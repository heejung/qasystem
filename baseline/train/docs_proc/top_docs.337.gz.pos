about IN
five CD

The DT
consensus NN
is VBZ
that IN
for IN

players NNS
, ,
the DT
least JJS
amount NN
of IN

would MD
be VB
three CD

But CC
pitchers NNS

almost RB
the DT
entire JJ
six CD

would MD
pitch VB
fewer JJR
innings NNS
at IN
the DT

Why WRB
ca MD

open JJ
while IN
the DT
owners NNS

A DT
: :
Seemingly NNP
, ,
the DT

allow VB
players NNS

training NN
while IN
it PRP

trying VBG

ensure VB
that IN
by IN
not RB

Here RB
's VBZ
why WRB
: :
The DT
bulk NN
of IN
the DT
money NN
received VBD
by IN
the DT

The DT

receive VBP
that IN

the DT
players NNS

wait VB
until IN
July NNP

August NNP

By IN
then RB
, ,
most RBS
of IN
the DT

will MD
have VB
received VBN
the DT
bulk NN
of IN
their PRP$
annual JJ

A DT
: :
The DT
majority NN
of IN
players NNS
are VBP
paid VBN

Some DT

According VBG

Q NNP

Why WRB

Finally RB
