FT  31 JUL 92 / Taxman set to drive a hard bargain: The Inland Revenue's
proposals for company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue says some 1.2m drivers would benefit under its proposals
to restructure company car taxation - but the 700,000 losers would face
higher tax demands running to thousands of pounds a year in some cases.
The Revenue emphasised yesterday that the proposals were only the start of a
3 1/2 -month consultative process.
It can expect to be inundated, for the issue is important for manufacturers,
which make nearly a third of sales to business users, and for the
government, which receives Pounds 1.4bn annually in income tax from the
company car benefit scale charges, as well as for the nearly 2m company car
users.
The proposals aim to make fairer what is essentially a crude banding system,
unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced <DATE>16 years ago</DATE>. But they
are also intended to take account of criticisms, including some by the
<ORGANIZATION>Monopolies and Mergers Commission</ORGANIZATION>, that the combined price and engine
capacity thresholds of the company car taxation system distort the market,
obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax break specials' causing market
bunching and potentially putting specialist manufacturers such as <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> at
a disadvantage.
There are about 1,200 car models available in the UK, but the present scale
system divides them into only five categories, using both price and engine
size. That means, to use the Revenue's own example, that the driver of a
sub-Pounds 9,000 <ORGANIZATION>Ford Fiesta</ORGANIZATION> diesel pays the same as the driver of a Pounds
19,000 <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 520i if their business mileages are similar.
The Revenue says its proposals to base the tax charge mainly on price is
fairer and more easily understood than the present system.
The Revenue has resisted pressure to abandon banding in favour of basing the
scale charge on a percentage of the list price of the car. The Revenue
wished to avoid the need for individual tax calculations and PAYE recodings
each time a car is changed.
The Revenue is proposing 12 price bands, each higher band covering a
successively wider range of car prices. The advantage seen in such a
structure is that it would be sensitive in the Pounds 10,000-Pounds 19,500
region where company cars are concentrated.
Business car buyers will have to wait until the final scheme is set out in
next year's Budget for the exact detail. But to generate the same revenue
yield as the present system, the document indicates a scale representing two
ninths of a car's value for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a
year; one third for low-mileage (below 2,500 miles) users and only one ninth
for those covering more than 18,000 business miles a year. The document
proposes no changes to the business mileage bands.
The effects of the change are likely to be uneven. The Revenue says more
than half of the 750,000 company car drivers in the existing 1.4 litre to 2
litre engine band would gain modestly, most with a tax charge cut by about
10 per cent, and about 70,000 drivers of most basic cars by up to 25 per
cent.
But even the Revenue acknowledges that better-equipped saloons in the Pounds
12,500-Pounds 16,000 range would attract increases of more than 10 per cent,
affecting an estimated 360,000 drivers. The typical middle-ranking
executive, driving a high-specification car of just under 2 litres and just
under the present Pounds 19,250 threshold, would be among those worst
affected, facing a typical increase in tax of about 40 per cent.
Cars now costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be split into
two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band would have
the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average; those costing more than Pounds
24,500 - involving about 20,000 cars - would be modest losers.
For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at
the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge
reduced by more than 30 per cent, a benefit to companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise, by 35 per cent for cars
costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000.
<PERSON>Mr Brian Friedman</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Stoy Benefit Consulting</ORGANIZATION>, said the
system 'will inevitably hit senior executives driving the most expensive
cars'. He suggested that, since many of these drivers were user-choosers,
'the logical result will be a general downsizing of company cars'.
The scheme also aims to minimise incentives to drive thirsty cars. And while
there are no specific provisions to encourage economical diesel cars, they
will be encouraged indirectly by the proposals.
Diesel cars need larger engines than petrol equivalents in order to have
acceptable power and are therefore often put into a higher band under the
present scale structure. A price-only band would end such discrimination, as
well as tending in general to favour cheaper - and generally more
fuel-efficient - cars.
There is a strong administrative argument for the Revenue's proposals:
whereas the whole business car sector usually waits on tenterhooks each
Budget to see what changes in scale charges are announced, a multi-band
price system would be broadly self-correcting and require no Budgetary
attention. Cars would simply drift up through the price bands, depending on
inflation.

<HEAD>Jaguar Hopes To Make Less Expensive Car in GM Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>, a British luxury automaker, is looking
to produce a less expensive model appealing to business executives
if plans for cooperation with <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> go through, a
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> executive said.
   ``An association with a large company like <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would enable us to
look at the possibility of introducing a smaller <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, an area in
which as a small independent company we cannot consider as the
investment and components-cost would be too high,'' <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>David
Boole</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``We want to look at other market opportunities and one of those
is a downsized model in the <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> range,'' <ORGANIZATION>Boole</ORGANIZATION> said
in a telephone interview from his home near the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> plant at
<ORGANIZATION>Coventry</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>English Midlands</LOCATION>.
   ``Because we are small we are somewhat constrained in what we
can do,'' <ORGANIZATION>Boole</ORGANIZATION> added.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> cars are known for their sleek lines and high-quality
interior trim. The highest-priced model costs around <MONEY>$64,000</MONEY>.
   Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at the opening
of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Motorfair he hoped within one month to present his
stockholders with a plan outlining cooperation with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>.
   The plan would thwart a merger bid by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> domestic
rival, which <DATE>this week</DATE> disclosed it has built a stake of <PERCENT>10.4
percent</PERCENT> in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>. Egan is set against a merger that would
undermine his rule over one of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s most famous companies.
   He told reporters that negotiations with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest
automaker, could lead to <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> receiving a huge cash injection and
guarantee his company's independence.
   British auto industry reporters said <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> would probably
propose to its stockholders that <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> sell <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> a <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> stake
in the company in return for about <MONEY>$237 million</MONEY> cash.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> currently produces 50,000 cars a year and <PERSON>Egan</PERSON> said the
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> deal would enable <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to invest immediately in new models and
cut spending on components by as much as <MONEY>$950 million</MONEY> a year.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has been a supplier for decades of gear boxes to <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>,''
said <ORGANIZATION>Boole</ORGANIZATION>. ``The most important thing for us in an association
with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would be access to low-cost components and to <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s advanced
research. That would mean developing our current range of cars and
making them more cost effective.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Boole</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> would concentrate on ``critical items'' in its
cars like body style, engines and the interior trim _ ``what the
customer sees and touches.''
   He said the company would look to <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> for the ``not-so-critical,
out-of-sight background technology'' of wiring harness, axles,
backup systems and air bags _ ``the areas in which a small company
like ours finds it isn't cost effective to spend time and money.''

FT  23 JUN 92 / Fastest Jaguar road car sets off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELIVERIES are beginning this week of the fastest and, at Pounds 350,000
each, the most expensive roadgoing <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> cars ever built.
However, growing environmentalist sentiment and the difficulties some
customers apparently face in paying for their cars make it almost certain
that the 500-plus horsepower 212mph XJ220 is likely to be the first and last
of its type to be offered under the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> badge.
'We all recognise that a long-term shift is taking place in what will appeal
to buyers. No one can afford to ignore the environmental issues,' according
to <PERSON>Mr Bill Donnelly</PERSON>, sales and marketing director of <ORGANIZATION>JaguarSport</ORGANIZATION>, which is
based at <ORGANIZATION>Bloxham</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oxfordshire</LOCATION>, where the XJ220 is being built.
JaguarSport, which has engineered and is producing the cars, is a 50-50
joint-venture company set up in <DATE>1988</DATE> between <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> - itself now owned by
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> - and <PERSON>Mr Tom Walkinshaw</PERSON>'s racing organisation to develop
high-performance versions of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream models as well as to
undertake special projects.
The XJ220, said <PERSON>Mr Donnelly</PERSON>, 'will probably turn out to be the ultimate
roadgoing <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>. We'll take a different slant in the future; something
smaller and lighter, with the emphasis very much on weight-saving.'
The XJ220 plant is to be taken over by another <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Aston
Martin</ORGANIZATION>, to make a new <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> model - expected to be priced below
Pounds 100,000 - at a rate of 625 a year as soon as XJ220 production ends in
early <DATE>1994</DATE>.
The car's debut could hardly be worse timed, coming when the UK and other
once buoyant markets for expensive cars are still struggling to emerge from
the recession, and when cars in general are being increasingly pilloried
over environmental issues such as exhaust emissions, energy conservation,
congestion and pedestrian safety. The XJ220 may meet all emissions standards
envisaged until at least <DATE>1994</DATE>, but its speed and inevitably high - but so
far undisclosed - fuel consumption make it a likely focus for anti-car
campaigners.
JaguarSport is not alone. Several other 200mph-plus 'supercars' conceived on
their creators' computer screens in the boom period of the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> have
also been announced in the past few weeks. They include the Pounds 530,000
McLaren F1, a car based on the Surrey racing group's grand prix technology;
and the <ORGANIZATION>Yamaha</ORGANIZATION> OX99-11, a 200mph single-seater to be produced for the
Japanese vehicle manufacturer at its <ORGANIZATION>Ypsilon Technology</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary at <PERSON>Milton
Keynes</PERSON>.
According to <ORGANIZATION>JaguarSport</ORGANIZATION>, 1,500 would-be owners applied to buy the cars,
backing their orders with a Pounds 50,000, non-returnable deposit when the
project was first announced in the <DATE>autumn of 1989</DATE>. But with the market for
very expensive cars having suffered a spectacular collapse, there is growing
speculation within the investment-car market about whether 'supercar' sales
confidence may be misplaced.
According to <PERSON>Mr Robert Brooks</PERSON>, principal of the international auction house
which has sold many of the world's most valuable cars, the present
investment value of virtually all 'supercars' is well below their new
purchase price. 'The investment money is simply not there,' he says. 'How
many cars like this can the market absorb, particularly at a time when the
speculative investment buyer has gone out of the market?'
Under the XJ220's order terms, options are tradable. Originally seen as
offering the potential for a premium, the recession has meant some option
sales have been made simply to recoup the Pounds 50,000 and escape payment
of a second Pounds 50,000 instalment required before a car's construction
starts.
JaguarSport has yet to try and test the veracity of another speculation
circulating among collectors of cars: that a few option owners looking to
escape from purchase but finding difficulty in selling their options have
'sold' them to asset-less shell companies which it would be pointless for
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to pursue for payment. If that is happening, said <PERSON>Mr Donnelly</PERSON>, the
instalment payment system means that JaguarSport will get warning at least
six months before construction of a particular car starts.
'If there are problems, it simply won't get built - at least not until
another firm buyer is found,' he added.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (2): Wait for the tax
changes - Drivers on business face a new regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN his budget speech next month <PERSON>Mr Norman Lamont</PERSON>, the chancellor, is
expected to indicate the extent to which the Inland Revenue's proposals for
the reform of company car taxation, first outlined last <DATE>summer</DATE>, have been
amended by criticism invited from the motor industry and other interested
parties.
The legislation to implement the revised tax regime will then be introduced
in this year's Finance Act. But such are the complexities of change - to
PAYE systems, car makers' production and marketing strategies, for example -
that there will almost certainly be no attempt to introduce the changes
before the start of the 1994-95 tax year. If the switch- over seems likely
to cause more complications than expected, it could even be postponed until
later.
Despite, or perhaps because of, the wide range of responses to and
criticisms of the Revenue's draft, there appear few signs that there will be
significant departures from the scheme as originally proposed.
The Revenue has declared four principal aims in restructuring the way
personal taxation of the company car benefit is assessed: greater fairness,
reduced distortion of the new car market caused by manufacturers producing
'tax break specials' within the current price and engine capacity 'banding'
system, to promote fuel efficiency and to simplify the administration of
company car taxation.
Central to the Revenue's proposed new regime are a dozen new bands, based
wholly on price and stretching up to Pounds 60,000. The current regime,
which the Revenue itself has described as outdated and crude, has only two
price thresholds, of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the
assessed tax benefit to the user rises sharply.
These, however, currently are assessed in combination with three engine
capacity bands, of under 1.4 litres, 1.4-2 litres and over <MONEY>2 litres</MONEY>. One of
the long-standing criticism of these capacity bands is that they do not
differentiate between petrol and much less powerful but more economical
diesel engines, which require more cubic capacity for a given level of
performance.
The proposals favour using the manufacturer's list price as the basis for
the bandings, but leave open actual cost to purchasers after discounts, and
estimates of original market value for a particular category of car, as
alternatives.
The Revenue has done its own calculations about the expected effect on some
2m company car drivers and asserts that 1.2m drivers would benefit from the
revised structure, with their tax bills falling by up to 25 per cent.
However, it also acknowledges that there would be 700,000 losers. About
500,000 of these, with cars currently in the Pounds 13,000-Pounds 15,000
bracket, would be less than 10 per cent worse off. But about 200,000 drivers
of high specification cars with prices just under the current two 'break'
points face a 40 per cent tax rise.
Launching the proposed scheme, <PERSON>Mr Stephen Dorrell</PERSON>, financial secretary to
the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>, said that it was designed to end the unfair situation whereby,
for example, the presumably low-paid driver of a basic 1.8 litre Ford Fiesta
diesel, using mainly for business, paid the same tax as the driver of a
Mercedes 190 for equivalent business mileages.
What the new regime apparently does not seek to do is increase the total tax
burden by more than the current scheme would impose in the normal course of
annual adjustments.
In a foreword to the proposals, <PERSON>Mr Lamont</PERSON> signalled that the swingeing
annual increases in scale charges that have quadrupled tax payable by
company car users in less than a decade are at an end: 'The government
recognises that company cars are an important feature of modern business
life and of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> car industry, and make a significant contribution to the
Exchequer.'
While not spelling it out precisely, <PERSON>Mr Lamont</PERSON> indicated that, in the
government's view, company cars are now just about tax neutral - neither
encouraging nor discouraging their provision. Currently, the Exchequer's
receipts from the tax are around Pounds 1.4bn.
The proposed dozen price bands are: under Pounds 5,000, Pounds 5,000-Pounds
6,499, Pounds 6,500-Pounds 7,999, Pounds 8,000-Pounds 9,999, Pounds
10,000-Pounds 12,499, Pounds 12,500-Pounds 15,499, Pounds 15,500-Pounds
19,499, Pounds 19,500-Pounds 24,499, Pounds 24,500-Pounds 30,999, Pounds
31,000-Pounds 38,999, Pounds 39,000-Pounds 49,999, Pounds 50,000-Pounds
62,500, and over Pounds 62,500. The advantage seen in this successively
wider banding is that it would be particularly sensitive in the Pounds
10,000-Pounds 19,500 region where company cars are concentrated.
To generate the same revenue yield as the present system, the proposals
suggest a scale representing two-ninths of a car's value for drivers
covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a year, one third for low-mileage
(below 2,500 miles) users and only one-ninth for those covering more than
18,000 business miles a year. The document proposes no changes to the
business mileage bands, despite widespread criticism that essential car
users are heavily penalised if they do not cover more than 18,000 business
miles.
Cars now costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be split into
two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band would have
the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average. In the case of cars costing
more than Pounds 24,500 - affecting about 20,000 - the drivers would be
modest losers.
For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at
the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge
reduced by more than 30 per cent. This would benefit companies such as
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise by 35 per cent for cars
costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000.
By using the price mechanism more strongly, the scheme also aims to
encourage the use of more economical cars. In that context, the regime, if
adopted largely unchanged, should give a significant boost to diesel cars.
The administrative argument in favour of the Revenue's proposals is widely
seen as a strong one. Whereas, at budget time each year, car makers and
fleet users alike have traditionally waited on tenterhooks for the revised
scale charges in each Budget, to assess the likely impact on both car users
and car sales, the Revenue's proposed new system would be broadly
self-correcting. Each year, cars could be expected to drift up through the
price bands, depending on prevailing rates of inflation.

Incur Over $1,000
Of Damage in Test

<TEXT>
   All but two of 22 midsized cars put through four low-speed test crashes designed to gauge bumper strength sustained damages exceeding <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>, a highway group backed by the insurance industry said. 

   The cars were crashed four times at five miles per hour. 
"As a group," said <PERSON>Brian O'Neill</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</ORGANIZATION>, the Washington-based group that tested the cars, "they did very poorly. 
There should be only minimum damage in such tests." 

   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Corsica</ORGANIZATION> incurred the least amount of damage -- <MONEY>$419</MONEY> -- in the four crashes, the institute said. 
The next best competitor, the <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Camry</ORGANIZATION>, sustained damages totaling <MONEY>$866</MONEY>, while the <ORGANIZATION>Honda Accord DX</ORGANIZATION>, which did the worst, had <MONEY>$2,030</MONEY> in damages. 

   Many of the more expensive cars tested had the more costly damages. 
All of the six worst performers had a manufacturer's suggested base price exceeding <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>. 
The suggested base price for the <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> Accord, for example, is <MONEY>$10,625</MONEY>, while the <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION> 6000, which sustained a total of <MONEY>$2,004</MONEY> in damages in the tests, costs <MONEY>$10,499</MONEY>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Ford Taurus GL</ORGANIZATION>, which has a manufacturer's recommended price of <MONEY>$11,622</MONEY>, sustained damages totaling <MONEY>$1,945</MONEY>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Sable GS</ORGANIZATION>, which has a <MONEY>$12,340</MONEY> price tag, had damages of <MONEY>$1,571</MONEY>. 

   Priced at <MONEY>$8,995</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Corsica</ORGANIZATION> was one of the least expensive cars tested. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Camry</ORGANIZATION> is priced at <MONEY>$10,998</MONEY>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Buick Skylark</ORGANIZATION>, which had damages of <MONEY>$1,024</MONEY>, and carries a suggested base price of <MONEY>$9,915</MONEY>, had the third-lowest damage total. 
Next was the Oldsmobile Firenza, which sustained damages of <MONEY>$1,125</MONEY>, and has an <MONEY>$8,449</MONEY> base price. 

   The four tests were a frontal crash into a barrier, a rear crash into a barrier, a frontal crash into a barrier at an angle and a rear crash into a pole. 
All the cars tested were <DATE>1987</DATE> models, except for the <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION>, which was a <DATE>1988</DATE> model. 

   <PERSON>Mr. O'Neill</PERSON> said the extensive damage that resulted from the tests underscores the need for tougher federal bumper standards. 
In <DATE>1982</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> eased a requirement that cars be able to withstand damage to the vehicle and suffer only minimal damage to the bumper at 5 mph. 
Its action lowered the standard to 2.5 mph. 

   Officials at the safety agency say the weaker rule, on balance, benefits consumers. 
They argue that bumpers required by the 5 mph standard add to the car price, are more expensive to replace and increase fuel costs because they are heavier than less damage-resistant bumpers. 

   In <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robert H. Munson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s director of automotive safety, said "the best evidence" of the strength of the bumpers on the Taurus and <ORGANIZATION>Sable</ORGANIZATION> and of the cars' overall damage resistance is "the fact that the two largest auto insurance companies . . . and most other insurance companies offer significant discounts for collision and comprehensive coverage on <DATE>1987</DATE> Taurus and Sable models." 

   In a prepared statement, he added that "actual accident statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION>Highway Loss Data Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which is funded by the <ORGANIZATION>Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</ORGANIZATION>, show that loss payments for Taurus and Sable are <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>, respectively, below the average loss payments for all 1986-model passenger cars." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Munson</PERSON> said the Taurus and Sable "five-miles-an-hour bumpers" performed "as expected" in the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s tests, noting that they "incurred no damage during the five-miles-an-hour perpendicular barrier-crash portions of the test." 
He added, "The <ORGANIZATION>IIHS</ORGANIZATION> bumper test results are distorted, however, by the five-miles-an-hour '<ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> pole test,' which simulates a kind of accident that is relatively rare in the real world." 

   A <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> said the No. 1 auto maker was "pleased with the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Corsica</ORGANIZATION>'s performance" and noted that "four of the top five performers" in the test were <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> products. 
He declined to comment on the performance of the <ORGANIZATION>Century</ORGANIZATION> and <DATE>6000</DATE>. 

   In <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is testing new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marketing programs to get it through a stagnant sales period that is expected to last at least two more years. 

   One program the West German auto maker is testing is aimed at buyers who can't afford the <MONEY>$30,980</MONEY> base price of the least expensive 1989-model <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>. 
Under a pilot program in 21 cities, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> is giving consumers an incentive to buy used models by offering a comprehensive, "bumper-to-bumper," factory warranty on used cars with less than 100,000 miles. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz AG</ORGANIZATION> is also trying to build up its leasing operations and is considering more extensive advertising programs. 
And it adopted only modest price increases on its most popular <DATE>1989</DATE> models. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> said that such steps are necessary because they don't expect demand for luxury cars to grow significantly before the early <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 
They said that over the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, sales of all cars costing more than <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> have leveled off to about 140,000 a year. 
About <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the cars Mercedes sells in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fall in that price range and it controls about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of that market. 

   <PERSON>Erich Krampe</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, said he expects to sell about 80,000 cars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by yearend, and about the same number in <DATE>1989</DATE>. 

   "We are confident this particular segment of the market provides prospects for future growth," <PERSON>Mr. Krampe</PERSON> said at the Mercedes 1989-model preview before reporters here. 
"But coming close to our boom year in <DATE>1986</DATE> {when Mercedes sold 99,314 cars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>} is not in our vision for the next five years," he said, since <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> won't cut prices to sell more cars. 

   Mercedes has tried to protect its dealers' profits by tightening inventories in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to less than a 40 days supply. 
Mercedes had enough cars in dealer inventories a year ago to handle sales for 70 days, which caused price wars in some cities. 
Mercedes officials also said bigger inventories greatly increase costs for dealers, who must finance the expensive, unsold cars. 

   Base prices of its <DATE>1989</DATE> models have been increased an average <PERCENT>1.7%</PERCENT>, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> said. 
It lowered the price on one of its least expensive cars, the 190E sedan, by <MONEY>$1,910</MONEY> or <PERCENT>5.7%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$31,590</MONEY>. 
It lowered that price because it eliminated a similar 190 model that came with a less powerful engine. 
However, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE> won't have any cars costing less than <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>. 
The base price of its cheapest model, the 190D diesel sedan, increased <MONEY>$1,020</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$30,980</MONEY>. 

   The company also raised prices on the 300 series cars, the most popular, by <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT>. 
The price of the 300E sedan, for example, went up <MONEY>$450</MONEY> to <MONEY>$44,850</MONEY>. 
The biggest price increases came on its top-of-the-line models. 
The most expensive Mercedes, the 560 <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> coupe, went up <MONEY>$2,775</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>3.6%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$79,840</MONEY>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it raised base prices on its <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> division cars an average of <PERCENT>2.2%</PERCENT> and its Acura division cars an average of <PERCENT>2.8%</PERCENT> to compensate for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar's slide against the Japanese yen. 

   The price boosts took effect yesterday upon their announcement by <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm, <ORGANIZATION>American Honda Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
They marked the ninth time <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> has raised its prices since the yen began its climb against the dollar in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
Prices of <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> division cars have gone up an average of <PERCENT>29.2%</PERCENT> in that time, while Acura prices have increased an average of <PERCENT>18.4%</PERCENT> since their <DATE>May 1986</DATE> introduction in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   The price of <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s least expensive car, the Honda Civic hatchback, increased <MONEY>$100</MONEY> to <MONEY>$6,195</MONEY>, a rise of <PERCENT>1.6%</PERCENT>. 
The base price of the least expensive sporty CRX model went up <MONEY>$250</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$8,545</MONEY>. 
The base price for the Accord, <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s bestselling model, jumped <MONEY>$390</MONEY> a car, or <PERCENT>3.7%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$10,925</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s most expensive car, the Prelude, will increase in price <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$145</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$13,640</MONEY> for a base model. 

   Prices on the upscale <ORGANIZATION>Acura</ORGANIZATION> division's base model cars jumped even higher than the <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> division's prices. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Acura Integra</ORGANIZATION> jumped <PERCENT>3.5%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$370</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$10,915</MONEY>. 
The luxury Legend sedan increased in price <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$525</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$23,675</MONEY>. 
And the Legend coupe rose <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$579</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$23,675</MONEY>. 

   At a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> news conference, <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON>Tadashi Kume</PERSON>, said he thought <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't lose market share in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> because of the price boosts. 
Honda accounted for <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT> of the cars sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>6.1%</PERCENT> a year earlier. 

   Separately, <PERSON>Mr. Kume</PERSON> said the Japanese company's home-market auto sales will grow in <DATE>1988</DATE>, while exports will be little changed. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Kume</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> aims to sell 1,310,000 of its Japanese-built passenger cars, including so-called minicars, in <DATE>1988</DATE>, up <PERCENT>5.8%</PERCENT> from last year. 
Of the total, 620, 000 units are expected to be sold in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, up <PERCENT>13.3%</PERCENT>. 
The company expects exports to total 690,000 units, almost unchanged from 690,946 units in <DATE>1987</DATE>.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (27): Design a high priority in
the luxury market - Stuart Marshall assesses the new models on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will a radical change in construction materials and techniques put <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> up
among the front runners in the luxury car stakes in <DATE>1995</DATE>? Its new A8 quattro
saloon's light alloy space frame and panels save weight and fuel; Tiptronic
transmission gives drivers the benefits of automatic or manual shifting; and
four-wheel drive allows them to make full use of its 4.0-litre, multi-valve
V8s 300 horsepower on wet or dry surfaces.
But by itself, this technology may not be enough to ensure sales success.
When it comes to styling and mechanical layout, status conscious luxury car
drivers are remarkably conservative. Thus the new <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 7-Series has classic
rear-wheel drive and lines remarkably like those of its predecessor, while
the new <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> XJ saloon, roomier inside yet slimmer looking, has even
reverted to the twin round headlamps of an earlier model.
In business motoring's middle reaches, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> has stayed faithful to
rear-wheel drive for its <ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION> in the UK) <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION>, as has <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> with
its heavily revamped Scorpio.
Drivers of these classes of car know what they want - smoothness and
silence, ample power and air conditioning, automatic transmission and a
built-in telephone, airbags and anti-lock brakes.
Next year the list will extend to satellite navigation, to be offered in
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>'s most prestigious S-Class, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s 7-Series and, probably the
successor to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s trend-setting luxury car, the Lexus LS400.
In the medium/large class most of the past year's newcomers - the <ORGANIZATION>Renault
Laguna</ORGANIZATION> is typical - have conformed to a pattern; front-wheel drive
(occasionally with an all-wheel drive option), space-saving
transversely-mounted engines, standard airbags and anti-lock brakes and the
easy availability of air-conditioning and automatic transmission.
Choice of a diesel as an alternative to a petrol engine has become
essential. Only two European business car providers of any consequence -
<ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> - do not have diesels in their product ranges. Both are
likely to add diesels, with engines bought-in rather than developed in-
house, within the next two or three years.
Great strides are being made in car diesel technology. For now, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s
in-line turbocharged and intercooled six-cylinder units have no peers for
urgent and near silent power delivery.
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, with the world's first four valves-per-cylinder passenger car
diesels, and <ORGANIZATION>PSA Group</ORGANIZATION>'s latest 2.5-litre diesels with twin balancer shafts,
have brought diesel smoothness close to petrol engine standards while
benefiting from higher torque at low revolutions and cleaner exhaust
emissions.
<ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s just introduced four-cylinder diesel is raising the stakes in the
market for less expensive, fuel efficient business cars. For fuel economy
combined with acceptable refinement, VW-Audi's direct-injection diesels, as
fitted in <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 80 and 100 and <ORGANIZATION>VW</ORGANIZATION> Golf and Passat models, lead the pack.
Rover's direct-injection engined 600 diesel saloon will soon rival their
standards.
Sales of on-off road 4x4s have maintained their impetus. The vehicles have
become civilised, if rather thirsty, on-road car substitutes and rarely
venture on to the rough terrain which they were designed to tackle.
Land Rover's latest Range Rover with height-adjustable air suspension is put
forward as an alternative to conventional luxury cars in the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> class.
Although its two beam axles cannot reasonably be expected to equal the ride
comfort of a sophisticated all-independent system, it is a most urbane
performer on the road and remains capable off it.
One of the attractions of on-off road vehicles such as Range Rover is their
so-called command driving position. It gives users a feeling of superiority
and allows them to see over the tops of normal cars ahead.
Similar benefits are offered by multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) which lack the
high-slung 4x4s largely unused off-road capability.
Their market penetration is forecast to grow substantially in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as new
models such as the joint Portugese-produced Ford-VW project come on stream.
Whether this will be at the expense of on-off road 4x4s or conventional
estate cars remains to be seen.
In the <DATE>past eight years</DATE>, sales of MPVs such as the <ORGANIZATION>Renault Espace</ORGANIZATION> (still
market leader in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>) have risen by an average 80 per cent per annum.
By the <DATE>end of the century</DATE> it is expected that 700,000 MPVs will be sold in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> each year.
This forecast makes the introduction of a range of MPVs built by <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> but
which will be sold badged as Citroens, Peugeots, Fiats and Lancias among the
most significant motoring events of <DATE>1994</DATE>.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (4): The Revenue gnashes its teeth
/ An examination of UK suppliers' changing price strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car makers were uneasy two years ago when the Inland Revenue unveiled its
proposals for a new company car tax regime, based on a simple percentage of
cars' list prices.
In previous years considerable effort had gone into producing 'tax break
specials' under the old tax regime, which heavily favoured high-earning
executives compared with lower-paid essential users of company cars.
The old system, based on price and engine capacity bands, meant that an
executive driving a highly-specified 'perk' car of fractionally under 2
litres and Pounds 19,250 paid only the same personal tax on his company car
as an essential user of a utilitarian vehicle of just over 1.4 litres,
provided their marginal tax rates were the same.
Under the new system, effective from <DATE>April 6</DATE>, the same executive would have
to swap his Pounds 19,000 car for a model costing a mere Pounds 12,500 so
that the tax bill would be the same. Car makers feared that many executives
would be tempted to downsize and downprice, thus sapping revenue from one of
the most profitable sectors of the new car market. Vehicles with many
executive 'extras' provide disproportionately higher profit per unit
compared with mainstream fleet cars.
It will take two or three years before the effect of the new system, in
terms of vehicle choice, can be fully assessed. Nevertheless, there is
little sign so far of executives opting for less tax-burdensome cars,
according to <PERSON>Mr Michael Banner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>'s director of fleet sales, and
researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Henley Management College</ORGANIZATION> who have studied the executive and
fleet car market on <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>'s behalf.
While some preference is being shown for smaller cars - but only ones
equipped to executive standards - there is only a very slight trend towards
downpricing, the researchers maintain.
<PERSON>Mr Banner</PERSON> observes that 'the typical executive driving a car priced at the
old Pounds 19,250 tax threshold has looked at the changes, realised that his
current car is going to cost him only another Pounds 20 or Pounds 30 a month
and has decided 'I'll cope'.'
Similar views are being voiced by other manufacturers. But that does not
mean that significant changes in manufacturers' model mixes and marketing
policies are not under way. One major effect of the new tax system was to
eliminate entirely the engine capacity bands which previously had
discriminated severely against larger units.
Particularly badly hit under the old system was the diesel engine. Though
likely to be favoured by many fleet managers because of its one-third
greater fuel economy compared with a petrol unit, it typically reqires
larger capacity to provide comparable on-road performance.
The new tax system is already seeing the introduction of new versions of
mainstream business cars with larger, high-performing V6 engines of 2.5
litres, as well as giving a further boost to the buoyant diesel car sector,
sales of which in the first four months of this year were running 60 per
cent higher than in the same period of <DATE>1993</DATE>.
The diesel sales go on despite two learned reports in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, which argue
that diesel exhaust emissions - including particulates suspected of causing
cancer - could contaminate the air in cities if the diesel car population
continues to expand.
One in four new cars sold in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> is now a diesel. Business car users and
fleet managers, increasingly impressed by the cost advantages, appear to be
taking comfort from the fact that commercial vehicles - many of them elderly
buses - account for at least two-thirds of the diesel exhaust pollution
being created in urban areas.
It is not only at the Pounds 19,250 tax break point that the tax system
changes are having an effect. The scrapping of the second threshold of
Pounds 29,000, above which an executive's personal tax on his company car
rose sharply, has eliminated model range 'bunching' around the breakpoint
while the capping of the new system at a Pounds 60,000 list price means that
the expensive car makers such as <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> are not
significantly disadvantaged.
It is in pricing structures and strategies that the new tax system has had
some of its most notable effects - at least in terms of the notional prices
which are paid for executives' cars. Traditional UK pricing policies - with
a few exceptions such as Mercedes and <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> - have been based on a relatively
high list price which few customers in the business sector actually pay.
There are widespread discounts - <DATE>30</DATE> per cent or more in a few notorious
deals to particularly large fleet operators. The new list price-based tax
regime makes such policies untenable because they would maximise an
executive's personal tax burden. So manufacturers have been cutting the
profit margins they allow their dealers. Once typically 15-16.5 per cent,
plus the chance of cash bonuses from manufacturers for meeting sales
targets, these 'official' margins have been cut to 10 per cent and in some
cases - over the past few weeks in the executive sector - to 5 per cent.
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> executive car range was launched with a 5 per
cent margin. In a few cases, the margin has been dispended with altogther in
favour of a fixed 'handling' charge payable to the dealer. Some <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> models fall into this category. So do some of the cheapest Rover 800
models with a Pounds 500 fee, while <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is allowing a Pounds 1,500 handling
fee on its US-built Probe coupe and is giving only a token margin on its
Granada/Scorpio executive cars.
The changes have been accompanied by much trumpeting about lower prices.
This is convenient in view of the pan-EU car price comparisons now published
twice a year at the behest of the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which wants to see
price convergence between <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> new car markets and tends to regard the UK as a
high-priced market.
But transaction prices have not changed a lot because dealers were already
giving away much of their official margin and relying on incentive bonuses
from manufacturers to make a return on mainstream executive cars. They now
merely have less room to haggle.
The approach does mean a lower company car tax burden for executives - and a
lower tax take for the Inland Revenue. At the moment, the Revenue can only
stand by gnashing its teeth. How it might react, in the longer term, to an
entrenched system of zero profit margins and 'handling charges' is another
matter altogether.

<HEAD>Ford Could Close Jaguar Deal by Year's End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> could complete its <MONEY>$2.5
billion</MONEY> acquisition of the British luxury car maker <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> by the
end of the year, the head of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s European arm said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>L. Lindsey Halstead</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Ford of Europe Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said in a
video news conference from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> that a <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> shareholders
meeting could be called by the end of this month. The transaction
could be completed within days after that if shareholders approved
the deal.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automaker after <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> its agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, which has suffered
from declining earnings due to dropping sales in its important <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
market.
   The buyout must win approval from <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s 182
million outstanding shares, which will vote whether to lift a
restriction barring anyone from owning more than <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> owns a <PERCENT>13.2 percent</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
   Halstead and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Bert Serre</PERSON> said financing for the
deal was undetermined. Technically, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> could pay for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> out
of its <MONEY>$5.8 billion</MONEY> in cash reserves, but that seemed unlikely for
tax reasons, analysts have said.
   Shortly after the announcement <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Standard &amp; Poors</ORGANIZATION> put
some of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s securities on its CreditWatch negative list _ a
possible prelude to a slight downgrading of their credit ratings _
citing concern about the frenzied pace of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisitions in
the face of a softening <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car market.
   Recent acquisitions have included last month's <MONEY>$3.35 billion</MONEY>
purchase of <ORGANIZATION>The Associates Corp.</ORGANIZATION> financial company from <ORGANIZATION>Paramount
Communications Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Because of the pending shareholders' vote, <PERSON>Halstead</PERSON> declined to
answer specific questions about how <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> production would be
affected by a possible merger with <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. Shared components may be
the most likely place a consumer would notice the partnership.
   However, he said, ``We are looking for an opportunity to expand
volume substantially. One of the first items on the agenda is
defining how that will proceed.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s factory in <LOCATION>Coventry</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, makes about 50,000 cars
annually and can produce up to 80,000.
   There has been speculation that if <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> came up with a totally
new model under <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> ownership, the car would be priced near or
below the current <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> XJ6 four-door sedan, which has a base
price of <MONEY>$39,700</MONEY>.
   Ford's most expensive car is the Lincoln Town Car Cartier with a
base price of <MONEY>$33,364</MONEY>.
   Halstead turned aside a suggestion that with the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>
acquisition, Lincoln no longer would be the company's luxury car
division. He said the character of the two cars, with <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> being
more of a performance vehicle than <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, would keep them
separate.
   ``I don't ever expect to see <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> cars in <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> showrooms and
no Jaguars in <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> showrooms,'' <PERSON>Halstead</PERSON> said.
   Ford recently stopped importing the West German-made Merkur,
which was sold through the company's <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln-Mercury</ORGANIZATION> dealerships.
   There are about 140 <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> dealerships in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (25): Safety for the driver and
his planet - Stuart Marshall explores the environmental and other features
of Europe's latest models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new models that will be entering European showrooms over the next 12
months will reflect the industry's success in meeting environmental needs as
well as consumer demands.
From next <DATE>January</DATE>, every new petrol-engined car must have a catalytic
converter to clean up the exhaust. Some sections of the industry perceived
the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> requirement as a politically inspired expedient. But they faced up to
the challenge, equipping even the smallest and cheapest of their cars with
the electronic fuel injection needed for a catalyser to work properly.
Multi-valve engines have for some years been widely used by all Japanese
makers on high volume production, as opposed to specialised high
performance, cars. This was not the case in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, though <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> and Rover
were among the few honourable exceptions as multi-valve pioneers.
Now, however, they are being adopted by European manufacturers across the
whole price spectrum as a means of improving power outputs without
increasing cylinder capacity.
Among the latest multi-valve models are a wide range of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Escorts</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes Benz</ORGANIZATION> 200-300 cars, due to be joined early next year by the
replacement for the best selling 190.
V6 engines are enjoying a vogue because of the space they save compared with
in-line designs, which do not fit transversely into front-wheel driven cars.
An alternative solution, seen in the latest <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> 850GLT, is to mount a
5-cylinder in-line engine east-west combined with an ultra-compact manual or
automatic transmission.
The most space-saving conventional piston engine of all is the narrow angle
V6, first used more than 60 years ago by <ORGANIZATION>Lancia</ORGANIZATION>. Audi and <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> are
employing two different narrow angle V6s occupying hardly any more space
than in-line 4-cylinder engines of far less cylinder capacity in a number of
models, including the <ORGANIZATION>VW Golf</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Vento</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 80 and 100.
This illustrates another growing trend - the fitting of comparatively large
displacement and high power output engines into cars of modest size. These
provide the performance, and offer all the luxury equipment, expected of
products in the next size class. Big is no longer beautiful among many
motorists who spend much of their time driving on their own in crowded
traffic conditions.
Availability from early next year of the mid-sized <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Vauxhall
Cavalier</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Opel Vectra</ORGANIZATION> in most European markets) with a new British-built,
narrow angle 2.5 litre V6 engine is a straw in the wind. So, too, is <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s
decision to offer its new V8 engines, originally introduced in the big
7-Series and intended to power its forthcoming replacement, in the 5-Series
as well.
<ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>, also <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> controlled, is expected soon to be using the British-made 2.5
V6 but has its own ideas for improving performance and minimising emissions.
The <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> link has given <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> access to 32-bit microprocessor technology. It is
combined with a direct ignition system having a mini-coil per cylinder and
no high-tension leads or distributor. This 32-bit component (most other
makers use 8-bit or 16-bit microprocessors) provides exceptionally precise
monitoring and control of transient state conditions within the engine.
So exactly does the <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> Trionic system, with its 2m calculations each
second, control combustion that it is claimed to make the 2.3 litre,
turbocharged 4-cylinder engine of <DATE>1993</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> 9000CS and CD models one of the
world's cleanest. In the foreseeable future, the Trionic system will allow a
petrol engine to be run on less polluting alternative fuels such as ethanol
or methanol without any adjustment.
Two-stroke engines, far smaller and lighter than four-strokes of the same
power output, are being developed by many car makers on both sides of the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is monitoring the performance of a fleet of two-stroke powered Fiestas
in service with a British police force.
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated an ultra-light and fuel efficient two-stroke powered
concept town car. <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> also has some promising two-stroke engines at an
advanced development stage in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
The Japanese motor industry has an unnerving habit of rapidly turning
concept cars into production models. For example, both <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> 3000GT and
Subaru SVX were on sale within two years of being unveiled to the public at
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> motor show. Even so, the Japanese do not expect two-stroke engines to
be in the showrooms in <DATE>1993</DATE> but a mid-decade timescale looks more promising.
But for the time being, there is agreement among major European
manufacturers that the diesel engine, preferably with turbocharging,
intercooling and direct injection, provides the best fuel economy.
Although there is a public perception that diesels are dirty - and
ill-maintained heavy lorries and buses undoubtedly are - a diesel car is at
least as environmentally acceptable as one with a petrol engine and
three-way catalytic converter.
There is a clear relationship between atmospheric pollution and fuel
consumption. The diesel engine, especially when operating at less than full
power and at constantly changing revolutions - as it does in traffic - has a
much lower specific fuel consumption than a petrol engine. Hence its carbon
dioxide emissions are proportionately lower and its efficient combustion
process also creates less carbon monoxide.
Now that inherent noise problems have been overcome by two-stage injectors
and other means, the direct-injection car diesel is pointing to fuel economy
beyond the capability of petrol engines.
Without any special preparation, a new <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 100 TDI saloon with 6-speed
gearbox recently gained an entry in the <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of Records</ORGANIZATION> by being
driven further on a single tankful than any other car. In showroom trim, it
went from <PERSON>John o</PERSON>' Groats to Lands End and then back again north of the
Scottish border on 17.62 gallons (80.17 litres) of fuel, giving a
consumption of 75.94 mpg (3.72 l/100 km).
The industry is now concentrating on further reducing the diesel car
engine's particulate emissions (visible exhaust smoke), the only area in
which it is significantly worse than a petrol engine.
The main line of attack is to refine the fuel injection and combustion
process and clean the exhaust gases by a simple oxidation catalyser.
Automatic transmissions are gaining ground as urban driving in particular
becomes more stressful. There can be no argument that a car with two pedals
makes fewer demands on the driver in heavy traffic than one with three.
Safety can only benefit. Just as 4-speed automatics have virtually taken
over from the old 3-speed types, those with 5-speeds are making steady
headway in cars of medium price and above.
This kind of technological advance always spreads downward. When ABS brakes
were first introduced, they were costly extra equipment on the most
expensive cars. Now buyers expect them to be standard on modestly priced
cars, particularly those of higher than average performance potential.
In the same way, traction control systems have become increasingly popular
on executive-class cars. They make use of the ABS brake system's electronic
sensors to eliminate the risk of wheelspin and consequent loss of control
when accelerating by matching engine output to tyre grip.
Full-time four wheel drive performs a similar function but traction control
has been found to provide most of the benefits without the weight and cost
penalties.
On the safety front, enhanced protection for the occupants in side impacts
is now a feature of many high volume production cars. Similarly, airbags
which inflate in severe frontal impacts and reduce risk of facial injury to
drivers and front seat passengers are spreading down market. They cost extra
 -usually over Pounds 500 - but as demand grows, prices must fall.

<HL> GM Moves Up Date
For Idling Of Plant,

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to close temporarily most of its assembly plant here more than a month earlier than previously planned because of slow sales of several luxury-car models built at the factory. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said it now plans tentatively to shut down its state-of-the-art, two-year-old factory here, known as the "Poletown" plant, on <DATE>June 26</DATE>, idling about 2,500 workers until its reopening in late <DATE>August</DATE>. 
During the closure, the company will retool the plant for styling changes in the new fall model of the <LOCATION>Cadillac Eldorado</LOCATION>, which the plant builds in addition to several other <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> luxury models, including the <LOCATION>Cadillac Seville</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile Toronado</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buick Riviera</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Stopping production of these <DATE>1987</DATE> models earlier than planned represents a setback for the company. 
When <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> introduced the front-wheel-drive models in the <DATE>fall of 1985</DATE>, they were hailed as vehicles that would keep <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> strong in the expensive-car market for years. 
But many consumers ignored the new products, partly because their styling was similar to less expensive <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> cars and they were smaller. 
They have sold at roughly only half the rate of the models they replaced. 

   Besides underscoring the continuing problems of these cars, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement also shows that the No. 1 auto maker's recent problems in generating sales across its product line aren't easing much. 
Just <DATE>last week</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said it plans to close temporarily six other assembly plants and to lay off about 30,000 hourly workers because of slow sales, in the latest of its frequent rounds of plant shutdowns this year. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> had opened the Poletown plant with much fanfare about laser-inspection systems and other high-technology devices that it was introducing there. 
But in addition to encountering resistance to the cars built there, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> also soon saw the plant run into a variety of technical snafus, which the company has spent the last year correcting.

   Just five months after its introduction, <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is raising the price of its <DATE>1990</DATE> Chevrolet Lumina sedan, the first of a new line of four-door sedans <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is counting on to boost its sagging car-market share. 

   The least expensive <ORGANIZATION>Lumina</ORGANIZATION> will sell for <MONEY>$12,340</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>3.8%</PERCENT> from the original base price of <MONEY>$11,883</MONEY>. 
The base price of the <ORGANIZATION>Lumina Euro</ORGANIZATION> sedan, which <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> expects to be the more popular version, will rise <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$14,240</MONEY> from <MONEY>$13,776</MONEY> currently. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> appears to be boosting the Lumina prices in step with its prime competitor, the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Taurus</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <DATE>1990</DATE> Taurus will start at <MONEY>$12,594</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$254</MONEY> more than <ORGANIZATION>Lumina</ORGANIZATION>, and up <PERCENT>6.9%</PERCENT> from the <DATE>1989</DATE> Taurus base price of <MONEY>$11,778</MONEY>. 
But the <DATE>1990</DATE> Taurus will have a standard driver-side air bag. 
Chevy's <ORGANIZATION>Lumina</ORGANIZATION> will not. 

   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Lumina</ORGANIZATION> hasn't set the market on fire. 
At the end of <DATE>July</DATE>, dealers had an 82-day supply of the sedans; a 60 to 65-day supply is considered desirable. 
In mid-August, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> sold 2,865 Luminas. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, by comparison, sold 8,363 Taurus sedans. 

   Meanwhile, Chevrolet set the price for its top-of-the-line image car, the Corvette ZR-1, at <MONEY>$58,995</MONEY>. 
That sticker could make the ZR-1 the most expensive car <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> sells, depending on the final price of <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION>'s Allante model. 
The <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Allante</ORGANIZATION> sells for <MONEY>$57,183</MONEY>. 
Cadillac hasn't announced a final price for the <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Allante</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Overall, <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expect the division to increase its combined <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car and truck market share to roughly <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1990</DATE> model year from an estimated <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> for <DATE>1989</DATE>. 

   Chevrolet general manager <PERSON>J.C. Perkins</PERSON> forecast <DATE>1990</DATE> Chevy sales at about 2.9 million vehicles, including more than 1.4 million trucks. 
That's up from 2.8 million currently estimated for the model year that ends next month. 

   Division marketing executives said the new car advertisements will focus on product and features, rather than image. 

   Truck advertising will accent image, however, with lots of quick shots in one television version of men hard at work in factory settings.

   Ford Motor Co., in an attempt to bolster profit in a
sagging market, quietly raised base prices on all 1991 model
cars as much as $582.
   Separately, General Motors Corp. boosted prices on certain
widely purchased options. The No. 1 and No. 2 auto makers'
actions come in the wake of price increases by Chrysler Corp.
and several Japanese auto makers. The moves suggest that
despite consumer resistance to high vehicle prices, the
industry is continuing a strategy of pushing prices up to
offset the impact of lower sales volumes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Dearborn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, told dealers in <DATE>February</DATE>
it would increase sticker prices on most of its models. But
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> didn't announce the action to the public. The increases
were reported in yesterday's <ORGANIZATION>Automotive News</ORGANIZATION>, a trade
journal.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said it moved to add an average <MONEY>$50</MONEY> a car to sticker
prices to offset higher operating and product development
costs. The increases could generate an additional <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>
for every 100,000 vehicles sold. With <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European auto
sales soft, the company has signaled it expects to post a
"substantial loss" for the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> and may not be
profitable for the full year.
   The biggest price rise came on the Taurus L and GL models,
which were given V-6 engines as standard equipment. The
Taurus L sedan now costs <MONEY>$13,934</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>4.4%</PERCENT> from <MONEY>$13,352</MONEY>. The
Taurus GL starts at <MONEY>$14,163</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$581</MONEY> from <MONEY>$13,582</MONEY>. The price
of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s least-expensive car, the <LOCATION>Festiva</LOCATION>, which is made in
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, rose <MONEY>$28</MONEY> to <MONEY>$6,648</MONEY>. Meanwhile, the price of the
least-expensive <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-made Ford</ORGANIZATION>, the Escort Pony, was pushed
<MONEY>$40</MONEY> to <MONEY>$8,016</MONEY>.
   "The cost of business continues to rise" despite slow
sales, a <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. "There's a laundry list of
costs that continues to go up." Ford didn't announce the
increases because they were "insignificant," the spokesman
said.
   <PERSON>George Hoffer</PERSON>, a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia
Commonwealth University</ORGANIZATION>, said the price increases shouldn't
have a major impact on buyers because <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> could use rebates
to adjust prices. "Auto makers use rebates to fine tune
prices to adjust to market demand," contends <PERSON>Mr. Hoffer</PERSON>. "The
cars don't normally sell at list price because of the
manipulation of rebates."
   Still, the increases mean consumers will start negotiating
from higher base prices. Moreover, because <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> no longer
offers direct-to-customer incentives, shoppers may not know
how much of a discount they can get. Instead, dealers could
pocket part of the rebate unless customers work hard to get
the best deal.
   Ford raised <DATE>1991</DATE> model prices an average of <PERCENT>1.9%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$312</MONEY>,
in <DATE>September</DATE>, the last month of the auto industry's <DATE>1990</DATE>
model year. Since that time, this has been <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s only price
rise.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s price increase for options could raise the cost of
cars equipped with air conditioning and automatic
transmissions by as much as <MONEY>$85</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> announced the increases in <DATE>January</DATE> to dealers only. A
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company raised option prices "to
partially recover higher production costs." The No. 1 auto
maker said it hasn't raised base sticker prices so far this
year.
   The increases affect such widely ordered optional
equipment as automatic transmissions, air conditioning and
power windows and locks. The price increases for automatic
transmissions range from <MONEY>$10</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30</MONEY>. Prices for air
conditioning will rise between <MONEY>$15</MONEY> and <MONEY>$55</MONEY>. Buyers of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>
trucks will pay between <MONEY>$5</MONEY> and <MONEY>$25</MONEY> more for certain optional
equipment. <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Cadillac divisions aren't
affected by the increases.

   NEW YORK -- Because of Wall Street's continuing slump, far
fewer traders and investment bankers are lining up to buy
high-powered, high-priced cars such as Porsches and BMWs.
   But in the rest of the U.S. -- and in Japan and Europe --
sales of these performance cars are shifting into overdrive.
Several European auto analysts say shares of Porsche and
Bayerische Motoren Werke are underpriced, even if Americans
have to search a bit to find ways to buy those stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>, which is much smaller than <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and makes more
expensive cars, gets more enthusiastic reviews for its adroit
recovery from a sales slump in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Porsche shares trade at
a price-earnings ratio of about 17.5, close to that of
<ORGANIZATION>Daimler Benz</ORGANIZATION>, the giant of German auto makers. Several
analysts believe <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> will someday command a higher
multiple, however, because it's the only remaining publicly
traded specialty car maker.
   "We really do believe <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> is the last of its kind
remaining in the world" after <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Stephen M. Reitman</PERSON>, a London-based
analyst with <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips &amp; Drew</ORGANIZATION>.
   Though <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> and other analysts also recommend <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>,
which trades at a significantly lower price-earnings ratio
than <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Daimler Benz</ORGANIZATION>, they fear that <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> shares may
get stuck in neutral because of fears about increasing
Japanese competition in the lower end of the luxury-car
market.
   "I think <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> is cheap and that one should probably buy
it," says <PERSON>Philip Ayton</PERSON>, a London-based analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Barclays
de Zoete Wedd</ORGANIZATION>. But he adds that <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s stock "has performed
badly and I'm not sure even now whether there's going to be a
change in sentiment."
   Several analysts cite <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>'s swift recovery from the
gear-grinding changes of <DATE>1987</DATE> as evidence of a management
that recognized the company's problems and acted decisively.
   Through <DATE>1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> rode the big luxury-car boom in the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and allowed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales to claim <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of its peak
production of about 53,500 cars a year. Porsche "stepped
right into the dollar trap by getting a little too greedy and
selling too many cars in the States," says <PERSON>Dagmar
Bottenbruch</PERSON>, a European auto analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse First
Boston</ORGANIZATION>. "Then the currency halved and the bottom fell out of
the luxury-car market" in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, she adds.
   But now, <PERSON>Ms. Bottenbruch</PERSON> says, <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> "has its destiny
under control." Production has been cut to about 31,000 cars
a year. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales now represent only about one-third of
<ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>'s total, with an equal amount in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and the rest
concentrated in other European countries and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> also eliminated its cheapest and least profitable
model in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the 924, which had been priced at about
<MONEY>$24,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> says. Now, the lowest-price <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> sold
in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is the 944, at <MONEY>$43,350</MONEY>.
   The most profitable models for <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> are the various
versions of its classic 911, descendants of the original
<ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> which resembled an upside-down bathtub.
   Porsche sales in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> have been rising this
year, up <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> through <DATE>May</DATE> and up <PERCENT>62%</PERCENT> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>
through <DATE>April</DATE>. But <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> doesn't expect big increases
in either production or prices. Porsche "trades on having a
cache, on their rarity and desirability. They will accept
waiting lists," he believes.
   One slightly hidden asset, <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> says, is <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>'s
research and development facility in <LOCATION>Weissach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>,
which does work for many other auto makers, including <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>,
and is run as a profit center. During the 1987-88 period the
center took on additional work that should produce more
profits in the next few years, he says.
   <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> also has net cash of <MONEY>459 million marks</MONEY> (<MONEY>$275.8
million</MONEY>) and no debt; analysts expect the company to be able
to continue to fund its development from cash flow.
   <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal year ends <DATE>July 31</DATE>; <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> expects
the company to report a profit of about <MONEY>70 marks</MONEY> (<MONEY>$42</MONEY>) a
share; <PERSON>Ms. Bottenbruch</PERSON> expects profit of 72 to <MONEY>75 marks</MONEY> a
share. For next year, <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON> forecasts <MONEY>80 marks</MONEY> a share
but says that could be low; <PERSON>Ms. Bottenbruch</PERSON> looks for <MONEY>85
marks</MONEY> to <MONEY>90 marks</MONEY> a share.
   At yesterday's closing price of <MONEY>1232 marks</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> is
trading at about 17.5 times its expected <DATE>1990</DATE> earnings. The
<ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> shares that trade on the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> exchange are
non-voting preference shares; voting control is held by
members of the <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Piech</PERSON> families.
   <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, which closed yesterday at <MONEY>584.50 marks</MONEY>, trades at
only about 10 times analysts' estimates of its <DATE>1990</DATE> earnings;
<ORGANIZATION>Daimler Benz</ORGANIZATION> is trading at about 17 times estimated <DATE>1990</DATE>
earnings. That price/earnings gap, asserts <PERSON>Mr. Reitman</PERSON>, is
"totally unjustified."
   <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> can be bought in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as an American Depositary
Receipt; <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> stock trades only in German markets.
   <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> shares have sagged on fears that new Japanese-made
luxury cars, such as Infiniti and Lexus, will steal some
market share from <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, whose lowest priced 318is model has a
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> base price of <MONEY>$21,500</MONEY>. <PERSON>Mr. Ayton</PERSON> concedes that the
Japanese will grab some part of the luxury market, but says:
"I'm not convinced that it will be fully at <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s expense or
at the expense of <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s margins."
   There's some concern that <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s profit may ebb next year
as it revises the models in its best-selling 3-series. <PERSON>Ms.
Bottenbruch</PERSON>, who has a neutral rating on <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, says the shares
may get a boost once the new models are introduced. "The car
press already says this is going to be a real blockbuster,"
she notes.
   One additional issue for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors in either <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>
or <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> is how the mark fares against the dollar. A falling
mark would diminish potential capital gains. Though many
economists expect the mark to thrive against the dollar
long-term, there is some concern that the mark will weaken
during the next few months because of the costs of German
reunification.

<HL> GM Increases '89 Model Prices From 4% to 8% --- Company Says Rise Is 2.9%, Listing Former Options As Standard Equipment </HL>
<AUTHOR> Joseph B. White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> GM </CO>

<DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is raising the base prices of most <DATE>1989</DATE> cars and light trucks between <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT>, and is pressing a strategy that makes it more attractive to buy cars that are relatively loaded with options. 

   The No. 1 auto maker, in an announcement <DATE>Friday</DATE>, billed the average price increase for <DATE>1989</DATE> cars as <PERCENT>2.9%</PERCENT>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> adjusted for the inclusion as standard equipment of features that were sold as options last year, and also adjusted for the fact that it isn't raising the prices of equipment that remains optional. 

   Excluding this latter adjustment, the actual prices of many popular <DATE>1989</DATE> models will go up considerably more than <PERCENT>2.9%</PERCENT>, even when allowances are made for new standard equipment. 

   For example, the lowest priced <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Pontiac Grand Prix</ORGANIZATION> will cost <MONEY>$13,899</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>10.8%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$1,360</MONEY>, from the <DATE>1988</DATE> base model price of <MONEY>$12,539</MONEY>. 
The Grand Prix, the best-selling of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s new line of midsized cars, will now have air conditioning as standard equipment. 
Last year, <PERCENT>99%</PERCENT> of Grand Prix customers bought air conditioning as a <MONEY>$775</MONEY> option, a <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. 
So on a comparably equipped basis, the Grand Prix's base price is up <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> for <DATE>1989</DATE>. 

   The base price for the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Buick Regal</ORGANIZATION>, the Grand Prix's sister car, will rise <PERCENT>14.1%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$14,214</MONEY>. 
Adjusting for new standard equipment, the <DATE>1989</DATE> Regal's base price is still <MONEY>$518</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>3.8%</PERCENT>, higher than the base <DATE>1988</DATE> model. 

   The <DATE>1989</DATE> Corsica sedan, one of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s best-selling cars, will have a base price of <MONEY>$9,985</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>4.5%</PERCENT> from last year's base price, and up <PERCENT>3.6%</PERCENT> from the <MONEY>$9,642</MONEY> price of the comparably equipped <DATE>1988</DATE> model. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is cutting the prices on a few models, such as the compact <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Cutlass Calais</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1989</DATE> base price of <MONEY>$9,995</MONEY> is <PERCENT>3.1%</PERCENT> less than the base <DATE>1988</DATE> version. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said its price increases reflect "the partial recovery of higher material, labor and other costs." 
But <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1989</DATE> pricing strategy also is aimed at two broader goals. 
It cuts the number of variations of each model the company has to build, and therefore helps <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> cut manufacturing costs. 
And it helps <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> push customers toward buying more profitable options. 

   For instance, a <DATE>1989</DATE> Camaro RS with a package of options that includes air conditioning, four-speed automatic transmission, power door locks, AM/FM-cassette stereo, tinted glass and rear window defogger will list for <MONEY>$12,227</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT> less than the comparably equipped <DATE>1988</DATE> model. 

   But a buyer who wants a base <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Camaro RS</ORGANIZATION> will pay <PERCENT>4.5%</PERCENT> more for that car than for the base <DATE>1988</DATE> Camaro RS. Even adjusting for the additional equipment added to the <DATE>1989</DATE> base car, the <MONEY>$11,495</MONEY> price represents a <PERCENT>3.8%</PERCENT> increase over the comparably equipped <DATE>1988</DATE> model. 

   In addition to the base price increases, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is also adding <MONEY>$25</MONEY> to the destination charges it tacks on to each vehicle delivered. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s price disclosure follows announcements by <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that it expects to raise base prices an average of <PERCENT>3.9%</PERCENT>, or about <PERCENT>2.3%</PERCENT> when adjusted for additional standard equipment. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month said it is raising the base prices of a half-dozen older models an average of <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> hasn't announced its final prices yet. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1989</DATE> pricing strategy builds on moves last year to justify higher prices by building more standard equipment into the base models. 

   Company officials say building popular options in as standard equipment will mean that base model prices more honestly reflect the prices customers actually will pay for cars. 

   "Under <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> buy base cars. 
That's an artifact, and customers know that," <PERSON>Shirley Young</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for consumer market development, said in a recent interview. 

   But for <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> officials are conceding that some of the price increases are simply "economic adjustments." 
The base price of the full-size <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> pickup truck, for instance, will rise <PERCENT>4.5%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1989</DATE> to <MONEY>$10,335</MONEY>, compared with <MONEY>$9,894</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
No new equipment is included, a <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> isn't raising the base prices of its least expensive and most expensive cars, the <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION> LeMans and the <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac Allante</ORGANIZATION>. 
The Allante, the flagship of the <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> division, has a base price of <MONEY>$56,533</MONEY>, and hasn't sold well. 
The LeMans, made in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, has a base price of <MONEY>$6,399</MONEY>. 

   The base price of a domestically built entry level model, the two-door <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Cavalier</ORGANIZATION>, will increase <PERCENT>5.4%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1989</DATE> to <MONEY>$7,375</MONEY> from <MONEY>$6,995</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. 

   Because <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> announced its <DATE>1989</DATE> prices to the public <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> before giving details to its dealers, dealers late last week said they needed to know more before making any comment.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (16): Environmental issues may apply the
brakes - The Supercars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deliveries are to start within the next few days of by far the fastest and
most expensive roadgoing <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> cars ever built.
Buyers from around the world are each paying Pounds 350,000 - enough to
acquire 12 'ordinary' <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> saloons - for a limited production run of 350
examples of the XJ220, a mid-engined two-seater sports car capable of
212mph.
But environmental considerations mean that the big, 542 brake horsepower
'supercars' are likely to be the last of their type - at least from <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>,
according to <ORGANIZATION>JaguarSport</ORGANIZATION>, a 50-50 joint venture company set up in <DATE>1988</DATE>
between <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr Tom Walkinshaw</PERSON>'s racing organisation, which has
developed and is making the cars.
The XJ220 is one of several 200mph-plus supercars, each costing up to Pounds
530,000, currently making their debuts.
Most were conceived towards the end of the economic boom of the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
But their appearance coincides with widespread recession and almost exactly
with the Earth Summit in <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION>, with its concerns about the adverse
impact on the environment of the motor vehicle.
'We all recognise that a long-term shift is taking place in what will appeal
to buyers. No-one can afford to ignore the environmental issues',
acknowledges <PERSON>Mr Bill Donnelly</PERSON>, sales and marketing director of <ORGANIZATION>JaguarSport</ORGANIZATION>.
For that reason, he suggests, the XJ220 will probably turn out to be the
ultimate roadgoing <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>.
'We'll take a different slant in the future; something smaller and lighter,
with the emphasis very much on weight-saving'.
A further irony is that the new wave of supercars is rolling towards the
market at a time when it is becoming increasingly likely that the last
country in which their performance could be used to the full, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, will
have its autobahns speed-restricted not by its own, but common <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
legislation.
At <ORGANIZATION>Monte Carlo</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McLaren Cars</ORGANIZATION> - a subsidiary of the grand prix racing group -
has just given the motoring press its first glimpse of the F1, <PERSON>McLaren</PERSON>'s own
roadgoing, Pounds 530,000 'supercar'.
Based on grand prix technology, it will go on sale next year.
Yamaha of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> last month unveiled the OX99-11, a street-legal machine
which uses a de-tuned version of its Formula One grand prix engine and which
has room for only the driver.
Reflecting the unique status of the UK as the world centre for motor
sport-based technology, the 'Ox' will be produced not in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> but <ORGANIZATION>Yamaha
Motor</ORGANIZATION>'s UK subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Ypsilon Technology</ORGANIZATION>, at <PERSON>Milton Keynes</PERSON>.
It is is also expected to cost more than Pounds 500,000.
The Bugatti name has been resurrected for a 200mph-plus supercar due to
enter production later this year in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, rather than <ORGANIZATION>Bugatti</ORGANIZATION>'s native
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
These cars eclipse in price and performance even vehicles such as <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION>'s
F40, the <ORGANIZATION>Lamborghini Diablo</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> 959.
The question is, who will buy them? The answer from all their makers is that
they are being snapped up by discreet, exceptionally wealthy entrepreneurial
types scattered in small numbers around the world.
And unfortunate though the timing of the XJ220's launch is in many ways, <PERSON>Mr
Donnelly</PERSON> insists that all 350 cars are pre-sold.
According to <ORGANIZATION>JaguarSport</ORGANIZATION>, 1,500 would-be owners have applied to buy the
cars, backing their orders with the requisite Pounds 50,000, non-returnable
deposit.
However, the market for used <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION> and other classic sports car markets
has suffered the most spectacular collapse in its history over the past two
years. And there is increasing speculation within the investment car market
about whether JaguarSport's confidence and that of other supercar makers may
prove misplaced.
The order terms for the XJ220 allow holders to sell their options to another
party.
Originally, this was seen as offering the potential for a premium. But the
recession has meant that some would-be owners have needed to make a distress
sale in an attempt to recoup the Pounds 50,000 - and to avoid payment of a
second Pounds 50,000 tranche due under each contract six months before a car
is delivered.
Worse, according to stories doing the rounds of the international
'investment car' market, some would-be sellers have had difficulty disposing
of their options.
Fearing that they might have to fulfil their contractual obligation to buy
the car, at least some are said to have formed so-called shell companies
into which to sell their options - and which it would be pointless for
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to pursue for payment.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and JaguarSport profess themselves to be relatively unperturbed.
The part payment system means that JaguarSport should get warning of
potential problems at least six months before construction of that
particular car is due to start.
'If there are problems, it simply won't get built - at least not until
another firm buyer is found', said a <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
With an expected total world market for new cars this year of just under
40m, in percentage terms the XJ220 and its cohorts represent an almost
infinitesimal proportion of the market.
<ORGANIZATION>McLaren Cars</ORGANIZATION> plans to make only 300 of its extraordinary F1, a three-seater
with the driver's seat in the middle and an array of mind-stretching
technology including fan-assisted suction to stick it more firmly to the
road.
<ORGANIZATION>Yamaha</ORGANIZATION>'s production plans have yet to be disclosed, but total envisaged
production also does not exceed a few hundred.
About 200 units a year are envisaged for the Bugatti EB110, a 200mph-plus
supercar from an Italian-based reincarnation of <LOCATION>Bugatti</LOCATION>, perhaps <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s
most famous pre-war make.
By comparison, <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION> is a common volume producer: it builds 4,000 cars a
year - and even the most expensive <ORGANIZATION>Testarossa</ORGANIZATION> sells in the UK for a mere
Pounds 130,000.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Struggling Group Lotus finds Italian saviour
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>TAKEOVER of Group Lotus</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Bugatti</ORGANIZATION> brings together two of the most
famous motor racing names of the pre-war and post-war eras.
<PERSON>Ettore Bugatti</PERSON>, the Italian creator of some of the world's most beautiful
classic cars, died in <DATE>1947</DATE>, and his car factory in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> had already ceased
production by the early <DATE>1950s</DATE> in the aftermath of the war.
In the UK <PERSON>Colin Chapman</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Group Lotus</ORGANIZATION> founder and one of the most
creative and successful designers of racing cars, started his business in
the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>. His company has had a chequered history and never achieved
a financial strength to match its success on the grand prix racing circuits.
Group <ORGANIZATION>Lotus</ORGANIZATION> struggled to survive both before and after <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON>'s death in
<DATE>1982</DATE>. It has proved to be none too secure in the hands of <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>
since <DATE>1986</DATE>, and <DATE>last year</DATE> recorded a a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m on a
turnover of Pounds 60.98m.
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> was forced to put in Pounds 18m to repair the battered <ORGANIZATION>Lotus</ORGANIZATION>
balance sheet in <DATE>1991</DATE>, and the reverses convinced the giant carmaker that it
had neither the desire nor the management resources to cope with such a
small and specialised business.
Group <ORGANIZATION>Lotus</ORGANIZATION> losses have grown from Pounds 2.1m in <DATE>1988</DATE> to Pounds 4.4m in
<DATE>1989</DATE>, Pounds 12.7m in <DATE>1990</DATE>, Pounds 14.7m in <DATE>1991</DATE> and the record Pounds 36.6m
last year.
However, in the past 12 months <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> has been restructuring the
business to ready it for disposal.
Following the demise of the <ORGANIZATION>Elan</ORGANIZATION> sports car, <ORGANIZATION>Group Lotus</ORGANIZATION> has limited
production to just one model, the Esprit luxury sports car, of which it is
planning to build 350 this year. The workforce has been cut from 1,717 in
<DATE>1990</DATE> to about 700 - a total of 500 in engineering and 200 in car production.
Now the latest saviour has come from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in the shape of entrepreneur and
life-time Bugatti lover <PERSON>Mr Romano Artioli</PERSON>, who holds an 18 per cent stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Bugatti Automobili</ORGANIZATION>.
He has recreated the Bugatti marque - supported by unnamed financial backers
in the European automotive components industry - both as a maker of exotic
and expensive cars and as a designer label for exotic and expensive fashion
items, from sunglasses to table-ware.
The first car of the new Bugatti company, created in <DATE>1987</DATE>, was the EB110
supercar unveiled early last year with a mid-mounted 550 bhp V12 engine,
carbon-fibre chassis and four-wheel drive. Production began in <DATE>December</DATE> and
47 have been delivered to date.
<ORGANIZATION>Bugatti Automobili</ORGANIZATION> is based at <LOCATION>Campogalliano</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Modena</LOCATION>, not far from the
homes of <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lamborghini</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Artioli</PERSON> was at one time a <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION> dealer and is now the Suzuki
distributor in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Bugatti</LOCATION> has been his passion for 40 years.
His campaign to revive the marque began in <DATE>1987</DATE> when he negotiated with the
French government for the rights to the Bugatti name and badge.
<PERSON>Ettore Bugatti</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, but the cars that made him famous were
produced in <LOCATION>Molsheim</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Alsace</LOCATION> region of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. After his death the
factory was taken over by Hispano-Suiza which eventually became part of
<ORGANIZATION>Aerospatiale</ORGANIZATION>, the French state-owned aerospace group.
The Bugatti holding company is registered in <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and its shareholders
remain anonymous. Some big corporations have co-operated in developing the
EB110, however, including <ORGANIZATION>Aerospatiale</ORGANIZATION>, which produces the carbon-fibre
monocoque chassis.

   <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> aggressively raised the prices on some of its 1990-model cars in line with its efforts to develop a more upscale image. 

   The Japanese auto maker boosted <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> base prices as much as <PERCENT>8.9%</PERCENT> on the redesigned 1990-model 323 subcompact scheduled to go on sale next month. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> also significantly raised base prices on the least expensive versions of its 626 sedan and MX-6 coupe compacts by adding an AM-FM cassette stereo as standard equipment. 
The <MONEY>$12,459</MONEY> sticker price of the base 626 1990-model will be <PERCENT>8.8%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$1,010</MONEY>, more than the base 1989-model. 
The <MONEY>$12,270</MONEY> price of the base MX-6 model represents a <PERCENT>7.7%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$880</MONEY>, increase. 

   The smallest price increases came on <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s most and least expensive models. 
The base price of the 1990-model <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> 929 sedan will rise <PERCENT>1.7%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$400</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$23,300</MONEY>. 
The base-model 323 hatchback's price rose <PERCENT>2.3%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$150</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$6,599</MONEY>. 
But the 323 SE model's <DATE>1990</DATE> base price jumped <PERCENT>8.9%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$680</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$8,329</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> said on a "comparably equipped" basis, the prices of its <DATE>1990</DATE> cars will rise an average of <PERCENT>2.9%</PERCENT>. 
The company hasn't released prices for its 1990-model light trucks. 
The base price of the hot-selling MX-5 Miata convertible, introduced earlier this <DATE>summer</DATE> as a <DATE>1990</DATE> model, will remain <MONEY>$13,800</MONEY>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive pricing strategy runs counter to some other import brands that are minimizing their price rises to remain competitive in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> already restructured its entry-level Sentra car line by eliminating some models and making standard equipment optional on other <DATE>1990</DATE> versions. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> haven't released their <DATE>1990</DATE> prices. 

   West German luxury sports car maker <ORGANIZATION>Porsche AG</ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this month a price freeze on its <DATE>1990</DATE> cars. 
<ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> also eliminated its least expensive model. 
British luxury car maker <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> hasn't released its prices yet, but officials in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> said they plan to keep the <DATE>1990</DATE> price of the XJ-6 sedan close to the discounted <DATE>1989</DATE> price of <MONEY>$39,000</MONEY>. 

   Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>Big Three</ORGANIZATION> auto makers plan to raise prices of their <DATE>1990</DATE> models <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> even though sales have declined this year. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s pricing moves are part of an effort to create more of an upscale image for its cars. 
When <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> entered the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <DATE>20 years ago</DATE>, it used a "great little car" theme to position products as a lower-priced option to domestic and other Japanese cars. 

   "As time goes on, more and more car buyers will be looking for more than low prices and high value," said <PERSON>George McCabe</PERSON>, group vice president, sales and marketing for <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales and marketing arm. 
"They're also going to be searching for the intangibles inherent in a premium quality brand." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> officials said they are studying the feasibility of adding a luxury car sales division in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> similar to <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti car lines. 

   <PERSON>Mr. McCabe</PERSON> also predicted that <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> will sell 370,000 cars and trucks in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by the end of this year and 401,000 next year. 
Most of the increase, he said, will come from the new Miata convertible and added production of the 626 model at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s Flat Rock, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, assembly plant.

   Buffeted by a cheaper dollar and Japanese
competition, European carmakers are hoping to hold on to their
lucrative slice of the American market. Two of them are trying new
incentives to keep Americans buying.
   At present, the Europeans have a <PERCENT>5.1 percent</PERCENT> share of the
American mmarket, compared to <PERCENT>18.6 percent</PERCENT> for the Japanese.
   ``Fly to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>,'' says a newspaper
advertisement of the West German automaker. The company offers a
single business-class seat or two coach-class seats to anybody who
orders a Mercedes in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   It is the first time American buyers have been offered a free
trip to pick up the prestige autos at the factory in <LOCATION>Stuttgart</LOCATION>.
   ``We offer them a luncheon and, if they want, a factory tour,''
said <PERSON>Fred Chapman</PERSON>, spokesman of <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Montvale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   Since the beginning of the advertising campaign earlier this
year, about 700 Americans have accepted the offer, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said.
   With factory deliveries, buyers save <MONEY>$3,500</MONEY> for the lower-priced
Mercedes to almost <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> for the luxury model, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> added.
   After the buyer completes his European vacation, the company
arranges to ship the car without charge to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dealer who
handles customs arrangements and other paperwork.
   For <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> cars delivered new in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,
prices range from <MONEY>$29,190</MONEY> for the 190E model with manual
transmission to <MONEY>$77,065</MONEY> for the 560 <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>.
   Last year, 89,000 Mercedes were sold on the American market. In
the <DATE>first six months of 1988</DATE>, sales were steady at 44,066.
   <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>, the West German builder of sports cars, lost some
business this year mostly because of the weak dollar. ``That made
our cars more expensive and less affordable,'' said <PERSON>Martha Mckinley</PERSON>
from the company's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> headquarters in <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>.
   Porsche sold 12,824 cars in the <DATE>first six months of 1987</DATE>, but
sales declined to 8,807 in the same period of this year.
   The company is now trying to recapture some ground with an
incentive program. The company's Trust-Tourist Delivery program
offers discounts between 7 and <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>, depending on the model,
for all models ordered in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and picked up in <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION>.
   Prices range from <MONEY>$26,560</MONEY> for the <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> 924 to <MONEY>$69,380</MONEY> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> 928.
   The company sees its main competition from Japanese cars and
from its German rival.
   ``In the lower-priced cars it's the Japanese product. When it
comes to the expensive models, we have to fight Mercedes,'' she
said.
   The Italian auto giant <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>, which sells <ORGANIZATION>Alfa Romeos</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lancia</ORGANIZATION>
cars on the American market, has similar fears. The company took
its own <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> models off the market because of the Japanese
competition in the small-car area. <PERSON>Gualberto Ramieri</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman, expects that the new Alfa Romeo 164 will capture some
lost ground in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   The price for the car on the American market has not been fixed
yet, he added.
   In the <DATE>first six months of 1988</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> sold 2,708 <ORGANIZATION>Alfa Romeos</ORGANIZATION> in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, down from 3,422 in the same period last year.
For the whole <DATE>1988</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Ramieri</ORGANIZATION> expects the sale of about 6,000 cars
through the company's 150 dealers across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> also lost some ground in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It
sold 9,320 cars last year but only 3,454 cars in the <DATE>first half of
1988</DATE>. Spokeswoman <PERSON>Kim Derderian</PERSON> said the company hopes a new model,
the <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> 405, will recapture some buyers.
   The British luxury car maker <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> doesn't fear sales losses.
The car with a basic price of <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> finds most of its admirers in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and the bigger cities, according to company
spokesman <PERSON>Tom McDonald</PERSON>. Last year the company sold 10,028 of its
cars in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. McDonald expects no major changes for
this year.
   BMW, another German luxury carmaker, has no plans to offer
special incentives to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> buyers.
   ``We know about the free trips Mercedes offers but we have no
similar program,'' said <PERSON>Robert Mitchell</PERSON> from <LOCATION>BMW North America</LOCATION>. His
company sold 87,839 cars last year on the American market. <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>
expects the same result for this year.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp., in a major gamble that
even budget-minded buyers will pay lots more for a new
braking system that improves safety, will raise base prices
about 11% on some key compact cars.
   GM said the price of its cheapest Chevrolet Cavalier will
carry a base price of $8,899 -- an increase of $904, or
11.3%, from the 1991 price. Likewise, the similar Pontiac
Sunbird will get a price boost of $936, or 10.8%, to $9,620
without optional equipment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is planning for relatively
small price increases on many of its cars and its base-model
minivans. However, the No. 3 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker is setting
larger price increases on its more profitable minivans and
Jeep Cherokee models.
   <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> has practically no new products this <DATE>fall</DATE> and
seems to be hoping its strategy will stabilize its weakening
car sales until its first new sedans in a decade arrive late
next year.
   Much of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s price increase is to cover the cost of a new
antilock braking system, which automatically provides pumping
action to the brakes to avoid wheel lockups and skids on wet
or icy roads. Antilock brakes are now found mostly on luxury
and high-performance cars, but <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has developed a new system
-- called ABS VI -- that it believes will put the price
within reach of average buyers.
   But it's far from clear whether the buyers themselves will
agree, especially those in the very price-sensitive market
for basic compact cars. "They aren't going to be able to
generate a whole lot of {customer} traffic with double-digit
price increases," said <PERSON>John Casesa</PERSON>, automotive analyst of
<ORGANIZATION>Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, however, characterized its new prices as a moderate
<PERCENT>3.1%</PERCENT> increase over its entire model line, when measured
against comparably equipped <DATE>1991</DATE> models. That means any
equipment that was optional last year but becomes standard
this year isn't counted by <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> as a price increase.
   For example, the <ORGANIZATION>Buick Regal</ORGANIZATION> will have power door locks
and intermitent windshield wipers as standard equipment in
<DATE>1992</DATE>. Currently, both these features are options. As a
result, the cheapest <DATE>1992</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Buick Regal</ORGANIZATION> will rise <MONEY>$920</MONEY> to
<MONEY>$16,610</MONEY>. That's a base-price increase of <PERCENT>5.8%</PERCENT> from the <DATE>1991</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Regal</ORGANIZATION>, although <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would consider the price increase to be
far less than that.
   The base price of the <ORGANIZATION>Buick LeSabre</ORGANIZATION> will jump <PERCENT>9.5%</PERCENT> to
<MONEY>$18,695</MONEY>. The car is being redesigned from last year, and the
big price increase reflects that, according to a <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is pioneering new ground in putting antilock brakes on
cars with relatively low price tags, but its major competitor
also is slating aggressive price increases for this <DATE>fall</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> included some substantial increases on its
preliminary 1992-model prices disclosed two weeks ago.
   For example, the base price of the cheapest Taurus sedan
is slated to increase <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> to almost <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>. The Taurus isn't
getting standard antilock brakes, although the exterior and
interior styling are being changed.
   All of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Three</ORGANIZATION> are under pressure to reverse
enormous losses in the North American market. "We're trying
to do the best we can to return this company to
profitability," said a <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. But he added that the
auto maker also wants to increase its market share and
intends to keep its car prices competitive.
   Thus, whether the price increases stick depends largely
upon the response of the Japanese auto makers. <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> are launching new versions of their
Camry and Civic models, respectively, this <DATE>fall</DATE>. But neither
company has yet announced prices for these key models.
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> didn't disclose the price of some vehicles that
will compete against them -- notably the new <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION> Grand Am
and the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> cars.
   <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> didn't provide a full breakdown on prices for its
<DATE>1992</DATE> models. The auto maker said its prices will increase
<PERCENT>1.4%</PERCENT> from comparably equipped <DATE>1991</DATE> models now on dealer lots.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the tentative price of the base
1992-model <LOCATION>Plymouth Voyager</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Dodge Caravan</ORGANIZATION> minivans will
rise to <MONEY>$13,706</MONEY>. That's <MONEY>$258</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>1.9%</PERCENT>, above the base price
of <DATE>1991</DATE> models now being sold. The increase is larger for
better-equipped minivans: base prices for 1992-model
extended-body Voyager and Caravan LE models will jump <MONEY>$1,169</MONEY>,
or <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$20,773</MONEY>.
   Chrysler plans to boost the price of the <DATE>1992</DATE> Jeep
Cherokee four-door base model with four-wheel-drive to
<MONEY>$16,842</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$1,021</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>6.5%</PERCENT>, from the base price for a
similar <DATE>1991</DATE> model.
   Base prices for <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s least-expensive cars, the <ORGANIZATION>Dodge
Shadow America</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Plymouth Sundance America</ORGANIZATION>, will increase
<MONEY>$285</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>3.7%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$7,984</MONEY>. The auto maker's most-expensive
model, the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Imperial</ORGANIZATION>, will carry a base price of
<MONEY>$28,453</MONEY>. That's <MONEY>$1,334</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>4.9%</PERCENT>, higher than the 1991-model
Imperial's base price.
   Chrysler lowered the tentative base price of one model --
the <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> LeBaron sedan -- by <MONEY>$877</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>5.3%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$15,710</MONEY>.
The company plans to use the less costly LeBaron to replace
the high-end <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION> Acclaim this <DATE>fall</DATE>.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Management: Company car policy goes in for a rethink - A
still popular perk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The calls started flowing into accountancy firms within an hour of <PERSON>Norman
Lamont</PERSON> finishing his maiden Budget speech.
Had the time come, clients wanted to know, to ditch the company car schemes
most had been blithely operating since the mid-1970s, when trying to
circumvent Labour's pay freeze and high taxes first brought the perk of the
company car into being.
The answer which seems to be emerging, appears to be 'yes' - at least for
many, perhaps most, categories of employees.
Lamont's Budget did not just raise the tax scale charge on company cars by
20 per cent, but, most traumatic of all, imposed a <ORGANIZATION>National Insurance</ORGANIZATION> charge
on employers for the benefit employees enjoy from their company cars.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> will raise Pounds 1.5bn from the tax on company cars this year,
and that is just from taxing individuals who receive them. When <ORGANIZATION>National
Insurance</ORGANIZATION> on companies supplying cars and free petrol to employees of Pounds
610m is paid in <DATE>1992/93</DATE>, the total amount raised by the Exchequer from
individuals and companies will rise to more than Pounds 2.3bn.
Although the personal tax on cars, which has been increased by 280 per cent
since the <DATE>1988</DATE> budget, seems high, the company car still amounts to a
considerable benefit for employees. On the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>'s figures, the benefit
to employees of a car (and free petrol) amounts to Pounds 5.9bn this year.
The tax currently paid by employees - many of whom are higher rate
tax-payers - is equal to just 25 per cent of that benefit.
For the vast majority of companies, the evaluation process is still under
way. But detailed analysis of the subject by accountants <ORGANIZATION>Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte</ORGANIZATION> provides a firm indicator that many companies could make the switch
at no financial cost to employees and potentially large savings to the
company itself.
The issue is more complicated than money, however.
'The choices can be very, very complex,' stresses <PERSON>Andrew Evans</PERSON>, a partner
with <ORGANIZATION>Price Waterhouse</ORGANIZATION>'s executive and benefits services practice. 'It's not
just a question of the tax position; it is tied in with employee motivation
and a host of other factors such as the ability to attract staff.'
Despite an initial post-Budget furore, analysis shows that <PERSON>Lamont</PERSON> would have
to tighten the taxation screw even more tightly on employees before the
company car loses its allure.
The cost/benefit equation for the companies providing cars, however, is much
more complex and involves many variables. Also, any change by a company in
its cars policy, particularly involving offers of cash to 'buy out' company
cars, has <ORGANIZATION>VAT</ORGANIZATION> and other pitfalls which could result in an increase of
taxation burdens for the unwary.
Yet the <ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION> calculations show that the cumulative effect of the
increases in scale charges of the past three years, coupled with the
imposition of <ORGANIZATION>National Insurance</ORGANIZATION> for the first time from next year, have in
many cases created a clear financial advantage to the company to 'buy out'
the company car.
In the most extreme cases, such as that of a director running a 4 litre
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar Sovereign</ORGANIZATION>, the company could provide him with the funds to buy and
operate the car at no financial net loss or gain to the individual, yet save
more than Pounds 3,000 per year.
In the table, column A represents the costs that might be incurred by a
company in providing a car for an employee's private and business use,
together with the resulting tax liability for the employee.
Column B analyses the same costs of motoring from the company's and
employee's positions, as if the employee had been reimbursed with the
running costs in column B.
Column C indicates the amount of any salary increase - and in some cases
deduction - necessary for the employee to be left neither better nor worse
off by being paid cash. The deduction can arise because the employee may
actually have a lower tax bill from using his own car at the company's
expense than from having a company car.
As <PERSON>Russell Thoms</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Coopers</ORGANIZATION> points out: 'There would be some unusual winners
and losers.' The figures show that there are marginal savings for the high
mileage business user from a straightforward change to cash.
But, as <PERSON>Thoms</PERSON> points out: 'In the middle ground, the cost and tax position
for the typical manager's car cannot yet be improved by a cash alternative.'
The biggest savings, however, are clearly on the highly-paid executive's
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> or similarly expensive car.
He says that savings can be increased further by 'fine tuning', such as
using company accounts at garages rather than reimbursing employees for
bills incurred, because the latter would otherwise attract employers' NIC
charges.
Yet whether the figures by themselves provide sufficient incentive for a
large-scale exodus from the company car is much more problematical.
'The car gives an employer a benefit out of all proportion to salary,' says
<PERSON>Paul Ives</PERSON>, human resources controller Legal and <ORGANIZATION>General</ORGANIZATION>, the insurance
company.
'If we could just offer salary then it would not have the same (positive)
effect when recruiting or retaining staff. A car is a very attractive
benefit and I would be loathe to scrap the thing if I thought, as I do, that
it would wrong-foot us in the recruitment market.'
<ORGANIZATION>Abbey National</ORGANIZATION>, which runs a mixed fleet of several thousand cars, is more
adamant: 'We have no intention of changing our company car structure because
of the Budget,' the company says.
Yet the imposition of <ORGANIZATION>National Insurance</ORGANIZATION> has given some companies pause for
thought. For Boots, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> pharmaceuticals and retailing group, <ORGANIZATION>National
Insurance</ORGANIZATION> will cost it about Pounds 400,000 on its fleet of 2,200 cars. Says
<PERSON>John Muncie</PERSON>, director of development, group personnel: 'It's a figure at the
margin, but it is an additional cost.'
Clearly the Budget has focused minds; consultants predict there will be:
greater selectivity in terms of who, in future, will be entitled to cars; an
end to free fuel for employees' private motoring; imposing restrictions on
the price or engine size of vehicles allocated to even the most senior
executives; and, contracting out the management of company car fleets
through competitive tender as a way of cutting costs.
The savings in <ORGANIZATION>National Insurance</ORGANIZATION> charges alone can be considerable by
keeping below the Pounds 19,250 price band for executives, and the Pounds
29,000 band for the chairman or chief executive.
'There is a lot of looking at cars over Pounds 19,250 and at ones under <MONEY>2
litres</MONEY>, and a lot of down-sizing is going on,' says <LOCATION>Muncie</LOCATION> of the
Nottingham-based Boots. 'People will also make sure that they do at least
2,500 miles. If there's any doubt about it they'll drive to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> by car
rather than take the train. And that will only add to the congestion.'
Companies seeking to offer a generous settlement to 'buy out' company cars
risk running foul of a judgment, <ORGANIZATION>Heaton v Bell</ORGANIZATION>. According to this judgment,
a company's valuation of the cash benefit of a car takes precedence over the
official scale charges and would apply to all other cars in the company's
fleet.
Thus even employees opting to keep their company cars could find themselves
paying a larger tax bill than the scale charge. Of greater concern, however,
is the stance being taken by Customs and Excise on VAT in relation to 'car
or cash' options.
Customs and Excise is taking the view that, if employees are offered a cash
option, but only a few take it up, those who choose to retain their company
cars have opted to accept a supply from the company which is liable to <ORGANIZATION>VAT</ORGANIZATION>.
'What Customs is arguing', says <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, 'is that if there is a company with
1,000 cars and if it offers everyone Pounds 5,000 a year cash substitute,
then even if only one of the 1,000 takes up the offer, there would be a VAT
liability in respect of the other 999.' In this example, the <ORGANIZATION>VAT</ORGANIZATION> payable
would total nearly Pounds 885,000.
So far, the Customs and Excise view has yet to be formally contested.
However, a number of companies has written seeking formal clarification, and
it appears now to be only a matter of time before the issue winds up in
court.

<HEAD>Is Warranty War Heating Up?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another battle in the automotive warranty war may
be on the horizon after a nearly three-year cease-fire and the front
may be on <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s highways instead of at dealership service
departments.
   In <DATE>early 1987</DATE>, the nation's Big Three automakers extended
existing warranties and used the new guarantees as bait to snare
new-car buyers.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile</ORGANIZATION> took a page from the European luxury car
makers' warranty book and introduced a new three-part program for
<DATE>1990</DATE> Oldsmobile buyers. Two days earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> boosted
its warranty on powertrain and safety equipment to five years or
60,000 miles from three years or 36,000 miles.
   Oldsmobile's new program offers buyers a three-year,
bumper-to-bumper warranty with a <MONEY>$100</MONEY> deductible after the first
year, a chance for new buyers to return their cars within a month
for full credit for another new Oldsmobile and a roadside assistance
plan.
   During the first three years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes
first, Oldsmobile owners will be able to telephone for help anytime
their car is disabled for any reason, from an empty gas tank to a
major mechanical failure, said <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile General</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Mike Losh</PERSON>.
   Because of <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile</ORGANIZATION>'s sales volume, the move may prompt other
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> divisions as well as <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to rethink their warranties.
   ``What you're going to see is a big ramp-up in the overall
warranty coverage on the part of everybody,'' said analyst <PERSON>Joseph
Phillippi</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Improving warranties can be costly for automakers, who shoulder
most of the cost through dealer reimbursements. Automakers keep
their warranty costs close to their chests, since, among other
things, that would give competitors a peek at their cars'
reliability.
   The Oldsmobile warranty announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> is unique in <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>. Other
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> divisions offer the basic three-year, 50,000-mile warranty with
the exception of the <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac Allante</ORGANIZATION>, which carries a seven-year,
70,000-mile warranty.
   Changes in the <DATE>1990</DATE> version of the Cadillac warranty will be
announced next week when the division formally introduces its cars
for the coming model year, spokesman <PERSON>Norb Bartos</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
declining to elaborate.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, which introduces its <DATE>1990</DATE> model cars next week, and
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>, which shows off its <DATE>1990</DATE> cars a week after that, have
basic warranties of 12 months or 12,000 miles in addition to longer
powertrain and rust protection coverage. Chrysler offers more
extensive basic coverage for its larger, more expensive cars.
   Officials of both companies said there were no immediate plans to
change warranties.
   <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> is offering a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty with
a free towing provision for its <DATE>1989</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE> cars. But the number
of vehicles covered by that plan, as well as those offered by other
makers of imported luxury cars, doesn't approach that of Oldsmobile.
   The Oldsmobile warranty, announced as the <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> division introduced
its <DATE>1990</DATE> model cars, may be transferred if the original buyer sells
the car while it's covered by the basic warranty.
   The warranty stems from pilot programs <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> ran on the <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile
Cutlass Supreme</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Pontiac Grand Prix</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, said <PERSON>Losh</PERSON>, who
was general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Pontiac Division</ORGANIZATION> before moving to
<ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year.
   He said fewer than <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Cutlass Supreme</ORGANIZATION> buyers
taking part in the pilot program returned their cars for other
Oldsmobiles. The program also offers free overnight accommodations
for drivers whose cars need that much time to be fixed if the driver
is more than 150 miles from home.

   Several foreign car makers have announced price increases on their 1988 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> models, adding profitable luxury equipment and more powerful engines compared with the <DATE>1987</DATE> models. 

   The companies said some of their increases also reflect the continuing weakness of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar compared with many foreign currencies. 

   One manufacturer is cutting or freezing some prices, however, in an effort to realign its products and avoid overlap among its models. 

   <ORGANIZATION>BMW of North America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it is boosting base prices <PERCENT>1.9%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> on the six <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> models that go on sale by <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE>. 
American <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Acura division is increasing base prices on its <DATE>1988</DATE> Legend cars <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>7.9%</PERCENT>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot Motors of America</ORGANIZATION> said base prices for its entire <DATE>1988</DATE> model line will rise <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>9.9%</PERCENT>. 
With sales currently running about <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT> below a year ago, <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> also said it will offer owners of its diesel-engine cars rebates of <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> if they purchase a new 1987-model gasoline-powered <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The lone price-cutter in the latest round of announcements is <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen of America Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm of West German-based <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen AG</ORGANIZATION> said it is freezing prices on three of its Golf and Jetta subcompact cars, cutting the price of the least-expensive Jetta and introducing a new <DATE>1988</DATE> model Golf with a base price <MONEY>$400</MONEY> lower than the lowest-price <DATE>1987</DATE> model Golf. 

   The new base Golf will start at <MONEY>$7,990</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> raised the price of the next least-expensive Golf -- the GL model -- <PERCENT>1.2%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$100</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$8,490</MONEY> and froze the price of the Golf GT at <MONEY>$9,975</MONEY>. 
The company said it made only minor equipment changes on the two-door Jetta, which now starts at <MONEY>$8,990</MONEY>, <PERCENT>6.3%</PERCENT> below the <DATE>1987</DATE> model. 

   <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, said its latest price increases, which cover six of its <DATE>1988</DATE> models, averaged <PERCENT>3.7%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$1,450</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> will announce prices for its remaining eight models when they go on sale in late <DATE>November</DATE>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> said its <DATE>1988</DATE> model Acura Legend prices averaged <PERCENT>4.4%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$1,016</MONEY>, higher than comparably equipped <DATE>1987</DATE> models. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it added a more powerful engine, antilock brakes and a security system to the Legend Sedan L. 
The Sedan L equipped with automatic transmission now starts at <MONEY>$25,748</MONEY>, an increase of <PERCENT>7.9%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$1,890</MONEY>, from the <DATE>1987</DATE> version. 

   French auto maker <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot S.A.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales unit said the weak <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar accounted for most of its <PERCENT>4.7%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$988</MONEY>, average price increase. 
The least-expensive <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION>, the 505 DL, will start at <MONEY>$15,495</MONEY> when it goes on sale next month with the rest of <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1988</DATE> product line. 
The company also increased destination charges on all cars by <MONEY>$10</MONEY>, to <MONEY>$385</MONEY>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> said its <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> rebate should help in "enhancing the resale value" of its diesel-powered cars. 
Sales of most manufacturers' diesel-engine models have slumped over the past few years, mainly because of declining gasoline prices and quality problems in some cars that hurt the image of the engines. 
In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the cars <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> sold here had diesel engines, but the company stopped importing those models in the <DATE>1986</DATE> model year.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): Conventional cars are
multiplying - All 1994 models are safer than the cars they will replace. The
industry has also been trying to minimise their impact on the environment /
New Models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN an ideal world, all the new cars which will make their debut at <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> motor shows would have been designed simply and solely as safe,
economical personal transport making the minimum impact on the environment.
Some of them have - although they are mainly concept cars which may or may
not go into production.
In the meantime, conventional cars with potential maximum speeds exploitable
only at rare intervals on the de-restricted parts of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s autobahnen
are alive and multiplying. The new <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> 911 and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s new <LOCATION>Supra</LOCATION>, which
is capable of 180 mph (290 kph) but restricted to a more seemly 155 mph
(250kph), prove that the supercar is surprisingly resistant to the
disapproval of the environmental/conservationist lobby.
To be sure, all <DATE>1994</DATE> models, be they European, American or Far Eastern, are
safer than the cars they will replace. And the industry has been going to
great lengths (and enormous expense) to minimise their environmental impact
during manufacture, for the whole of their working lives and when they are
finally scrapped.
Active safety has been enhanced by the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) which
have become standard equipment on medium and higher priced cars. Traction
control systems, using the same electronic sensors as ABS, are gradually
being introduced. Permanently engaged four-wheel drive is available on a
limited number of purely road-going cars for buyers who feel the need for
maximum possible tyre grip for performance or safety reasons.
On the passive safety front, reinforcing bars are now fitted to the cheapest
cars to limit intrusion into the passenger protecting cell in side-on
accidents. Buyers of executive-class cars now expect driver-side airbags as
standard equipment, with passenger-side airbags as not-too-expensive
optional extras.
ProCon Ten, an ingeniously simple mechanical system which pulls forward the
steering wheel in an impact severe enough to displace the engine backward
and simultaneously tightens the seat belts against driver and front
passenger remains exclusive to <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>. There are signs that it will be
abandoned in favour of airbags. The new <ORGANIZATION>VW</ORGANIZATION> Passat being launched at
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> has them as standard for both front seat occupants.
Impact-sensitive, self-tightening belts, however, are now common to most
makes of car.
Inevitably, improving the driver's chances of preventing a hazardous
situation from developing into a collision, and protecting a car's occupants
better if the worst should happen, has its downside.
Making new models crash-safer has increased their weight and complication.
To maintain or improve performance, particularly acceleration and easy
driveability in traffic, they are tending to have lower overall gearing,
which does not help fuel consumption.
The potentially adverse effects of heavier construction and lower gearing on
fuel consumption are being offset by improved electronic management systems
for petrol engines and the wider adoption of fuel-efficient diesel - and
particularly turbo-diesel - engines.
<ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> is showing at <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> a management system which further
improves the economy of diesel cars by shutting off the fuel supply and
stopping the engine on downgrades. <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>'s 900, its first new model since
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> took a controlling interest, is to be available - initially
only in the turbo version - with a Sensonic automatic clutch.
This system is a half-way house. The driver still has to change gear with a
conventional lever but there is no clutch pedal. Sensonic provides many of
the advantages of a conventional torque-converter automatic transmission
without any fuel consumption penalty. Eliminating the gear lever and
shifting by buttons on the steering wheel is the next step.
There are signs at <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> - and there will be signs at <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> - that a
rash of really small cars is coming in the <DATE>second half of this decade</DATE>. New
models will be nearer to the <ORGANIZATION>Fiat Cinquecento</ORGANIZATION> and Japanese microcars in
overall size than existing small Europeans such as the British-made <ORGANIZATION>Nissan
Micra</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Corsa</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> Twingo and Rover 100 (Metro in
UK). Corsa and Micra have proved that in terms of performance, ride comfort
and general utility, the only thing distinguishing a really small car from a
medium sized one is its bulk.
Mercedes-Benz, whose Vision A 93 design study is a <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> talking point,
speaks of growing demands by customers for cars of individuality and quality
that will be suitable for use in crowded conurbations but still capable of
longer journeys. <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s 3.7 metre-long E1, designed for either
battery-electric or petrol-engine power, is similarly targeted. The <ORGANIZATION>Fiat
Cinquecento</ORGANIZATION>, seemingly parkable anywhere, does not feel in the least out of
its depth on a motorway; and it is on the market now.
Recognising that multi-cylinder buyers do not necessarily want a
conventionally large car has led <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> to offer a 2.5 V6 engine in
its medium/large <ORGANIZATION>Opel Vectra</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Cavalier</ORGANIZATION>), <ORGANIZATION>Calibra</ORGANIZATION> coupe and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>
900. Especially when combined with automatic transmission, a small V6 is an
appealing package, as Japanese producers like <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> realised earlier on.
Next year, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s successful Mondeo will go on sale with a US-made 2.5-litre
V6 engine and automatic transmission.
The civilised benefits of air conditioning have already spread from luxury
to executive cars. Now they are now begining to reach the broad base of the
European market, just as they did years ago in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. At the same
time, the convertible market is booming, with <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> launching its 306 and
<ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> its new Golf soft-tops at <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> promising a new 900
cabriolet by the <DATE>spring of 1994</DATE>.
Just as the BX propelled Citroen into the mainstream European car market in
the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, the Xantia which has just succeeded the BX is proving a
powerful challenger in the fleet market traditionally dominated by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> products. It is an outstanding car, widely tipped as a likely European
Car of the Year <DATE>1994</DATE> contest winner. It combines a roomy though elegantly
styled body with advanced self-levelling suspension and refined diesel and
turbo-diesel engines.
In the luxury class, <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> has squeezed more power from its venerable
V8, while <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, aware of a trend among business buyers away from
very large cars with very large engines, has introduced a 2.8- litre,
six-cylinder version of the S-Class.
Some versions of its new C-Class saloons, which have been aimed at younger
than traditional <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> buyers, have the world's first
four-valves-per-cylinder diesel engines. Although they have been on sale for
some weeks in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, they are making their first show appearance at
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> says it will start producing a limited
edition of a <MONEY>$576,000</MONEY> car that can attain speeds of more than 200
mph.
   Chairman Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the car, the XJ220, is
as exciting as <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s D-type, which was introduced in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>.
``It is a very interesting project and could herald a pattern for
the future,'' he said.
   The concept model was first revealed at the <ORGANIZATION>International Motor
Show</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, and consumer interest was so strong that <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>
believes it is assured of getting buyers for an initial production
of 220 cars.
   Output could increase to a maximum of 350 cars, if demand is
strong enough, said the chairman of the British car maker, which is
being acquired by <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>.
   ``After this we might look at another limited edition. More
super cars could follow if there is a demand,'' he said. He added
that more than 200 new jobs would be created when production
started at a new factory currently being built in <LOCATION>Oxfordshire</LOCATION> in
western <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   Fifty engineers were already working on the project, he said.
   The car will be available in left-hand and right-hand drive, but
will not be exported to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since it will only meet
European regulations.
   The cars are to be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.
   Each of the cars will be numbered and customers will have to put
down a deposit of <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY>. The cars will be delivered in <DATE>1992</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> said.

   For Copying Classic Models,

   DETROIT -- Anyone who dreams of tooling along America's
roads in a slick Ferrari Daytona Spyder needs two things:
money and patience. The now-discontinued car fetches roughly
$1 million, and there's often a lengthy wait to get a used
one.
   But buyers who settle for a California Daytona Spyder have
no wait and pay only about $50,000. The California Spyder is
a "kit car," a life-size replica that independent
manufacturers make from the parts of cheaper cars. The
California Spyder looks so much like the Daytona Spyder it
was used on television's "Miami Vice." It's also so close to
the original version that Ferrari S.p.A. sued its builder for
trademark infringement -- and won.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> kit-car industry has been on edge since
that <DATE>July 1989</DATE> ruling by a federal judge in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and
with good reason. Other luxury car makers are joining <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION>
in claiming that kit-car makers are cheating them by
reproducing their cars and selling them at cut-rate prices.
   The auto companies claim the kit-car makers are infringing
on their trademarks, because their designs are easily
recognized and considered unique. "We don't want a
Chevy-powered Lamborghini on the road," says <PERSON>Robert F. Smith</PERSON>,
business development executive for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm of
<ORGANIZATION>Lamborghini S.p.A.</ORGANIZATION> "We're trying to protect our reputation."
   That wasn't much of a concern until the last year or two.
Most kit-cars (so-called because consumers can buy them in
kits to build at home, though most buy them already
assembled) didn't look too much like the originals. But many
kit makers have improved their manufacturing processes.
They've stepped up advertising and gotten exposure on
television shows. Industrywide sales figures don't exist, but
auto makers now see kit makers as more of a threat than in
the past.
   Ferrari has sued two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> kit makers in recent years, and
won each time. Because of that, other auto makers are finding
that merely threatening to sue kit makers for replicating
rare, expensive cars is enough. "The {kit-car} industry may
be forced to go back and do business a different way,"
contends <PERSON>George Evans</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Association of
Handcrafted Automobiles</ORGANIZATION>.
   That is precisely what the auto makers want. Lamborghini,
for example, finds companies that replicate its cars by
watching ads in kit-car magazines, and asks them to quit. So
far, <ORGANIZATION>Lamborghini</ORGANIZATION> says, its lawyers have sent letters to at
least three auto-replica companies, and all have ended
production. "It's like copying the <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON>," asserts <PERSON>Mr.
Smith</PERSON>. "You can't imagine <PERSON>Da Vinci</PERSON> would be happy about it."
   But kit makers say you can't liken a <ORGANIZATION>Lamborghini Countach</ORGANIZATION>
to the <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON>. They claim they're being bullied by large
auto companies who've got the money and the manpower to
outmuscle them.
   "At first I said I was going to fight," says <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
kit maker <PERSON>Jim Kuzara</PERSON>, who stopped replicating the Countach
after he was contacted by <ORGANIZATION>Lamborghini</ORGANIZATION>. "But then logic
started to take over." <PERSON>Mr. Kuzara</PERSON> says he couldn't afford a
lengthy court battle, even though losing the Countach replica
would devastate his small business. The bread-and-butter
model had accounted for <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of his company's sales.
   Lamborghini and <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION> are the most aggressive in
attacking the kit makers, but they aren't alone. Rolls <ORGANIZATION>Royce
Motor Cars</ORGANIZATION> has taken two duplicators to court since the
<DATE>1970s</DATE>, and won both cases on the grounds of trademark
infringement. "If you try to doctor something up to look like
a Rolls we find it offensive," says spokesman <PERSON>Reg Abbiss</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> unit, <ORGANIZATION>Porsche AG</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz AG</ORGANIZATION> are likewise vigilant, threatening to sue kit
makers whose replicas hit too close to home. "We're very
strict with our trademark," asserts a spokesman for
<ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, which makes <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> cars.
   But kit-car makers say they don't understand all the fuss.
"The cars are similar and we don't deny that," says <PERSON>Carl
Roberts</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> kit-car builder. "But you can't stop
people from making something that is similar to something
else."
   But the courts are doing just that. Earlier this year <PERSON>Mr.
Roberts</PERSON> was ordered to stop selling replicas of Spyder and
Testarossa models, both made by <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sales of the look-alikes, which were built using the body
and engine of Chevrolet Corvettes, represented about <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of
<PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON>'s cash flow. <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> says he had to
temporarily shut down after the ruling, and now builds stunt
cars for movie makers, though they aren't nearly as
profitable as the Ferrari copycats had been. "They make it
difficult for a small businessman to survive," says <PERSON>Mr.
Roberts</PERSON>, who is appealing the court case that he lost.
   But auto companies say they have little sympathy for kit
makers. "The replicas dilute our good reputation," says <PERSON>Hugh
Steward</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION>. "Individuals who invest
large amounts of money in real Ferraris are upset when there
are cheap imitations on the road."

   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> division is raising the base prices of its most popular <DATE>1990</DATE> models as much as <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT> from <DATE>1989</DATE> levels. 

   Base prices for <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION>'s Fleetwood coupe, sedan and <ORGANIZATION>Sixty Special</ORGANIZATION> will jump more than <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> each. 
The <DATE>1990</DATE> Fleetwood coupe's list price will rise <PERCENT>6.7%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$32,400</MONEY> from <MONEY>$30,365</MONEY> now. 
The <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Sixty Special</ORGANIZATION> will start at <MONEY>$36,980</MONEY>, an increase of <MONEY>$2,140</MONEY>, or <PERCENT>6.1%</PERCENT>, from <DATE>1989</DATE>. 

   The <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Eldorado</ORGANIZATION> will start at <MONEY>$28,855</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>7.2%</PERCENT> from <MONEY>$26,915</MONEY> currently. 
The smallest increase was for the <ORGANIZATION>Seville Touring Sedan</ORGANIZATION> model, which will start at <MONEY>$36,320</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>1.8%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$631</MONEY>, from the <DATE>1989</DATE> model. 

   By contrast, rival <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to keep prices for its three Lincoln luxury cars below <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
For example, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has set the tentative base price of its best-selling luxury model, the Lincoln Town Car, at <MONEY>$27,315</MONEY>, up <PERCENT>6.7%</PERCENT>, or <MONEY>$1,783</MONEY> from the <DATE>1989</DATE> version. 
Still, the <DATE>1990</DATE> Town Car, which will have a new, smoother exterior look, is priced <MONEY>$85</MONEY> below <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION>'s least expensive full-size sedan for <DATE>1990</DATE>, the <MONEY>$27,400</MONEY> <LOCATION>Brougham</LOCATION>. 
The most expensive <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, is expected to start at <MONEY>$29,258</MONEY>. 

   Cadillac said in a statement that the increases reflect the costs of airbags and new standard equipment. 
New standard features on the <DATE>1990</DATE> Eldorado include airbags, a more powerful engine, and several previously optional cosmetic features such as "illuminated vanity mirrors," trunk mat, door edge guards, front and rear floor mats, rear window defogger and "accent striping," <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   Cadillac didn't release a <DATE>1990</DATE> base price for its most expensive model, the <LOCATION>Allante</LOCATION> two-seater. 
In <DATE>1989</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Allante</ORGANIZATION> listed for <MONEY>$57,183</MONEY>, including a <MONEY>$650</MONEY> gas guzzler tax. 
For <DATE>1990</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Allante</LOCATION> is expected to get standard airbag and traction control, a system that controls the wheels to prevent spinouts when the car accelerates on slick pavement. 

   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buick</ORGANIZATION> divisions announced that base prices on many of their <DATE>1990</DATE> car models will increase <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT>. 
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> said it also plans to raise the prices of certain optional equipment.

FT  28 SEP 94 / Jaguar unveils Pounds 200m XJ range: Ford expects cost of
returning ailing marque to profit to reach Pounds 1bn by 1996
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> today unveils its new XJ range of luxury saloons, the first of a
series of three new cars planned for launch in the next four years, and
aimed at transforming the fortunes of the chronically loss-making UK luxury
carmaker.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> has suffered total pre-tax losses of Pounds 776m since it was taken
over for Pounds 1.56bn in late <DATE>1989</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, the world's second-biggest
vehicle producer. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> carmaker is doubling its stakes rather than
quitting, however, and expects to have invested another Pounds 1bn by the
end of <DATE>1996</DATE>.
An important part of this spending has been devoted to the XJ series,
code-named X300 during its development, which has cost more than Pounds 200m
to bring to production. <PERSON>Mr Nick Scheele</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief
executive, said the new car would help to bring the company back to profit
next year.
The XJ series is the first important product programme delivered by <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>
since the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> acquisition. The cars go on sale in the <DATE>UK this week</DATE>, priced
between Pounds 28,950 and Pounds 59,950, and should be launched in the
company's 50 export markets before the end of the year.
The new model, which replaces the saloon range launched in <DATE>1986</DATE>, must prove
to sceptical luxury car buyers that the Coventry-based carmaker has learned
the quality and efficiency lessons expensively and painfully imparted by
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> since the takeover.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s classic styling and design have often been the envy of its rivals,
but its quality and reliability have left much to be desired.
In spite of improvements in the last couple of years the XJ6 range still
failed to make it into the top 50 cars in this year's new-car initial
quality study by <ORGANIZATION>JD Power</ORGANIZATION>, the leading <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> automotive consumer research
group. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s most important market, accounting last year for
46.4 per cent of total worldwide sales of 27,338.
The current XJ6 is conspicuously missing from a list of cars that includes
all its main rivals, the Lexus LS400, the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 5 and 7 series, the Infiniti
Q45 and the <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> E and S-Class, which all scored fewer than 100
problems per 100 cars. The XJ6 scored 128, significantly worse than the
industry average of 110. But it is closing the gap - its score was 233 in
<DATE>1989</DATE>, against an industry average of 148.
<PERSON>Mr Jim Padilla</PERSON>, the tough Detroit-born engineer appointed two years ago as
executive director of manufacturing and engineering - with the task of
ensuring that new product programmes are delivered to target - said that the
investment and restructuring of the last couple of years had yielded big
gains in quality and efficiency.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> had cut the number of problems per 100 cars, measured at the end of
the assembly line, from 1,432 at the end of <DATE>1990</DATE> to 281 by <DATE>February this
year</DATE>. A 15 per cent improvement had been achieved on its <DATE>1994</DATE> model year
cars, he said.
Labour hours per unit have been cut by 54 per cent between <DATE>1991</DATE> and <DATE>1994</DATE>.
The hourly-paid workforce has been cut by 54 per cent, the salaried
workforce by 37 per cent and inventories by 35 per cent. The workforce fell
from 12,100 in <DATE>1990</DATE> to 6,750 last year.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> has invested about Pounds 110m at its three manufacturing plants in
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> and Coventry to prepare for the launch of the XJ series. It has
installed a new final assembly line at the <PERSON>Browns Lane</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Coventry</ORGANIZATION> plant,
ripping out equipment bought in <DATE>1953</DATE> from the <ORGANIZATION>Standard Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
According to <PERSON>Mr Scheele</PERSON> the new XJ series is 'the most significant new
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> in a generation', but it is only the first step.
A substantial part of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> spending in the next two years is being devoted
to developing a grand tourer sports coupe and roadster, code-named X100, to
replace the XJS range in the <DATE>autumn of 1996</DATE>.
It is also developing a range of V8 engines for use initially in the sports
car, and by the late <DATE>1990s</DATE> as the main <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> engine family.
Most important for the future growth of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> is the project to develop a
range of smaller sports saloons to compete with cars such as the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 5
series. Code-named X200, this car is due for launch in <DATE>1998</DATE>. It would be an
addition to the range and would more than double <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> output to more than
100,000 a year by 1998/99.
The snag for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s UK workforce is that no decision has yet been made on
a production site. The X200 could become the first <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to be built in
<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. It is being designed as a derivative of a <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> world-car
programme code-named DEW 98, being developed in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Padilla</PERSON> said: 'The important thing for car-buying motivation is the
product, not the manufacturing location. The feedback from our customer
studies is less than compelling in favour of the UK.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (12): Not all customers
are honest - Rented and leased vehicles are increasingly likely to be stolen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BOSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the growing incidence of theft of cars in the UK that <ORGANIZATION>Avis</ORGANIZATION> staff are
now taking photographs of people who want to rent their vehicles.
'We're using this system at high risk locations', says <ORGANIZATION>Avis Operations
Director</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Steve Maltby</PERSON>, 'and we'd rather not rent to those who won't have
their picture taken.'
Maltby is also chairman of the security committee of the <ORGANIZATION>British Vehicle
Rental and Leasing Association</ORGANIZATION> (BVRLA) and is concerned at the numbers of
vehicles being stolen both in the leasing and daily rental sectors of the
market.
'It's costing our members Pounds 125.5m a year', he says, 'and when you
consider that 60 per cent of the light commercial vehicles which are stolen
are never recovered, and some 17 per cent of the cars are never seen again,
you can see the scale of the problem.'
Of the l2m cars run by BVRLA members, 3 per cent of the leasing cars and 3.5
per cent of the daily rental cars are stolen every year.
Interestingly, <ORGANIZATION>Avis</ORGANIZATION> carried out a simple test in its <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION>
operation which significantly cut down on theft. Of its 400 fleet cars, some
21 were fitted with an expensive engine immobiliser, while the others were
supplied with a dl6 steering wheel lock. Some of <ORGANIZATION>Maltby</ORGANIZATION>'s colleagues scoffed
at the garishly coloured lock, but his action was soon vindicated.
'Within two weeks, seven of the cars fitted with engine immobilisers had
been broken into, but those cars fitted with the steering wheel lock were
untouched.
'The point is, it's highly visible, so it's a deterrent to the petty thief,
and he's usually the one who breaks into cars. He sees the steering wheel
lock, he goes to the next car which isn't protected.'
And thereby hangs the next problem. Many in the leasing industry believe
that the car manufacturers and the government must do more to protect all
vehicles from the criminal.
The actual theft of vehicles seems to be slightly slowing down, says <PERSON>Howard
Thomas</PERSON>, operations director of Lease Plan, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s largest vehicle lease
company, though thefts from vehicles are still very evident. 'What annoys me
is that today the anti-theft technology is proven, and it's relatively
inexpensive, and yet some of the vehicle manufacturers are still not putting
enough standard anti-theft equipment into cars.' As an example, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>
points to the number of cars which are fitted with a simple perimetric
alarm.
'Some buyers haven't a clue what this really is', says <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, 'and many
come out of the showroom with the idea that it protects the car. But it only
protects the doors, and perhaps the bonnet and boot. It does not stop the
criminal smashing the window and reaching inside and taking whatever is in
the car. With this sort of cheap alarm system such a theft doesn't even
activate the alarm.'
Thomas adds that a car's image also attracts the thief. 'We get far more
break-ins of BMWs than we do of <ORGANIZATION>Ford Mondeos</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION>, though
usually the theft is because there's a good in-car entertainment package
there. What we like to see is a sound system which is built into the car,
which forms part of the build of that car, so it cannot be taken out, and if
it is, then it's of no use.'
There had been important strides, for example the <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Astra</ORGANIZATION> where the
radio's display was not part of the unit itself, but some manufacturers were
still doing only half a job.
Take the new <ORGANIZATION>Renault Laguna</ORGANIZATION>. It had an easily stealable radio, which was not
built into the car. 'To us this is a distinct disadvantage.' Thomas points
to other cars where there are similar problems.
'<ORGANIZATION>The Citroen Xantia</ORGANIZATION> has engine immobilisation, which we see as a very
important feature, but you cannot get it on the diesel models, the best
sellers in the Xantia range.'
This is a view echoed by others in the industry. As <PERSON>Steve Maltby</PERSON> points out,
'the car manufacturers are generally doing more, responding to pressure from
government as much as anybody else, but one of the sad things is that while
they are increasingly putting security of all types in their most up-market
models, there are generally less anti-theft measures across their ranges.
Whether somebody is paying Pounds 6,000 or Pounds 60,000 for a car he should
be entitled to a decent level of security. Car manufacturers who are not
supplying anti-theft across their ranges are not supplying a proper service
to the customer.'
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, now considered by many in the industry to be at the cutting edge of
anti-theft technology, disagrees.
'We have alarms on all of our models as standard, with the exception of the
four-wheel drive <ORGANIZATION>Maverick</ORGANIZATION>', says <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Don Hume</PERSON>, 'and all of our Fiestas
and Escorts now come, as standard, with the transponder key, each of which
has a one in 10 trillion start code programmed into it. Without the right
key it's not possible to start the engine.'
But <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> also still fits perimetric alarms to many cars, rather than a full
ultrasonic system. That said, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is testing a tracking device which can
tell a control room where a specific car is at any time.
A similar device is used by Swindon-based Datatrak who can track stolen
vehicles, directing the police to them, wherever they are. This system has
proved especially useful to safeguard valuable freight.
There are other advanced systems being tested by police forces throughout
the country. One of the most interesting is a device which couples a
transmitter in the hire car with a receiver fitted into police cars.
Should the car be stolen, the police could not only track it, but once they
got close enough they could activate the receiver to slow down the stolen
car, stopping it safely, and then presumably arresting the thief. If
on-going tests are successful and the system gets <ORGANIZATION>Home Office</ORGANIZATION> approval it
could be fitted as standard on some expensive cars next year.
In tandem with their own tracking device, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is also continuing to
experiment with satellite tracking. This system would ensure that at any
given time the car could be pinpointed - within seconds - wherever it is in
the world.
Clearly anti-theft technology will continue to improve, but caution is
required with some of these devices. Three years ago a British company
developed a system which locked the thief in the car. That is not always a
good idea.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (9): Shake-up in 'perk' sector -
Company Cars / The UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT since the 'perk' car first appeared in numbers as a way of getting round
pay restrictions in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> has the company car sector faced such a
shake-up as that which will arrive on <DATE>April 6</DATE> next year.
On that day, out will go the long-standing system of personal taxation of
the company car benefit based on three engine-size bands and two price
'thresholds'.
In its place will come a much simpler system, in which tax will be payable
on a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's listed retail price of the car -
its 'list' price - plus any extras.
The percentage is fixed at 35 for drivers covering fewer than 2,500 business
miles a year (the classic 'perk' car), with a 'discount' of one third, to
23.3 per cent, for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles and of
two-thirds, or 11.7 per cent, for drivers covering more than 18,000 business
miles. These mileage bands, at which more favourable tax treatment is given,
are about the only 'leftovers' from the current system.
Employees entitled to two company cars will find that both will be assessed
for tax on exactly the same basis, so that the second car - where no
business mileage is likely - will be taxed at the highest rate.
As with the current system, there will be no reduction in the scale charge
payable on a car until it is more than four years old, when the charge drops
by one third.
In the broadest terms the new system will mean a higher tax bill for about
700,000 of the Inland Revenue's estimated 2m company car drivers, but
unchanged or reduced bills for the majority.
In some cases, particularly that of executives with cars priced at just
under the Pounds 19,250 or Pounds 29,000 thresholds of the current banded
scale charge system, individuals face tax rises of up to 60 per cent.
Because there is no 'cap' on the system, drivers of very expensive cars face
tax bills of potentially daunting proportions. Anyone who is running one of
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s Pounds 415,000 XJ220 sports coupes on the company, for example, and
covering fewer than 2,500 business miles with it, will next year face a tax
scale charge of Pounds 145,000 or an actual cash payment of Pounds 58,100 at
the higher marginal rate of personal income tax.
Under this year's scale charge structure, that same XJ220 driver has a scale
charge of Pounds 15,060 and an actual payment of Pounds 6,024.
At a slightly less exalted level, the new taxation structure has sent a
tremor of dismay through companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Aston
Martin</ORGANIZATION>, each with cars in the Pounds 100,000-plus sector.
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motors</ORGANIZATION>, still struggling to emerge from heavy losses, has
already asked the government to relent and set a ceiling on car prices above
which the tax charge will not rise any further. So far, the appeal seems to
have fallen on deaf ears.
But it is not only new luxury cars which will fall foul of the fresh system.
Many executives have chosen to run classic cars, from <PERSON>James Bond-style Aston
Martins</PERSON> to exotic <DATE>1960s</DATE> Ferraris, as low-mileage company cars providing
something 'different'.
They could do so because they were taxed on the basis of original market
value, rendered insignificant by inflation.
The new system will base tax levels on current market value, the precise
fixing of which has yet to be spelt out. Even though the bottom has already
fallen out of the classic car market because of recession, the new system
inevitably will damage the sector's hopes of recovery next year.
Despite this, the new system is not intended by the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> to produce any
increase in real terms in the total tax take - now approaching Pounds 1.5bn
 -from the company car benefit. That has already been taken care of by
further stiff increases in tax scale charges applicable during the current
tax year, and announced in last month's budget by <PERSON>Mr Norman Lamont</PERSON>,
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<PERSON>Mr Lamont</PERSON> now regards the company car overall to be fairly taxed relative to
private motorists as a result of this year's <MONEY>8 per cent</MONEY> increase in the tax
scale charge on the car benefit itself, 20 per cent on the tax charge on
free fuel for private use and the ending of the 50 per cent reduction in the
fuel scale charge for high business mileage drivers.
If there are big losers under the new system, there will be a substantially
larger number of 'winners', particularly among the drivers of lower value
cars which are in genuinely essential business or working use. Tax bills for
these could fall by as much as one third.
The driver of a 2-litre Rover 800 with a price just under Pounds 19,000
currently pays tax on a scale charge of Pounds 4,485 if he or she covers
less than Pounds 5,000 business miles, as the car is assessed solely by it
being in the 1.4litre-2litre engine capacity band. Under the new system,
however, it will attract a scale charge of about Pounds 6,700, based on 35
per cent of 'list' price.
In order to avoid paying extra tax, and all other things being equal, the
driver would have to switch to a car with a list price of about Pounds
12,800.
Not only should the new system mark the end of production of the 'tax break
specials' and other market distortions already much criticised by the
<ORGANIZATION>Monopolies and Mergers Commission</ORGANIZATION> - it has the benefit, from the
manufacturers' point of view in particular, of being self-adjusting.
Instead of the new car market holding its breath each year waiting to see by
how much the Budget would increase scale charges, no action should be
needed. The amount of tax payable will be determined by the rate of increase
in new car prices.
So the new system will contain inbuilt incentives for both companies and
employees to choose smaller and more fuel-efficient cars - seen as desirable
on environmental grounds - and act as a brake on manufacturer price
increases.
Once certain effect of the latest scale charge increases and the new system
is to make many more companies and their drivers examine whether the time
has come for the car keys to be handed over in favour of a cash alternative.
There are no straightforward rules to follow in determining whether the
company or employee will benefit from such a switch to cash. Whether it will
be worthwhile depends on each individual's circumstances and will need
precise calculation.
Nevertheless analysts such as <PERSON>Mr Stewart Whyte</PERSON>, a director of consultancy
<ORGANIZATION>Fleet Audits</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Mr Brian Friedman</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Stoy Benefit
Consulting</ORGANIZATION>, predict that it will become much more widespread, particularly
for 'perk' users who would then be able to take advantage of current high
depreciation rates by buying 'nearly new'.

<TEXT>
   Leo Vigil is caught in a <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> nightmare.
   Three weeks ago, his brand-new <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> Pathfinder was stolen from
outside a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> restaurant where he had taken a customer of his
tie company for dinner.
   ``The buyer was telling me about how his car had been stolen. We
walk out of the restaurant and my car's gone,'' Vigil said.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, his other car, a <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, was one of seven autos
taken at gunpoint from a <LOCATION>Greenwich Village</LOCATION> garage.
   ``My insurance company is totally freaking out,'' Vigil said.
His two cars were worth about <MONEY>$75,000</MONEY>.
   Two of the cars taken <DATE>Monday</DATE> _ a <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> _ were
abandoned near the garage, but the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> and two
other cars not yet identified were driven away.
   ``The luxury cars are very hard to steal, that's why we're
having more gunpoint robberies,'' said Sgt. <PERSON>Pete Baglio</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Auto
Crime Division</ORGANIZATION>. ``The expensive cars have alarm systems that make
them tough to get into.''
   Once stolen, ``a lot of these cars are being tagged and shipped
out of the country. They're not chopping up these cars,'' <PERSON>Baglio</PERSON>
added.
   ``It's just devastating, it really is,'' Vigil said in a
telephone interview <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``It's just amazing what happens here.''
   He said he'd bought another Pathfinder and would ``hope for the
best.''
   There were 133,861 reported car thefts in the city in <DATE>1989</DATE>, a
rise of 13,921 from <DATE>1988</DATE>, according to police statistics.
   But nationwide, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> ranked ninth per capita in car
thefts, after top-ranked <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.

<HL> Upscale Drive: Competition Grows
In U.S. Market for Luxury Autos

<DATELINE> Luxury is losing its exclusivity  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
    at least in the
stratosphere of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car market.
   This lofty region, once dominated by big, plush American models and European touring sedans, is being invaded by a widening variety of upstarts in search of prestige and profits. 
The newcomers range from sporty Japanese cars with price tags that belie their companies' econo-box heritages to British off-road vehicles in mud-shedding shades of "astral silver" and "Caspian blue." 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> luxury-car segment -- loosely defined as vehicles with high prices, lots of equipment and a prestige image -- now has some 60 models, up from about 40 just <DATE>five years ago</DATE>. 
More are on the way; just yesterday <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> announced a new luxury division called Lexus to start selling cars in two years. 
The companies building luxury cars want "a slice of what everyone has looked at as a very attractive market," says <PERSON>William J. Hoover</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Volvo Cars of North America</ORGANIZATION>. 
"There are a lot of players in there with big ambitions." 

   The unprecedented competition is accelerating just as luxury-car makers are being hurt by tax-law changes, weakness in the overall car market and, for some imports, the weaker dollar. 
As a result, the traditional luxury-car makers increasingly are taking very untraditional steps. 
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> is giving dealers up to <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> on some models. 
Ford guarantees the trade-in price of its new imported Merkur Scorpio sedans. 
<ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> is paying dealers up to <MONEY>$500</MONEY> for every non-turbocharged car they sell. 

   Product planning and development have become more sophisticated as companies struggle to make their models stand out from the clutter. 
Targeting a car to a niche, from land-barge to performance sedan to sport utility vehicle, has become more important. 
"You can't just show up every year and make the cars bigger anymore," says <PERSON>Thomas J. Wagner</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s luxury-car division. 

   The growing competition stems in part from demographics. 
Baby boomers are moving into their years of peak earning power, which coincide roughly with the prime luxury-car buying years, about 40 to 54 years old. 
The result: more people who can afford to pay <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> or more for transportation at a time when "it's not unfashionable to make a statement about your wealth through your car," says <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Hoover</PERSON>. 
Also luring manufacturers is the prospect of bigger profits on luxury cars than can be had on other autos. 

   So, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European car makers have broadened their product lines, hoping to win over younger buyers just entering the luxury-car segment and keep them through their retirement years. 
BMW, for example, had only four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> models in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 
Now it has 12, with two more due by year's end. 

   At first the expansion seemed to be working -- particularly for European auto makers, whose leading-edge styling, high quality and exclusive images helped fuel rising sales. 
But this year, the bubble is bursting. 
Tax overhaul's changes in depreciation write-offs, elimination of the sales-tax deduction and phase-out of consumer-interest deductions pulled many luxury-car buyers into dealer showrooms last <DATE>November</DATE> and <DATE>December</DATE>, stealing sales from <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
And the dollar's decline has boosted import prices. 
Since <DATE>October 1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> has raised prices six times; its most expensive car now has a sticker price of more than <MONEY>$73,000</MONEY>. 

   "The honeymoon of the last five years is over," says <PERSON>Christopher W. Cedergren</PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a California-based market research firm. 
"The days of easy, back-to-back (sales) records are gone." 

   The companies' sales figures and forecasts support his view. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales of traditional European luxury car makes -- <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> -- climbed an average of <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> a year from <DATE>1983</DATE> to <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
In the <DATE>first seven months of this year</DATE>, however, sales fell about <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> from year-earlier levels. 
That certainly isn't a disaster when sales of all North American-made cars have dropped more than <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT>, but it is a shock for companies and dealers whose more affluent customers have allowed them to weather most previous downturns in car sales. 
"This year, for the first time, we've had to work to sell the cars," says <PERSON>Michael J. Jackson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> dealer in suburban <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION>, for example, is the only member of the group to post a sales rise so far this year, with deliveries up about <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT>. 
But "probably as the year goes on we will drop slightly below last year's rate," mainly because of the tax changes, says <PERSON>Hans Jordan</PERSON>, vice president of marketing. 

   BMW, offering financing as low as <PERCENT>6.9%</PERCENT>, still hopes it can meet its earlier forecast of essentially flat sales for <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says the company's sales increases over the next few years "will stay in the single-digit percentage range, knowing that this is not going to get a lot easier and there are a lot of people who want to play in this game." 

   Those people include Range Rover of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, which in <DATE>March</DATE> began selling in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> a <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> Jeep-like sport utility vehicle. 
Touted as the transportation of royalty and adventurers, <ORGANIZATION>Range Rover</ORGANIZATION> is designed to appeal to "people who buy Rolex" watches and want "products that have the proper image," says <PERSON>Charles R. Hughes</PERSON>, president of the company, a unit of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Land Rover. 

   But the biggest new push comes from the Japanese firms. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to form a new division called Infiniti for upscale cars. 
It and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> are following <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>, which set up its Acura luxury-car dealer network last year. 

   These divisions are supposed to do more than just keep Japanese car owners in the fold -- owners who previously would have switched to a European car if they wanted a more luxurious import. 
Acura's new Legend model, which carries sticker prices ranging almost up to <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY>, also is intended to attract current drivers of European and American cars as they move onto and up the luxury ladder. 
But <PERSON>Jack Billmyer</PERSON>, senior vice president of automobile sales for <ORGANIZATION>American Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, acknowledges that this isn't an easy task. 
"It's a matter of perception," he says. 
"The Japanese came in at the bottom originally with entry-level cars." 

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto makers also are fighting for their share of these buyers, mainly by focusing on European styling and features. 
Ford plans to introduce an aerodynamic <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Continental</ORGANIZATION> model this <DATE>fall</DATE>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION> division, despite a <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> drop in sales through <DATE>July</DATE>, has had some success with its <MONEY>$55,000</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Allante</ORGANIZATION>, whose body was designed and is built by the coachmaker <ORGANIZATION>Pininfarina</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. 
Cadillac also is adding more powerful engines to its <DATE>1988</DATE> lineup and is restyling its two-year-old <LOCATION>Eldorado</LOCATION> to lengthen it by three inches and make the front grille more formal. 

   Buick and <ORGANIZATION>Oldsmobile</ORGANIZATION> are developing their own new luxury models, and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> plans a restyled, front-wheel-drive New Yorker and a new luxury coupe being designed jointly with <ORGANIZATION>Maserati</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. 

   Lincoln so far has been the most successful of the American luxury-car makers, with sales through <DATE>July 31</DATE> up <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> from a year earlier. 
The division's Town Car continues to attract the traditional land-barge lover, while its performance-oriented Mark VII <ORGANIZATION>LSC</ORGANIZATION> model "now has evolved to the point that it's a legitimate alternative to a German luxury car," says <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Cedergren</PERSON>. 

   Whether the growing competition in the luxury-car market will lead to a shake-out isn't yet clear. 
But "a few people had (the market) sewed up for so long," says <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Billmyer</PERSON>, "it's probably good from the consumer's standpoint that now there are more alternatives."

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (7): Manufacturers are kept
guessing - The UK Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE size and structure of the UK executive car market has been dictated, to
a very large extent, by two price 'break points' and - since <DATE>1988</DATE> - a
2-litre engine size threshold above which company car taxation levels
increase considerably.
Carmakers and importers have adjusted their production and marketing
strategies to take advantage of this. That they have felt constrained to do
so is an illustration of the importance of the business car sector relative
to their total sales.
For example, although <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> makes 'only<DATE>' 40</DATE> per cent of its sales to business
'fleet' buyers - its own definition is a company taking 10 or more of its
cars - it believes that as much as 85 per cent of its total sales are
business-linked, through sales to accountants, small partnerships and
similar entities. Thus these purchases are also subject to company car
taxation calculations.
From next year, the existing tax framework will be dismantled in favour of a
much simpler system based on a percentage of a car's retail list price.
Company executives will then be much freer to choose what cars they like.
For the moment at least, what those buyers will like remains a matter of
important guesswork for manufacturers seeking to determine what their future
model line-ups should be. Some strands of likely change are starting to
appear, however.
One of the most important is diesels. The arguments in their favour are
already powerful. They are much more economical than equivalent petrol
models, by up to 30 per cent. This is assuming greater importance as the
price of fuel continues to rise by well in excess of inflation.
The price premium demanded by manufacturers for their diesel models is also
disappearing as economies of scale on diesel engine production increase.
And, important in terms of improving their performance in the executive
sector, the larger engines size needed to deliver supposedly similar
performance to a petrol engine will no longer be subject to a tax penalty
next year.
The volume manufacturers fit diesels in their executive car ranges as a
matter of course. But the take-up to date has been relatively low because of
their sedate image and the engine-size tax penalty.
However, the latest high-speed turbocharged car diesels, far from being
inferior in performance to glamorous-sounding multi-valve '<ORGANIZATION>Gti</ORGANIZATION>'-type cars,
are superior to them in most normal conditions of use.
Their relatively much greater torque delivered at low engine speeds is more
usable than high power - as the executive sector itself is poised to
discover.
Citroen is setting the ball rolling with a 'Volcane' version of its ZX which
it is marketing as a 'hot hatchback' in every sense, including outright
performance. Nevertheless, beneath the bonnet is a turbo diesel also capable
of up to 50mpg.
But the watershed will be reached in mid-year when <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, the German executive
car maker whose image has been built largely on high performance, launches a
range of diesel cars in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>.
It is doing so with trepidation, anxious that its performance image should
not be prejudiced among British customers who have been buying some 40,000
BMWs a year. Nevertheless, many industry observers believe its initial 900
sales target is an underestimate of likely demand for a car still capable of
about 120mph.
<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and some other makers also expect an increase in the capacity
of petrol engines chosen by many buyers as a result of the tax penalty
disappearing.
Under the existing taxation regime, the 'typical' executive car has tended
to be a highly specified model of just under 2 litres. Now, they expect,
many buyers of such cars will be willing to pay a bit extra for, say, a
2.5-litre V6 of the type that <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION> has just put into production at
<LOCATION>Ellesmere Port</LOCATION>. A further significant number of buyers, they believe, will
opt for the larger engine but a less luxurious specification in order to
minimise their liability to tax under the incoming list price taxation
scheme.
With traffic congestion continuing to increase, an already apparent business
car market trend towards smaller cars - so-called 'downsizing' - is likely
to be boosted further by the new freedom to specify cars with larger
engines. <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION> has already caused a stir in this context by launching the
V6 in a relatively cheap version of its medium-sized Cavalier.
A big problem with analysis of the executive sector is that each
manufacturer tends to define the sector differently.
However, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> is widely regarded as the archetypal 'executive' car. On its
analysis, the lower end of the executive car market - which it defines as
including its own 3 Series, <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen Golf GTi</ORGANIZATION> and VR6, top specification
Cavaliers, Rover 400s and similar - was badly hit last year by a sales drop
of 19.75 per cent in a total market which was almost unchanged from <DATE>1991</DATE>. In
unit terms, sector sales fell from 555,319 to 445,637 - within which,
however, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s own share rose from 4.6 to 6.3 per cent. But it was a long
way behind segment leader <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> whose share was 22.5 per cent - even if down
from the 25.7 of <DATE>1991</DATE>.
However, previously the sector had been doing relatively much better than
larger executive cars, which were themselves hit by the imposition of the
2-litre tax break in <DATE>1988</DATE>, causing a sales plummet in <DATE>1989</DATE>, for example, of
bigger-engined cars typified by <ORGANIZATION>Jaguars</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s 7 Series.
The 'middle' executive segment typified by <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s 5 Series also went into a
sharp downturn in <DATE>1991</DATE>, by more than a quarter, so that last year the fall
of <MONEY>6 per cent</MONEY> to 105,802 from 112,554 was relatively mild.
It is a sector fought over fiercely by, among others, <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION>'s 800 and 900
Series cars, <LOCATION>Granadas</LOCATION>, Rover 800s, Saabs and mid-range Mercedes. Last year,
<ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> saw its share shoot up to 10.3 per cent from 5.9. But its satisfaction
was minor compared with that of Rover, which knocked <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> off its
market-leading pedestal and down to fourth place.
It is volume manufacturers, rather than their more obvious rivals, that
companies such as <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> have most cause to fear. For all the volume
makers are seeking to acquire for their more expensive products exactly the
same type of image that <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and its cohorts are most anxious to protect.
Rover, with its just-launched 600 range - developed jointly with <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>,
whose own Accord version is now in increasing production at <LOCATION>Swindon</LOCATION> -
provides one of the most obvious examples of that threat.
Strictly speaking, it is no more a 'volume' manufacturer than <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> - indeed
Rover's own output was considerably lower than the Bavarian manufacturer's
last year.
But Rover has been working hard to distance itself from its BL 'volume car'
roots and many believe that with the 600 its success will accelerate
sharply.
Professor <PERSON>Garel Rhys</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff Business School</ORGANIZATION>, a motor industry guru, is
one such believer. He only half-jokingly refers to the new Rover as the '<ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>
400'.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: COUNTY IS DOING ITS PART FOR LEGISLATIVE DRIVING

<TEXT>
<P>
It's often said that <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> doesn't count for much in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A crass canard, that. A libel upon our dedicated public servants. 
</P>
<P>
Just look at the list of fancy cars leased by the state so legislators can 
cruise in style while pondering which health and education programs to slash in 
these lean times. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive car in the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> is the <DATE>1990</DATE> Lincoln Towne Car leased 
for <PERSON>Wadie P. Deddeh</PERSON> (D-Bonita), valued at <MONEY>$30,811</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive car in the Assembly is the <DATE>1989</DATE> Cadillac Allante leased for 
Speaker <PERSON>Willie Brown</PERSON> (D-San Francisco), valued at <MONEY>$44,530</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
No local angle with <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>, you say. Oh ye of little faith. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION>, the sporty Mercedes-like model, is leased from De la <ORGANIZATION>Fuente 
Cadillac of El Cajon</ORGANIZATION>, owned by <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s political friend <ORGANIZATION>Roque de la Fuente</ORGANIZATION>. 
When De la Fuente opened his business park in <LOCATION>Otay Mesa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> was an honored 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
The state pays the maximum allowable under legislative rules: <MONEY>$446.50</MONEY> a month 
for <ORGANIZATION>Deddeh</ORGANIZATION>'s Lincoln, <MONEY>$400</MONEY> for <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s Caddie. Insurance is also provided. 
</P>
<P>
(Since the leases exceed the state maximum, <PERSON>Deddeh</PERSON> pays another <MONEY>$347.49</MONEY> a month 
from his own pocket, and <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> pays <MONEY>$668.83</MONEY>.) 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Deddeh</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> is strictly for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I want something very heavy, because I drive a lot on the freeway," <PERSON>Deddeh</PERSON> 
told <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Ralph Frammolino</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
He said he drives 18,000 to 22,000 a miles a year, mostly around his district 
on weekends: "The only time it is non-business is when I go to church or go to 
the grocery, and, even then, someone stops me and asks about a piece of 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the legislators take the maximum car allowance. 
</P>
<P>
One who doesn't is Sen. <PERSON>William Craven</PERSON> (R-Oceanside). It costs the state a 
crummy <MONEY>$200</MONEY> a month to lease a <DATE>1985</DATE> Oldsmobile for <PERSON>Craven</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the roads in <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> are less dangerous than those in <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>.

his satiric novel, "Wilkes: His Life and Crimes." 
</P>
<P>
In the new effort, a judge gets bumped off, and <LOCATION>Sevilla</LOCATION>'s anti-hero, defense 
attorney <PERSON>John Wilkes</PERSON>, is an obvious suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Only the cops are too dumb to realize it. 
</P>
<P>

NBA stars are coming to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> for a benefit game next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at the Sports 
Arena. The waterfront <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Marriott</ORGANIZATION> is playing host and providing a 
hospitality suite. 
</P>
<P>
Then somebody discovered that the luxury suite has a very low ceiling. That 
could be a problem for a bunch of giants. 
</P>
<P>
A new suite has now been found. The view isn't as good, but the ceiling is a 
regulation 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To the Winner, the Spoils 
</P>
<P>
That was then, this is now. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> election, <PERSON>Linda Bernhardt</PERSON> sent out a mailer 
blasting <PERSON>Ed Struiksma</PERSON> for taking contributions from, among others in the 
building industry, executives of the La Jolla development firm Oliver/McMillan: 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past eight years, <PERSON>Ed Struiksma</PERSON> has sold our district to the highest 
bidders." 
</P>
<P>
Since her victory, <PERSON>Bernhardt</PERSON> has been hustling to reduce a <MONEY>$155,000</MONEY> campaign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure forms filed last week show that <PERSON>Bernhardt</PERSON> received post-election 
contributions from, among others in the building industry, executives of 
Oliver/McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also hosted a <LOCATION>Bernhardt</LOCATION> fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The debt is now down to <MONEY>$90,000</MONEY>. And <PERSON>Bernhardt</PERSON> just sent a letter to previous 
contributors (and their spouses) asking for more money and pledging fealty: 
</P>
<P>
"Please make a contribution to the campaign deficit. Be assured that I will do 
everything in my power to continue to serve you in the best possible way."

<HEAD>British Luxury Car Maker Faces Tough Fight For Its Independence</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LON1 of Oct. 31; LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the luxury automaker with the leaping
cat logo, may have a tough time staying out of the cage of <ORGANIZATION>General
Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many analysts expect the world's No. 1 and 2 automakers to stage
a <MONEY>multibillion-dollar</MONEY> bidding war for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, which is suffering
the latest in several reversals of fortune that date back to its
founding 67 years ago.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rivals are believed to want to pitch Jaguars against
new Japanese luxury models.
   ``It's looking increasingly likely. It is very much squaring up
for a fight between these two,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Reitman</PERSON>, an auto
analyst with the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips</ORGANIZATION> and Drew.
``Both of them will fight very hard for it, which suggests a
bare-knuckle fight.''
   The British government on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> opened the way for competing
bids by announcing that it would waive its ``golden share,'' which
gave it the power to block any takeover.
   Trade Secretary <PERSON>Nicholas Ridley</PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s
shareholders voted by a <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> majority to lift a <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT>
limit on the size of a single investor's <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> holdings, the
government would drop its veto power.
   The veto rights were imposed when the government sold off the
former state-owned car maker in <DATE>1984</DATE>. They were to expire at the
end of <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   No. 2 <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has said it is prepared to make a full bid for <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>
when takeover restrictions are lifted. Ford had bought <PERCENT>13.2 percent</PERCENT>
by early this past week.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> calls <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s move unwelcome and is negotiating a friendly
cooperation agreement with <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> in which <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would take a
minority stake of perhaps ultimately <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> in the British
company. <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> has obtained <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regulatory approval to buy up to <PERCENT>15
percent</PERCENT>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON>John Egan</PERSON> has said he hoped to announce an
agreement with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> by mid-November. Such a deal might include plans
to jointly manufacture a less expensive executive model, <PERSON>Egan</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s cheapest car costs <MONEY>$39,700</MONEY>.
   ``We believe that preserving <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s independence is in the
best interest of everyone associated with the company,'' <PERSON>Egan</PERSON> said
at a British car show. ``Our desire has always been to keep our
destiny firmly in our own hands.''
   But <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders aren't likely to approve a limited
tie-up with <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>, because they would like to see a full bid, said
<PERSON>John Lawson</PERSON>, an automotive analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Nomura Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   This could prompt both companies to make full takeover offers,
and the winner could end up paying more than <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, the
analysts said. Takeover speculation has more than doubled <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s
share price since before <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> signaled its interest.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> has fallen on hard times again because the weak dollar
and a luxury car sales slump have hurt its crucial <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales. It's
looking for a linkup that would give it the technology and
financial resources to expand its line of cars to become more
competitive.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> is vulnerable because it has a small product range _ it
produces 50,000 XJ6 and Series III sedans, XJS sports cars and
limousines a year _ and it needs to invest heavily to modernize.
   ``We have talked to large number of companies over the past 18
months,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Arnold Bolton</PERSON>.
   What makes <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> attractive is that it is one of the last
independent luxury marks available. Hollywood stars such as the
late <PERSON>Clark Gable</PERSON> and modern royalty including Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> have
owned <ORGANIZATION>Jaguars</ORGANIZATION>, which are loaded with luxurious touches such as
leather upholstery and walnut paneling.
   A major auto maker risks hurting <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s cachet if it takes
over the British company entirely, said <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON>, the analyst. But it
also risks making a poor return on its investment if it doesn't,
and only takes a stake, he said.
   ``There is a danger that you destroy the thing that sells the
cars if you try and make this part of an international group,''
<PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> said.
   ``A lot of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> sales are based on it being a traditional,
sporting gentleman's car and being English. This is a fashion
industry. <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> is the Burberry of the car industry.''
   The best strategy, <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> said, is to expand <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> into
``BMW-type territory.'' But that would require a huge investment in
plant and equipment, he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> was launched in <DATE>1922</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>Swallow Sidecar Co.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Blackpool</LOCATION>. Swallow introduced its first car in <DATE>1927</DATE>, and a year
later moved to <LOCATION>Coventry</LOCATION>, the center of the British car industry, 95
miles northwest of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   It produced a line of SS cars in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and changed its name
to <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar Cars Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> at the end of World War II. In <DATE>1968</DATE>, it became
a part of the state automaker British Leyland.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> fared badly under state stewardship. It suffered an
after-tax loss of <MONEY>$84 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and developed a poor
reputation for quality control.
   <PERSON>Egan</PERSON>, who took over nine years ago, is largely credited with
turning <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> around by cutting costs, more than tripling
production per worker and expanding sales in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far
East</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> was being hailed as a prime example of a successful
privatization, along with <ORGANIZATION>British Airways PLC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Steel PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> remained overly dependent on the extremely
competitive <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market, where it still sells <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of its
cars, and it was clobbered when the dollar and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> luxury car
sales slumped.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s after-tax profit peaked at <MONEY>$141 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. It
sank to <MONEY>$99 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE> and then to <MONEY>$46 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE> on
revenue of <MONEY>$1.07 billion</MONEY>. Analysts are expecting <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to lose
money in <DATE>1989</DATE>.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Are company cars a waste of money? -
With a new tax system for business drivers imminent, Scheherazade Daneshkhu
examines the impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should you keep your company car? The question arises because a new system
of taxing the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s 1.8m company car drivers will come into force from next
month.
The old scale charges, based on three engine-size bands and two price
'thresholds,' will disappear. Under the simpler replacement system, tax will
be paid on a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's list price when new,
plus any extras and value added tax.
The new system - detailed by <PERSON>Norman Lamont</PERSON>, the former chancellor of the
exchequer, in his <DATE>March 1993</DATE> Budget - is aimed at ending distortions in the
new car market. The government has said that, on average, the amount raised
will be the same as under the old system, although some people will pay more
and others less.
Most pay-as-you-earn employees will not be able to tell from their tax code
if they are better or worse off because most are based on the old system.
The Inland Revenue says this is because list prices have not been submitted
by employers. Codes taking the new tax system into account will have the
word 'new' alongside the car benefit figure.
If the old system works to your advantage, it is unlikely you will be in a
hurry to have your code changed; otherwise, you or your employer should
contact the Revenue with the list price of the company car to have the code
revised as soon as possible.
How will the new
system work?
The amount on which you will pay tax at your marginal rate is 35 per cent of
the list price of the car the day before it was registered; this price must
include VAT, delivery charges, and any accessories of Pounds 100 and over.
The price is capped at Pounds 80,000, so that cars with a list price above
this amount will be taxed as though the price had been Pounds 80,000.
Drivers covering 2,500-17,999 business miles will have a reduction of a
third on their assessment, while those covering more than 18,000 will
receive a discount of two-thirds.
If your company car is four or more years old at the end of the tax year,
there will be a further one-third reduction on the figure after deductions
for business mileage.
The rules differ for classic cars or those without a list price. If a car is
15 years old or more at the end of the tax year, or has a market value of
Pounds 15,000 or more (which is higher than the manufacturer's list price
when the car was first registered), the price for tax purposes will be the
open market value of the car and its accessories.
Fuel provided for private use will be taxed on the basis of the car's engine
size and whether it is petrol or diesel-powered. But there is no tax if you
pay for private motoring fuel yourself.
You can also reduce your tax bill if you contribute towards the cost of the
car or its accessories to a maximum of Pounds 5,000 (including VAT).
<PERSON>Kevin Paterson</PERSON>, of accountant <ORGANIZATION>Ernst &amp; Young</ORGANIZATION>, says the new system throws up
some unfair anomolies. If it had been operating <DATE>last year</DATE>, two drivers doing
the same business mileage in a <ORGANIZATION>Ford Mondeo</ORGANIZATION> 1.8LX, one taking delivery in
<DATE>March</DATE> and the other in <DATE>June</DATE>, would have faced a Pounds 400 difference in
their car benefit charge.
This is because <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> changed the list price of the car at least twice in the
year.
Who will benefit?
Table 1 shows how to calculate if you will gain under the new rules. First,
identify into which of the five brackets your car falls under the old
system, based on its cost when new and its cylinder capacity.
Then, compare your car's list price to the break-even list price shown in
the first column. If the list price is greater than the break-even figure,
you are a loser; if it is less, you are a winner.
For example, all drivers of two-litre cars costing less than Pounds 19,250
will be hit if the list price of their car is greater than Pounds 12,814.
A survey released this week by <ORGANIZATION>WF Corroon</ORGANIZATION>, an actuarial and benefits
consultancy, found that middle managers driving mostly Fords, Vauxhalls and
Rovers costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600 would lose the most
under the new system, with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra tax.
Corroon's <PERSON>Ian Morgan</PERSON> said: 'Chairmen, chief executives and managing
directors who drive mainly <ORGANIZATION>Jaguars</ORGANIZATION>, BMWs and Mercedes, costing between
Pounds 28,000 and Pounds 39,000, are affected less, with about one in three
having to pay a higher tax bill and the remainder paying less.'
Table 2 shows the change to your tax bill if you drive one of the 20 cars
listed. Drivers of very expensive cars face the heftiest increase, while
those with the cheapest listed will see a fall.
There are some oddities caused by the way the old scale charges were
calculated. The driver of a <ORGANIZATION>Ford Granada</ORGANIZATION> 2.0i Ghia with a list price of
Pounds 19,150 will have to pay an extra Pounds 591 (on the assumptions
stated in the table).
But the driver of a <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> 9000 <ORGANIZATION>CSE</ORGANIZATION> 2.0i with a list price of Pounds 20,245
will see a fall of Pounds 594. This is because of the difference in the old
scale charge for the two cars.
'In general, the losers are those drivers who chose cars at the top of the
old bands,' says <PERSON>Paterson</PERSON>.
How to decide between
keeping the car or taking cash
Many company car drivers will have made this choice already, especially
after scale charges were raised by <MONEY>8 per cent</MONEY> for the 1993-94 tax year.
Calculating whether you would be worse or better off is difficult because it
is hard to put a price on the convenience factor of driving a company car.
If it breaks down or is involved in an accident, you do not have the bother
of arranging a replacement or negotiating with the insurance company. And,
if the insurance premium goes up because of an accident, you do not have to
pay the increase.
'Perks' drivers who do not clock 2,500 business miles will pay
proportionately the largest amount of tax, since they will not benefit from
the discounts. If you are such a driver but must have a car, it might still
be more cost-effective to have a cheaper company one.
<PERSON>Maurice Fitzpatrick</PERSON>, of accountant Chantrey Vellacott, says that if you
forego the company car to take a salary increase instead (based on the
amount the employer saves by not providing you with a car), and then buy the
same car, you will be neither better nor worse off as a result.
But, he adds, you are likely to see a benefit by taking 'an increased salary
and then running a smaller car or one which does not fit the employer's
policy.'
<PERSON>Nilesh Shah</PERSON>, tax partner at accountant <PERSON>Blick Rothenberg</PERSON>, says most employees
driving a car with a retail price of Pounds 18,500, and doing more than
18,000 business miles, will do better to keep it since the taxable benefit
is reduced by two-thirds.
Shah adds that if you do decide to hand in the company car (or to buy it off
your employer at a favourable second-hand rate) and claim business mileage
on your own vehicle instead, be sure to negotiate the rate beforehand to
make sure depreciation is taken into account.
Another option is to switch to a company car with a cheaper list price or to
retain the company car if it is four years old. 'If the list price was
Pounds 10,000 in <DATE>1989</DATE>, one-third of the value would be deducted because the
car is four years old,' says <PERSON>Fitzpatrick</PERSON>. 'The 35 per cent car benefit
charge would, therefore, be levied on Pounds 6,666.
'The same car new would probably cost about Pounds 13,000, taking inflation
into account, and the 35 per cent tax will be based on that amount. You have
almost doubled your tax bill as a result of having a new company car.'
Other ways of reducing the tax bill are to keep an eye on the number of
accessories in the car, especially if you do not have it for the whole of
the tax year. 'While the car benefit charge is reduced proportionately if
the car is unavailable for part of the year, the same principle does not
apply to accessories,' says <PERSON>Paterson</PERSON>. 'Accessories fitted part-way through
the year increase the car price for the complete tax year and subsequent
years.'
A number of organisations will calculate if retaining a company car is worth
your while. London-based accountant <ORGANIZATION>Kingston Smith</ORGANIZATION> charges Pounds 25 while
<ORGANIZATION>Wheawill &amp; Sudworth</ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> accountant, will run the calculations
through a computer without charge.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (1): Thinking the unthinkable -
Upheavals in the industry come at a time when, as recession grips much of
continental Europe, the flamboyance of the 1980s is being replaced by a more
low-key, sober approach to motoring. This is affecting both design and
engineering

<TEXT>
THE map of the world's executive and luxury car industry is being re-drawn.
In the process, and sometimes to the dismay of die-hard traditionalist
customers, some of the taboos which have determined parts of the industry's
structure for many years are being dismantled.
The re-drawing is most apparent in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, the world's biggest single
executive and luxury car market, where Japanese manufacturers have captured
nearly one third of the sector in less than six years with marques such as
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti and <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s Acura.
The European executive specialist manufacturers such as <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, who once dominated this part of the market, now control only one
fifth.
The competitiveness of the German manufacturers, in particular, has been hit
hard by the strength of the D-Mark and spiralling wage and social costs
which have left <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> by far the most expensive country in which to
produce cars in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
So, in moves which might have been unthinkable to many industry observers in
the car industry boom years of the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>, German manufacturers are
moving out of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> announced that its next new production
facility would be in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, to build a new sporty car at a volume
of up to 90,000 a year.
At the beginning of <DATE>April</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> announced that it intended to build
a Dollars 300m plant, also in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, to produce a four-wheel-drive sports
utility vehicle at a rate of up to 60,000 vehicles a year, beginning in
<DATE>1997</DATE>.
Such moves are the German makers' main hope of narrowing what they
acknowledge to be the big production costs gap between them and Japanese
rivals, even allowing for the occasional accusation against the Japanese of
dumping.
According to <PERSON>Mr Helmut Werner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>' vice-chairman, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> plant's
production costs should be 30 per cent lower than those of its European
facilities - and will also reduce the impact of currency fluctuations. Not
least, the learning experience should help prepare it for the time when - as
is regarded as inevitable - the Japanese manufacturers move into the
European luxury car market in earnest.
However, in <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>' case the re-drawn map includes much more than plant
locations. The company, says <PERSON>Mr Werner</PERSON>, is to transform itself from luxury
carmaker into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality
vehicles in all segments of the market'. Thus, before <DATE>this decade</DATE> is out,
there is to be a 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
four-wheel-drive machine and even a small 'city' car as well as its current
three-model conventional car line-up.
In an astonishing admission, he asserts that the current cars are
'over-engineered' - a practice which, if continued, would price Mercedes out
of its markets.
The breaking of old taboos is not confined to the German industry: <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>,
the loss-making luxury car subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, has been helped by sterling
devaluation since <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> withdrawal. But <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>, too, faces possibly
substantial change which is fundamentally cost-driven.
The old idea that a 'proper' <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> could never be built anywhere but
<ORGANIZATION>Coventry</ORGANIZATION> is already being eroded by the prospect of future engines coming
from <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s Bridgend plant in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>. Yet more trauma-inducing for the
traditionalists, the smaller <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> planned for the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> is expected
to share the floor pan of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s 'world car' replacement for the current
<LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION>.
These upheavals come at a time when, as recession has tightened its grip on
large swathes of continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the flamboyance of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> is
disappearing, replaced by a more low-key, sober approach to motoring which
is affecting both design and engineering.
Greater concern with economy and the environment is reflected in surging
sales of diesel cars. They are both 'cleaner' in terms of their exhaust
gases and much more economical than petrol engines of similar power.
Hitherto regarded in markets such as the UK as appropriate more to
high-mileage utilitarian than executive cars, the picture is about to change
with the launch in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s first diesel cars in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
The old axiom that 'safety does not sell' is also under challenge as never
before.
An increasing proportion of manufacturers' promotion of their products is
being allocated to safety features rather than performance or styling. One
of the main planks of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s advertising for its new Mondeo 'world car' is
the standard fitting of driver airbags to all models.
Mercedes and other manufacturers are now in a race to develop the first
commercial airbags to protect passengers in side collisions.
German manufacturers of executive cars, in particular, believe they must
broaden their market presence to survive - thus <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> is planning a new
'entry level' <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>, the 50, which will be little more expensive than a
well-equipped Golf. As well as the Mercedes small car, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> has been
investigating the production of a 'city car', a concept for which, the Z13,
was shown at the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> motor show.
At the other extreme, <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> will take the industry into a new era of
technology from next year when it launches a new V8-engined flagship with
its main body structures made from aluminium, not steel.
The car will mark the first use of aluminium body assembly systems which, in
future, may lend themselves to high-volume production of lightweight,
energy-efficient and easily recyclable cars.
Old customer allegiances are fading; replaced by a greater willingness to
sample a variety of manufacturers' wares.
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> is considering joining <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and Mercedes in production on the American
continent although it may opt not to set up in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> but to extend its
existing assembly facilities in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. Not to do so could leave <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> at a
significant disadvantage vis-a-vis other manufacturers, particularly
Japanese, who have already opted for sites within the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free
Trade Area</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>).
'To be successful in the world a company has to be successful in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,'
declared <PERSON>Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, when he broke ground
late last year for the company's new Dollars 400m plant in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
Increased competition is not just coming from the Japanese, however. <ORGANIZATION>General
Motors</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> have also begun to enjoy a product revival in the
executive and luxury sectors, while the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s own competitive position is
being increased through the long-standing collaboration between <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> and
Rover bearing increasing fruit. This month, Rover unveiled its long-awaited
Rover 600 range, the Cowley-built version of <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s Swindon-built Accord,
with which both are making a significant assault on the middle-range
executive car market.
The cars look different but have the same engines and gearboxes and mostly
shared components.
For Rover, they represent the biggest step yet in its drive to transform
itself into a producer of premium upmarket models capable of competing with
the likes of <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> and with a similar production level of about
500,000 units a year.
The benefits of the relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> go beyond technology and
resources. 'We have acquired an insight into Japanese best practice and
processes,' says <PERSON>Mr George Simpson</PERSON>, Rover's chairman, who maintains that it
opens the way to significant cost reductions in every area of the business.
In continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, where Rover has started a dealership expansion
programme despite recession, the 600 is being promoted as a head-on rival to
<ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s 3-Series and <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>'s 80 and <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>' 190 models.
A side-effect of the cold climate for the German industry is increasing
collaboration between its manufacturers.
For example, towards the end of this year <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> will launch an Audi-badged
sports model built in collaboration with <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>, the deeply-troubled luxury
sports car maker. The deal, inspired by <PERSON>Mr Ferdinand Piech</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> group
chief executive who is also a member of the family which controls <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>,
is aimed at helping underpin loss-making <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>'s finances while giving
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> an image lift.
Even Mercedes-Benz and <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> have been discussing possible collaboration on
parts manufacture, according to <PERSON>Mr Werner</PERSON>. Hitherto, each has remained among
the most determinedly independent and vertically integrated of all the
world's car companies.
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> exemplifies some of the troubles of the German industry. It fell into
loss in <DATE>this year's first quarter</DATE> and slashed production by more than 40 per
cent in order to reduce its backlog of unsold vehicles. Total sales in the
period were down by about one third. <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION>, which includes also SEAT of
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and Skoda of <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, made a net loss of DM1.25bn (Pounds 515m)
in its most recent quarter.
However, with costs being cut extensively - about 12 per cent of the 37,000
workforce is expected to go by the end of this year - <PERSON>Mr Piech</PERSON> maintains
that <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> should be profitable for the year as a whole.
The effects of achieving this goal are likely to be felt throughout
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s extensive motor components supply industry. Suppliers are being
asked to cut their prices by 5 per cent on average this year, with cuts of
up to 10 per cent being required in some cases.
German suppliers, who contribute about 90 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>'s parts, do not
only face price cuts, however. They are also exposed to loss of business as
a matter of policy by <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>, which is embarking on a programme of global
component sourcing to help it escape German manufacturing costs.
Helping it along the way is the group's new purchasing director, <PERSON>Mr Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua</PERSON>, former head of purchasing at <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, who
revolutionised <ORGANIZATION>GM Europe</ORGANIZATION>'s supply chain to give it the most competitive
purchasing cost base of any European producer - and who was doing the same
thing for <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> when he was poached by <ORGANIZATION>VW</ORGANIZATION> after a bizarre
tug-of-war between the two big manufacturers.
But <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>'s subdued outlook is of the kind that <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> might envy. Riven by
management disputes last year which saw the departure of <PERSON>Mr Arno Bohn</PERSON>, chief
executive, <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> plunged into a DM120m loss in the first half of its
financial year and has warned that sales and profits will be down
significantly for the full year ending <DATE>July</DATE>.
It is a measure of the extent of <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION>'s decline that this year it expects
to produce only 15,000-17,000 cars, less than one third of its mid-1980s
levels. <PERSON>Mr Wendelin Wiedeking</PERSON>, appointed chief executive in <DATE>September</DATE>,
insists, however, that new models due to be launched over the next two years
will see demand for its products back up to 30,000-plus a year from <DATE>1996</DATE>
onwards.
He also maintains that widely-expressed doubts about whether <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> can
retain its independence are unjustified.
He has a point: <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> is privately owned by two extremely wealthy
families, the Porsches and the Piechs, and the company was debt-free and
harbouring net cash of DM600m at last financial year's end. It can soldier
on for several more years yet, either to a new model-led revival or until
the families feel the competitive pressures are such that the game is no
longer worth the candle.
Not only the German industry is suffering. <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish car maker
jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, is receiving its second
capital injection in two years against a background of four years of
consecutive losses. Its fate will depend heavily on the successor to its 900
model, to be launched later this year. <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania</ORGANIZATION> has hinted that it will
be reluctant to provide further finance.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (26): Age of the city car is
about to dawn - The Car of the Future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most of us, the name <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> evokes images of large luxury cars.
Yet one of the most significant potential trends for cars of the future is
that <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> will unveil a concept car smaller than a <ORGANIZATION>Ford Fiesta</ORGANIZATION> at the
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> motor show this week, and that the ideas it incorporates will
provide the basis for a production Mercedes of the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE>.
The age of the 'city' car - small, light, miserly on fuel or alternatively
using electrical energy - appears to be about to dawn in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
The Twingo runabout from <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION>, and the Polish-built Cinquecento from
<ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>, have already given renewed momentum to the European market for very
small cars - a market all but ignored during the economic boom years of the
<DATE>1980s</DATE>. (The sector is long-established in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, where there is a
flourishing market for 'microcars' specifically designed for urban use.)
Current cars, however, are equated with cheapness and utility. Mercedes'
model, which in concept form is called the Vision A 93, should show, once
and for all, whether the 'city' car concept can be satisfactorily taken
'up-market.'
Rapidly increasing urban traffic congestion, concern about the pollution
thus caused, and even the prospect of city centres being closed to all but
electric cars or other very 'clean' alternatives have been driving factors
behind the development of the 'Vision' - together with <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>' own
acknowledged need to find commercially attractive new market sectors.
But Mercedes is not alone. <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> has produced a three-seater prototype of its
own, the Z13. <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> will start production of its city car, the <LOCATION>Chico</LOCATION>,
in <DATE>1995</DATE>, and many other manufacturers have similar projects in development.
<ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>'s Z13 is more obviously a 'city only' car than the Mercedes. It has been
designed and developed mainly for driver-only operation; it is powered by a
1.1 litre motorcycle engine mounted at the rear with a continuously variable
automatic transmission. The driver is seated centrally, with two full-sized
seats for possible passengers set back slightly on either side.
The Vision has been designed as a four-seater and is intended to be usable
on longer journeys. With impact safety in mind, the engine - petrol, diesel
or battery-powered electric - is located centrally under the passenger
compartment.
Importantly, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> claims that the petrol and diesel engines would both
qualify as 'ultra-low emissions vehicles' under <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s draconian clean
air regulations, and the electric version would qualify as a 'zero emissions
vehicle' (ZEV). Starting in <DATE>1998</DATE>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will require 2 per cent of a
manufacturer's total car sales to be of ZEVs, rising to 10 per cent by the
year 2010, if the manufacturer wants to go on selling its vehicles in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s 1m-plus annual new car market.
Both the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and the Mercedes models would have in common in their bodies
the extensive use of aluminium, seeking the lightness needed for good fuel
economy from small capacity power units, or in compensation for the weight
of the air conditioning, mobile telephone, navigation system and fax - all
considered as possible de rigeur fitments for cars towards the end of the
<DATE>1990s</DATE>.
Not surprisingly, aluminium producers are watching these developments with
the closest interest: it now looks increasingly likely that the material
will have a much expanded use in the car of the future.
Aluminium's attractions are obvious: it is extremely light and much easier
and cheaper to shape than steel. On the other hand it is more easily
damaged; it is more difficult to weld than steel; and it requires a great
deal of energy to produce, so it is a good deal more expensive.
In terms of total energy requirement, however, its exceptional capacity to
be recycled works in its favour in the long term. Smaller, lighter engines,
gearboxes, driveshafts and other mechanical components can be used.
So far, aluminium has provided the main bodywork only for expensive, limited
production cars such as <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>NSX</ORGANIZATION> sports car. But the next
substantive move towards wider adoption by vehicle manufacturers is
imminent, within the next few months, with the launch by <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> of its
replacement for the V8 saloon and which will have an aluminium chassis.
The car will mark the culmination of an ll-year collaborative project
between <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Aluminium Company of America</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION>). It required not only
the development of new alloys with the required crash protection properties,
but also new production processes. The car will have a skeleton-like
spaceframe made up of about 100 robotically welded pressings - about one
third the number required in a steel-bodied car.
The partners' faith in the future of aluminium for the motor industry is
such that <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION> has built a Dollars 70m facility at <LOCATION>Soest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, to make
the spaceframes - and to offer its services to other vehicle makers.
However, the material is not yet a candidate for cheaper, very high volume
production cars; at present the process is cost-effective only for
production runs of up to 100,000 cars a year.
But the revival of interest is aluminium is causing a certain amount of
wariness at some large chemical groups such as Dow and <ORGANIZATION>DuPont</ORGANIZATION>, which have
large plastic composites interests. For much of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> it appeared that
plastic composites could emerge as stronger, non-rusting rivals to metal for
the load bearing main structure of a car. Complexity and recycling
difficulties make this a more distant prospect, although the use of plastics
continues to increase steadily in other non-stress bearing applications.
With or without aluminium, 'downsizing' of cars is occurring across most
vehicle sectors as sophisticatedcomputer aided design and manufacturing
systems allow much better packaging of mechanical components, thus leaving
more room for occupants.
Mercedes is even investigating ways of making its top-range 'S' class models
appear smaller, following criticisms in some sections of the press that it
seems too much of an environmentally-unfriendly leviathan.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to acquire closely held <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the British maker of ultraluxury cars. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Newport Pagnell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, produces fewer than 200 cars a year, with prices ranging from <MONEY>$145,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$170,000</MONEY>. 
The company has only 400 employees. 

   With the acquisition, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> joins the other members of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Big Three, in buying a European auto maker specializing in limited production of extremely expensive cars. 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> last year purchased <ORGANIZATION>Group Lotus PLC</ORGANIZATION>, another British company, while <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> recently acquired <ORGANIZATION>Nuova Automobili F. Lamborghini S.p.A.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, which makes 400 cars a year with price tags about same as <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin's</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies say they can benefit from the engineering expertise of such specialty car makers, while also providing capital to allow the European concerns to boost production and develop future models. 

   <PERSON>Kenneth Whipple</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, made those points in yesterday's announcement. 
"Ford involvement will allow <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> to expand its production capabilities and fully pursue future product programs," <PERSON>Mr. Whipple</PERSON> said. 
"For <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, it is an opportunity to enter the high-image, specialty market, where <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> has earned an outstanding reputation." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Whipple</PERSON> also said that <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> will "retain its individual character, identity and present management." 
<PERSON>Victor Gauntlett</PERSON> will continue as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in <DATE>1919</DATE>. 

   Last year <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> made an unsuccessful effort to enter the European luxury market, although in a niche well below <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin's</ORGANIZATION>. 
Ford bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Alfa Romeo S.p.A.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, which makes more cars than <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION>, but sells them for less than <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Fiat S.p.A.</ORGANIZATION> convinced the Italian government, which held a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Alfa Romeo</ORGANIZATION>, that <ORGANIZATION>Alfa</ORGANIZATION> would best be left in Italian hands. 
The government sold its <ORGANIZATION>Alfa</ORGANIZATION> stake to <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> currently sells three models in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- the <LOCATION>Volante</LOCATION>, the Vantage and the <LOCATION>Lagonda</LOCATION>. 
In addition, in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> it sells the <LOCATION>Saloon</LOCATION>. 
All four are equipped with V-8 engines. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that each <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> vehicle is in production for 16 weeks, during which it gets 20 coats of hand-rubbed paint. 
By comparison, two to three coats are standard for most cars. 
The production rate is five a week -- equivalent to about five minutes of production at a typical <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> plant. 

   Aston Martin models have been driven by secret agent <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> in many of the Bond movies. 
In the latest Bond film, "The Living Daylights," the agent drives a <DATE>1987</DATE> Volante.

   <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it has raised prices on its
imported <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> cars an average <PERCENT>4.6 percent</PERCENT> over
comparably equipped <DATE>1987</DATE> models.
   The new prices, announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, also were higher in most
cases than tentative prices used since the model year began in
<DATE>October</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Karen Stewart</PERSON>.
   The increases followed a debate between <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> and various
Japanese automakers in which <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> charged the Japanese
companies may be dumping cars and trucks on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market.
   Dumping is selling foreign products here for less than in their
home market.
   Chrysler has maintained the Japanese companies probably haven't
increased prices enough to reflect the dramatic jump in the value
of the Japanese yen against the dollar in the past two years.
   The dumping debate heated up at news conferences preceding <DATE>last
weekend</DATE>'s opening of the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Auto Show, where <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> also
introduced a new Japanese car, the Mitsubishi-built Eagle Summit,
for its Jeep-Eagle lineup.
   <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON>Robert McCurry</PERSON> charged
that if the Japanese were dumping, so were the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automakers who
sell imported Japanese cars under their own nameplates.
   Of the Big Three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automakers, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> is the most dependent
on Japanese imports. About <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> of its cars and <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of
its light trucks are built by <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   McCurry also said <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Motors
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> were charging less for imported Japanese cars sold under
American nameplates than were Japanese companies who made the cars.
   At the prices announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, a base <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION> Colt two-door
hatchback will start at <MONEY>$5,998</MONEY>, down from <MONEY>$6,005</MONEY> for a comparable
<DATE>1987</DATE> model and up from the tentative <DATE>1988</DATE> price of <MONEY>$5,899</MONEY>.
   At the other extreme, the base price on the sporty <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler
Conquest TSi</ORGANIZATION> coupe rose to <MONEY>$18,683</MONEY> from <MONEY>$18,005</MONEY> on a comparable
<DATE>1987</DATE> model and up from the tentative <DATE>1988</DATE> price of <MONEY>$18,155</MONEY>, <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>
said.
   <PERSON>Chris Cedergren</PERSON>, industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power and Associates</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Agoura</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, said Japanese automakers have held down prices
on their entry-level cars and made up the difference on
higher-priced models.
   Automakers value entry-level buyers because of the chance they
will become loyal customers and buy more expensive cars from the
same company later.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Management: Are you driving a good bargain? - John Griffiths
answers questions on company cars raised by tax changes in this month's UK
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q: A new system for taxing company cars comes into effect from <DATE>April 6 1994</DATE>.
What are its most significant features?
A: The most significant is that the amount of tax paid by individuals on
their company car will be based wholly on a percentage of the manufacturer's
'list' price, or recommended retail price. The current system comprises five
scale charge bands, at the lower end of which are three determined by engine
size with the other two - for executive and luxury cars - defined by the
original market value of the car. These will remain in place during the
financial year 1993-94.
As a result of the change there will no longer be any benefit to an employee
if his or her company negotiates a discount with the manufacturer (a common
practice at the moment which can help put the car into a cheaper scale
charge band).
Under the new rules an individual will pay tax on 35 per cent, 23.3 per cent
or 11.2 per cent of a car's list price, depending on whether he or she
covers less than 2,500 business miles, 2,500 to 18,000, or more than 18,000
miles respectively.
This plays havoc with the tax bills of distinct categories of drivers who
are clearly under-taxed at the moment. Most notable are executives driving
well-equipped cars with prices deliberately pitched just below the current
price band thresholds of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the
scale charge rises significantly. There are estimated to be several hundred
thousand drivers of these 'tax break specials'.
Currently they pay the same scale charge as someone driving a basic, 1.6
litre 'sales rep' car costing Pounds 7,000 less. This is because the lower
bands - under 1.4 litres, 1.4 to <MONEY>2 litres</MONEY> and over <MONEY>2 litres</MONEY> - are based
solely on engine size. It is these drivers who face scale charge increases
of up to 60 per cent under the list price system and for whom, says <PERSON>Brian
Friedman</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Stoy Benefit Consulting</ORGANIZATION>, 'a cash alternative
will now be a lot more attractive'.
Q: We have delayed replacing our company cars because of recession but many
are now high mileage and will have to be changed during <DATE>1993-94</DATE>, when the
current banded scale charge system will still apply. What pitfalls should we
look out for in replacing these cars? Are there some cars which, though
currently tax effective, would incur significant penalties - for employer or
employee - under the new system?
A: Executives driving 'tax break specials' should think hard about whether
the perceived status of their existing cars is worth the substantial extra
tax penalty involved from next year.
What these charges will be can be seen in the two right-hand graphs, which
plot the incoming list price system against 1993-94 scale charge bands for
drivers in the 'perk' car category (under 2,500 business miles) and for the
majority of company car drivers, namely those covering between 2,500 and
18,000 business miles. (Mileage bands will be carried over from the current
system.) For example, a driver who runs a Pounds 19,000 car, under 2 litres,
will have to trade down to a car costing around Pounds 12,500 if he wishes
to avoid an increased tax bill.
Companies should clearly encourage this sort of reassessment, because the
lower the list price the lower the company's own costs, including pro rata
<ORGANIZATION>National Insurance Contribution</ORGANIZATION> reductions.
There is, incidentally, no tax advantage in buying a nearly new car of high
specification instead of a cheaper new one; the new legislation taxes cars
up to four years old in the same way as new ones.
Nor is there much point in hoping for change in succeeding Budgets. A basic
requirement of the new system was that it should be self-adjusting, thus
ending for the motor industry those traditional pre-Budget sales droughts
caused by uncertainty. As list prices drift up post-1994, percentage scale
charges will automatically drift up with them.
At the top of the market - cars above Pounds 40,000 - there is nothing but
misery in store for drivers and manufacturers. <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> is already
appealing to the government to 'cap' the scale charge above a certain price
level. It is not hard to see why: the scale charge for 1993-94 on a 'perk'
user of a car costing more than Pounds 29,000 will be Pounds 15,060, no
matter how expensive it is. From 1994-95 the scale charge on a Pounds
100,000 Rolls will be Pounds 35,000.
Critics say the new system could destroy the 'supercar' market embodied by
vehicles such as <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s Pounds 415,000 XJ220, which will incur a scale
charge of nearly Pounds 150,000 as a 'perk'.
Q: Is the new system likely to affect the structure of the new car market,
in particular prices and their rate of increase?
A: According to <PERSON>Garel Rhys</PERSON>, professor of motor industry economics at <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff
Business School</ORGANIZATION>, the new system could strike 'a bigger blow for the
convergence of car prices in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> than anything the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> has done'.
Under the current banding system, whether the employer has obtained a
discount on car purchases has not mattered much to drivers of cheaper
company car drivers because their tax scale charge is determined by engine
capacity. 'Tax break special' drivers have usually benefited, in that a
discount may have helped squeeze a car into a lower tax band.
But because the <DATE>1994</DATE> scheme will be based strictly on published list prices,
ignoring all discounts, employees and employers will for the first time have
a united interest in seeing list prices kept as low as possible. Inevitably
this will strengthen the current trend towards lower dealer margins -
<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION>, Rover and latterly <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> have cut their dealers' margins
to 10 per cent on some models, from the usual <DATE>16-17</DATE> per cent. Their scope
for haggling will be reduced.
But analysts such as <PERSON>Stewart Whyte</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Fleet Audits Consultancy</ORGANIZATION>
and spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>500-member Association of Car Fleet Operators</ORGANIZATION>, are
united in thinking it will also change the structure of manufacturers'
product offerings and mark the return of cheap 'no-frills' cars, devoid of
any extras, which were once the hallmark of the UK 'reps' car market of the
<DATE>1960s</DATE>.
Q: We are considering 'buying out' our company cars with the offer of a cash
alternative. What factors need to be taken into account in arriving at a
fair valuation? Are there general guidelines or does each employee's
circumstances need to be taken into account?
A: The main cost ingredients of running a car, for both company and private
motorist, are set out in the top left-hand chart. The buy-out decision
requires complex calculations involving variables such as the mix of
business mileage to private, cost of finance, foregone interest, mileage
rate for use of private car on business.
Just how difficult even some of the most sophisticated companies have found
it to calculate cash compensation can be seen in the wide variation in
valuations contained in the other table.
A number of tax consultancies have recently developed complex computer
models for making these evaluations. But the cost of running a company's
entire fleet through them could be substantial.
Q: This has been a harsh recession in which thousands of companies have
closed and nearly 2m jobs lost. Our employees are lucky to be in work. Why
shouldn't we get rid of 'perk' cars with no, or only partial, compensation?
A: In most cases, the right to a car of a certain specification is likely to
be contained in contracts of employment. Its withdrawal without agreed
compensation would represent a change in terms and conditions of employment
tantamount to constructive dismissal. Receivers remain bemused by how many
companies are still going under with uncut, self-indulgent car fleets.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. had to stop building its
most expensive car, the $64,138 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, for
three and a half months while engineers tracked a flaw that
caused some of the 370 horsepower engines in the cars to
self-destruct, company officials confirmed yesterday.
   The ZR1, nicknamed "King of the Hill," has been the object
of considerable hyperbole from GM's Chevrolet division and
the automotive press. Car and Driver magazine called the ZR1
the "Corvette from Hell. . . so good it's scary." And dealers
cheerfully accepted offers well above sticker price from
collectors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ZR1 costs <MONEY>$31,683</MONEY> more than the <MONEY>$32,455</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Corvette</ORGANIZATION>.
That's mainly because of the ZR1's 32-valve, eight-cylinder
aluminum engine, which can fling the car from 0 to 60 miles
per hour in just 4.3 seconds. The regular <ORGANIZATION>Corvette</ORGANIZATION> has a cast
iron eight-cylinder engine that produces 245 horsepower and
takes an additional 1.4 seconds to get from 0 to 60 miles per
hour.
   But in <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> officials quietly halted production
and sales of the car, after a vexing engine problem surfaced.
The company resumed building and selling the cars last month.
   Engineers found the problem in a defectively manufactured
camshaft, the component that regulates fuel flow into the
engine. The defect caused the engines to overheat and
ultimately "seize," a <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. In other
words, the engines self-destructed.
   Chevrolet officials say they checked an entire batch of
500 ZR1 engines manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Marine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Stillwater</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Okla</LOCATION>. They found 17 engines with the problem, which they
dismantled in their search for the solution.
   But more importantly, <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> officials say, none of the
defective engines got into the hands of buyers. "I guess the
proof of the pudding is that there haven't turned out to be
any more problems," the <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.
   Analysts say Chevrolet handled the ZR1 problem well by
halting sales and production until they fixed it. "This is a
sign of how customer-driven manufacturers have become," says
<PERSON>Chris Cedergren</PERSON>, an industry expert with the <LOCATION>Agoura Hills</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>. "Things have
radically changed from 10 or 15 years ago" when manufacturers
might sell the cars anyway and later try to fix problems at
dealerships, he said.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Corvette</ORGANIZATION> customers may still end up paying more than
the sticker price. Production cutbacks caused a shortage of
ZR1s, which is likely to encourage dealers to demand high
prices, <PERSON>Mr. Cedergren</PERSON> says.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (18): Lure of the feel-good factor
 -How They Go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE simple answer to the question 'How do the latest cars go?' is: at least
as well as cars of twice their price 15 years ago.
Giant strides have been made in improving the refinement and ride comfort,
safety and sheer easy driveability of the medium-sized and medium-priced
car. So much so that the executive car costing less than Pounds 20,000 is
now so good that company car users demanding better must be more concerned
with status than with the practicalities of business motoring.
It is no exaggeration to say that today's superminis such as the <ORGANIZATION>Nissan
Micra</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Corsa</ORGANIZATION> are the equal of yesterday's small-medium cars in
everything but bulk. Much the same comment applies to the small-medium cars
 -such as the Rover 200-400, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Escort-Orion</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Citroen</ORGANIZATION> ZX-Peugeot 306 and
<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Astra</ORGANIZATION> - and the modestly-priced larger models from the high-volume
producers, such as the <ORGANIZATION>Citroen Xantia</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Mondeo</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Primera</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION>
405, Rover 600, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Carina E</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Cavalier</ORGANIZATION>.
In fact, the latest crop of new models is so good one almost has to nit-pick
to find fault. It is true that the Mondeo's ride deteriorates slightly as
one moves up range and the tyres become wider and squatter - but the upside
is handling and cornering of a standard confined to high-performing sports
cars not long ago.
The performance, refinement and comfort of cars in the size and price
classes of the Mondeo must inevitably encourage some user-choosers to trade
down and reduce the tax man's take. For example, the latest <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall
Cavalier</ORGANIZATION> automatic with a 2.5-litre, V6 engine, or a two-pedal Rover 623GSi,
both way below a Pounds 20,000 list price, would probably please any Senator
or 820i user untroubled by loss of perceived status.
The slow but inexorable move towards diesels in company fleets - and
pressure on executives to follow suit - need bring no loss of motoring
enjoyment. The latest turbocharged and intercooled diesel cars such as the
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 80 and 100, Rover 825, <ORGANIZATION>Citroen XM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> 605 - not to mention the
BMWs due here in the very near future - are light years away from the
sluggish diesels of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and early <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
Although they are still more noisy at start-up than petrol cars, they cruise
on motorways in near silence, have lively acceleration and need tanking up
at much greater intervals.
Although the forthcoming abandonment of the over-1,999cc tax barrier on
company cars removes some of their raison d'etre, the just-under-2-litre
petrol engine with a turbocharger can provide the executive car user with
the best of both worlds.
Driven gently with an eye on the boost gauge, they offer 2-litre economy.
Potential 3-litre performance (and, of course, fuel consumption) is there
when required. Sensitive drivers, though, exploit the turbocharged engine's
massive low-speed torque by staying in a high gear for overtaking and hill
climbing instead of changing down, which benefits economy. Good examples of
these 'split personality' cars are the <ORGANIZATION>Citroen XM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lancia Thema</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>
9000.
But however good the under-Pounds 20,000 cars are, there are always
user-choosers whose companies are prepared to pay more and who are
themselves willing to find the extra income tax. Only in the highest reaches
of the premium quality and luxury car market does the tax burden become
oppressive.
It can, in fact, be argued that lower rates of depreciation affect the total
motoring costs so much that, a Mercedes 190E, for example, is a better
financial bet, long term, than an apparently cheaper car. Its successor, the
keenly awaited C-class, seems likely to be as much a benchmark car as the
190 has been for over 10 years.
For some people, a <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> has a 'feel good' factor
which is more easily recognised than described. My personal pick of this
top-quality crop would be a <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 5-Series or 7-Series with a 3-litre or
4-litre V8 engine and 5-speed automatic; a <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> XJ6 3.2-litre or 4-litre;
or a <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> 320E. The only other saloon of comparable price that
equals - and in some respects exceeds - their standards of performance and
refinement is that bogeyman of the European luxury car maker, the
superlative <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> Lexus LS400.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (17): Biggest is not

Stuart Marshall finds little to choose between the best new medium size
models and says they are challenging big executive cars for heavy business
use

<TEXT>
Look at the models now available and a message comes through loud and clear
 -the business driver looking for comfortable, reliable and mile-eating
personal transport no longer needs a big executive car.
Having driven all of the latest crop of medium-sized cars on offer to fleet
buyers or user-choosers, I reckon they are the equal of vehicles the next
size up in everything but bulk.
Prominent among these comprehensively equipped and moderately priced cars
are the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 80, <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 3-Series, <ORGANIZATION>Citroen Xantia</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Mondeo</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> Accord,
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> 626 and Xedos 6, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> C-180, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Galant</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan
Primera</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> 405, <ORGANIZATION>Renault Laguna</ORGANIZATION>, Rover 600, <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> 900, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Carina E</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Cavalier</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> Passat and <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> 850 SE 2.0.
And which are the pick of this very extensive list? That's hard to say
because, by any sensible standard, they are all very good cars indeed.
The <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 3-Series and <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> C-180 are the only ones conforming with
what was once the classic concept of in-line engine and rear-wheel drive.
All but one of the others have front-wheel drive and transversely mounted
four-cylinder engines. The sole exception is the five-cylinder <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION>.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 80, <ORGANIZATION>Ford Mondeo</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Renault Laguna</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> 900, <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Cavalier</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>VW</ORGANIZATION> Passat, there is a V6 option for those who feel happy with a medium-sized
car only if it has a multi-cylinder engine of at least 2.5-litres capacity.
Comparisons really come down to a matter of personal whim.
For example, any of the cars will amble along at speeds far in excess of the
British motorway speed limit of 70mph (112 kmh), which the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Transport</ORGANIZATION> admits is broken by 56 per cent of drivers.
At 100mph (161 kmh) they still have power in hand - although increasingly
tough police action against speeding makes this an academic matter.
All are power-steered as standard. Most have ABS brakes, driver and, in some
cases, front passenger airbags and doors reinforced against side intrusion.
Automatic transmission is universally offered as an option. Air-conditioning
is part of the package with some upmarket versions of these cars, such as
the <ORGANIZATION>Renault Laguna</ORGANIZATION>, and can be had as an extra on any of them.
Only the <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> 900 and <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> 850 are exclusively petrol-engined. For my
taste, the car with the best ride, and which at its price is the best
turbo-diesel, is the <ORGANIZATION>Citroen Xantia</ORGANIZATION>. I also rate its spaciousness for rear
passengers highly.
The Rover 600 has a more distinguished interior than its cheaper mechanical
clone, the <ORGANIZATION>Honda Accord</ORGANIZATION>. Mondeo is <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s best car for years  - the least
expensive 1.6-litre is more refined than the 2.0-litre and I find the estate
car body more attractive than the saloon or hatchback.
Though built on a <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION>) Calibra platform, the new 900 is a
genuine, dyed-in-the-wool <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Renault Laguna</ORGANIZATION>, newly arrived in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, feels like a scaled-down Safrane.
Some of the C-Class <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> interiors are not to my taste but in every
other way the new car is an improvement on that benchmark among compact
business cars - the former 190E. Its ultra-smooth, four valves per cylinder
diesel versions are stayers, not sprinters.
For sheer get-up-and-go, the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 325TDs is unrivalled among diesels but it
sells for Pounds 6,000 more than the most upmarket Xantia VSX. Among larger
business cars, the latest, more firmly sprung Jaguars seem to have gained in
agility while being as refined as ever.
Equally appealing are the 3.0-litre and 4.0-litre V8-engined <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 530 and
540. So, for that matter, are the sepulchrally silent <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> Xedos 9 and the
sportier <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> Lexus GS300.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> Granada/Scorpio and Rover 800 are beginning to show their age but
the top models in particular are still agreeable to drive. The new <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION>
(<ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> replacements for the <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall Carlton</ORGANIZATION> and Senator go well
enough to win business away from Granada/Scorpio.
Whether these excellent new cars will be able to seduce status-conscious
user-choosers out of their <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class remains to be
seen.
At the bottom of the market the small-is-beautiful, or
smaller-is-acceptable, rule can also be applied.
Ford's latest Fiestas are vastly improved and now have optional ABS brakes
and power-steering.
The even more compact <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> 106 range, with much admired refinement and
handling, is soon to be expanded by the 1.6-litre engined, power-steered
luxury <PERSON>Gentry</PERSON> and sporty XSi versions.
I rate the Escort/Astra sized <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> 306 and mechanically similar Citroen
ZX highly. And <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION>'s new Punto is good enough to set a cat among the
pigeons in the sub-Ford Escort size class.

<TEXT>
   The <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Audi V8 Quattro</ORGANIZATION> is as close to a swagger as the folks
at <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> get.
   This <MONEY>$47,450</MONEY> power machine is quietly packaged in decidedly <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>
styling _ the luxury Eurosedan look that's relatively unassuming.
   But take this new flagship of the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> fleet out on the highway
and revel with <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> in a new appreciation for what a luxury
Eurosedan can be.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro test car's 3.6-liter, 32-valve V-8 engine
impressively dominated, going from 0 to 60 mph in 8.7 seconds, and
is capable of producing 240 horsepower. Coupled with four-speed
electronically controlled automatic transmission, it delivered
smooth performance, especially in the economy driving mode.
   Drivers can change the shift points with a knob on the center
console, depending on whether they want to watch fuel consumption
(economy mode) or want maximum power (sport setting). I preferred
the sport setting, though it made this nearly 4,000-pound car so
quick I nearly took off the corner bumpers of a couple of cars I
was trying to pass.
   And road handling? The <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8's suspension was masterful,
making the vehicle feel as safe and in control at, let's just say,
frightfully high speeds, as it did at the highway speed limit of 65
mph. And with full-time four-wheel-drive, this car can handle just
about anything. It tackled snow with gusto, leaving other cars in a
swirl of white. It tracked capably through icy slush, too.
   It was especially impressive, considering this is <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>'s first
merging of a powerful 32-valve V-8 engine, an automatic
transmission and permanent all-wheel-drive technology. Of course,
it's also the most expensive car the West German carmaker has
marketed in the States. The previous top-priced <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> was the 200
Quattro wagon at <MONEY>$38,000</MONEY>.
   But wait. There's more to the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro. A microcomputer
not only monitors the engine systems and maintains optimum
performance but memorizes malfunctions for easier diagnosis at the
shop.
   The test car's antilock brakes (ABS) came with a turnoff button
on the dashboard for those driving conditions, such as loose
gravel, where ABS can sometimes hinder a driver's ability to stop
by preventing gravel from building up at the wheels.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> Bose sound system was superb, and the electronically
controlled front seats _ leather, of course _ were roomy and
comfortable. The front center armrest, which housed a cellular
phone that was standard equipment, not optional, could be adjusted
to various heights.
   Other thoughtful touches included heated seats in both the front
and rear that worked wonderfully fast, a heated door lock on the
driver door so you can't be frozen out of the car, and a dual
windshield washer system. The system lets you use a special washer
fluid that's particularly effective for salt and grime first, and
then follow up with the regular fluid for picture-perfect vision no
matter what the road throws up at you. The headlights received a
washing, too, each time the regular washer fluid was activated.
   The front floor mats had fasteners to keep them in place,
carpeting was all-wool throughout, and the shoulder belt height was
adjustable so the belt wouldn't chafe against a short person's neck.
   There also was a reddish light that shone down on the driver
floor area as an added safety feature when the headlights were on,
wood grain tastefully swathed across the doors and dashboard, and a
spot in the center of the instrument cluster that showed what radio
station was tuned in so the driver never had to look below at the
radio.
   That feature took some getting used to. My eyes caught the
flickering of something changing in the instrument cluster, and at
first, I thought it must have been a warning light that came on and
went out. On examination, I realized it was just the changing radio
station.
   I also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel _ I averaged under
17 mpg in combined city-highway driving, with the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> rating the
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. A gas
guzzler tax of <MONEY>$1,050</MONEY>, by the way, is added on to the <MONEY>$47,450</MONEY> base
price for the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro because of the vehicle's poor fuel
economy.
   Additionally, the person sitting in the rear middle seat would
find the seatback a bit hard. That's where the rear center armrest
is, and it just doesn't make for a very comfortable long-term
resting spot. On the other hand, the rear legroom was good, and
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children
in back can't get hurt.
   Audi lists some impressive competitors for the V8 Quattro _ the
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> 420SEL, which starts around <MONEY>$63,000</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 735i,
around <MONEY>$53,000</MONEY>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> XJ6 <PERSON>Vanden Plas</PERSON>, around <MONEY>$48,000</MONEY>.
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> didn't mention Japanese luxury models, such as the Lexus
LS400, which starts at <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY>, but they're bound to be a factor,
too.
   Still, sales of the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro totaled more than 800 in
calendar <DATE>1989</DATE>, and the company projects about 1,500 sales in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   They're looking for mostly male buyers between 35 and 49, with
household income of <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>. They will be predominantly college
graduates in professional jobs, <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Because the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports
magazine does not list owner trouble reports.

   I also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel _ I averaged under
17 mpg in combined city-highway driving, with the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> rating the
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. A gas
guzzler tax of <MONEY>$1,050</MONEY>, by the way, is added on to the <MONEY>$47,450</MONEY> base
price for the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro because of the vehicle's poor fuel
economy.
   Additionally, the person sitting in the rear middle seat would
find the seatback a bit hard. That's where the rear center armrest
is, and it just doesn't make for a very comfortable long-term
resting spot. On the other hand, the rear legroom was good, and
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children
in back can't get hurt.
   Audi lists some impressive competitors for the V8 Quattro _ the
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> 420SEL, which starts around <MONEY>$63,000</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> 735i,
around <MONEY>$53,000</MONEY>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> XJ6 <PERSON>Vanden Plas</PERSON>, around <MONEY>$48,000</MONEY>.
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> didn't mention Japanese luxury models, such as the Lexus
LS400, which starts at <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY>, but they're bound to be a factor,
too.
   Still, sales of the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro totaled more than 800 in
calendar <DATE>1989</DATE>, and the company projects about 1,500 sales in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   They're looking for mostly male buyers between 35 and 49, with
household income of <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>. They will be predominantly college
graduates in professional jobs, <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Because the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports
magazine does not list owner trouble reports.

   The <DATE>1990</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Audi V8 Quattro</ORGANIZATION> is as close to a swagger as the folks
at <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> get.
   This <MONEY>$47,450</MONEY> power machine is quietly packaged in decidedly <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>
styling _ the luxury Eurosedan look that's relatively unassuming.
   But take this new flagship of the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> fleet out on the highway
and revel with <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> in a new appreciation for what a luxury
Eurosedan can be.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro test car's 3.6-liter, 32-valve V-8 engine
impressively dominated, going from 0 to 60 mph in 8.7 seconds, and
is capable of producing 240 horsepower. Coupled with four-speed
electronically controlled automatic transmission, it delivered
smooth performance, especially in the economy driving mode.
   Drivers can change the shift points with a knob on the center
console, depending on whether they want to watch fuel consumption
(economy mode) or want maximum power (sport setting). I preferred
the sport setting, though it made this nearly 4,000-pound car so
quick I nearly took off the corner bumpers of a couple of cars I
was trying to pass.
   And road handling? The <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8's suspension was masterful,
making the vehicle feel as safe and in control at, let's just say,
frightfully high speeds, as it did at the highway speed limit of 65
mph. And with full-time four-wheel-drive, this car can handle just
about anything. It tackled snow with gusto, leaving other cars in a
swirl of white. It tracked capably through icy slush, too.
   It was especially impressive, considering this is <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>'s first
merging of a powerful 32-valve V-8 engine, an automatic
transmission and permanent all-wheel-drive technology. Of course,
it's also the most expensive car the West German carmaker has
marketed in the States. The previous top-priced <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> was the 200
Quattro wagon at <MONEY>$38,000</MONEY>.
   But wait. There's more to the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro. A microcomputer
not only monitors the engine systems and maintains optimum
performance but memorizes malfunctions for easier diagnosis at the
shop.
   The test car's antilock brakes (ABS) came with a turnoff button
on the dashboard for those driving conditions, such as loose
gravel, where ABS can sometimes hinder a driver's ability to stop
by preventing gravel from building up at the wheels.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> Bose sound system was superb, and the electronically
controlled front seats _ leather, of course _ were roomy and
comfortable. The front center armrest, which housed a cellular
phone that was standard equipment, not optional, could be adjusted
to various heights.
   Other thoughtful touches included heated seats in both the front
and rear that worked wonderfully fast, a heated door lock on the
driver door so you can't be frozen out of the car, and a dual
windshield washer system. The system lets you use a special washer
fluid that's particularly effective for salt and grime first, and
then follow up with the regular fluid for picture-perfect vision no
matter what the road throws up at you. The headlights received a
washing, too, each time the regular washer fluid was activated.
   The front floor mats had fasteners to keep them in place,
carpeting was all-wool throughout, and the shoulder belt height was
adjustable so the belt wouldn't chafe against a short person's neck.
   There also was a reddish light that shone down on the driver
floor area as an added safety feature when the headlights were on,
wood grain tastefully swathed across the doors and dashboard, and a
spot in the center of the instrument cluster that showed what radio
station was tuned in so the driver never had to look below at the
radio.
   That feature took some getting used to. My eyes caught the
flickering of something changing in the instrument cluster, and at
first, I thought it must have been a warning light that came on and
went out. On examination, I realized it was just the changing radio
station.
   I also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel _ I averaged under
17 mpg in combined city-highway driving, with the <ORGANIZATION>EPA</ORGANIZATION> rating the
<ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. A gas
guzzler tax of <MONEY>$1,050</MONEY>, by the way, is added on to the <MONEY>$47,450</MONEY> base
price for the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> V8 Quattro because of the vehicle's poor fuel
economy.
   Additionally, the person sitting in the rear middle seat would
find the seatback a bit hard. That's where the rear center armrest
is, and it just doesn't make for a very comfortable long-term
resting spot. On the other hand, the rear legroom was good, and
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children
in back can't get hurt.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cheap cover for classics in the garage
 -A look at insurance for classic cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CLASSIC car enthusiasts are a special breed. That at least, is the
conclusion of their insurers who offer a different type of policy for the
proud owners of a much-loved <PERSON>Jensen</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Alfa Romeo 'Spider</ORGANIZATION>.'
The main attraction of this type of insurance, provided by brokers and many
of the big insurance companies, is the much lower annual premiums. <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Cooke of Bain Clarkson</ORGANIZATION> insurance brokers (<DATE>0384</DATE>- 455011), estimates that
someone owning a Ferrari or <LOCATION>Bentley</LOCATION>, requiring annual insurance premiums of
Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 under a standard policy, would find them reduced
to Pounds 800-Pounds 900 under classic car insurance.
To enjoy the lower premiums, classic car owners are expected to cherish
their car and not use it for mundane purposes, such as transport. 'The
average owner of a collector's car will keep it in a garage, look after it
carefully and will not use it for everyday driving,' said <PERSON>Mike Chamberlin</PERSON> of
<PERSON>John Scott</PERSON> and partners (081-977-9121), one of the first brokers to
specialise in classic and vintage cars. These conditions mean reduced risk,
which is why the classic car insurance market can insure expensive cars
relatively cheaply.
Classic car insurance differs in two main ways from standard policies which
use bandings for cars depending on model, engine size and the age of the
driver.
Instead, the agreed value of the car and the amount of driving the car is
expected to do are the basis for theinsurance
<ORGANIZATION>Norwich Union</ORGANIZATION>'s Collectors Car policy (0603-622200), will cover the
policyholder against accident, damage and total loss on an agreed value
basis. 'Premiums are worked out on the value of the car rather than its
group rating,' said <PERSON>James Duffell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Norwich Union</LOCATION>. 'Since a classic <DATE>1950s</DATE>
car, saloon or sports car are all expected to be driven in much the same
way, only the value of the car is relevant.'
An <PERSON>Alvis</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION> or an <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> would all fall into the same
insurance bracket if it was agreed their value was the same.
Settling on a value can be difficult in a market which has not found itself
immune to the problems of recession. Those who bought at the top of the
market in <DATE>1989</DATE>, when prices for some classics had quadrupled in a few years,
found that the value of their cars fell by as much as half. For this reason,
the value of the car may need to be reassessed at intervals.
Since the car is not expected to be used daily, premiums are based on
maximum mileage - which is not usually a consideration under a standard
policy. The most common mileage band is for a maximum of 3,000 miles a year,
although some policies allow up to 4,500 miles or even 6,000 miles.
Unlimited mileage policies may be available but the cost of premiums will be
much higher. <PERSON>Bain Clarkson</PERSON>, for example, will offer standard rates but with
the insurance being on an agreed value basis.
The car does not have to be expensive to qualify for classic car insurance -
<ORGANIZATION>Morris Minors</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Sunbeam Alpines</ORGANIZATION> are common risks - but it must be old.
'The car must be at least 20 years old, though we do make exceptions, for
example, for Morgans,' said <PERSON>Peter Fry</PERSON> of KGM Motor Policies (081-530- <DATE>7351</DATE>),
a <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds</ORGANIZATION> syndicate which is another veteran of the classic car market.
<PERSON>Bain Clarkson</PERSON> will also insure younger cars but for higher premiums. The
annual premiums for a <DATE>1980</DATE> Mercedes 450 SL, with an agreed value of Pounds
9,000 will, for example, be Pounds 300 for a 3,000 mile maximum and Pounds
460 for a maximum of 6,000 miles a year.
Young drivers are not welcome. Most classic car insurers will base premiums
on a minimum of 30 years for the driver. Cover may be available for those
who are younger for higher premiums.
Annual premiums for a classic car worth Pounds 5,000, such as a Morris 1000,
insured for a maximum mileage of 3,000 are in the region of Pounds
110-Pounds 115 under classic car insurance. KGM estimates that for the same
mileage, annual premiums for a fully comprehensive policy on a Pounds 10,000
car (such as a <DATE>1970</DATE> E-type <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> or a TR2) would be Pounds 170 and on a
Pounds 20,000 car (a Mercedes 190 SL, for example), Pounds 253.
The market has been affected by the rise in crime which has led to steeply
increased premiums in the motor insurance industry as a whole. <PERSON>Bain
Clarkson</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Cooke</PERSON> says that for the first time in 20 years, classic car
insurers have been obliged to raise premiums, by an average of 25 per cent
this year because of increased theft. In addition, insurers are beginning to
insist on lock-up garages for cars and are stipulating that the policyholder
should have another car for normal daily driving, with the classic car
reserved only for 'social, domestic and pleasure purposes.'
Fry's KGM says that it tries to avoid 'off the road' cover, when cheaper
insurance is provided for the car which is not being driven. <ORGANIZATION>Norwich Union</ORGANIZATION>
will still provide off the road cover, which includes accidental damage,
loss or damage by fire or theft, particularly for those who are doing
restoration work to the car.
What if the worst happens and your cherished <PERSON>Bugatti</PERSON> has a crash and is
deemed a write-off? 'Sometimes a car has been passed on from father to son
through generations and the owner will want to retain and restore the car
whatever,' says <PERSON>Chamberlin</PERSON>. The best classic car insurance policies should
have a salvage clause allowing the owner to retain the salvage after an
accident. <PERSON>John Scott</PERSON> has arrangements with two insurers: under its Lloyd's
scheme, the settlement would be limited to 80 per cent of the insured value
while a scheme underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>General Accident</ORGANIZATION> will allow the owner to have
the car repaired and reimbursed up to the insured value.
