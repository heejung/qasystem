<TEXT>
   American inventor <PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON>, a
pioneer of television, was accorded what many believe was long
overdue glory <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when a 7-foot bronze likeness of the
electronics genius was dedicated in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Capitol.
   With his 81-year-old widow, <PERSON>Elma Farnsworth</PERSON>, looking on, the
inventor was extolled as the father of television and his statue
was placed in the pantheon of famous Americans of the <ORGANIZATION>Capitol</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I think it's an honor long overdue,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Barnson</PERSON>, who
headed a commission that raised <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> to place <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> near
the likeness of a better-known <ORGANIZATION>Utahn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart ... for
this great honor,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Farnsworth</PERSON> told an audience at the Capitol
dedication.
   The ceremony included songs from the school choir from
<ORGANIZATION>Ridgecrest Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. Students from
<LOCATION>Ridgecrest</LOCATION> started the drive for the statue after they surveyed
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> residents and recommended to the state legislature that
<PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> be the second <DATE>Utahn</DATE> honored in <LOCATION>Statuary Hall</LOCATION>.
   The statue by <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> sculptor <PERSON>James Avanti</PERSON> depicts <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>
holding an image dissector tube that was the heart of the
electronic television system that he first conceived as a
15-year-old high school student in <DATE>1922</DATE>.
   Farnsworth is called in an inscription at on the base of the
statue the ``Father of Television.''
   Farnsworth gained the first patent on his system, the precursor
of today's television, in <DATE>1934</DATE> after winning a patent battle with
the powerful <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> corporation, which later paid him <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to
use his many patents. Most history books list <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> only as
one of many early pioneers of television.
   He died in <DATE>1971</DATE> while working on fusion research. He had
contributed more than 160 inventions, including radar and the
electron microscope. He was named to the <ORGANIZATION>National Inventors Hall of
Fame</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Each state is allowed to honor two of its famous citizens with
statues in <ORGANIZATION>Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> had placed only Young in the
hall.

<TEXT>
   Fifty years after commercial television made
its flickering debut at the <LOCATION>New York World</LOCATION>'s Fair, the passion of a
gangly teen-ager who made it possible is finally being requited.
   ``It's high time,'' said <PERSON>Elma</PERSON> ``Pem'' <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>, who for 44
years was sounding board, sweetheart, lab assistant and wife to
<PERSON>Philo Taylor Farnsworth</PERSON>.
   But she wasn't his first love. Television was.
   <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1971</DATE>, was 15 years old in <DATE>1922</DATE> when he
diagrammed his idea for an electronic TV system on a high school
blackboard in this eastern <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> farming town.
   Chemistry teacher <PERSON>Justin Tolman</PERSON>'s memory of that drawing,
including the first description of an electronic ``image
dissector'' TV camera tube, helped <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> win the first in a
series of patent battles with <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> over early TV technology in the
<DATE>1930s</DATE>.
   But if <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> won the battles, <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> won the war. Outside
<LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, most history and reference books place
him on the sidelines among ``other pioneers'' who contributed to
television's development.
   Most of the glory went to <PERSON>Vladimir Zworykin</PERSON>, the
Russian-American inventor who developed the iconoscope and
kinescope during a career primarily with <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>, who
received some 160 patents, finally was inducted into the <ORGANIZATION>National
Inventors Hall</ORGANIZATION> of Fame in <DATE>1984</DATE> _ seven years after <PERSON>Zworykin</PERSON>.
   ``We're going to set the record straight across the country,''
said <PERSON>Kent Farnsworth</PERSON>, the inventor's son.
   Utah Gov. <PERSON>Norm Bangerter</PERSON> proclaimed <DATE>May 2</DATE> ``<PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth
Day</PERSON>,'' kicking off a fund-raising effort for a bronze statue of
<ORGANIZATION>Farnsworth in National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION>. It is scheduled for placement
<DATE>May 2, 1990</DATE> in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Capitol.
   <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>, who was born in the southwestern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> town of
<LOCATION>Beaver</LOCATION>, was picked for the honor by the <ORGANIZATION>Utah Legislature</ORGANIZATION> at the
urging of a <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> elementary school class that researched
a number of famous Utahns.
   ``People kind of like a guy who's an underdog,'' said <PERSON>Bruce
Barnson</PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION>Ridgecrest Elementary</ORGANIZATION>. ``Here's a guy who was
brilliant, came up with television and really got nothing out of
it.''
   In <PERSON>Rigby</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Farnsworth Television Group</ORGANIZATION> is raising money for a
TV museum to highlight his achievements. There already are signs on
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 20 leading into the town of 2,600 proclaiming <PERSON>Rigby</PERSON> the
``Birthplace of Television.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Community Center</ORGANIZATION>, in a former bank building, has a
collection of <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> memorabilia in what used to be a vault.
Last year it featured the Emmy he won posthumously in <DATE>1978</DATE> for his
contributions to TV technology.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Farnsworth</PERSON>, now 81, recently wrote an essay about her
husband for People magazine, criticizing RCA chief <PERSON>David Sarnoff</PERSON>'s
effort to ``control the television industry just like he'd
controlled radio.''
   That theme is explored further in a book <PERSON>Mrs. Farnsworth</PERSON> hopes
to publish titled, ``Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an
Invisible Frontier.''
   She recounts how the financial strain of legal disputes with <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION>
forced the <ORGANIZATION>Farnsworth Television &amp; Radio Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to the verge of
bankruptcy, and finally to sell out to <ORGANIZATION>International Telephone &amp;
Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE>.
   But <PERSON>Edward W. Herold</PERSON>, a former RCA researcher and retired
director of the electronics research laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION>David
Sarnoff Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said jabs at <LOCATION>Sarnoff</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Zworykin</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> are misplaced.
   ``I think <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> got plenty of credit from the historians,
more than he deserves. He was really a genius; a really bright
guy,'' <PERSON>Herold</PERSON> said.
   ``<PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> was a competitor, and a good competitor... But I
would say he was eventually overwhelmed by the number of brilliant
people we had at RCA.''
   <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>, who continued research in physics after selling the
business, developed an early electron microscope to study the
uniformity of the phosphor coating on tubes in the image dissector.
His work also helped in development of night-vision scopes, radar
and an incubator for premature babies.
   He was at <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young University</ORGANIZATION> at the time of his death,
working on an area of physics that science has yet to conquer _
nuclear fusion.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Farnsworth</PERSON> said new attention to his life should be an
example to a new generation of discoverers. ``<PERSON>Phil</PERSON> was told
television was impossible by everyone he talked to about it. I'm
hoping this will encourage young people to stick by their guns and
not be dissuaded by anyone.''

   And Let's Not Forget the Genius
   Who Invented Remote Control

   If Utahans have their way, Philo T. Farnsworth will become
a household name.
   Each state can place statues of two local heroes in the
U.S. Capitol. When a class of Utah fifth-graders learned
their state had only one -- of Mormon leader Brigham Young --
they sought a candidate for the other place of honor. Locals
overwhelmingly chose Mr. Farnsworth, an inventor who died in
1971 (one of Brigham Young's wives was runner-up).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Utahans consider <PERSON>Mr. Farnsworth</PERSON> the "father of
television," the governor's spokeswoman says. "He's finally
getting his just recognition. In his lifetime, he wasn't
really recognized." A statue of <PERSON>Mr. Farnsworth</PERSON>, holding the
image-dissector tube he invented, will be unveiled <DATE>May 2</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Utahans claim <ORGANIZATION>RCA Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which helped make TV a success,
stole much of the glory for inventing it. <PERSON>Vladimir Zworykin</PERSON>,
an <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> employee, "was working on the concept at the same
time," says <PERSON>Bruce Barnson</PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> statue
committee. "He went to <PERSON>Philo</PERSON>'s lab, and <PERSON>Philo</PERSON> told him the
whole thing."
   Legal battles ensued until the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, when RCA (now a unit
of <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>) paid to cross license <PERSON>Mr.
Farnsworth</PERSON>'s patents, the first time the company had ever
licensed a patent. "The chief patent lawyer supposedly cried
when <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> had to purchase the license," says <PERSON>Elliot Sivowitch</PERSON>,
of the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION>'s division of electricity and
physics.
   Unfortunately, <PERSON>Mr. Farnsworth</PERSON>'s patents "were too early,"
says his 82-year-old widow, <PERSON>Elma</PERSON> (her husband's first
TV-picture transmission was of her in <DATE>1929</DATE>). World War II
sidelined the infant industry, and "his patents started to
expire a few years after commercial television took off."
Worse, she claims, "historians went to <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> and got history
from their PR people. Phil was largely ignored."
   "<PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON> is a rather controversial issue,"
concedes <PERSON>William Boss</PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> executive and consultant
to the <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Industries Association</ORGANIZATION>. "A lot of people
were working a long time" creating television.
   Though "<PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> did crucial experimental work," it's
tough to name one inventor of a complex technology, says <PERSON>Mr.
Sivowitch</PERSON>. "Generally speaking, when someone says they're
first, if you look hard enough, you'll find someone who's
more first." The British, for instance, cite <PERSON>John Logie Baird</PERSON>
as TV's inventor.

<HEAD>House Authorizes Five-Year Plan For Supercollider</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> has voted to authorize the
superconducting supercollider but refused to guarantee <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>'
investment in the <MONEY>$7.4 billion</MONEY> project.
   The bill, approved 309-109 <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, allows the <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Energy</ORGANIZATION> to build the particle accelerator near <LOCATION>Waxahachie</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Costs above <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> would be left to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, which has pledged
<MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, and other sources, including foreign investors.
   House members by a 256-163 vote approved an amendment calling
for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government to return <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>' investment if the <ORGANIZATION>Energy
Department</ORGANIZATION> cancels the project before <DATE>October 1995</DATE>.
   Rep. <PERSON>Dennis Eckart</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, said the vote did not assure
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would fully fund the project. Spending will have to be
approved later during <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>' annual appropriations process.
   The bill was sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, but the supercollider will not
likely be authorized by the full chamber. An aide to <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Texas</LOCATION>, said senators probably will act on the collider
during appropriations.
   The supercollider is a 54-mile underground ring in which streams
of protons guided by electromagnets would be hurled at almost the
speed of light until they smash together and break into even
smaller particles.
   Scientists say the supercollider would recreate the physical
state in the moment after the Big Bang, which some believe was the
beginning of the universe.

   Inventors whose developments have affected
nearly every American in one way or another, and led to major
changes in society, will be added to the <ORGANIZATION>National Inventors Hall of
Fame</ORGANIZATION>.
   Special ceremonies have been scheduled for <DATE>March 27</DATE> to honor the
developers of oral contraceptives, computer memory, television

Each year, 1.5 million visitors view the bronze and marble statues that stand 
throughout the Capitol waiting to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Some are well-known. Many are not. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>1864</DATE>, each state has been entitled to donate statues of two of its most 
distinguished deceased citizens for permanent exhibit in the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state legislature decides who is to be honored, a statue is created and 
accepted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for a place in the <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION> -- <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always anxious to see the statues from their state. But often 
they're surprised and disappointed because they have no idea who (the people) 
depicted in the statues are," said <PERSON>Barbara Wolanin</PERSON>, 46, curator of <ORGANIZATION>Statuary 
Hall</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s statues, both dedicated on <DATE>March 1, 1930</DATE>, are of a minister and a 
priest. It is the only state with two statues of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors recognize Father <PERSON>Junipero Serra</PERSON>, the Franciscan priest who 
established nine <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> missions before he died in <DATE>1784</DATE>. Father <PERSON>Serra</PERSON>'s 
bronze likeness holds a little mission in his left hand, and in the right, a 
cross, held high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas Starr King</PERSON> is not so familiar. "What did he do?" Californians typically 
ask when they see the statue. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Unitarian minister, came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1860</DATE> from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to serve as 
pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>First Unitarian Church of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION>. It was during the Civil 
War and many Californians favored the Confederacy. Of the more than 100 
newspapers in the state, only 24 supported <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"King traveled throughout <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> championing the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> cause. He is 
remembered as the man whose matchless oratory kept <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the union," 
curator <PERSON>Wolanin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
King lived in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> only four years before dying at age 40 in <DATE>1864</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95 statues from 50 states, 14 are of religious leaders, including Father 
<PERSON>Damien</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), who devoted his life to lepers on <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>; Father <ORGANIZATION>Kino</ORGANIZATION> 
(<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), a Jesuit missionary, and <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>), the <ORGANIZATION>Mormon Church</ORGANIZATION> 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Five states -- <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> -- have 
contributed only one statue each. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>May 2</DATE>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> became the latest state to present its second statue, a 7-foot-7 
bronze likeness of lanky <PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON> (1906-1971), known as the "Father 
of Television." The statue shows <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> holding one of his first 
cathode-ray tubes. He transmitted his first electronic TV picture in <DATE>1927</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Students at <ORGANIZATION>Ridgecrest Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, under the guidance of 
Principal <PERSON>Bruce Barnson</PERSON>, led the effort to put the <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> statue in the 
<LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll conducted by students, residents favored <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> over 20 
other Utahans, including <PERSON>Eliza Snow</PERSON>, a poet and wife of <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young; Mormon 
Church</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Ezra Taft Benson</PERSON>; hotelier <PERSON>J. Willard Marriott</PERSON>, and heavyweight 
boxing champion <PERSON>Jack Dempsey</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present for <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Norman Bangerter</PERSON>'s unveiling of the statue 
was the inventor's 81-year-old widow, <PERSON>Elma</PERSON> (Pem) <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Three statues are of Presidents: <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>James A. Garfield</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>). Four are of vice presidents, 36 of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
senators, 23 of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members, 30 of governors and 32 of military heroes. (Some 
held more than one of these titles.) Six statues honor women: <PERSON>Dr. Florence 
Sabin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>), author of the "Sabin Health Laws" that modernized <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s 
public health system; <PERSON>Frances Willard</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>), founder of the Women's <ORGANIZATION>Christian 
Temperance Union</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Marie Sanford</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), educator and champion of women's 
rights; <PERSON>Jeannette Rankin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>), the nation's first congresswoman; Mother 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>), a Catholic nun who contributed to the fields of health care, 
education and social work, and <PERSON>Esther Hobart Morris</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>), the first woman to 
hold judicial office in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of four signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of 
six physicians. A king is here -- Kamehameha (<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), and a famed cowboy 
artist -- <PERSON>Charley Russell</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>). Oklahoma honors two American Indians: 
Sequoya, inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and <PERSON>Will Rogers</PERSON>, humorist, 
newspaper columnist and movie star. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON>' famous advice to "Always keep an eye on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to see 
what they're up to," his statue is the only one facing the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The feet of many of the statues gleam from constant rubbing, "for good luck," 
by visitors. Will <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> has the shiniest feet of all. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of the president and vice president of the <LOCATION>Confederacy</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton Stephens</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>), respectively, as 
well as of "Father of Refrigeration" <PERSON>John Gorrie</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>), and steamboat inventor 
<PERSON>Robert Fulton</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
America's best-known historic figures are here as well: Henry Clay (<LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Huey 
Long</PERSON> (<LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> (<LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>

Most visitors to <PERSON>Statuary Hall</PERSON> have no idea who they were, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people pass away who are much more famous than many in Statuary Hall, 
but the states are stuck with those selected at an earlier time," longtime 
Capitol guide <PERSON>Madeline Allen</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Statuary Hall is in a part of the Capitol completed in <DATE>1807</DATE>, a domed 
semicircular room with sandstone walls and breccia marble columns, a room that 
housed the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>1857</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> moved to its 
present, larger chamber. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passed a bill in <DATE>1864</DATE> to create the <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION> to house 
two marble or bronze statues from each state "of deceased persons illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1870</DATE>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> contributed the first statue, Revolutionary War hero 
<PERSON>Nathaniel Greene</PERSON>. By the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, 23 were on exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>1933</DATE>, there were 65 statues crowded into <PERSON>Statuary Hall</PERSON>, and it became clear 
that the floor would not support any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was then decided to keep most of the collection in the hall and place the 
others in prominent sites throughout the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statues no longer stand in the same room, this gathering of heroes 
-- famous or not -- continues to be called <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Bruce R. Barnson</PERSON> is an ample, suspender-wearing educator with unfashionably 
long sideburns and a beguiling belief that politics is too important to be left 
to adults. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade, the elementary school principal has urged his 11- and 
12-year-old charges to get down and dirty in state politics. Come up with an 
idea to benefit the commonweal, Barnson tells them, then lobby relentlessly to 
ram it through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Through cunning, manipulation of the media, moral righteousness and 
old-fashioned political muscle, the students have assembled a record that would 
be the envy of any Capitol Hill power broker: Among other triumphs, they have 
pushed through a mandatory seat-belt law and a resolution opposing nuclear 
waste dumping in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the children's crusade is going national by asking <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to 
extend <ORGANIZATION>Daylight Saving Time</ORGANIZATION> another week to give trick-or-treaters an extra 
hour of light on <LOCATION>Halloween</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Empowerment of the young comes easily in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, which is the most youthful state 
in the <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> thanks to a Mormon zeal for big families. One-third of the state's 
1.7 million people are under 15; the median age in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> is 26, compared to 32 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
As the state's <DATE>1990</DATE> "Statistical Abstract" notes, "<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s young population has 
placed unprecedented demands on the state's public education system during the 
last decade." <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> has the nation's most crowded classrooms, with a 
student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1; teachers earn less than their counterparts 
in 43 other states, and <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> ranks 50th in average annual expenditure per 
student. 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Barnson</PERSON>, who was named <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s most distinguished elementary principal two 
years ago, all those youngsters are not so much a problem as an opportunity. 
After growing up on a farm in southern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, Barnson dropped out of college, 
did a stint in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, then labored in an open-pit copper mine in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. 
Working the graveyard shift one night, he had a revelation -- that "only 
coyotes and prostitutes work these kinds of hours" -- and returned to school to 
eventually earn a doctorate in education from <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young University</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1983</DATE>, three years after <PERSON>Barnson</PERSON> became principal at <ORGANIZATION>Ridgecrest Elementary 
School</ORGANIZATION>, his fifth-graders launched their first, modest "legislative project." 
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, they realized, had a state motto, "Industry"; a state bird, the sea gull; 
a state song, "<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, We Love Thee"; even a state fish, the rainbow trout. One 
thing it didn't have was a state bug. In the <ORGANIZATION>Beehive State</ORGANIZATION>, the leading 
candidate was somewhat self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with statistics about the honey industry and the bee's value to 
agriculture, a dozen pint-sized lobbyists worked over the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate's Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee</ORGANIZATION>. As a school scrapbook later put it, "They also 
learned to deal with opposition and some ridicule." But when then-Gov. <PERSON>Scott 
Matheson</PERSON> signed SB216 into law, he called it "the bright spot of the session." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the students returned to the <LOCATION>Statehouse</LOCATION> with a weightier issue; 
in a meeting with <PERSON>Matheson</PERSON>, they noted that <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> was one of only nine states 
with no "child safety restraint" law. The governor, having twice failed to pass 
seat-belt legislation, urged the children to "march right upstairs to the 
Legislature" and press the issue. 
</P>
<P>
They did that and more -- manning observation posts near the school to count 
how many auto occupants were wearing seat belts, raising <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> for a "buckle 
up" billboard campaign, and sending educational packets to other schools. Over 
bitter opposition from state senators, who warned darkly about trampling 
"parents' rights," a bill requiring mandatory belting for children under age 5 
passed the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 21 to 5 and eventually became law. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear waste came next. Noting that geologists had identified a subterranean 
salt dome in one of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s national parks potentially suitable for a temporary 
storage site for radioactive matter, <ORGANIZATION>Barnson</ORGANIZATION>'s students conducted a public 
opinion poll on the issue in <LOCATION>Salt Lake County</LOCATION>. Not surprisingly -- nuclear 
waste is about as popular here as a contagious skin disease -- <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT> of the 
respondents opposed the idea. The Legislature passed, and the governor signed, 
a resolution reflecting that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Such exercises, the school scrapbook declares, "foster patriotism, free 
enterprise and involved citizenship," while suggesting "the value of individual 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
Students also learn a little bare-knuckled politics, as demonstrated in their 
most recent enterprise: placing the statue of a famous <DATE>Utahn</DATE> in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
More than a century ago, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> authorized each state to erect statues of two 
native sons -- or daughters -- in the hallowed halls. In <DATE>1950</DATE>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Brigham 
Young</ORGANIZATION> joined the pantheon; <DATE>four years ago</DATE>, students at <LOCATION>Ridgecrest</LOCATION> concluded 
that the time had come to fill the second niche. They drafted a list of 21 
significant figures in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s history and asked 27 elementary schools around 
the state to list their favorites; a slightly smaller list was sent to 501 
homes here in <LOCATION>Sandy</LOCATION>, and the students conducted an informal survey at a 
downtown mall. 
</P>
<P>
The clear favorite was one <PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON>, an inventor who is considered 
the father of television. A bill supporting <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>'s immortalization passed 
the <ORGANIZATION>Utah House</ORGANIZATION> and cleared a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee, but trouble appeared from an 
unexpected quarter: Advocates of hotel magnate <PERSON>J. Willard Marriott</PERSON>, a native 
son from northern <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, outmaneuvered the children by tabling and eventually 
killing the <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> bill. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>'87</DATE>-'88 school year, Barnson's students tried again, only to see history 
begin to repeat itself. A <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> bill cleared committees in both chambers, 
but the <ORGANIZATION>Marriott</ORGANIZATION> forces, who wanted their own man in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, bottled up 
<PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Rules Committee</ORGANIZATION>. It was time for hardball. As the 
school scrapbook recounted, "The committee finally let it out when, at our 
request, the TV stations asked why our bill was being held." After some more 
skin-of-the-teeth maneuvering, the bill finally became law, and a statue of 
<PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON> will soon appear in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Barnson, who moved to <ORGANIZATION>Silver Mesa Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> this year, is slightly 
pessimistic about congressional willingness to extend daylight saving time, 
although the <ORGANIZATION>Utah Legislature</ORGANIZATION> supports the idea. The junior lobbyists are 
trying to compile statistics on the number of children killed by automobiles at 
dusk on <LOCATION>Halloween</LOCATION>, but that has been a difficult task. Persuading the lawmakers 
on Capitol Hill to tinker with the national clock also seems a bit daunting. 
"Our only ally is reason," <PERSON>Barnson</PERSON> sighed, "and I'm not sure reason works in 
smoke-filled rooms."

   Pioneering scientists <PERSON>George Washington Carver</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Percy F. Julian</PERSON> are the first blacks named to the <ORGANIZATION>National
Inventors Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION>.
   They were among 10 people, including the founders of two of the
nation's largest computer companies and the developers of a leading
ulcer medicine, chosen for the honor.
   They ``are the real heroes of our age,'' <PERSON>Jeffrey M. Samuel</PERSON>,
acting commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, said about those
chosen <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``They are the thinkers and the problem-solvers. They have
opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and
technology.''
   Carver, once director of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION>Tuskegee Institute</ORGANIZATION>, was
selected for his work developing countless products from peanuts
and sweet potatoes. Julian, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> chemist, was the first to
synthesize cortisone and other human hormones.
   ``He was one of the most persistent men I have known,'' <PERSON>Samuel
B. Massie</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> said about <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>, a former
colleague.
   Tenacity was cited as a necessary ingredient by another man
being honored.
   <PERSON>Robert S. Ledley</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> said the prerequisite
skills for success include a pragmatic attitude, boldness,
fortitude ``and `stick-to-itiveness' almost to the extent of
obsession.''
   <PERSON>Ledley</PERSON> was named to the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame for his development of the
CT scanner, a special X-ray device that allows doctors to see the
inner workings of the body in great detail.
   Honoree <PERSON>Herman Hollerith</PERSON> was described as having left behind a
motto for the generations: ``Do not fold, spindle or mutilate.''
   Hollerith invented the punch-card system that helped pave the
way to modern computers. A <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> employee, he halved the
time it took to tabulate the <DATE>1890</DATE> national head count and later
went on to help found the giant <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines
Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   The second computer pioneer honored was <PERSON>Kenneth S. Olsen</PERSON>,
developer of the magnetic memory core for computers and founder of
<ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Graham C. Durant</PERSON>, <PERSON>John C. Emmett</PERSON> and <PERSON>C. Robin Gannellin</PERSON> were
selected jointly for their work in medical chemistry. The three
developed the drug cimetidine, which has greatly reduced the need
for surgery for ulcer victims. It is known by the trade name
Tagamet.
   <PERSON>Charles P. Ginsberg</PERSON> was named for his work leading the
engineering team that developed the first practical videotape.
<PERSON>Eugene J. Houdry</PERSON>, a French-born engineer, was honored for
developing the procedure that allows crude oil to be processed into
high-grade gasoline and aviation fuel.
   The selection of 10 new members is the most since six were
chosen in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and brings total membership to 85. The <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame
was Founded at the <ORGANIZATION>Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. A new <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of
Fame building is scheduled to be built in <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Thomas A. Edison</PERSON> was the first member. The <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> also includes
many of the nation's best-known inventors, including <PERSON>Alexander
Graham Bell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Orville</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wilbur Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Charles Goodyear</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rudolf
Diesel</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Henry Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON>.
   The newest members will be inducted in <DATE>April</DATE>.

<HEAD>Inventor Says He Has Developed 3-D TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inventor said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he has developed
three-dimensional television, beating the world's electronics
giants.
   ``We think that just as black and white was converted into
color, so will color be converted into 3-D,'' said the 33-year-old
British inventor, <PERSON>James Ashbey</PERSON>.
   The technology does not require special glasses or screens. It
can convert all new and existing black and white and color films
into 3-D, along with live broadcasts, animation and computer
graphics, said his company, <ORGANIZATION>Delta Group</ORGANIZATION>.
   Ashbey displayed his invention at a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> studio, showing color
films in what he calls ``full natural perspective.''
   The effect appears three dimensional, but it loses some
resolution compared with a standard TV image, and is very blurry.
Ashbey did not display the 3-D and normal television versions of
the same film side-by-side for comparison.
   Ashbey said he has applied for an international patent for his
invention, which he calls ``Deep Vision.''
   He said he developed the technology with financial support from
<ORGANIZATION>RCA-Columbia Pictures International</ORGANIZATION>, which he said provided
<MONEY>$245,000</MONEY>, and the British entertainment group <ORGANIZATION>Brent Walker Holdings
PLC</ORGANIZATION>, which he said provided <MONEY>$642,200</MONEY>.
   Deep Vision electronically stimulates the brain into creating an
illusion, he said.
   The technology takes a normal film, makes a digital version and
inserts what Ashbey calls stereo cues. A digital decoder added to
an ordinary television set then uses these cues to send slightly
different images to each eye, and that creates the experience of
depth, he said.

<LEADPARA>  The National Inventors Hall of Fame last week chose to honor Gertrude Belle
Elion for her pioneering research at Burroughs Wellcome Co. that led to the
development of drugs to combat leukemia, septic shock and tissue rejection in
patients undergoing kidney transplants.;    The recognition makes Elion, 73,
the first woman to take her place alongside innovators like Alexander Graham
Bell and Thomas A. Edison in the Hall of Fame since the organization was begun
in 1973.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'MAVERICK' WOMAN JOINS RANKS OF MEN IN INVENTORS
HALL OF FAME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Two years ago, <PERSON>Elion</PERSON> (pronounced ELL-ee-on) shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine with her longtime colleague, <PERSON>George H. Hitchings.;    Elion</PERSON>, who was
born in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, has been a pioneer in more ways than one. Although
women have produced a number of major technological advances, women remain
rare among inventors and receive only about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of all patents.;    "I
was a maverick," <PERSON>Elion</PERSON> said <DATE>last week.</DATE>;    At a time when most women did not
go to college, she graduated from <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> with top honors at 19 and went on to
obtain a master's degree in chemistry.;    In the <DATE>1940s</DATE>, she and <PERSON>Hitchings</PERSON>
developed variations on components of the genetic material DNA that could be
used to fool cells and foil the reproductive machinery of viruses and
bacteria.;    But what made the work remarkable was that no one had yet
identified the double-helix structure of DNA or knew much about the way it
worked. But the two scientists did know that DNA was built from four chemical
components, known as bases. Their approach, therefore, was to develop fake
versions of these bases that would fool particular kinds of cells and lead to
useless DNA.;    <PERSON>Elion</PERSON> first used the approach to synthesize compounds that
block lymphocytes that cause leukemia, but the approach led her and other
researchers to develop a host of other drugs as well.;    <PERSON>Elion</PERSON> now holds
about 40 patents, and the approach has since been applied by other
scientists.;    The <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame is a non-profit organization based in <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. Inductees are selected by a panel of scientists, patent attorneys and
other experts. Thus far, 94 inventors have been named to the hall.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A record 10 new members, including the first
two blacks, were named to the <ORGANIZATION>National Inventors Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``The 10 individuals we honor here today are the real heroes of
our age. ... They are the thinkers and the problem solvers. They
have opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and
technology,'' said <PERSON>Jeffrey M. Samuels</PERSON>, acting commissioner of
patents and trademarks.
   <PERSON>George Washington Carver</PERSON> and <PERSON>Percy F. Julian</PERSON> were among the
inventors selected for inclusion this year, marking the first
blacks to be selected since the hall was begun in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   Carver was selected for his work developing more than 500 uses
for peanuts, including cooking oil and printer's ink, and for sweet
potatoes, including synthetic rubber. He died in <DATE>1943</DATE>.
   Julian, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> chemist, was the first to synthesize cortisone
and other human hormones. Before the synthetic cortisone came onto
the market, the only cortisone available to treat rheumatoid
arthritis was produced from oxen bile, at a cost of <MONEY>hundreds of
dollars</MONEY> a drop.
   ``He was one of the most persistent men I have known,''
reflected <PERSON>Samuel B. Massie</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION>, once a
colleague of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   Tenacity was also cited as a necessary ingredient by another man
being honored.
   <PERSON>Robert S. Ledley</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said the
prerequisite skills for success as an inventor include a pragmatic
attitude, boldness, fortitude ``and stick-to-itiveness almost to
the extent of obsession.''
   <PERSON>Ledley</PERSON> was named to the hall of fame for his development of the
computerized tomographic, or CT, scanner, a device similar to an
x-ray machine that allows doctors to see the inner workings of the
body in great detail.
   Another man honored was <PERSON>Herman Hollerith</PERSON>, described as having
left behind a motto for the generations: ``do not fold, spindle or
mutilate.''
   Hollerith invented the punch-card system that helped pave the
way to modern computers. A <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> employee, he halved the
time it took to tabulate the <DATE>1890</DATE> national head count and later
went on to help found the giant <ORGANIZATION>IBM Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Carver</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ledley</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Hollerith</LOCATION>, inventors
selected for the hall of fame for <DATE>1990</DATE> are:
   _<PERSON>Graham C. Durant</PERSON>, <PERSON>John C. Emmett</PERSON> and <PERSON>C. Robin Gannellin</PERSON>,
medical chemists who developed the drug cimetidine, which has
greatly reduced the need for surgery for ulcer victims. It is known
by the trade name Tagamet.
   _<PERSON>Charles P. Ginsberg</PERSON>, who led the engineering team that
developed the first practical videotape.
   _<PERSON>Kenneth S. Olsen</PERSON>, developer of the magnetic memory core for
computers and founder of <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment Corporation</ORGANIZATION>.
   _<PERSON>Eugene J. Houdry</PERSON>, a French-born engineer who developed the
procedure that allowed crude oil to be processed into high grade
gasoline and aviation fuel.
   The selection of 10 new members is the most since six were
picked in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and brings total membership in the Hall of Fame to
85.
   Founded at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, the hall of
fame will eventually move to <LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, where construction on a
new facility is to begin later this year.

<DATELINE>SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the days when inventor <PERSON>Thomas
Edison</PERSON>'s light bulb first lit the nights of <DATE>1879</DATE>, Americans have
been regarded as naturally inventive and creative.
   Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and
engineers at <ORGANIZATION>General Electric's Research and Development Center</ORGANIZATION>,
which traces its roots to the <ORGANIZATION>Edison Electrical Light Company</ORGANIZATION> formed
in <DATE>1878</DATE> to support the experiments of <PERSON>Thomas Edison</PERSON>.
   GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal
organs without X-rays.
   Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, not
pulled from the depths of the earth.
   In <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> was the first company to pass the 50,000th patent
mark.
   But <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s _ and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s _ technological lead is being threatened
by the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clever
copycats.
   Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowed
American inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensive
household staples. Color television sets, transistor radios and
videocassettee recorders were all original American ideas the
Japanese have capitalized on.
   All that is changing.
   The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of American
scientists and engineers for new technology, says <PERSON>Roland W. Schmitt</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy</ORGANIZATION> and former
vice president of corporate research and development at <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Japanese are trying to be innovators, <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON> says.
   Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> now acquires
more patents worldwide than any other country.
   <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON> says the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still leads the way in developing
new technology. ``But <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is now in a stage where they're starting
to do this,'' he said.
   Japanese business executives say it's only natural for their
companies to develop their own technology.
   ``Any company that hopes to continue making progress will require
innovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' said
<PERSON>Kazuya Hosaka</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>'s patent office in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   Many in this country question whether the Japanese can be
pioneering.
   The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quick
at turning inventions into products and their students study science
and technology in an education system considered superior in those
areas.
   But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-taking
and prizes collective action over individual effort. Their
scientists and engineers aren't trained to be pioneering.
   Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative.
   ``We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON> said.
   A recent study for the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> showed that in
<DATE>1987</DATE>, three Japanese companies garnered the most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents:
<ORGANIZATION>Hitachi</ORGANIZATION> with 873, <ORGANIZATION>Canon</ORGANIZATION> with 850 and <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> with 830.
   <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>, which until <DATE>1986</DATE> had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, was
fourth with 782 patents.
   <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> executives at the company's R&amp;D center, located in a sprawling
complex of buildings overlooking the <LOCATION>Mohawk River</LOCATION>, dispute the
results of the patent study done by <ORGANIZATION>Computer Horizons</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting
company. They argue <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> would still rank as patent leader if the
study had included patents granted to RCA, which <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> acquired in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   ``Whoever did the study obviously didn't know <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> was a
subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>James C. Davis Jr.</PERSON>, manager of patent and
legal operations at <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>.
   Top <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> officials, though, see the study as a warning.
   ``It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned,'' said <PERSON>Walter Robb</PERSON>,
vice president of corporate research and development at <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>. ``There
are still three Japanese companies in the top four.''
   Moreover, the Japanese are beating the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is their
ability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR.
   ``We get out of the starting block fast,'' <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON> said. ``But we
lose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the long
haul.''
   America's best hope in its competition with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> may be its
education system. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is far ahead of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in an area
vital to technological and scientific development: the encouragement
of creative thought.
   Yet serious problems exist in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s education system.
   ``We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science
and technology,'' said <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Science Board</ORGANIZATION>.
   He believes that for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to remain No. 1 in science
and technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese.
   ``The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customer
preferences are integral parts of the innovation process, not
afterthoughts,'' <PERSON>Schmitt</PERSON> said. ``I see no reason why we Americans
can't renew our skills at the application of science and technology
while maintaining our strength as pioneers.''

<HEAD>Inventor of PAL Color Television System is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Walter Bruch</PERSON>, a German television
pioneer who invented the <ORGANIZATION>PAL</ORGANIZATION> color system, has died, the Telefunken
company said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He was 82.
   Bruch invented the Phase Alternation Line (PAL) color television
system 20 years ago. Telefunken, a West German maker of television
sets, said the system was now being used in 60 countries.
   Bruch had been <ORGANIZATION>Telefunken</ORGANIZATION>'s head of research for many years.
   Telefunken said <PERSON>Bruch</PERSON> died after a long illness but gave no

   ENGLAND REIGNED supreme in <DATE>1851</DATE>. 
Her colonies were vast, her navy invincible, her industrial and technological might unquestioned. 
But in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Crystal Palace Exhibition</ORGANIZATION> of <DATE>1851</DATE>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> stole the show. 

   <PERSON>Cyrus McCormick</PERSON>'s reaper drew thousands to a nearby farm. 
<ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> rubber products won a big prize. 
The biggest shocker, though, was the American system of manufacturing -- precision tools, interchangeable parts -- that made possible an unbelievable flow of pistols, clocks and other items at cheap prices. 

   The great fairs and expositions of the <DATE>19th</DATE> and <DATE>20th century</DATE> have always been a showcase of new technologies and inventions, but the fairs have been something more. 
They are a wonderful place to watch the gradual passing of technological supremacy from one part of the world to another. 

   In the decades following the <ORGANIZATION>Crystal Palace</ORGANIZATION> extravaganza, it was clear that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> was seizing that supremacy. 
The nation's inventors developed the telephone, the incandescent lamp, the typewriter, the phonograph. 
Near the end of the century, Americans began building skyscrapers. 

   The British admired what they called the "American system of manufactures," but much of the technology the Americans used was actually borrowed from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and other European nations. 
<PERSON>Andrew Carnegie</PERSON>, for example, built a steel empire -- but it was initially based on the work of Sir <PERSON>Henry Bessemer</PERSON>, an Englishman. 

   History would repeat itself in later decades, but by then the scientific innovator would be <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
The great technological borrower and commercial exploiter would be <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 

   The <LOCATION>Chicago World</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Columbian Exposition</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>1893
   America</LOCATION> was showing off. 
If the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> fair of <DATE>1889</DATE> had been graced by the spectacular new iron tower designed by <ORGANIZATION>Eiffel</ORGANIZATION>, then the 1893 <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> fair would have its own symbol, equally impressive, totally American. 
A man named <PERSON>Gale Ferris</PERSON> constructed a giant wheel, 250 feet in diameter, capable of carrying 1400 people at a time. 

   The message of the <DATE>1893</DATE> fair was this: <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is now the equal of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
The great capitalists of the day -- the steel, sugar, oil, beef and coal barons -- hired the finest architects, who produced a pseudoclassical with statuary, fountains and columns. 

   On <DATE>May 1</DATE>, president <PERSON>Grover Cleveland</PERSON> opened the fair by pressing a golden telegraph key and 10,000 electric lights flashed on. 
At night the effect was ethereal, sensational. 
All the buildings had been painted white, and the place soon became known all over the world as the "White City." 

   The same year, the <LOCATION>Duryea</LOCATION> brothers put the first American auto on the road. 
They were 10 years behind <PERSON>Gottlieb Daimler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
But, it was American manufacturing genius -- in the person of <ORGANIZATION>Henry Ford</ORGANIZATION> -- that brought the product within the grasp of the ordinary person. 
Ford introduced the moving assembly line in <DATE>1913</DATE>, cutting costs, cutting prices, and expanding output. 

   By the end of World War I, half the cars in the world had been made by <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   At the time of the <DATE>1893</DATE> fair, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was still a long way from making cars. 
But it was on the way. 
Twenty five years before, under the young emperor <ORGANIZATION>Meiji</ORGANIZATION>, it had set itself a seemingly impossible goal: to catch up with the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in technology. 
It wasn't making cars, no -- but it had already begun to build ships and manufacture guns, locomotives, machinery and textile mills. 

   The <LOCATION>New York World</LOCATION>'s Fair, <DATE>1939</DATE>
   At this fair, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> showed it wasn't just the equal of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> but its superior. 
With the Depression still lingering, the <DATE>1939</DATE> fair offered hope -- the hope of a brighter future through technology. 
American technology. 

   RCA unveiled its television developments on opening day, with <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> becoming the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president to appear on the tube. 
<PERSON>David Sarnoff</PERSON> of RCA, writing shortly before the opening of the fair, predicted a future of mobile car phones, facsimile transmission and overseas TV broadcasts. 

   The runaway hit of the <DATE>1939</DATE> fair was the <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Futurama</ORGANIZATION> pavilion. 
People stood in line for hours to see a vision of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE> -- some 36,000 square feet of model American landscape, transformed by a vast web of superhighways. 

   Sitting in a soft chair, you glided 20 years into the future. 
Before you spread a giant landscape of the future. 
Over here was a thriving and prosperous city of heavy industry. 
Over there was an even more futuristic city, with shiny glass skyscrapers, outlying districts for business and for housing, and an outlying airport, all connected by a network of highways. 
It looked a lot like <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> today. 

   The Japanese exhibit at the fair focused only on traditional housing, gardens, and culture. There was no hint that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> had already succeeded in building giant industrial combines and a war machine that was already in action against <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. -
   The <LOCATION>New York World</LOCATION>'s Fair, <DATE>1964</DATE>
   Japanese electronics companies introduced some early products at this fair, including the first calculator with an electronic readout. 
But they were put in the shade by <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor</ORGANIZATION>. 
It unveiled the Mustang, marking perhaps the zenith of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto industry. 
RCA introduced color television. 

   While this was going on, however, the first Japanese cars, made by <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, were beginning to arrive on American shores. 
No one could have foretold the tremendous impact they would eventually have on <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>'s supremacy. 
And no one could have foretold that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> would dominate the world's manufacture of color televisions. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Tsukuba Exposition</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>1985
   Japan</LOCATION>'s real debut as a world-class technological power didn't come until <DATE>1985</DATE>, when 20 million people descended on <ORGANIZATION>Tsukuba Science City</ORGANIZATION>, north of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, for an <MONEY>$840 million</MONEY> extravaganza. 

   Tsukuba was new and unpopular, a thoroughly planned city with all the warmth of most thoroughly planned new cities. 
When the Japanese government relocated dozens of government laboratories to <LOCATION>Tsukuba</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, scientists howled. 
Tsukuba offered rice paddies, look-alike laboratory buildings, a dearth of shops and an overabundance of ennui -- but the fair itself was a celebration of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s awesome gains in technology. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was there, too, but its exhibits were overshadowed by those of the Japanese. 
By this time, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> also was losing to Japanese rivals in semiconductor memory chips, piling up huge trade deficits with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and was on the verge of becoming a debtor nation. 

   Tsukuba was very much a Japanese celebration, and a playful one. 
Few of the exhibits even tried to explain the intricacies of chemistry, biology or computers; much of the fair was aimed at young people, especially children. 

   They were entertained by huge television screens, cute little robots, enormous crowds. 
The biggest hit of the fair was the <ORGANIZATION>Fujitsu</ORGANIZATION> pavilion, which featured <ORGANIZATION>Fanuc Man</ORGANIZATION>, a 16-foot robot weighing 25 tons, a gigantic symbol of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s power in robotics. 
Fanuc Man could lift 400-pound barbells and could also assemble a small replica of himself. 

   The fair never explored the darker aspects of technological progress, even though the Japanese themselves were beginning to worry about invasion of privacy, computer crime, system failure, robot error, displaced workers, mental stress, video-terminal eye strain, and alienation of humans from each other. 
Tsukuba, however, gave only one message: Love technology. 

   <PERSON>Atsushi Shimokobe</PERSON>, one of the fair's senior planners, says he remembers seeing children who embraced computers and wouldn't let go. 
"There were some adults who saw that and were happy about it, but it made other adults anxious and uneasy," he recalls. 

   Even some of the children made it clear they wanted a future with something more than just technology, technology, technology. 
<PERSON>Peter Eggleton</PERSON>, science attache at the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, remembers taking his nine-year-old daughter's class to Expo <DATE>'85</DATE>. 
On the bus ride home, everybody talked about seeing a horse in one of the Japanese pavilions and a baby elephant from <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>. 
Says <PERSON>Mr. Eggleton</PERSON>, "This was a strong message for me."

   A 25-year-old convict helped bring television to
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s remote northwest by developing a satellite receiver in his
prison workshop, the official <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua News Agency</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Ren Huimin</PERSON>, serving a five-year sentence for fraud in a

made it possible for <LOCATION>Yinchuan</LOCATION> residents to receive programs
transmitted from <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>China Central Television</ORGANIZATION>.
   He also invented an ultra-high frequency analogue switch which
turns lights on and off when people enter or leave a room, and an
infra-red automatic alarm used in the prison.
   The report said <PERSON>Ren</PERSON> taught himself physics, chemistry, optics,
electronics and electromagnetics and dropped out of school to do
independent research.

   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office has begun an investigation to determine if a
patent awarded to Gilbert P. Hyatt for the invention of the
single-chip microcomputer was first sought by Gary W. Boone
while working at Texas Instruments.
   The investigation is the first step in finding who
actually invented the device, which over the years has become
crucial to the manufacturing of televisions, computers and
other electronic products. The winner of the patent battle is
likely to claim millions of dollars in royalties from U.S.
and Japanese semiconductor companies now producing huge
volumes of more advanced versions of the device.

office on <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> to investigate <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON>'s patent, which
was awarded with great fanfare last year. A spokesman said
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION> is convinced <PERSON>Mr. Boone</PERSON> patented the device
on <DATE>July 19, 1971</DATE>. The company said <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON>'s patent wasn't
filed until <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   Calling the challenge "frivolous," <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> said he filed
his patent in <DATE>1968</DATE>.
   Separately, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to develop a
new solar technology with <ORGANIZATION>Southern California Edison Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a
unit of <ORGANIZATION>SCEcorp</ORGANIZATION>. It said the two companies plan to develop a
new solar cell using low-purity silicon to convert sunlight
to electricity.

<P>
<PERSON>Mikhail Tsinberg</PERSON>'s workroom at <ORGANIZATION>Philips Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Ossining</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, brims 
with the gear of the modern inventor: Television monitors tuned to test 
patterns stand on shelves, stacks of electronic equipment blink silently in 
corners, and bench drawers display labels for mysterious gizmos such as "logic 
analyzer probes parts." 
</P>
<P>
It's a playground for the Soviet-born engineer, who in the past six years has 
won four <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents in high-definition television under the aegis of 
<ORGANIZATION>Dutch-owned North American Philips Corp</ORGANIZATION>. But it's also a vantage point from 
which he surveys <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> technology. And these days, Tsinberg is starting to worry 
that the invention prowess of his adopted country is weakening. 
</P>
<P>
He sees signs everywhere -- from what he terms the "lousy" science and math 
education in this country to the closing of major research laboratories owing 
to corporate restructurings. He notes, too, that European- and Asian-born 
scientists are the majority at research labs where he has worked in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> and that increasing numbers of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents are granted to Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"When Sputnik was launched, it captured headlines" and prompted a rapid <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
response, the inventor said. "But with this slow decay process, there's nothing 
to put in headlines. It's hard to notice and very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just One <ORGANIZATION>Voice 
</P>
<P>
Tsinberg</ORGANIZATION>'s is just one voice in a growing debate about <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s technological 
competitiveness. Some analysts say <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s technology engine is sputtering 
while the engines of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> are at full tilt. If 
current trends continue, analysts say, the nation will experience a technology 
deficit that could lead to more anemic manufacturing in certain industries and, 
ultimately, a decreased standard of living. America's loss of dominance in 
consumer electronics and automobiles is the point of the wedge, the experts 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Others say <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is not lagging, that the country is pre-eminent in several 
cutting-edge fields such as biotechnology and computers. Rather, the world is 
simply catching up -- a positive development. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the debate are statistics compiled by the federal Patent and 
<ORGANIZATION>Trademark Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. An increasing number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents are 
being awarded to foreign residents and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, of the 77,925 patents issued (excluding grants for plants and 
designs), <PERCENT>48%</PERCENT> were awarded to nonresidents. Japan received the most (16,158, or 
<PERCENT>21%</PERCENT>), followed by <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> (<PERCENT>9%</PERCENT>), the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> (<PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> each). 
</P>
<P>
This invention snapshot contrasts sharply with the picture 25 years before, 
when <PERCENT>18.6%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents were awarded to foreigners. Patent grants to 
foreigners will reach the <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> mark "within the next few years," predicts 
<PERSON>Herbert Wamsley</PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Intellectual Property Owners</ORGANIZATION>, a 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the percentage of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents to foreigners rising, but the number 
of patents granted to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businesses and individuals is generally declining -- 
though there's been an uptick since <DATE>1982</DATE>. Last year for example, 40,497 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
patents for mechanical, chemical or electrical applications were granted to 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> residents. Fifteen years ago there were 51,504. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Japanese companies have been particularly active in targeting 
-- and winning -- patents in such areas as consumer electronics, automotive and 
photo optics. In the category of internal combustion engines, for example, 
Japanese companies won <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> patents issued in <DATE>1987</DATE>, while <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
companies received <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>. Ten years earlier, the shares were the exact reverse. 
</P>
<P>
A company routinely seeks patents in countries where it sells its products to 
keep others from making, using or selling the invention. 
</P>
<P>
Although the patent stats are in black and white, opposing sides of the 
"Is-American-inventiveness-slipping?" debate draw conclusions of different 
shades. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who see little cause for alarm is <PERSON>Richard Nelson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henry Luce</PERSON> 
professor of <ORGANIZATION>International Political Economy</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>. For one 
thing, he notes, Japanese companies traditionally apply for more patents per 
innovation -- and receive them -- than do <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historical Anomaly 
</P>
<P>
Nelson also believes that the figures show the correction of a historical 
anomaly -- the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pre-eminence in technology and manufacturing after World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Shattered by the war, it took <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> more than 15 years to catch up 
to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in trading and industrial output. What we are witnessing, 
<PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said, is the rapid industrialization of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> relative to 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, coupled with the globalization of the world's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, he said, are applying for more and more patents in the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> because they sell more and more products here. The amount of 
inventing in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is also going up, relative to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose (these developments) bother our sensitivities quite a bit. But the 
sense of lost leadership . . . doesn't bother me," <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said. "Why should it? 
It makes for a more complex and balanced world for us to live in, not one 
that's necessarily detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON>'s view is <PERSON>Edwin Mansfield</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Economics 
and Technology</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>. "I think it's true that the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is not as dominant as it was before . . . but there are advantages to 
having a strong competitive <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and a strong <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. So I think it isn't as 
worrisome as some make out."

<FP=106> [From the "National News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] [Reporter] This reporter has learned from the 
department concerned that since <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> promulgated its Patent Law 
10 years ago, the legitimate rights and interests of 
patent-holders of all countries have been effectively protected 
in this country. According to <ORGANIZATION>Supreme People's Court</ORGANIZATION> President 
<PERSON>Ren Jianxin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s courts at various levels have handled some 
1,900 cases of patent disputes and some 1,600 have been settled 
as of the end of <DATE>1993</DATE>. At the same time, the patent 
administrative organs at various levels handled more than 2,200 
patent dispute cases and settled some 1,700 of them. The 
serious handling of a large number of patent cases has protected 
the legitimate rights and interests of patent-holders, yielding 
a good effect at home and abroad. Some patent-holders involved 
in patent disputes have the following to say: 
  [<PERSON>Wang Yongmin</PERSON>, identified by screen caption as inventor of 
the five-stroke Chinese character identifier] It has been 10 
years since the Patent Law promulgation. The law has protected 
the patent of the five-stroke Chinese character identifier. 
Many factories have signed agreements with me. One or two 
factories that did not and violated my patent rights have been 
fined by the court. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Zhang Li</ORGANIZATION>, identified by screen caption as inventor of the 
Lunar Vehicle brand magnetic massager] In my view, we must not 
tolerate patent violators. We should use the law as a weapon to 
effectively protect patent right and sternly deal with the 
violators. However, the Patent Law's implementation is not yet 
fully satisfactory. Many people do not understand the Patent 
Law. It is necessary to step up the publicity for it and make 
it known to everyone. 
  [Reporter] <ORGANIZATION>Director China Patent Office Gao Lulin</ORGANIZATION> believes 
that the increase of patent disputes indicates both an enhanced 
awareness of self-protection on the part of the patent-holders 
and the ignorance of many people with respect to patent. For 
this reason, the number of patent dispute cases will continue to 
rise.

<HEAD>Race For Cold Cash From Cold Fusion Leaves Some Scholars Cold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traditional academic openness is going by the
boards in the race to understand cold nuclear fusion as scholars
withhold findings that could make them big money.
   A broad patent on cold nuclear fusion could be worth <MONEY>billions of
dollars</MONEY> if the invention turns out to provide a new way of
producing cheap, clean and abundant energy.
   But the lure of money is inhibiting exploration of cold fusion
claims by making researchers withhold information to protect their
patent positions, lawyers and scholars said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that once you dangle
out that pot of gold called a patent it causes people to publish
less and disclose less,'' said <PERSON>Donald Chisum</PERSON>, a patent expert at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Washington</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists trying to test the cold fusion claims announced at a
press conference last month have been stymied because the two
researchers have withheld important details of their work.
   The <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION> applied for three patents even before the
<DATE>March 23</DATE> news conference featuring its own <PERSON>B. Stanley Pons</PERSON> and his
co-investigator, <PERSON>Martin Fleischmann</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Southampton</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> said this week it has
applied for patents on work done by a researcher named <PERSON>Peter
Hagelstein</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young University</ORGANIZATION> plans to apply for patents as well,
although mainly to establish the credibility of its researcher,
<PERSON>Steven Jones</PERSON>, rather than to make money, spokesman <PERSON>Paul Richards</PERSON>
said.
   Pons and <PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON> announced they had achieved fusion using
ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature _ so-called cold
fusion. They said their device produced four watts of energy for
every watt it used.
   Previously, it was believed that fusion would have to take place
at extremely high temperatures. The announcement stunned scientists
worldwide who had worked for years to achieve fusion.
   Widespread skepticism about their findings has continued despite
partial confirmation by other researchers. Still, the stakes are so
high that virtually every major chemical research laboratory is
believed to be looking into it.
   ``It's almost unknowable, unthinkable how much it would be
worth,'' said <PERSON>John Bockris</PERSON>, a chemistry professor at <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bockris also said he was upset by the way the focus on patents
had disrupted the normal scientific disclosure process.
   Patent lawyers usually advise clients to file for patents before
they disclose anything publicly. Secrecy helps even after a patent
application is filed, because it gives the inventors time to modify
their application with new findings or to file for more patents.
   ``The more information you give out, the more can be used
against you,'' <PERSON>Chisum</PERSON> said. ``From a patent law perspective,
publication is bad.''
   <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the school applied
for patents mainly so the <ORGANIZATION>Patent and Trademark Office</ORGANIZATION> has a chance
to sort out what he called false allegations that its <PERSON>Steven Jones</PERSON>
stole <PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Pons</PERSON>' work. <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> said <PERSON>Brigham Young</PERSON> did
not believe cold fusion was likely to be very valuable commercially.
   Richards claimed that <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION> officials held their
<DATE>March 23</DATE> news conference despite an agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION>
officials that the schools would keep quiet about their work until
<DATE>March 24</DATE>, the day they had agreed to ship back-to-back papers on
cold fusion to the British journal Nature.
   Richards and several patent lawyers said the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Utah</ORGANIZATION>'s unusual press conference appeared to be more of a grab for
publicity than anything.
   ``I think they just naively thought they could pull this off,
and go down in history as the first ones to have done this,''
<PERSON>Richards</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>James Brophy</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>University of Utah</ORGANIZATION>'s director of research,
said the school held the news conference because there had been
leaks and ``I was concerned and others were concerned that the
story would get out in an uncontrolled fashion.''
   Any royalties from <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s patents will be split evenly three
ways between <PERSON>Fleischmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pons</PERSON>, the chemistry department, and
the university as a whole. That is the usual procedure, <PERSON>Brophy</PERSON> said.
   The concern for profit on campus accelerated in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> with
biotechnology, which made a fast transition from pure research to
product. <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> earn <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> a year on the so-called
Cohen-Boyers atent on gene-splicing techniques.
   The revolution in high-temperature superconductivity dragged
universities even closer to the commercial sphere.
Superconductivity is the ability to transmit electricity through a
substance without any loss of power, or resistance.
   Last year, for example, <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont Co.</ORGANIZATION> paid <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> to the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Houston</ORGANIZATION> for exclusive rights to <PERSON>Paul Chu</PERSON>'s
superconductivity patent applications.

<HL> Japan Finally Gives Credit to Its 'Edison'
---
Inventor Was A Pariah
Until Discovered by U.S.

By Stephen Kreider Yoder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<DATELINE> SENDAI, Japan  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For three decades, Japanese industry all but ignored <PERSON>Junichi Nishizawa</PERSON>'s inventions. 
Bureaucrats thwarted his patent applications; a hostile academic community blackballed him. 

   His offense? 
He was young and outspoken -- qualities valued in the West but often resented in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
His ideas too often clashed with accepted theories. 
But if <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> abhors open criticism, it also reveres the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as the source of innovation. 
So when the Americans discovered <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, his reputation at home was transformed almost overnight from pariah to national hero. 

   "Companies here would still rather look to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>," says the 61-year-old professor at <LOCATION>Sendai</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Tohoku University</ORGANIZATION>. 
"They don't believe in the Japanese." 

   Today, <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> appears regularly on television documentaries. 
Foreign and domestic awards adorn his office walls, his students are eagerly sought by electronics giants. 
The inventor of dozens of novel electronic devices, <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> has been dubbed "the Edison of modern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>" by one business magazine. 

   His story is a familiar one in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
In a kind of perverse "not invented here" syndrome, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> has often ignored its own innovators, looking instead to the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> for technological ideas. 
Bright young Japanese scientists are stifled by the hierarchy and consensus system that helped produce the country's powerful economy. 

   But now <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is beginning to recognize it needs unconventional thinkers to help spark creativity in its industry. 
Says <PERSON>Genya Chiba</PERSON>, director at the <ORGANIZATION>government-run Research Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>: "The controversial figures are the ones we're looking for." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> fits that mold. 
Says <PERSON>Jim Harris</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> electronics professor: "He pursued the unconventional, probably far more than anyone else in the Japanese electronics industry." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> has sparked controversy from his student days. 
As a graduate researcher at <ORGANIZATION>Tohoku University</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE> he proposed a novel device that he called a PIN diode, a precursor to many semiconductor devices. 
But the 24-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON>'s theory had a major flaw -- it rebutted a widely accepted American theory. 
American science was gospel here in <DATE>1949</DATE>. 
Challenging it was heresy. 

   Japanese researchers were scandalized. 
<PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON>'s youthful self-confidence only fueled their outrage. 
Outrage turned to ostracism. 
Scientists challenged him in public, while back at the lab, peers spread rumors that he was fabricating research data. 

   "In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, wisdom comes with age. 
People saw him as a young wise guy," says <PERSON>Atsushi Abe</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION> manager who studied under <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON>. 

   American labs eventually confirmed <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON>'s PIN-diode findings, but he remained a pariah for years, especially at such influential institutions as the <ORGANIZATION>University of Tokyo</ORGANIZATION>. 

   In <DATE>1953</DATE>, for instance, <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> invented a photodiode, a tiny light-emitting device, and took it to several Japanese corporate labs. 
They weren't interested. 
"<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> hasn't even made one of these," <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> recalls one official telling him. 
"There's no reason <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should be able to." 

   When <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> announced at a <DATE>1964</DATE> meeting that light would flow though glass strands -- now called optical fibers-- he was laughed off the podium. 
Later, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s patent office repeatedly rejected his patent applications for a type of optical fiber. 
The refusal, he argues, allowed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> inventors to patent the vital discovery first. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> persevered. 
From his independent <ORGANIZATION>Semiconductor Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>, set up in <LOCATION>Sendai</LOCATION> in <DATE>1961</DATE>, he turned out inventions and theories and urged them on a reluctant industry -- often unsuccessfully. 
"He had very good ideas but he pushed them too hard and too fast," says <PERSON>Hisao Oka</PERSON>, general manager of research and development at <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Electric Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"He was playing the flute, but no one was dancing." 

   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> began unleashing a barrage of criticism at <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s universities and companies, which he accuses of suffocating creativity and ignoring indigenous ideas. 
While such rhetoric raised eyebrows at home, the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> began to take note of <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON>'s inventions. 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, he says, were first to show interest in a device called the static induction transistor, or SIT. 

   And in <DATE>1983</DATE>, the California-based <ORGANIZATION>Electrical Power Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> agreed to test a Nishizawa device called an SI thyristor after Japanese companies had refused even to look at it. 
The same year, the <ORGANIZATION>American Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</ORGANIZATION> honored <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> for his work on semiconductors. 

   Later in <DATE>1983</DATE> came rumors that he was a Nobel Prize nominee. 
He didn't get the prize, but the speculation brought him new status at home. 
The Japanese government awarded him a coveted culture prize; companies that had earlier shunned him fell over each other to get at his devices. 

   And as more and more of his former students hold influential jobs among <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s electronics giants, industry support for him is growing. 
"Every big maker has some kind of connection to <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON>," says a <ORGANIZATION>Sanyo Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> official. 

   Indeed, so closely associated has he become with technological innovation that mere rumors he is advising a company can send stock prices soaring. 
Shares of firms that use the professor's inventions are called "Nishizawa stocks." 

   Despite his hard-won fame, <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> still has plenty of critics in both <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
They denounce him as a self-promoter who overrates his discoveries -- few of which, they say, have yet resulted in practical products. 

   "<PERSON>Mr. 
Nishizawa</PERSON> has lots of grand ideas. 
He's always announcing: 'I did, I did it,' but then you don't see his ideas being carried out," says Japanese corporate executive who requests anonymity. 

   Adds an electronics specialist at a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> university, who also asked that his name not be printed, "He champions what he does very enthusiastically. 
But I don't think anybody in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would say he's made major contributions to silicon technology." 

   Though most of his detractors maintain a public silence about him these days, <PERSON>Mr. Nishizawa</PERSON> isn't under any illusion that their number is dwindling. 
In fact, he considers one assessment that "<PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the people" are against him as optimistic. 

   "It's still <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> enemies," he says. 
"I'll be doing battle to the day I die."

FT  29 APR 92 / World Trade News: Finns invest Pounds 24m in TV tubes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>NOKIA Consumer Electronics</ORGANIZATION>, the third biggest maker of televisions in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, is investing Pounds 24m in a television picture tube factory in
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
The company is to adapt production lines at its <LOCATION>Esslingen</LOCATION> factory to make
picture tubes for wide screen TV, which European electronics manufacturers
hope will be the next mass-selling consumer product in the television
market.
<ORGANIZATION>Nokia</ORGANIZATION>, a Finnish group, will also build a 6,000 square metre extension to
the factory and install highly-automated <ORGANIZATION>Black Matrix</ORGANIZATION> tube machinery. The
<ORGANIZATION>Black Matrix</ORGANIZATION> technology produces improved screen resolution, colour and
contrast. Its introduction will make <LOCATION>Esslingen</LOCATION> one of the most advanced tube
plants in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Production of the picture tubes on the 16:9 screen format will start by the
end of <DATE>1993</DATE>. The plant will also continue producing tubes for conventional
square-shaped 4:3 television sets.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Nokia</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch electronics group, and <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION>, the
French group, have been selling 16:9 wide-screen TV sets since <DATE>September</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> is the only maker currently producing 16:9 picture tubes. <ORGANIZATION>Nokia</ORGANIZATION>'s
investment comes when European electronics companies are suffering from
sluggish consumer demand which has led to makers holding unusually high
inventories of about two-months' worth of production.
But <ORGANIZATION>Nokia</ORGANIZATION> expects demand for its conventional picture tubes to increase,
partly because European manufacturers are able to meet only about 8 per cent
of indigenous demand. Far eastern manufacturers supply the rest of the
market. It also expects demand for 16:9 picture tubes to increase as the
wide screen TV market grows.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MATSUSHITA'S VISION GOES BEYOND HORIZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, one of the world's largest 
consumer electronics firms, interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the giant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
entertainment company? 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the answer is easy. Matsushita, with <MONEY>$44 billion</MONEY> in annual 
sales, wants films and TV shows it can sell along with televisions and VCRs in 
all parts of the globe and songs to go with its stereo and compact disc 
players. 
</P>
<P>
And if it pays up to <MONEY>$7.5 billion</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> will get films and songs 
in abundance. <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, with <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> in sales, owns <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios</ORGANIZATION> ("Back to 
the Future," "Field of Dreams," "Jaws," "E.T." and many more), plus an enormous 
library of television programs that includes "Murder She Wrote" and "<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 
Vice," plus one of the largest record companies in the world, plus the 
<ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios Tour</ORGANIZATION> theme parks. In a single purchase, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> would buy 
a worldwide distribution system for films and records, an incomparable value. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>'s reasons go beyond the short term. It is looking at the 
development of home entertainment technology -- at high-definition television 
and, later, more complex, computer-like instruments. There's vision in 
<LOCATION>Matsushita</LOCATION>'s moves. 
</P>
<P>
The deal isn't signed yet, and merger talks involving <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> have fallen through 
in the past. Still, something is afoot. So we should understand what the deeper 
implications are. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days you may hear a lot of noise about <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> buying up <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
movie studios. But chances are the noise will miss the underlying issue, which 
is vision in Japanese business and lack of vision in American business. 
</P>
<P>
So why does <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> want to own <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>'s films and shows? That's essentially 
the same question that was asked a year ago when <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Pictures</ORGANIZATION>. 
And the answer is that humble products change and develop -- the phonograph 
becomes the stereo and then becomes the compact disc player. The mundane TV set 
is becoming high-definition television and nowhere more prominently than at 
<LOCATION>Matsushita</LOCATION>, which employs HDTV's inventor, <PERSON>Takashi Fujio</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Owning the programing is important because it gives you something to show on 
the advanced TV set and also persuades producers to film for your new 
technology. "If you get the technology going, producers will begin shooting 
HDTV because they think of the rerun market, of the future value of their 
product," says a senior television executive. 
</P>
<P>
The vision used to be American. When <ORGANIZATION>Radio Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> originated radio, 
it also created the <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION> to have something to broadcast; 
when the same RCA developed color television, it pushed programmers to film in 
color. But, sadly, RCA lost its vision, declined and ultimately sold out to 
<ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION>, which unloaded its TV-making business. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>'s vision looks beyond tomorrow's marketplace to what its annual 
report calls "emerging new products in audio-visual technology, including 
liquid crystal and digital TV. "Our long-range plans encompass 
computer-controlled audio visual and home automation systems. We will 
revitalize the home electronics market." 
</P>
<P>
What do reruns of "Jaws" have to do with computers? Plenty, says <PERSON>Paul Saffo</PERSON>, 
research fellow of the Institute for the Future, a <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, research 
firm. "Entertainment programing is better at getting computer-like machines 
into the home than more technical software," says <PERSON>Saffo</PERSON>. "Just look at <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> 
and its game systems." 
</P>
<P>
With <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION>, of course, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> would buy great libraries of entertainment 
software. But the <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> deal would be only one part of the mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> made another, much smaller deal. It agreed to 
invest in <LOCATION>Owl International</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Bellevue</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, software company that makes a 
"hypermedia engine." That's an electronic equivalent of a library card 
catalogue, allowing you to pick programing through your TV set-computer. So you 
might come home some future night, flick on a screen in your wall and choose to 
view the Battle of <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON> or the life of a Chinese empress. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it's a long leap from <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>'s negotiation with <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> to the coming 
of walk-in television. But nobody doubts that information technology will 
develop massively in this decade, that computers and communications will come 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> understands that. In an interview in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> two years ago, 
<PERSON>Masayuki Nakajima</PERSON>, director of engineering at <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita's Central Research 
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, summed up the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest inventions of the 20th Century are the semiconductor and the 
laser," he said. "The semiconductor has brought progress in the field of 
computers and the laser has contributed directly to communications. We are 
devoted to progress in both." 
</P>
<P>
Now, lots of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies think like <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>; the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> electronics and 
computer industry sees the trend of technology. But are <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies acting 
on their vision as <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> is? If the TV set and the TV show make a good 
combination in consumer electronics, why does NBC no longer have the TV sets? 
Why is <ORGANIZATION>MCA</ORGANIZATION> for sale and not <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>?

<HL> Japanese Firm to Stop Selling TVs to GE
In Price Dispute Over Higher Yen Value

<TEXT>
   A big Japanese television maker will stop supplying color sets to <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> because of a dispute over how a sharply higher yen value should be reflected in the price. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, sought to increase prices on sets sold to <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> for resale in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> under the <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> brand name. 
The price increase was necessary, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> said, because of the significant rise in the yen's value against the dollar. 
But <LOCATION>Fairfield</LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> wanted a price reduction, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> said. 
<ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the reasons for the impasse. 

   The development may signal a stronger resolve by Japanese consumer electronics concerns to raise the price of goods that they sell in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Moreover, it may mark the beginning of significant gains in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market for consumer electronic products from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, where currencies haven't experienced the sharp reevaluations that the yen has. 

   For <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>, the move may lead to increased domestic production of televisions by its <ORGANIZATION>RCA Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit. 
Before <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> bought RCA, it had announced plans to stop making television sets. 

   With a <PERCENT>66%</PERCENT> jump in the yen's value since its low in <DATE>February 1985</DATE>, Japanese manufacturing cost in dollars has climbed substantially. 
Theoretically, the price in dollars for Japanese goods should rise in response. 
Indeed, some companies increased prices last year but not enough to offset the strong yen; prices for consumers, however, in some cases, fell. 

   Some Japanese makers, including <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>, have attempted through efficiency gains to blunt the need for price increases. 
In an effort to maintain market share, some companies have also sliced profit margins rather than raise prices. 
"There has been an ongoing program of making every attempt to increase productivity," said a spokesman for <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON>. 
"We have made every effort possible to improve distribution." 

   Yet the Matsushita-GE impasse indicates that some Japanese manufacturers may now have decided to draw the line. 
"There is a certain pressure point that you reach and we have reached it," the <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> spokesman said. 
"We could give no more." 
Matsushita also sells electronic products in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> under the brand names Quasar, <ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Technics</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>David Lachenbruch</PERSON>, editorial director of <ORGANIZATION>Television Digest</ORGANIZATION>, a trade publication, said the development is "just the beginning" and predicted "tremendous upheaval" in the consumer electronics market. 
"The Japanese have been absorbing this change (in currency valuation), and they can't do it forever," he said. 
"Their shareholders won't let them." 
There clearly is pressure on some Japanese companies from an earnings standpoint. 
For example, <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s consolidated earnings tumbled <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT> in the fiscal year ended <DATE>Oct. 31</DATE> to the equivalent of <MONEY>$257 million</MONEY>. 

   Indeed, other evidence of the upheaval is already apparent as the industry begins to make adjustments. 
The most dramatic change appears to be the ascendency of other manufacturers, particularly South Korean concerns, to whom American consumer electronics companies are increasingly turning for supplies. 
For the 10 months ending <DATE>Oct. 31</DATE>, imports of fully assembled color televisions from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> rose <PERCENT>43.4%</PERCENT> from the year-earlier period, while Japanese imports fell <PERCENT>4.9%</PERCENT>, said <PERSON>Mr. Lachenbruch</PERSON>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Emerson Radio Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's biggest importers of consumer electronics products, has changed suppliers "in a small number of cases," said <PERSON>Stephen Lane</PERSON>, president. 
There has been no wholesale switching, however, because the Japanese have been absorbing much of the effect of the rising yen. 
In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Emerson Radio</ORGANIZATION> has traditionally bought supplies from companies throughout the <LOCATION>Orient</LOCATION>, and has built currency hedges into its contracts to protect itself. 

   A spokesman for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arm of <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Samsung Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said "we expect to be able to take advantage of this <MONEY>dollar yen</MONEY> problem" this year. 
Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Samsung</ORGANIZATION> said its opportunity to expand its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market share was limited only by its inventories. 
"We could have sold everything we could have gotten our hands on," the spokesman said. 
"This year, we are in a much better supply situation." 

   In <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>'s case, the company said one of its options is to seek supplies elsewhere, presumably including other nations. 

   Ironically, in an effort to adjust to the higher yen values, even the Japanese are turning to <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> for supplies, industry officials said. 
"The Japanese are using Korean manufacturing to build some of their components," said the spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Samsung</ORGANIZATION>, which is supplying some Japanese firms. 

   Moreover, most major Japanese concerns have rapidly moved production, or at least, final assembly, to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Sony</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has announced plans to expand its color-TV plant in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> has two facilities, including one in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, to serve the <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> contract. 
Manufacturing the products here doesn't fully immunize the Japanese from the yen's effect because some parts are still made in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and shipped to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for assembly. 

   With its acquisition of RCA, a major consumer electronics player, <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> could obtain supplies from its unit. 
For the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> has been rapidly automating its huge final-assembly plant in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>. 
The company makes TV chassis in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, where labor costs are low. 
It makes picture tubes in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and cabinets in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> declined to comment on the number of sets supplied under the existing contract. 

   Separately, in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. International Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> ruled that imports of color-television picture tubes from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> may be hurting domestic makers and their workers. 

   The preliminary decisions, made in response to complaints filed by several <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade unions, mean that the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> will continue to investigate charges that the imports have been sold at unfairly low prices in violation of the anti-dumping act. 
If both agencies conclude that the imports are in violation of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade law, anti-dumping duties may be ordered on them. 

   Officials at the commission said the imports from all four countries totaled about <MONEY>$133 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>first nine months of last year</DATE>, up from <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> during all of <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> is the largest foreign supplier, followed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.

IN-CAR VIDEO SCREEN SMALL BUT CRITICS QUESTION SAFETY

<TEXT>
<P>
In the near future, motorists may see something entirely new when they look at 
their windshields -- a television show that appears to float above the road. It 
may sound farfetched, but <PERSON>Jay Schiffman</PERSON>, an electrical engineer at <ORGANIZATION>Auto Vision 
Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ferndale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, has recently received a patent for a device that 
could make it possible. 
</P>
<P>
Called AutoVision, the video system consists of a tiny mirror positioned on the 
windshield above the driver's line of sight to reflect the picture shown by a 
small projector located near the dome light. "The whole thing depends on the 
size, position, and the shape of the mirror," <PERSON>Schiffman</PERSON> said. "It is small 
enough to see around, mounted high enough on the windshield to see under, and 
the curve of its surface creates the illusion that the television image is 
hovering about 15 feet in front of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the feasibility of the technology, the obvious question of the safety of 
a car TV is already being debated by experts. The consensus so far is that the 
device appears to be safe but is not without potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Its safety hinges on the optical illusion it creates, called a "virtual image" 
by psychologists, which makes AutoVision's TV image seem to be just another 
part of the landscape. It is as if a small piece of the scenery had been cut 
out and a television screen put in its place. The illusion also makes the 
picture seem much larger than it actually is, allowing the driver to watch the 
screen comfortably without it monopolizing his attention. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to whatever else the driver wishes to view, a small video camera 
mounted near AutoVision's projection unit is pointed at the dashboard and feeds 
the projector. The device is used to display a picture of the dashboard onto 
the screen. By selecting this option, drivers can check their speed, adjust the 
air conditioning, or even tune the radio without taking their eyes off the 
road. This type of readout, known as a "head-up display," has been used on jet 
fighters for over 30 years, and is claimed to make the operation of supersonic 
aircraft safer by allowing pilots to check their instruments while still 
watching where they are going. 
</P>
<P>
People who have tested AutoVision say the matchbook-size mirror blocks far less 
of the windshield than the sun visor and is no more distracting than the 
overhead signs on a highway. However, the real magic of this invention may be 
the fact that it concentrates driver attention on the road ahead. "The view of 
the road surrounding the television image always remains in focus," the 
inventor said, "and a driver whose interest is captured by what is going on in 
front of the car is not likely to let his eyes wander off the road." 
</P>
<P>
The panel of independent psychologists and traffic safety specialists now 
evaluating the device for AutoVision generally agree that there is little 
danger in having the mirror on the windshield. However, some members of the 
group have stressed the need for further research on what images should be 
shown and under what conditions the device should be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have no objection to using this device to display a picture of the 
dashboard," said <PERSON>Dr. Herschel Leibowitz</PERSON>, an experimental psychologist at 
<ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania State University</ORGANIZATION>, who has tested AutoVision. "I can even see how 
the television function might be beneficial in stimulating drivers who are 
bored and in danger of falling asleep. However, misuse might be dangerous, 
especially if the driver was drinking, or was distracted in heavy traffic or 
with pedestrians present." 
</P>
<P>
The objection that watching television while driving will distract drivers and 
delay their reactions is the most common criticism of AutoVision. But <PERSON>Schiffman</PERSON> 
said, "We have been testing AutoVision for several years, and over 200 people 
have driven the prototype cars a total of 175,000 miles without a single 
incident. Our experience and research have shown that when a person watching 
AutoVision sees a potential hazard in the same visual area as the screen, he 
automatically shifts his attention to the problem. The first call of mankind is 
to preserve its own skin. It is a natural reaction." 
</P>
<P>
A driver can watch AutoVision and drive at the same time because most of the 
information needed to follow a television program comes from the audio portion 
of the broadcast. "You do a sort of time sharing, and actually look at the 
screen only a small fraction of the time," explains the inventor. "But even 
when you glance at the picture to fill in some details, everything on the road 
ahead remains in full view and completely in focus." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for AutoVision first came to <PERSON>Schiffman</PERSON> while he was doing research on 
head-up display units designed for aircraft. In order to discover how these 
displays might be distracting to pilots, he installed one in a panel truck and 
began driving with it. "The electronics for that first unit took up almost the 
entire back of the truck, and while the research I wanted to do was never 
funded, I did discover that if I put the right type of image in the right 
location, I could safely drive while watching television." 
</P>
<P>
As his work progressed, and with the advent of transistors and printed 
circuits, <PERSON>Schiffman</PERSON> reduced the dimensions of the projection unit to the size 
of a book. 
</P>
<P>
He also developed other types of head-up displays, such as the <ORGANIZATION>Bendix Blind 
Landing System</ORGANIZATION> (to which he holds the patent), a device that allows pilots 
flying in fog to see an electronically generated image of the runway they are 
approaching. But even with this impressive background, he had to work at 
convincing scientists, traffic officials and investors that his invention was 
practical. "Most of them found the idea of AutoVision hard to believe, but when 
I got them in a car and let them drive with it, they immediately saw its 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Schiffman</PERSON> believes that the story of AutoVision could very well parallel that 
of the car radio. In <DATE>1929</DATE>, <PERSON>Bill Lear</PERSON> (later of jet aircraft fame) presented his 
boss, <PERSON>Paul Galvin</PERSON>, with the first radio designed for use in an automobile. 
<PERSON>Galvin</PERSON>'s immediate response was, "They'll never be allowed in cars. There will 
be laws against them." But <PERSON>Lear</PERSON> was determined, and despite predictions from 
traffic authorities in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that there would be nationwide bans on car 
radios, his invention was a success and formed the basis of what would later 
become the <ORGANIZATION>Motorola Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Some cities actually did pass laws against using 
radios while driving, but every one of these laws was eventually repealed, and 
today <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> of all cars are equipped with a radio. 
</P>
<P>
With 300 million motor vehicles now operating worldwide and 30 million new cars 
being built each year, the economic possibilities for AutoVision are enormous. 
</P>

"If the safety issues are resolved, the market for AutoVision should be similar 
to the one for car stereo systems," said <PERSON>Ron Pherigo</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Electronics Assn</ORGANIZATION>. But others fear that this is another multibillion-dollar 
industry that could be lost if the fear of liability suits forces the 
technology overseas, to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, where few laws exist that would limit 
the use of the device. 
</P>
<P>
The safety consultants and traffic officials who have begun to evaluate 
AutoVision believe that some form of the apparatus could be used in cars in the 
near future. But no one is sure exactly what we will see when we look at that 
tiny screen. Some recommend that video cameras be used to televise the blind 
spots between a car's mirrors, while others suggest that maps could be 
projected on the screen and the car's location plotted by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine it being used as an entertainment device, but with carefully 
defined programming," said Prof. <PERSON>D. Alfred Owens</PERSON>, a psychologist specializing 
in human perception and traffic safety at <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marshall College</ORGANIZATION>. "This 
device provides an opportunity to develop an entirely new mode of broadcasting 
that considers the driver's situation and actually enhances driver attention." 
</P>
<P>
If the television option is proved safe for widespread use, proponents say, 
AutoVision will change the way we experience driving. It can make extended 
trips seem shorter, calm people caught in traffic jams and even keep drivers 
alert during long, boring trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we need to know about this device can be researched," <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> said. 
"In fact, if you will pardon the pun, this new technology is going to drive us 
to learn more about how humans operate automobiles."

<TEXT>
   The latest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company to drop out was mighty <ORGANIZATION>General Electric
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which decided in <DATE>1987</DATE> that the <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> television lines were
not ``core'' businesses and sold them to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Thomson SA</ORGANIZATION>.
   It was widely assumed that if <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> got out of televisions, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>,
at a tenth the size, could not be far behind. Some Wall Street
analysts became exasperated when <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> hung onto the money-losing
business after all.
   <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> gets half its more than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> in annual sales from
personal computers and related equipment. Surprisingly, it sold more
AT-compatible personal computers last year than anyone, including
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>.
   Thanks to computers, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> expects to make a small pre-tax
profit this year for the first time since <DATE>1984</DATE>. But its consumer
electronics business, mainly TVs, has been running in the red.
   <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> says foreign companies are dumping TVs here at illegally
low prices and accuses the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> of failing to enforce
penalties against the alleged dumpers.
   Whatever the reason, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> is short on money for investment and
most likely will never manufacture complete high-definition
televisions. Its more modest goal is to get its proposed HDTV
transmission system established as a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> standard, which could win
it big royalties from the companies that actually make the TVs.
   <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> also has a highly praised and patented technology for
sharp, bright computer screens, which it hopes to supply to HDTV
makers. <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> is asking the federal government for <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> so
it can make the screens big enough to be used in the new televisions
as well as in military equipment and air traffic control towers.
   Unfortunately for <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies, the Japanese
have built up a nearly insurmountable lead in many aspects of the
technology.
   ``HDTV is not just one technology. It's thousands of
technologies. And the Japanese have ended up by dominating every
single one of those markets,'' said <PERSON>Richard J. Elkus Jr.</PERSON>, chairman
and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Prometrix Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and
co-chairman of an <ORGANIZATION>American Electronics Association</ORGANIZATION> task force on
HDTV.
   Some analysts are skeptical of groups such as Rebuild America
that urge <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies to take the plunge into HDTV on patriotic
grounds. Even if an American company did get into the business, it
would probably have to buy many or most of the components from the
Japanese, they say.
   ``Open up your typical PC from <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>. Do you see products that are
made in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>? You bet,'' said <PERSON>Balog</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> analyst.
   As for <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>, although it says its television business is not up
for sale, it negotiated earlier this year with potential European
and Asian buyers.
   The talks reportedly broke down mainly because the governments of
the foreign parties ruled out a purchase, fearing it would stir up
anger among American voters and hurt trade relations.
   <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s appeal as the last U.S.-based company in the TV business
is itself rather fuzzy. Most companies in the TV business today are
transnational. <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> has major operations in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>,
while <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and others have thousands of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> workers.
   Although it is Dutch, for example, <ORGANIZATION>NV Philips</ORGANIZATION> says it has more
than 12,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> employees in television-related businesses,
including 350 doing research and development.
   Citing the threat to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> electronics industry, <ORGANIZATION>Rebuild
America</ORGANIZATION> says the federal government should support a U.S.-based
company or companies in manufacturing high-definition televisions.
   The support could take the form of loans, shared research,
guaranteed purchases or some combination of those, Rebuild's
<PERSON>Branfman</PERSON> said.
   The threat to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> electronics is unquestionable. Some of it,
however, stems from such fundamental problems as the inadequate <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
educational system, the short-term perspective of investors and
managers and the high cost of money, none of which is addressed by
government support.
   ``Where American companies have been successful, they've had
great technology and great marketing. We shouldn't use trade
barriers or subsidies as a substitute for those,'' said <PERSON>Doug van
Dorsten</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> analyst in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Elkus</PERSON>, who helped invent the videocassette recorder while at
<ORGANIZATION>Ampax Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, concedes the difficulties but says a U.S.-based
consumer electronics industry is indispensable.
   In this scenario, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> is an indicator of which way things are
headed, more so than a major force in its own right.
   ``To really get our feet back in this (HDTV) market we're going
to be talking about something well in excess of a <MONEY>billion dollars</MONEY>,
well in excess,'' he said.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> will not save the world. This is a problem that's so
much bigger than <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> that you can't imagine.''

<HL> The Patent Truth in Poland: Inventors
Find That Brilliance Is Hard to Market

   "Here's a merry-go-round," says <PERSON>Bronislawa Fitak</PERSON>. 
"Here's a butterfly. 
A shovel. 
A hairdryer. 
Here's a swan. 
A hang glider. 
A kangaroo." 

   Standing behind a table in a friend's apartment, <PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON> flips, bends and stretches an object of unimaginable malleability into a succession of imaginary shapes. 
She invented the thing, known to her admirers as the Polish Rubik's Cube. 
It is made of paper. 

   <PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON>, who is 56 years old and has intense eyes, makes a sombrero and puts it on. 
She folded paper for years before perfecting her complex accordion. 
In <DATE>1983</DATE>, a journalist came across her entertaining some children. 
An article came out. 
Then television got interested. 

   "All <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> watched," she says. 
"Here's a birthday cake. 
Everybody liked it. 
Wine glass. 
Mushroom. 
That's where it ended. 
People just looked." 
She kneads the thing into a piano. 
"It also walks down stairs by itself," she says. 

   In <DATE>March</DATE>, <PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON>'s invention won Polish patent No. 42,195. 
But the Polish toy industry didn't beat a path to her door. 
Ideas like hers don't count for much in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
No company has to create demand or outsmart rivals. 
The toy industry makes toys already. 
Why make one more? 

   <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s economic reformers try to get the answer across. 
They want managers to care about profits. 
Managers don't. 
So reformers promote innovation with tax breaks. 
Managers yawn. 
Poles with new ideas make money only if their inventions are produced, and produce profits. 
Much of the time all they produce is a letdown. 

   "I can't stand listening to the rustle of paper anymore," says an inventor caught in the bureaucratic mill. 
"It isn't quite normal being an inventor. 
It would be better to go dancing." 

   Yet not even the polka suppresses the urge to invent. 
Hundreds of Poles keep at it. 
A few luck out: Of 76,993 patents granted by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, 13 came from here. 
The less lucky tinker bravely on, waiting for promised reforms to take hold. 
For moral support, they hang around their local inventors' club. 

   The <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> club is housed in a building with a wooden canopy above the entrance, a contrivance that prevents loose masonry from falling on visitors. 
In the meeting room, patent officer <PERSON>Przemyslaw Groszkowski</PERSON> sits drinking tea. 

   "Each company has a unit of technical progress," he says. 
"We should therefore have great technical progress." 
He looks up and laughs as a large man wearing a black shirt and a white tie comes in. 
"But we have a problem. 
It's easier to do things the old way. 
You might say <PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON> here has had some troubles." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON> (first name Wlodzimierz) sits heavily and laughs until he coughs. 
Then he lights a cigarette and tells his story. 

   "People say I have a technical imagination. 
I always ask myself, 'What can be improved?'" 

   Five years ago, <PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON> decided to improve the car. 
He came up with a device the size of a drinking glass that screws onto an engine and makes it burn gas better. 
It saves fuel. 
"We have a shortage of fuel here," he says. 
"You'd think I'd get help." 

   But no state company would consider the gadget without a prototype, and none would pay to build one. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON> had to borrow <MONEY>eight million zlotys</MONEY> (an average Pole earns that in 20 years) and build one himself. 
He patented it, and made the rounds again. 

   "The <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> car factory was interested," he says, "but they wouldn't produce it. 
It interfered with their plan." 

   Finally, <PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON> gave up on the state. 
He sold a license to <ORGANIZATION>Donau Trading Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a small, private maker of pipe connectors backed by Poles abroad. 
Donau cranked out 20,000 fuel-savers this year. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON>, still in debt, hasn't seen much money yet. 
So he's pursuing a new idea: the "anti-AIDS" syringe. 
"The construction makes it impossible to use more than once," he says, digging into his briefcase. 
"It will be good for drug addicts," he says. 
"At the moment, I'm trying to sell it," says <PERSON>Mr. Jaroszynski</PERSON>. 
"In <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, as usual, nobody's interested." 

   To climb out of this hole, a Polish inventor has two options. 
He can give the state precisely what it wants, or he can tell the state to get lost. 
<PERSON>Piotr Penczek</PERSON> picked option one. 
That's why he has 140 patents, more than anyone else in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 

   "If an invention is really new," he says, "the success rate is lower. 
When industry has to change something substantial, you get trouble. 
I strive to avoid such inventions." 

   Prof. <PERSON>Penczek</PERSON>, a restrained man with neat white hair, works at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Industrial Chemistry</ORGANIZATION>, one of the state's cumbrous research combines. 
He knows plastics. 
And he knows Polish managers. 
They all lack hard currency, so any invention that cuts imports or boosts exports excites them. 
They lack raw materials, so any invention that fills a supply gap gets produced. 
"The new idea isn't the main point," he says. 

   But it surely is the main point for <PERSON>Zbigniew Bogusz</PERSON>. 
He picked option two. 

   A loud alarm goes off as the gate of the <PERSON>Bogusz</PERSON> compound slides open one evening, revealing a flood-lit <PERSON>Mr. Bogusz</PERSON>. 
"I'm just back from <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION>," he says, walking past the house to his trinket factory. 
"The Germans were wide-eyed." 

   In the factory office, he pulls out the drawers of a tall case. 
Each contains buttons, earrings, necklaces, buckles, pins and pendants -- all adorned with metallic filigree. 
He says he has developed a process for applying patterns to any material of any shape. 
"Suddenly, it dawned on me," he says. 

   A year ago, he was a craftsman, working in leather. 
Now he privately mass produces costume jewelery and employs 30 people. 
He built his own machinery, though strangers don't get to see it: patent pending. 
"Nobody knows how to make things this way," <PERSON>Mr. Bogusz</PERSON> says. 
"I have to do it myself." 
What about the Polish state? 
"I've never tried. 
I don't like tilting at windmills." 

   But it's a rare Polish inventor who can go it alone. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON>, the toy inventor, is a retired seamstress with no spare cash and just one small comfort: If industry ignores her, television somehow doesn't. 

   "C'mon, get going!" says a voice over the studio loudspeaker. 
This is a taping of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s weekly kids' show; the director doesn't waste time. 
<PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON> sits under the lights surrounded by nine children. 
Each holds one of her paper doohickeys. 

   "I've come to show you a new toy," <PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON> says. 
"Look, a sea horse. 
Barbells. 
See what you get? 
Lighthouse. 
Umbrella." 

   She goes on and on. 
In awe, the kids try it themselves. 
A girl folds a bow, a boy folds a fan. 
"How many can you make?" asks one. 

   "I have 312," she says. 
"Hedgehog. 
I'm aiming at. . ." 

   "Okay, let's get rid of this lady," the loudspeaker cuts in. 

   <PERSON>Mrs. Fitak</PERSON> bundles off, leaving a few of her gizmos behind. 
A technician picks one up and folds it. 
A duck. 
His colleague picks up another. 
Hassock. 
Space helmet. 

   "You want to know something?" says the studio manager, folding up his top hat. 
"In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, you could make a <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY> with this thing. 
Not in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, unfortunately."

<HL> Small Business (A Special Report): The Dark Side --- The Good, the Bad and the Useless </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ron Iori </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   INVENTIONS are the mainstay of many small businesses, and sometimes the small businesses turn into big businesses. 
Take <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION>. 
Born in the garage of one of the founders, the company virtually invented the home-computer industry. 

   Not every invention is that successful, of course. 
Some are just plain wacky. 
Others are entirely practical but either aren't marketable or are ahead of their time. 

   Bathrooms seem to preoccupy many inventors. 
In <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Walter Hibbs</PERSON>'s ex-wife used to complain that he didn't put down the seat after using the toilet. 
So he developed Seat Down, a hydraulic device that is attached to the seat of the toilet. 
Lifting the seat activates a timer that slowly closes the seat over two minutes, which <PERSON>Mr. Hibbs</PERSON> says is four times longer than the average man needs. 
The couple got a divorce anyway. 

   Another bathroom product, the toilet-sound duplicator, may seem useless in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, but Japanese women like it. 
Embarrassed by the sounds they make in public toilets, Japanese women flush an average of 2.7 times a visit to drown out the offensive sounds. 
But this wastes water, which became a problem during a water shortage in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> <DATE>last summer</DATE>. 
The answer: Etiquettone, a battery-powered device mounted next to the toilets that the user pushes to activate a 25-second flushing sound. 
The government and private companies are buying about 3,000 of the devices a month. 

   Children have an interesting way of looking at problems. 
Invent <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, a program that sponsors an annual invention contest for elementary-school children, has come up with plenty of proof of their problem-solving ability. 

   <PERSON>Maurice Scales</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Suitland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, saw his baby sister constantly smashing her fingers in doors. 
The first-grader developed Baby No-Mash, a device that fits on the top of a door to prevent it from closing completely. 
On the lighter side, 12-year-old <PERSON>Christina Ahrens</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, saw a need for a product for her male friends. 
She was a winner in the <DATE>1987</DATE> contest for her Fly Guard -- an attachment to a zipper that sounds an alarm when the zipper is down. 

   While these children's ideas haven't yet been turned into successful commercial products, they certainly seem practical. 
Adults, on the other hand, often come up with highly impractical inventions. 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</ORGANIZATION> is flooded with them. 

   The electronic singing toy frog is an example. 
An amusing novelty, yes; a practical paperweight, no. 
Animals need toys, too, so a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> man invented a ball that rolls when dogs and cats wearing an electronic collar approach the toy. 

   Needless to say, adults do invent some very practical items -- in some cases, too practical. 
<PERSON>Burton Siegel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-based Budd Engineering</ORGANIZATION> designed a beauty-salon hair dryer that would accomplish the job in about five minutes instead of 20 minutes to a half-hour. 
Great, right? 
Wrong. 
Beauticians want the drying stage to take more time, so that they can get a good head start on the next customer. 
Good idea, wrong market. 

   An example of an invention that came before its time appeared 10 years ago in the <LOCATION>Hammacher Schlemmer</LOCATION> catalog. 
For <MONEY>$750</MONEY>, you could buy a personal computer, complete with keyboard and some software, that used your television screen as its monitor. 
None sold, and the item was removed from the catalog after one year. 
Well, all right, it was kind of crude: It did some word processing and simple calculations, and you could play games on it, and that's all. 
But it was a personal computer and it went nowhere. 

   Another <PERSON>Hammacher Schlemmer</PERSON> offering might also have been a bit too futuristic. 
The <DATE>1983</DATE> catalog offered a robotic maid for about <MONEY>$7,900</MONEY> that could provide security by buzzing the local cops, clean the house and act as a personal butler. 
Two prototypes were built; none was sold. 

   And here's an invention for inventors who might be too stressed out from all their toiling. 
Maybe screaming would help but you don't want to upset anyone within hearing distance. 
A <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> woman patented a sound-muffling cup for such situations. 
Just carry it around with you and, when you get the urge, scream into it.

<LEADPARA>  Zenith Electronics Corp., America's last maker of televisions, has bet its
future on advanced TV sets and high-definition television, a technology that
promises wide-screen pictures as clear as photographs.;    But the new sets
are at least a year away and payback from HDTV is even more distant, doing
little to boost Zenith's troubled finances in the short term.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ZENITH ON THE BRINK
COMPANY BETS FUTURE ON NEW TVS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Meanwhile, an investor group that owns about <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> stock has
questioned the company's management and direction. This week, the group, <ORGANIZATION>Nycor
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, will try to gain a foothold on <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s board at the company's annual
stockholders meeting.;    The battle is just one more worry for <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>, which
sealed its future when it sold its computer business a year and a half ago.
The 73-year-old company has not reported a profit since <DATE>1988.</DATE>;    <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> has
pegged its rebound on two technologies: a unique, flat-screen picture tube it
invented that promises brighter, glare-free viewing, and a system for
broadcasting high-definition TV it developed in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</ORGANIZATION>;    <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s "flat tension mask" tube is covered by
more than 100 patents, said <PERSON>Charles J. Prazak</PERSON>, the company's tube technology
expert. He says there will be no competitors.;    But the flat tubes won't
appear in TV sets for at least a year, and HDTV isn't expected to become a
reality until <DATE>1994</DATE> at the earliest. That leaves <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> with little but its
money-losing TV business to hang onto in the meantime.;    "Unless something
fundamentally changes about the cost structure of their (TV) business, or they
get some kind of decent cash infusion, I don't see how they can continue until
these HDTV revenues start coming," said <PERSON>David Schofield Jr.</PERSON>, an analyst at the
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.</ORGANIZATION>;    The tube's origins trace to
<ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s entry into the computer business in <DATE>1979.</DATE>;    When <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> decided to
start making color computer monitors, "the Japanese had a seven- or eight-year
lead on us," <PERSON>Prazak</PERSON> said during a tour of the suburban <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> factory, which
has produced conventional <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> TV tubes for 26 years.;    Rather than try to
catch up -- and hindered by limited funds -- <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> decided to reinvent the
computer tube, eliminating the curved front. That allowed <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> to improve
the innards of tubes as well.;    In all TV and computer tubes, tiny dots of
red, blue and green phosphors are applied to the inside surface. When they are
struck by electrons shot from a "gun" in the rear of the tube, they glow in
the proper combination to form colors of the rainbow.;    Behind the dots is a
thin sheet of metal perforated with hundreds of thousands of holes. This
screen, called a shadow mask, directs the electron beams to the dots.;    In a
conventional tube, the shadow mask must be curved to fit the tube's face.
Because of the curvature, it cannot be applied firmly to the screen, and
instead is suspended by springs. That produces a drawback.;    The electron
beams cause the mask to heat up, allowing it to move slightly out of alignment
because it is on springs. That causes a flickering of colors noticed, for
example, when someone on TV is wearing a white shirt.;    <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s flat mask,
by contrast, is stretched taut, preventing it from moving. That allows the
tube to use a more powerful electron beam, producing a brighter picture with
higher contrast.;    <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> has a few options should cash become tight. It
could sell its small non-TV businesses, which include making cable TV boxes.
Or it could try to raise money by selling bonds. But with a credit rating in
the junk bond category, it would have to pay steep interest rates, <PERSON>Schofield</PERSON>
said.;    <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> took a major step to boost its finances when it sold its
respected line of desk-top and lap-top computers to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Groupe Bull</ORGANIZATION> in
late <DATE>1989</DATE>. The deal provided about <MONEY>$511 million</MONEY> in cash that <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> used to
pare its debt, reducing interest payments.;    In another move to raise cash,
<ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> agreed in <DATE>February</DATE> to sell about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of newly issued stock to
<ORGANIZATION>Goldstar Co</ORGANIZATION>. Ltd., a South Korean electronics maker, for <MONEY>$15 million.</MONEY>;    As
part of that deal, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> will license its patents for flat picture tubes and
HDTV to <ORGANIZATION>Goldstar</ORGANIZATION>. The plan is for <ORGANIZATION>Goldstar</ORGANIZATION> to make flat-tube-equipped TVs for
sale primarily outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and to promote the Zenith-AT&amp;T technology
for HDTV in its own country if the technology is selected by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal
Communications Commission</ORGANIZATION> as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> standard.;    <PERSON>Schofield</PERSON> said an unstated
reason for the <ORGANIZATION>Goldstar</ORGANIZATION> deal, or at least the timing of its announcement,
might have been to scare Nycor.;    <ORGANIZATION>Goldstar</ORGANIZATION> potentially could become a "white
knight" in a takeover fight, blocking <ORGANIZATION>Nycor</ORGANIZATION> by buying a controlling stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> denies such intentions.;    <PERSON>Schofield</PERSON> said there was irony in
the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>, which takes pride in its status as the last U.S.-based
TV maker, looked abroad for help. But he said he believed <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> spoke to a
number of companies about such a venture, including American ones, and
<ORGANIZATION>Goldstar</ORGANIZATION> was the one that came through.;    The deal offers the potential for
appreciable royalty revenue in the future, the analyst added.;    In an
interview last week, <PERSON>Jerry Pearlman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and president, was
asked how the company will manage until it sees a boost from its flat-screen
TV and HDTV technology.;    "When you have great technology and customers,
access to capital is not an issue," <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> said. "We run the business as
best we can, and we've been running it for the long term.";    <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> said
much of <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s fortunes lie in its patented flat-tube technology, which
provides brighter pictures with higher contrast and eliminates most of the
glare produced by conventional curved-front screens.;    <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> already sells
the flat tubes to computer makers and plans to start using them in its TV sets
next year.;    <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> said the tubes, which can offer extremely high
resolution, will become increasingly desirable in the computer industry and
will help <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> differentiate itself in the consumer TV market.;    But
<ORGANIZATION>Nycor</ORGANIZATION>, whose executives control the <ORGANIZATION>Fedders Corp.</ORGANIZATION> air conditioning business,
say they have a better plan to turn around Zenith.;    In letters to <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>
stockholders, the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> company says it would sell <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s non-TV
operations, cut manufacturing costs, invest more money in HDTV and give
employees incentives to act more like entrepreneurs.;    <ORGANIZATION>Nycor</ORGANIZATION>, which would
not make a representative available for an interview, said in the letters it
would use its experience boosting <ORGANIZATION>Fedders</ORGANIZATION>' market share to help <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>. It
says <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> "does not have a viable business plan to restore <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> to
profitability.";    At <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders meeting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Nycor</ORGANIZATION> wants to
replace three of <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s 10 directors, including <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON>, with its own
candidates. It says that should give it a platform to promote its turnaround
plan.;    <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON>, a 20-year <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> veteran, says <ORGANIZATION>Nycor</ORGANIZATION> doesn't know what it
is talking about. He calls <ORGANIZATION>Nycor</ORGANIZATION>'s plans "business-school platitudes" that
show a lack of understanding of the TV market, where profit margins are razor
thin or non-existent because of price cutting.;    "You think that no one ever
thought of cutting costs and increasing market share?" he said in the
interview at <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s modern headquarters building in this <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> suburb.;   
The <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> plans to start testing five competing HDTV proposals in <DATE>July</DATE>.
<PERSON>Schofield</PERSON>, the industry analyst, believes <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> stand a good chance
of seeing their all-digital technology adopted. Pearlman appeared even more
certain.;    "We're confident that ours works. We have seen nothing to
indicate that the other digital proponents actually have workable solutions,"
<PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> said. Digital technology would send television signals in
distortion-free computer language, as opposed to the radio-wave analog
technology used today.;    The winner of the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> contest will gain royalty
revenue from licensing the technology to other TV makers. But even if it
loses, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> will benefit from HDTV by making sets based on whatever standard
wins, <PERSON>Pearlman</PERSON> said. He said the company's flat-tube technology will give its
HDTV sets an edge.;    If <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> wins the <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> race, it will be another in a
series of technical achievements for the company. It invented the world's
first portable radio in <DATE>1924</DATE>, the first wireless TV remote control in <DATE>1956</DATE>,
stereo FM broadcasting in <DATE>1961</DATE> and stereo TV in <DATE>1984</DATE>.  </TEXT>

   NBC's ``<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice'' has thrived on style, and
executive producer <PERSON>Michael Mann</PERSON> is determined the detective series
will wrap up its fifth and final season the same way.
   ``For the final season, our writers are taking the mythology of
our best episodes seriously,'' said <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>. ``What we're trying to do
is write to that mythology. Our aim is to do a series of classic
`Vices.' The stories the writers are coming up with are on track.''
   What is that mythology?
   ``A hard-nosed attitude toward life,'' <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> replies. ``Yet, it's
not all grim and serious.''
   The decision to bring ``<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice'' to an end wasn't lightly
made, but <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> and stars <PERSON>Don Johnson</PERSON> (playing <PERSON>Sonny Crockett</PERSON>) and
<PERSON>Philip Michael Thomas</PERSON> (<PERSON>Ricardo Tubbs</PERSON>) thought it was time to move
on. <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> has not officially acknowledged the decision to end the
series.
   ``It was by our election to end the show, so we're planning for
it,'' said <PERSON>Mann</PERSON>. ``As a result it's kind of liberating and has
generated a lot of enthusiasm. The show's going to be around a long
time in syndication and we all want it to end well. We're going to
end it with a two-hour episode. Salazar, a Latin American strong man
who can cut deals, will figure in that story.''
   The finale is still under wraps, but don't look for <PERSON>Sonny
Crockett</PERSON> to open a bait shop in the <LOCATION>Keys</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Ricardo Tubbs</PERSON> a charter
service in <LOCATION>Bimini</LOCATION>.
   The original concept of the show, which made its debut in
<DATE>September 1984</DATE>, was a kind of MTV cops. It pulsated with rock music
and vibrated with pastels. Its sparkling imagery came right out of a
music video.
   But this season, <PERSON>Sonny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ricardo</PERSON> seem to wear only blacks and
grays, and the images seem to be filtered through sepia.
   Creator <PERSON>Anthony Yerkovich</PERSON> set the tone in the two-hour pilot
script, in which <ORGANIZATION>Sonny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Tubbs</PERSON> battled evil and corruption against
the backdrop of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s glitzy <ORGANIZATION>Gold Coast</ORGANIZATION>.
   The show was symbolized by the reflection of the neon and lights
in the black sheen of their Ferrari as they raced around <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Sonny Crockett</PERSON> was a vice detective whom <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> played as a
knight errant in dented armor. He had a raspy voice, a three-day
beard, no socks and pastel <ORGANIZATION>Versace</ORGANIZATION> suits. His partner, <PERSON>Tubbs</PERSON>, played
by <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, was explained as a black <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> street cop who first
came south to find the drug dealer who'd killed his brother. <PERSON>Edward
James Olmos</PERSON> played their taciturn boss, Lt. <PERSON>Martin Castillo</PERSON>.
   At the start of the fifth season, <PERSON>Sonny</PERSON> has been knocked cuckoo
and thinks he really is <PERSON>Sonny Burnett</PERSON>, his drug-dealing undercover
alter ego, and <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> is preparing for the windup. Sonny's brother
will show up this season and cause him trouble. A few loose ends
from various stories will also be taken care of.
   Although ``<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice'' was rapped several years ago for
emphasizing style over content, <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> said he is now satisfied with
the scripts being turned out under the direction of <ORGANIZATION>Robert Ward</ORGANIZATION>. The
show got off the track when <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> temporarily left to direct
``Manhunter,'' based on <PERSON>Thomas Harris</PERSON>' suspense novel ``Red Dragon.''
   ``In the second season I went off to do the picture, and I
thought I had everything set up to function while I was gone,'' he
said. ``Forget about that. It was total meltdown. The first day of
shooting `Manhunter' I got a phone call from `<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice.' All hell
had broken loose.
   ``There was no conscious attempt to rely on style. It's not in
the script. But once you set the style it becomes automatic. The art
director, costumers, editors all know what to look for. You don't
have to re-invent it every week. But you do have to re-invent the
story every week, and what we had was an absence of stories. The
style became more obvious because the story wasn't there.''
   After ``<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Vice,'' <PERSON>Mann</PERSON> has a number of other projects lined
up. Among them is a six-hour miniseries for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> based on <PERSON>Elaine
Shannon</PERSON>'s ``Desperados.'' The book tells of Latin drug lords and the
murder of Enrique ``<PERSON>Kiki'' Camarena</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>New Board Game Pokes Fun at TV Evangelists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The shenanigans of television evangelists
have spawned another player in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s multimillion-dollar board
game industry, this one irreverently named ``Fleece the Flock.''
   The game, developed by a writer, an inventor and an illustrator,
is based loosely on ``Monopoly,'' but instead of real-estate
tycoons, players assume the roles of greedy evangelists.
   ``I came up with the idea when <PERSON>Jimmy Swaggart</PERSON> was caught in the
motel,'' said <PERSON>Elizabeth Fuller</PERSON>, author of ``My Search for the Ghost
of Flight 401'' and other books. ``I thought, `These guys belong on
a board game.'''
   Equipped with collection plates, players toss the dice and pursue
ownership of theme parks, television stations and record companies
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own
sexual escapades secret.
   Fuller collaborated on the game with inventor <PERSON>Stanley Mason</PERSON>,
whose 30 patents include Masonware microwave cookware, and <PERSON>Roy Doty</PERSON>,
a humorous illustrator.
   The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions and sold the rights
to market the game to <ORGANIZATION>Regent Continental</ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-based
company that produces board games for some of the nation's largest
toy makers.
   The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at
<MONEY>$25</MONEY> retail, available mostly in the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>April 1</DATE>, said <PERSON>Cindy
Levinson</PERSON>, an account executive for <ORGANIZATION>Regent</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalize
on people in the news. <PERSON>Milton Bradley</PERSON>, maker of the some of the
country's most popular games, last month unveiled ``Trump _ The
Game,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate
mogul <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>.
   Analysts say any new entry into the <MONEY>$760 million-a-year</MONEY>
board-game industry faces an uphill battle.
   ``More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not
make it past that year's Christmas,'' said <PERSON>David S. Leibowitz</PERSON>, a toy
industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION>American Securities Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. ``The
success of any new toy item is pretty tough.''
   But Fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that
Americans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of
television evangelists will create a niche for their game.
   During five months of testing, the inventors were dumbfounded to
discover one common trait among test players: They all were cheating
by the end of the game. That prompted the inclusion of one rule
assumed in most games: ``Thou shalt not cheat (unless thou canst get
away with it).''
   No real-life evangelist is named and the inventors insist they
are not attacking religion itself. Fuller is a <LOCATION>Unitarian</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Doty</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Mason</PERSON> are both Methodists.
   ``It's a comment on humanity,'' <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> said. ``It's aimed at the
human foibles we have, when we'll support people like this when we
know ... they are evil.''

FT  02 DEC 93 / Technology: Strong feelings over patent dispute - The
multimedia industry may soon turn into a legal minefield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US computer software companies are up in arms over the granting of a basic
patent on multimedia databases to <LOCATION>Compton</LOCATION>'s New Media, a small software
company best known for its development of an electronic multimedia
encyclopedia that is sold on a CD-Rom, similar to an audio compact disc.
Compton's has shocked the industry by announcing that it has been granted a
patent that covers any computer-controlled system that searches through a
database and retrieves text with images or audio or video information.
The company is seeking royalties amounting to <MONEY>1 per cent</MONEY> of revenues from
sales of multimedia products ranging from personal computer databases to
interactive television. It has said that it will reduce or eliminate
royalties on the patent to software developers that use <ORGANIZATION>Compton</ORGANIZATION>'s as a
distributor.
Many in the software industry are convinced that <ORGANIZATION>Compton</ORGANIZATION>'s claim to have
invented a novel process for searching multimedia databases is false. 'This
patent basically claims that <ORGANIZATION>Compton</ORGANIZATION>'s invented multimedia,' says <PERSON>Philip
Dodds</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Interactive Multimedia Association</ORGANIZATION> (IMA), a
trade association representing more than 260 companies in the rapidly
emerging multimedia industry.
Compton's patent covers a search system process that is common and
considered non-proprietary, the industry group maintains. Compton's patent
now seems certain to be challenged in the courts. Several industry groups
including the <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Multimedia Developers Group</ORGANIZATION> are
banding together in an effort to get the patent overturned.
Compton's, however, is determined to assert its patent rights. 'We simply
want the public to recognise <ORGANIZATION>Compton's NewMedia</ORGANIZATION> as the pioneer in this
industry, promote a standard that can be used by every developer and be
compensated for the investments we have made to make multimedia a reality
for developers and end users,' said <PERSON>Stanley Frank</PERSON>, president and chief
executive.
The dispute has raised strong feelings in the software industry because it
comes just as multimedia products appear set to break into the mainstream of
personal computing. Dozens of software companies have launched CD-Rom titles
for home and school use and sales of PCs complete with stereo sound and
video capabilities are booming.
The fledgling multimedia industry could soon turn into a legal battleground
says <PERSON>G. Gervaise Davis III</PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION>Davis &amp; Schroeder</ORGANIZATION>, a
California-based law firm specialising in intellectual property issues.
Thousands of multimedia patent applications have been filed in the past few
years, he notes.
However, the row over <LOCATION>Compton</LOCATION>'s multimedia patent is only the latest example
of a much broader problem with software patents. Critics charge that
software patents covering basic ideas are stifling the creativity of the
small companies that have led innovation in the software industry by
limiting access to fundamental ideas.
Until seven years ago, the <ORGANIZATION>US Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> did not grant patents on
software. Since then, more than 10,000 software patents have been granted,
but there are as many as 15,000 software patent applications waiting for
approval.
Yet the <ORGANIZATION>US Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> is ill-equipped to examine properly these claims,
industry critics charge. The agency lacks the expertise or resources to
fully research 'prior art' that can invalidate patent applications. As a
result, several sweeping patents have been granted for basic computer
processes that are not novel, the <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION> complains.
A group of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> firms including <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Digital Equipment</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lotus
Development</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> have formed the <ORGANIZATION>Software Patent Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which
is building a database of software inventions for the <ORGANIZATION>Patent Office</ORGANIZATION>'s use in
an effort to avert software patent disputes.
But <PERSON>Compton</PERSON>'s patent issue is spurring industry pressure for broader
reforms. The <ORGANIZATION>IMA</ORGANIZATION> has called for the formation of an industry commission to
review pending patents and provide the <ORGANIZATION>Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> with the expertise it
currently lacks.
Some are also calling for changes in <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> patent laws to give patent
challengers an opportunity to make their case before a patent is granted.
Currently, in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, patent filings are secret until approval is granted.
This means that anyone wishing to dispute a patent must either challenge the
patent in the courts or ask the <ORGANIZATION>Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> to re-examine the patent.
Both are lengthy and expensive procedures. In the meantime, the challenger
must pay royalties to the patent holder or run the risk of being liable for
triple damages for willfully infringing the patent.
Such disputes are nothing new in other sectors of the high-technology
industry such as semiconductors and computer hardware, where patents have
long been recognised as a primary means of protecting intellectual property
rights that enable innovators to recoup their investments in technology
development.
Yet in the software industry, patent rights are a relatively new phenomenon
and one that few developers have previously encountered. Although many may
see the dispute over <LOCATION>Compton</LOCATION>'s patent as a threat to innovation, it may well
prove to be a catalyst for broader understanding of intellectual property
rights in the software industry and improvements in the patent process that
will eventually benefit all software developers.

<HEADLINE>  A STAR IS BORN: LASER DISC SALES ARE FINALLY TAKING
OFF  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a Christmas shopping season hobbled by recession, laser discs and laser
disc players are one of the few sources of holiday cheer for consumer
electronics retailers.;   <ORGANIZATION>Paul Kagan Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm
in <LOCATION>Carmel</LOCATION>, estimates sales of laser discs will increase <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1991</DATE> and
a further <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1992</DATE>; sales of laser disc players will jump <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT>
<DATE>this year</DATE> and <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1992.</DATE>;   Total sales are still small. About 1
million households in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will have a laser disc player by the
end of next year, compared with 75 million households containing a
videocassette recorder.;   But most other types of home electronics are in the
doldrums. According to statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION>Electronic Industries
Association</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, sales of color televisions dropped <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>
in the <DATE>first 11 months of this year</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>VCR</ORGANIZATION> sales inched up only 3 percent.;  
"Laser disc is a product whose time has come," said <PERSON>Bill Matthies</PERSON> of The
<ORGANIZATION>Verity Group</ORGANIZATION>, a research firm in <ORGANIZATION>Diamond Bar</ORGANIZATION>, an eastern suburb of <LOCATION>Los
Angeles.</LOCATION>;   After more than a decade on the market, the ingredients are
finally in place for rapid expansion of laser disc sales. If everything
follows according to the plans of manufacturers, household penetration could
reach <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> in five years.;   For the uninitiated, laser discs -- or LDs
-- are the video equivalent of compact discs -- or CDs -- for music.;   LDs
are 12 inches in diameter, about the size of the long-playing records pushed
out of existence by CDs, and are made of the same plastic that reflects a
rainbow hue of colors. Because LDs can store more information than videotapes,
laser disc players produce an image with <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> more resolution than the
<ORGANIZATION>VHS</ORGANIZATION> format used in videocassette recorders. What's more, LDs offer CD-quality
sound, especially important for the emerging market of "home theaters" that
combine big-screen televisions and stereo systems.;   "The larger your screen,
the more you need laser disc," said film critic <PERSON>Roger Ebert</PERSON> in a telephone
interview from his <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> office. Ebert, best known for the television show
"<PERSON>Siskel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ebert</PERSON> at the Movies," has been tirelessly recommending laser discs
to his readers and viewers for the past five years.;   LDs are becoming the
format of choice for movie collectors such as <LOCATION>Ebert</LOCATION>. Because the laser inside
a player doesn't actually touch the spinning disc, there is almost no wear --
a distinct contrast to videocassettes, which lose their picture quality after
repeated viewing. LD players also have the ability to jump instantly to any
spot on a disc. That isn't particularly important for watching movies, but is
a key feature for viewing music videos and certain types of children's
programming.;   Movie studios are helping develop the laser market by pricing
most LDs at <MONEY>$25</MONEY> to <MONEY>$35</MONEY>, including new releases. Although some movies on
videocassette are sold at discount prices as low as <MONEY>$10</MONEY>, most new releases are
priced at <MONEY>$100</MONEY> -- limiting their appeal to video rental stores.;   Laser discs
aren't new. The first players reached <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retailers in <DATE>1978</DATE>, about the same
time VCRs were starting to gain popularity. But LDs never took off in the
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, because consumers wanted the ability to record programs -- something a
laser disc player can't do -- and because a competing laser system from <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION>
called Selectavision failed in <DATE>1984</DATE> after several years on the market.;  
Laser discs are finally clicking with the public for several interrelated
reasons:;   (check) Home theater. The improved picture quality of a laser disc
is only marginal on a typical 19-inch television set, and the CD-quality sound
isn't noticeable on that TV's small, tinny speaker. But some 11 million
households now have big-screen televisions, defined as 27 inches or above, up
from 5 million households just <DATE>two years ago</DATE>. The better resolution and sound
is much more compelling on a big-screen TV.;   "If people see it once, they're
hooked," said <PERSON>Douglas Pratt</PERSON>, editor of The Laser Disc Newsletter in <LOCATION>East
Rockaway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> "You can't watch something on <ORGANIZATION>VHS</ORGANIZATION> after you've seen it on
laser. All you notice are the flaws.";   About 500,000 to 750,000 homes now
have laser disc players, only a fraction of those with big-screen TVs, so
there is considerable room for growth.;   (check) Lower prices and "combi"
players. Until the last two years, prices for laser disc players started at
<MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> -- out of reach for most consumers. But low-end LD players are now <MONEY>$400</MONEY>
and could drop another <MONEY>$100</MONEY> in the next year or two. What's more, most models
on the market today are so-called "combi" players that also play standard
5-inch music CDs and 8-inch video CDs.;   (check) More manufacturers. After
laser disc flopped in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, only one manufacturer stayed in the
market -- <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Electronic Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Retailers and consumers were
nervous about investing in a format with only a single company behind it,
perhaps because they remembered how Selectavision buyers were orphaned when
<ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> dropped the system.;   In the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, however, the heavy hitters
of consumer electronics have finally decided to throw their weight behind
laser discs. Matshushita, through its <ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION> line, and <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> have both
started selling laser disc players in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also added an LD
production line at its CD plant in <LOCATION>Terre Haute</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>;   The presence of <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION> will do more than resolve consumer jitters. The two companies
have much broader distribution networks than <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION>, which mostly sells
through stereo shops, so that laser disc players are showing up more and more
in high-volume electronics stores.;   (check) More titles. Back when Pioneer
was going it alone in laser disc, there were only a few hundred movies
available on laser disc and few stores sold LDs. There are now 7,000 movies
and music videos on the market and laser discs are sold nationwide. Some video
stores are also beginning to rent laser discs.;   "We finally felt the market
had got to a critical size where it made sense for us to get into the
business," said <PERSON>Geoff Holmes</PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner Inc</ORGANIZATION>. In
<DATE>August</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Time Warner</ORGANIZATION> started producing LDs at its disc-pressing plant in
<LOCATION>Oliphant</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>;   The future for laser discs is far from guaranteed, however.; 
 Consumer electronics technology is poised for massive change in ways that are
hard to predict. Cable television systems, for example, are trying to develop
"video-on-demand" systems that would supply a wide variety of movies at the
push of a button. If video-on-demand is a success, it could undermine the
demand for laser discs.;   Laser discs also could be hurt by technological
improvements in VCRs, although a new high-resolution format called Super VHS
hasn't been selling well.;   But new technology could also help the laser
format. Pioneer has developed a recordable laser disc system, priced at <MONEY>$30,00</MONEY>
for professional use. If Pioneer or another manufacturer can invent a low-cost
version, laser discs could eventually displace VCRs.  </TEXT>

   LA PALMA, Calif. -- This small, bedroom community is the
most Asian -- 30.5% -- of any in Orange County, according to
the latest Census figures. That is only one irony in the
story of a suddenly-celebrated resident who says his cause is
no less than building America's technological fortress in the
computer age.
   Gil Hyatt was awarded a patent last summer for the
microprocessor, 20 years after he says he invented it -- only
to see his idea lifted. The effect of his windfall, according
to Silicon Valley chronicler Michael Malone, has been "to
turn the entire semiconductor industry on its ear."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Complex legal matters bearing on the patent's significance
must yet be resolved, but many believe 52-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON>
stands to reap <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>, perhaps hundreds of
millions. Safe to say, the carpets won't be fraying much
longer at his tract home, frugal as he boasts of being. (Our
lunch at his pick of the Chinese restaurants in town came to
<MONEY>$10.50</MONEY>.) Yet, even as he plans to license his package of
personal-computer technology -- including the core patent --
he maintains that personal wealth isn't the point.
   <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> argues that he represents thousands of
"entrepreneurial engineers" whose inventions are the hope for
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industrial future. He says that these innovators,
whether on a payroll or on their own, have been routinely
ripped off by lawyer-driven, bureaucratic companies and as a
result are holding back breakthroughs that could transform
life on earth and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s competitive posture. <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON>
says his wealth will be devoted to lionizing the nation's
inventors and securing their legal rights.
   In semiconductor circles, however, this little guy's
triumph is widely seen as precisely the wrong medicine for
what ails homegrown high-tech. No less a tribune of the
start-up set than <PERSON>George Gilder</PERSON>, whose book "Microcosm" and
other writings seem made to order for Hyatt heroizing,
decries the "promiscuity in the patent office" that he says
is benefiting none other than lawyers and the Japanese. <PERSON>Mr.
Hyatt</PERSON>'s is "just a case of one small American inventor
getting in on this gold rush" via a paper trail. <PERSON>Mr. Gilder</PERSON>
and others allege that putting a computer on a chip was a
common idea in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE>; finding a way actually to do
it was key.
   <PERSON>Gil Hyatt</PERSON>, though he's enjoyed notice in the popular press
and is now the talk of the techies, is absent from the
histories of the "micro" that cite the work of <ORGANIZATION>Carver Mead</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Caltech</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ted Hoff</PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Gary Boone</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION>. The son of a Russian immigrant who helped
design the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> subway system, <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> gained an
electrical engineering degree at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> but never joined
the fraternity in <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION>.
   Yet like many of his brethren there, he'd struck out on
his own by <DATE>1968</DATE> in search of the technological grail. Not
long after, he filed the patent with the long fuse.
   He says he had 25 employees working to make his vision a
reality. But his venture folded in <DATE>1971</DATE> when investors, who
included the founders of <ORGANIZATION>Intel</ORGANIZATION>, pulled the plug. Why they did
so is a subject of contention, but <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> maintains the
episode set a pattern for what he has experienced in the
years since as inventor, consultant and patent agent:
Derogation, exploitation and sometimes outright theft of
ideas by corporations that know they can bleed the creator
white in court.
   <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> says he himself spent much of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> paying
off costs from a suit brought by <ORGANIZATION>Mattel Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that he lost.
(He blames a federal trial judge unsympathetic to patents and
an inadequate appellate procedure -- now changed.) He rattles
off a handful of other major companies that he says tried to
appropriate his work.
   Now <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> calculates how to avenge the inventors. To
date, he has enhanced his own identity, through speeches and
press appearances. He gets calls from the sort of people who
read <ORGANIZATION>Midnight Engineering</ORGANIZATION>, a 25,000-circulation bimonthly put
out in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. He seeks to persuade <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies that
they will profit by treating creators with more respect and
rewardhe says foreign firms show "reverence." When his money
comes in, he wants to fund selected legal actions on behalf
of his comrades and a PR campaign to bolster their image.
   "The youth don't have proper role models," he says. "You
see lawyers on television, and they make heroes out of them.
Policemen. But they look at the scientists and inventors as
nerds and kooks. It's a very bad environment."
   <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> finds inventive corporate engineers are hemmed
in and then stifled internally. They top out quickly and are
either encouraged to become bureaucratic managers themselves
or are supervised by "BS types" who see them as a threat and
deny them discretion over funds.
   He isn't eager to pick winners himself, and doesn't think
large companies or governments are equipped to do that,
either. Ideas bubble up, they don't get assigned. "Safe"
recipients get the grants. Listen to his reaction to the
notion that the space program has yielded oodles of
commercial technology:
   "That is the biggest load of hokum that you can imagine.
It's just the opposite. It sucked up a lot of money from the
private sector, some of which might have trickled down to
funding some real innovative things. It pumped it into these
big aerospace corporations that are so inefficient, all
political. Sure, there's a little trickle of things, and if
you look hard after spending billions and <MONEY>billions of
dollars</MONEY>, and you might get a <MONEY>few million dollars</MONEY> worth of
results. Those things do not, for the most part, help in our
competition with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which is our big threat."
   Repeatedly, <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> inveighs against the "contemptuous"
attitude of lawyers with whom the inventor must "interface."
Yet as <PERSON>Michael Malone</PERSON> detailed in a recent article in Upside,
a technology magazine, the "great patent war" that loosed the
Hyatt bomb threatens litigious havoc a la torts on the large
and small alike.
   <PERSON>Mr. Gilder</PERSON> says the intellectual-property craze is hurtful
coming now: "The Japanese were ready for it" and have flooded
the <ORGANIZATION>Patent Office</ORGANIZATION> with applications at each step of the
laboratory process, hamstringing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> potential in the
process. <ORGANIZATION>Hitachi</ORGANIZATION> has led the charge, while in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> it is
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Instruments -- "a Japanese company in semiconductors,"
in <PERSON>Mr. Gilder</PERSON>'s words. However, the real winners, he agrees,
are the lawyers.
   <PERSON>Mr. Hyatt</PERSON> is undaunted. In the service of modern American
pioneers, he draws an Asian adage. "It's an old expression
from the Orient: It's the nail that sticks up that gets
pounded down," he says. "We're a nation of nails that stick
up."
   Observes <PERSON>Michael Malone</PERSON>, "This is a glimpse into the soul
of engineering." The methodical man from <LOCATION>La Palma</LOCATION>, unrequited
all these years, now has leverage over the hammer. He wants
compensation but also esteem for his role in an epoch.
Justice aside, however, how much legal backtracking to
establish claims can the rapidfire world of electronics take
before its fabled fibers get caught on the nails?

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution was prepared to say
two <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> researchers invented the computer
until an <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> congressman who helps hold the museum's purse strings
said <ORGANIZATION>Iowa State University</ORGANIZATION> should get the credit.
   The solution: Honor many ``early developments.''
   University of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> researchers <PERSON>John W. Mauchly</PERSON> and <PERSON>J.
Presper Eckert</PERSON> completed building their ENIAC machine in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
Utilizing thousands of vacuum tubes and taking up an entire
basement, it is often cited as the first electronic digital computer.
   But was it really?
   Rep. <PERSON>Neal Smith</PERSON>, the No. 3 Democrat on the <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations
Committee</ORGANIZATION>, insists the credit should go to physicist <PERSON>John V.
Atanasoff</PERSON> and graduate student <PERSON>Clifford Berry</PERSON>, who developed a
smaller machine at <ORGANIZATION>Iowa State University</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1937</DATE> to <DATE>1941</DATE>.
   In an attempt to assuage <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>'s wounded pride, the <ORGANIZATION>National
Museum of American History</ORGANIZATION> _ preparing a major exhibition on
information technology _ has decided to spread the credit among
several computer pioneers.
   ``We will not be presenting the ENIAC as the `original' or
`first' computer,'' said the museum's director, <PERSON>Roger M. Kennedy</PERSON>, in
a letter to <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>.
   He wrote that ``our presentation will rather show that there were
many early developments that led to the emergence of the computer
industry ... including of course the work of <PERSON>John Atanasoff</PERSON> and the
development of the ENIAC at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The exhibition also will recognize the pioneering work of <PERSON>Howard
Aiken</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>George Stibitz</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Bell Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>
said.
   What touched off the computer-inventor tiff was a newsletter
issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the museum, saying
that the exhibition would include ``a walk through the ENIAC, the
first electronic digital computer.''
   Smith fired off a letter to <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> saying he was ``gravely
concerned'' that the exhibition would jeopardize the museum's
``unrivaled reputation ... for historical accuracy.''
   The congressman cited a <DATE>1973</DATE> federal court decision that
invalidated patents obtained by <PERSON>Mauchly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eckert</PERSON> for ENIAC
(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). The court held that
``<PERSON>Eckert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mauchly</PERSON> did not themselves first invent the automatic
electronic digital computer'' but instead derived their machine from
the work done earlier at <ORGANIZATION>Iowa State</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I strongly urge you to review the documented facts of record
relating to <PERSON>Dr. Atanasoff</PERSON>'s invention in the interests of avoiding
what would be both a historical inaccuracy and a monumental
injustice to a great American inventor,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> wrote.
   In his reply, <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said the museum was negotiating with <ORGANIZATION>Iowa
State</ORGANIZATION> for loan of the last remaining piece of the original
Atanasoff-Berry computer _ the memory drum _ and also a
``reconstructed breadboard model of the central unit.''
   ``These will be prominently displayed with appropriate
photographs and information about <PERSON>Atanasoff</PERSON>'s role,'' he wrote.
   That was not enough for <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION>. He still isn't satisfied.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Kennedy</PERSON>'s letter was welcome but it offered no new
information and failed to allay the concerns I had expressed,'' the
congressman said <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a statement.
   ``The central question is not whether <PERSON>Dr. Atanasoff</PERSON>'s work will
be included in some minor way in the exhibition. The question is:
Will he be recognized as the inventor of the first electronic
digital computer, in accordance with the historical fact?''
   Smith suggested that the Atanasoff-Berry machine be exhibited as
the first electronic digital computer and the ENIAC as the first
programmable computer.
   ``The interests of both justice and history would be served and
the reputation of the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> for historical accuracy would not
be tarnished,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   The corporate descendent of the ENIAC, meanwhile, is continuing
to side with <PERSON>Mauchly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eckert</PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>
researchers founded a company that was taken over by <ORGANIZATION>Sperry Rand</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1950</DATE>, and <PERSON>Sperry</PERSON> subsequently merged with <LOCATION>Burroughs</LOCATION> to form <ORGANIZATION>Unisys
Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Complex inventions like the computer rarely have just one
parent,'' said <PERSON>John B. Wise</PERSON>, chief technology officer for <ORGANIZATION>Unisys</ORGANIZATION>.
``Encyclopedias generally start the history of the computer with the
invention of the abacus and list dozens of major contributors to
what is generally accepted as the first electronic digital computer,
the ENIAC.''

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Konosuke Matsushita</PERSON>, an inventor who founded of
<ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest
manufacturers of consumer electronics, died of pneumonia today, a
hospital official said. He was 94.
   Matsushita had been in poor health and was admitted to
<ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 5</DATE> for treatment of a
cold, a company official said.
   Quitting school at age 10 to go to work, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> remained
faithful to the values he learned growing up as the youngest of
nine children in <LOCATION>Wakayama</LOCATION> in western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   He built his global electronics empire from an electric socket
business he began in <DATE>1918</DATE>.
   The company grew into more than 450 companies in 37 countries,
with brands including <ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>, Quasar and <ORGANIZATION>Technics</ORGANIZATION>.
Sales totaled <MONEY>$30.3 billion</MONEY> in the fiscal year ending in <DATE>March</DATE>.
   ``I have many memories of him,'' Prime Minister <PERSON>Noboru Takeshita</PERSON>
said <DATE>today</DATE>. ``He was like a god.''
   ``I have simply done common things commonly well, doing what I
should do and abstaining from what I should not,'' <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> once
wrote. ``In short, I have lived my daily life at the dictates of
common sense.''
   Later in life, he espoused a philosophy of ``peace and happiness
through prosperity,'' a kind of benevolent capitalism he preached
through his own publishing company and a weekly magazine with a
circulation of 1.5 million. His views were criticized, however, as
being a religion of worldly interests.
   Born <DATE>Nov. 27, 1894</DATE>, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> grew up in a well-to-do
environment but was forced to quit school and work after his
father, a farmer, lost the family fortune speculating in rice
futures.
   After apprenticeships with a dealer of charcoal-burning stoves
and a bicycle maker, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> began working for the <ORGANIZATION>Osaka
Electric Light Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1910</DATE>. He stayed there seven years, until he
quit to begin his electric socket business with his wife, <PERSON>Mumeno</PERSON>,
and her brother.
   As an inventor, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> registered more than 100 patents. His
first was for a successful two-way socket he invented while
confined to home because of poor health.
   Centering around consumer appliances, his Osaka-based company's
products ranged from television sets, washing machines and
refrigerators to video tape recorders and microwave ovens.
   <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> was known in the business world for his
unconventional ideas, such as turning assembly line workers into
door-to-door salesmen during a <DATE>1974</DATE> recession, and once advocating
that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> bulldoze <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of its mountains to provide
reclaimed land for the crowded nation.
   He received honorary degrees from several of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s most
prestigious universities, and, in <DATE>1979</DATE> started his own school of
government and business.
   He wrote more than 50 books, including a <DATE>1975</DATE> best-seller titled
``How to Rescue Crumbling <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>,'' and received one of the Japanese
government's highest honors, the Order of the Rising Sun First
Class, as well as medals and honors from the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>.
   Matsushita is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Mumeno</PERSON>, 93, and daughter,
<PERSON>Sachiko</PERSON>, 68. The daughter's husband, <PERSON>Masaharu Matsushita</PERSON>, 76, was
adopted into the family and now is the company chairman.
   A <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> official said funeral services would be held <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
at <ORGANIZATION>Honganji Tsumura Betsuin Temple</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>, western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.

   Frozen for nearly 100 years in the same
position _ his ear pricked up to the sound of a gramophone _ Nipper
the <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> dog is coming to life and gaining a smart-alecky sidekick.
   In television commercials airing for the first time <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the
internationally known RCA mascot and his new companion will promote
a new line of ``Home Theatre'' color television models and a lineup
of 8mm camcorders, <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``The two dogs will serve as an appropriate `balancing act' as
we continue to expand our customer base,'' said <PERSON>Martin J. Holleran</PERSON>,
president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Thomson Consumer
Electronics</ORGANIZATION>' American sales and marketing divison.
   ``The younger dog is the focus for the new designs and advanced
features of today's RCA products, while `Nipper' represents <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION>'s
traditional values of reliability and ease of use,'' he said.
   Thompson is a French-owned company that bought the <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION>
home electronics lines from <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Executives of <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> wrestled with the idea of bringing Nipper
back for advertisements for several years, said spokesman <PERSON>Greg
Zehner</PERSON>.
   ``It's just that we couldn't figure out how to make him work
best,'' he said. ``It was too dated.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Ammirati &amp; Puris</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> advertising firm, suggested earlier
this year that the company use a live dog to represent <PERSON>Nipper</PERSON> and
find a look-alike puppy to play the more modern role.
   ``We knew we had to update him, so we invented this little
whippersnapper to be his foil,'' said <PERSON>David Fowler</PERSON>, an associate
creative director at <ORGANIZATION>Ammirati &amp; Puris</ORGANIZATION> who worked on the new
campaign.
   Nipper was created in the 1890s by <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> painter <PERSON>Francis
Barraud</PERSON>. Barraud depicted the terrier listening to ``His Master's
Voice'' emanating from a gramophone. He sold the painting to the
<ORGANIZATION>Gramophone Co.</ORGANIZATION> after replacing the cylinder-type phonograph with a
disc version.
   In <DATE>1900</DATE>, the North American rights to the painting were acquired
and <PERSON>Nipper</PERSON> was used to launch the <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Talking Machine Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
later to become the <ORGANIZATION>Victor Talking Machine Co</ORGANIZATION>. RCA purchased <PERSON>Victor</PERSON>
and the rights to use Nipper in <DATE>1929</DATE>.
   RCA, in turn, was bought by <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. GE continues to use the
RCA name for some products, but it sold the <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GE</ORGANIZATION> names for
home electronics to <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``He is one of the oldest advertising syumbols in the world,''
<PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said. ``The <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> symbol is the only better known symbol
in the world than the dog and the horn.''
   Before bringing Nipper back, <ORGANIZATION>Ammirati</ORGANIZATION> conducted a survey to
judge his name recognition and popularity.
   ``We went all over the country, asking whether they like him,
whether we should keep him,'' <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said. ``And people told us,
`Are you kidding? Of course you have to use Nipper.'
   ``We didn't bring him back simply for nostalgic benefit because
nostalgia is anathema to electronics. We brought him back because
he's a good symbol.''
   The agency found the dogs for the ads in a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> animal
shelter run by animal trainers. The new Nipper was insured for
<MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> before seven days of filming this <DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said.
   Two of the commercials will debut <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s
``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Funniest Home Videos,'' <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said. Each of the spots
contains three vignettes demonstrating RCA product features. Nipper
and his sidekick will also appear in print advertising and on the
company's brochures.
   In all the advertisements, the puppy plays the part of the
adventurous, wise-cracking offspring who always gets the best of
Nipper.
   ``He's sort of a smart aleck, a hot dog, a little hot shot,''
<PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said. ``He's like you. He has all the answers and he's not
afraid to talk about them. The big dog is more staid, like your
father.''
   ``We hope they can tell the company's story for the next 100
years,'' <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> said.

   You know the voice of the grown-up <PERSON>Kevin
Arnold</PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s ``The Wonder Years,'' but you probably don't know
the man behind the voice is actor-director <PERSON>Daniel Stern</PERSON>.
   Stern gets no regular screen credit for the narration, and when
he auditioned he was known only as ``No. 6.'' His name does appear
when he directs an episode of the hit comedy that focuses on <PERSON>Kevin</PERSON>
as a 13-year-old in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. He's directed seven so far.
   ``I'd never done voiceover before so I've had to learn as I went
along,'' said <PERSON>Stern</PERSON>. ``I like my part. There's a lot of emotions
and conflict to be acted out. I think it's good that the narrator
is an adult. It wouldn't be as effective if the narrator was
<PERSON>Kevin</PERSON>'s age. It's a good device that helps pull the stories
together.''
   Stern provides the ironic footnotes for ``The Wonder Years,''
which won an Emmy as best comedy series in <DATE>1988</DATE> after its premiere
that <DATE>January</DATE>. Fred Savage stars as 13-year-old <PERSON>Kevin</PERSON>.
   The show wouldn't be nearly as funny, nor as poignant, without
the acerbic comments from <ORGANIZATION>Stern</ORGANIZATION>.
   He's never appeared in the show. ``I almost did once,'' he said,
``but I don't want to do that. I don't want to goof around with it.
The show means something to a lot of people. You don't want it to
be too in or too jokey.''
   Only once has his name been listed as narrator. That came when
he directed his first episode, called ``Pottery Will Get You
Nowhere.'' It was about a year ago, in the second season.
   ``I did it for my mother,'' he said. ``I think it works out
better not to have my name listed.''
   His brother, <PERSON>David Stern</PERSON>, was the original story consultant for
``The Wonder Years,'' but has since left.
   ``At the time I was auditioning for the show I got my brother a
job as a production assistant on `Born in <LOCATION>East L.A.</LOCATION>,''' he said.
``I played a great sleazy character. I showed <PERSON>David</PERSON> a copy of the
pilot script and he wrote a script on speculation. They hired him
as a staff writer.''
   Stern has played sleazy characters in other movie roles. In
``Leviathan,'' he was a diver and crew member whose morals were
also at the bottom of the ocean. Despite the numerous underwater
sequences, he said he never got his feet wet. Instead of water,
they made their way through smoke tinted by colored lights to look
like water. Special air vents on their boots blew sand on the floor
so that it appeared to be washed about.
   Stern mostly acts in feature motion pictures, such as ``Diner,''
``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' ``Blue Thunder,'' ``The Milagro
Beanfield War'' and ``One-Trick Pony.'' His only television series
was ``Hometown'' on CBS <DATE>five years ago</DATE>.
   He'd hoped to reprise his character of Shrevie from ``Diner''
for <PERSON>Barry Levinson</PERSON>'s latest movie, ``Avalon,'' but the one-day role
had to be filmed on Thanksgiving Day on location in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>.
Stern had 10 relatives coming for Thanksgiving dinner and had to
turn it down.
   ``When I was hired to narrate I said I'd like to direct,'' he
said. ``I went to the set and met everyone. I observed <PERSON>Steve Miner</PERSON>
direct the pilot. He sort of invented the style and directed a lot
of the shows the first season.
   ``I feel comfortable directing. I've been in about 30 movies and
the <DATE>last 15</DATE> I've kept my eyes open to the process, as opposed to
just sitting in my trailer when I wasn't needed. I took a role in
`My Blue Heaven' just to watch <PERSON>Herbert Ross</PERSON> work. I did that with
<PERSON>Sidney Lumet</PERSON> and `<PERSON>Daniel</PERSON>' and <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> and `Hannah and Her
Sisters' and `Stardust Memories.'''
   His newest movie is ``Coupe De Ville,'' due in <DATE>March</DATE>, about
three brothers who take an old car across country.
   ``They sort of get to know each other on the trip,'' <PERSON>Stern</PERSON> said.
``I was in that car forever. I do all the driving.''
   Stern lived for 12 years in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> before moving to <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>. He and his wife have three children.

FT  30 APR 91 / Technology (Technically Speaking): HDTV standard is
overrated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Filippo <PERSON>Maria Pandolfi</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> research commissioner, is
close to concluding a new directive on satellite TV.
The directive has the support of the European electronics industry and
broadcasters. It also has the backing of <ORGANIZATION>Lord Chapple</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Frank Chapple</PERSON> was the redoubtable general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s electrical
and electronics union. Now, ennobled, he is president of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
television manufacturers' association. Earlier this month he endorsed
<PERSON>Pandolfi</PERSON>'s efforts to create a single European satellite broadcasting
standard, based on the Mac system.
His backing for Mac was not altogether surprising. Mac, touted as the
European route to high definition television, is a British invention. Far
more surprising is that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has a television manufacturers' association.
The last significant British-owned television maker, <PERSON>Ferguson</PERSON>, was acquired
by <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
So who does the <ORGANIZATION>British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers'
Association</ORGANIZATION> (Brema) represent? Ferguson is still a member, as is the UK
branch of <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. But of <LOCATION>Brema</LOCATION>'s 15 members, 10 are
Japanese. Japanese television manufacturers have been busily building
factories in the UK since <DATE>1974</DATE>.
The worrying question for the champions of Mac, such as <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION>,
is why Japanese companies are backing the system. Mac was to be a home-grown
European answer to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s high definition Muse system, ensuring that
companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION> remained among the leaders in
international consumer electronics.
A <DATE>1986</DATE> EC directive required all satellite broadcasters to use the European
system. They would begin with either D-Mac in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> or with D2-Mac in the
rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. D-Mac and D2-Mac are not high definition systems, but they
do provide better images than those currently seen on European screens. The
next step would be for broadcasters to move on to HD-Mac, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s own high
definition system, giving local companies an advantage over Japanese
competitors.
The directive expires at the end of the year and the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> hopes to
present a new one to telecommunications ministers on <DATE>June 3</DATE>. The accord will
result in all satellite broadcasters using D2-Mac.
So why are Japanese companies supporting a system devised to exclude them?
Anyone who talks to Japanese electronics executives soon learns the answer.
They would have liked the Europeans to adopt Muse. But failing that, the
Japanese say they do not really mind what standard the Europeans choose for
high definition television, provided they have one. Whatever the
broadcasting system is, they say, they will manufacture the equipment to
receive it.
The UK-based Japanese set makers have proved themselves formidable exporters
to the rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>, which has a factory in <LOCATION>South Wales</LOCATION>, has won
three Queen's Awards for Export. So successful have the British-based
Japanese companies' exports been that the UK <DATE>last year</DATE> had a Pounds 271m
trade surplus in television sets.
The D2-Mac patent is held by European companies and organisations. They
could make life difficult for Japanese companies which request manufacturing
licences. The Japanese say they will fight any attempt to deny them access
to the European high definition industry. It is unlikely that they can be
excluded forever.
If D2-Mac does become widely accepted in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Philips</ORGANIZATION> will
have won one battle. The war, however, will not have started. Its weapons
will not be directives or government subsidies, but design, price and
reliability - weapons that <PERSON>Lord Chapple</PERSON>'s troops have learned to wield with
devastating effect.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology: A flat vision of the future - A new type of
television screen promises to shake up the global market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consumer electronics industry has been searching desperately for ways to
revitalise the television market. There has been much excitement in the
industry over wide-screen television and, further ahead, high-definition
equipment.
But a different kind of television unveiled by <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric of Japan</ORGANIZATION>
could be just what the industry needs to spark demand among consumers for
new sets.
Matsushita's television boasts a flat screen that is a third of the depth of
conventional sets. Matsushita calls the new product Flat Vision and believes
it can capture more than 10 per cent of the world's display market by the
end of the decade.
The 14-inch television, which <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> will sell in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> from <DATE>October 1</DATE>,
has a screen that is less than 10cm in depth, compared with about 34cms for
conventional televisions of the same size which use cathode ray tubes.
Matsushita also plans to introduce computers and multimedia devices using
the flat panel. If the company succeeds in overcoming some technological
hitches, televisions on the wall may become a reality earlier than expected.
The starting point for Flat Vision lay in what appears to have been an
inspiration from the research and development staff at <LOCATION>Matsushita</LOCATION>. While
consumer electronics makers have tried to make thinner televisons, doing so
with conventional technology, which uses CRTs, was always a problem. CRTs
are necessarily bulky, with an electron beam at the back of the tube to scan
colour dots on the screen's face and produce a moving picture. The tubes are
thick to allow the electron beam enough room to be bent to reach the outer
edges of the screen.
<PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> has overcome the problem by replacing the bulky electron beam
with a matrix of 9,746 tiny tubes that are lined up to form the shape of a
television screen.
Flat Vision consists of 44 vertical wire cathode tubes, with 222 minitubes
per wire cathode on the backplate which emit the electrons. There are five
control plates and a fluorescent surface with colour phosphor strips on the
surface.
The picture is created through the illumination of the fluorescent front
surface by the electrons, with a separate electron beam source for each of
the 9,746 tubes. Each minitube thus acts like a <ORGANIZATION>CRT</ORGANIZATION>, scanning six lines of
two sets of the three colour elements (red, blue and green) to form the
picture.
Flat Vision retains the <ORGANIZATION>CRT</ORGANIZATION> advantage of being self-illuminating and
therefore very bright. 'By allocating only small areas of the display to
each electron beam source, the company was able to achieve a much slimmer
body than if one electron beam was responsible for the entire display area,'
<PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> says.
The closeness of the cathode to the faceplate, the fluorescent surface which
contains colour dots, means it is easy to aim the electron beam to the
proper colour and this enhances the picture clarity and brightness. Since
the <ORGANIZATION>Flat Vision</ORGANIZATION> screen has a grid of small CRTs there is no blurring at the
edges of the screen, allowing a wider viewing angle than conventional
televisions.
There is still much to be improved upon in <LOCATION>Matsushita</LOCATION>'s screen. The company
admits that because the glass of the screen is flat, it is not as strong as
the curved <ORGANIZATION>CRT</ORGANIZATION> screen and is therefore more vulnerable to pressure. This
makes it difficult to produce televisions larger than 20 inches until a
further breakthrough in the technology.
The electronics team at <ORGANIZATION>SG Warburg</ORGANIZATION>, the securities company, believes that
because Flat Vision splits up the screen into a large number of minitubes it
creates faint horizontal lines on the screen in high-resolution
applications, making Flat Vision in its current state unsuitable for
high-definition television.
Its high power consumption also means it is unlikely to become a viable
alternative to liquid crystal display technology found in portable
applications, <ORGANIZATION>SG Warburg</ORGANIZATION> says.
<ORGANIZATION>Matsushita's Flat Vision</ORGANIZATION> product will go on sale in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> at a cost of
Y288,000 (Pounds 1,811). The company initially plans 1,000 units to be
produced a month.
By <DATE>2000</DATE>, <PERSON>Matsushita</PERSON> believes that Flat Vision will sell about 25m units
annually, or more than 10 per cent of the annual worldwide display market
which it forecasts will be 217m units, up from 140m units today, including
<ORGANIZATION>CRT</ORGANIZATION> and LCD devices.
To meet its forecasts the company plans to start licensing the technology,
for which it already has over 133 domestic patents, to third parties. It has
applied for another 1,300 patents in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.

<LEADPARA>  If Japanese consumer electronics companies have their way, in the future
people will do more in their cars than just drive -- they'll watch a color TV,
sing on a karaoke system and fax their friends.;   Those were just a few of
the hundreds of new consumer products on display here Saturday at the annual
Japan Electronics Show. More than 30 electronics companies, all but a handful
Japanese, offered a glimpse of what manufacturers believe will strike a
buyer's fancy in the coming years.  </LEADPARA>

FIRMS SHOW OFF PRODUCTS AT FAIR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Thousands of visitors packed a convention hall to get "hands on" experience
with everything from a digital audio tape machine to a personal relaxation
system called "Mother." Unlike similar shows in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> that are
primarily for business executives, the <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Electronics Show was open to the
public for half its four-day run. In all, 360,000 people saw the displays.;  
Overall, the look of the show was sleek and futuristic. Most of the products
on display had the trademark Japanese slick design, and a wide range of items
-- from phones to television sets -- were available in pastel and primary
colors and the latest neon brights.;   Some products -- like <ORGANIZATION>Sony Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s
ultrathin compact disc player -- simply improved upon existing technology.
Others -- like high-definition television sets with short, wide screens --
aimed to break new ground. The rectangular TVs allow a viewer to zoom in on an
object on the screen, pull back for a panoramic view or even watch several
shows at the same time.;   But don't plan to buy these products in a local
electronics store any time soon. Although <ORGANIZATION>Casio</ORGANIZATION> will begin selling an
automotive color TV in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> later this year, most companies say
it could be two years or more before many of the products are available
outside of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Most of them, however, will hit the Japanese market this
year.;   As would be expected, these products are still at the pricey stage. A
36-inch HDTV receiver will cost about <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> -- and at that price even
usually enthusiastic Japanese consumers aren't buying them, several exhibitors
said. An "intelligent" fax and answering machine, which automatically routes
calls to either device, will sell for about <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>.;   If there was one "hot"
item common to almost every exhibit, it was the idea of a portable, personal
karaoke system. Invented in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, karaoke lets a person sing along with a
popular song but suppresses the recorded words so the singer's voice is easily
heard. Karaoke bars are very popular in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> -- and there are quite a few on
the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> as well -- so Japanese companies like <ORGANIZATION>Sanyo</ORGANIZATION> think they have
come up with a sure winner.;   <ORGANIZATION>Sanyo</ORGANIZATION> showed a "CD Pot," which is a compact
disc player with a microphone for karaoke singing. It is shaped like a rice
pot -- complete with carrying handle -- and comes in black, red and yellow.
<ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>'s new Video Walkman can be mounted in a car. With the vocals turned off,
it can be used as a karaoke system.;   Pioneer's most popular display was its
"Mother" exhibit. Attendees were invited to lie down on a couch and strap
themselves into a biofeedback-like machine. Their heads were placed under a
dome, where blinking lights flashed repeatedly either to stimulate or to
soothe.;   "Mother" is a long way from home use, a Pioneer spokesman said, but
<ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> hopes to sell it to companies for stressed-out employees. No price was
available.;   <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> continued to add new products to its popular "Man" family,
showing the MiniDisc for the first time. The handheld device plays tiny
two-inch compact discs and has both video and audio capability. <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION>
demonstrated it with <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>'s "Bad" video. <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> also showed <ORGANIZATION>Data
DiscMan</ORGANIZATION>, a so-called personal education tool that combines pictures with sound
and text and could be used, for instance, as an electronic encyclopedia or a
foreign language tutor.;   In the midst of the more offbeat items were a
profusion of televisions. And there were two trends that might seem at odds
with one another: TVs are getting bigger -- and smaller. From enormous 55-inch
screens that made a character nearly life-size to two-inch screens on which
the same person would be the size of a fingerprint, Japanese companies like
<ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Panasonic</ORGANIZATION> and Citizen showcased dozens of new televisions with an
emphasis on HDTV.;   High-definition television creates ultra-sharp resolution
by packing more lines on the screen than a normal television.  </TEXT>
