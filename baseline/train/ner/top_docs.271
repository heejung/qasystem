   The miniseries comes to ``Mister <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON>'
Neighborhood'' next week, and the show's cardigan-clad creator
promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever.
   The three-part musical, titled ``Josephine the Short-Neck
Giraffe,'' tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a
long, graceful neck like all the other giraffes. She eventually
grows, <PERSON>Fred Rogers</PERSON> confided, ``not on the outside, but on the
important side.''
   ``It's very much like the usual message of the Neighborhood,
that you can be acceptable as you are,'' he said, smiling. ``It's
not so much the outsides of us that are important.''
   A song sung by <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON> and her friend Hazel the elephant sums
it up best, according to <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``You're much more than a neck, <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON>. And you're much more
than a trunk, Hazel. A chicken's more than a peck, and there's more
than a smell to a skunk,'' <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> quietly sang during an interview
at <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s WQED-TV, home to his children's programs for the
past 35 years.
   The special week of new programs gets under way <DATE>Monday</DATE> on <ORGANIZATION>Public
Broadcasting Service</ORGANIZATION> stations with a trip to the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild
Animal Park</LOCATION>, where viewers are introduced to real-life giraffes and
elephants. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION> visits a film processing lab to have
his animal photographs developed.
   The miniseries, which features a cast of 15, elaborate animal
costumes and five sets, runs <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Rogers
gently guides his young audience from one day to the next,
summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for
<PERSON>Josephine</PERSON>.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Neighborhood of Make-Believe</ORGANIZATION>, where animals sing, dance
and play the trombone, <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON> is befriended by <PERSON>J.R.</PERSON>, a shy
giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON> conquer
hers. He accomplishes that with help from Hazel the elephant, who
advises him to ``just let your heart speak.''
   ``There isn't a time that I see the scene in which <LOCATION>J.R.</LOCATION> talks
and sings with Josephine ... that I haven't gotten chills up my
spine,'' <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said, tapping his right hand against his back.
``And this is something I've worked with for years. There's
something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help
somebody else.''
   Rogers, 61, wrote ``Josephine the Short-Neck Giraffe'' for a
French class assignment at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Rollins College</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1950</DATE>. He
named J.R. the giraffe after fraternity brother <PERSON>John Reardon</PERSON>, who
went on to sing with the Metropolitan Opera and was a frequent
guest on ``Mister Rogers Neighborhood.'' <PERSON>Reardon</PERSON> died a year ago,
and the miniseries is dedicated to him.
   Rogers set the story to music in the late <DATE>1950s</DATE>, and about 1,000
records were pressed. Writer <PERSON>Barry Head</PERSON> transformed ``Josephine the
Short-Neck Giraffe'' into a poem for children in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   For years, <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> tried to have the musical produced on stage or
as an animated film.
   ``I still think it would be great for animation and a stage
production,'' he said. ``But I thought unless we get it out on the
air, I don't think anybody's going to know about it.''
   The story <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the
musical airing next week. It is the Neighborhood's 13th musical.
   ``At the end of the (original) story, when people are telling
<PERSON>Josephine</PERSON> that they like her just the way she is, she raises her
head to look at them because she hasn't really heard this message
before and her neck starts to grow. And it grows and grows and
grows until her neck is as tall as everybody else's,'' <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said.
   In the musical, <PERSON>Josephine</PERSON>'s neck remains short.
   ``I think it shows how much we've grown,'' <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said. ``You
know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable
and to feel acceptable. And wishes don't always come true.
   ``Because for a year and a day I've been wishing, she sang. That
was one of her first songs. Her wish was for a longer neck, she
thought. But really her wish was to have people like her exactly as
she is. So often what we say we're wishing for isn't necessarily
what is behind the wish. This is very philosophical.''
   Will pre-schoolers be able to grasp such a serious message, even
in such a light-hearted setting?
   ``Maybe not in words, but let their hearts speak to them the way
<PERSON>Hazel</PERSON> said to <LOCATION>J.R.</LOCATION>, `Just let your heart speak,''' <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said. ``I
think that that's the way an awful lot of communication takes
place.''

A TALL STORY; 
</P>
<P>
A DEFORMITY IN A GIRAFFE'S NECK HAS BECOME A LEADING ATTRACTION AT THE SANTA 
BARBARA ZOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard the one about the giraffe with a sore throat? Try the one about 
the giraffe with a kink in her neck. 
</P>
<P>
It's no joke to the people at the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara Zoo</LOCATION>. They're baffled by the 
very noticeable zigzag halfway up the neck of the 4-year-old female giraffe. 
</P>
<P>
It's so striking that the gangly animal has become one of the newer attractions 
at the zoo. A sign at the giraffe enclosure even points out the bizarre 
deformity and assures observers the animal is in no pain and that zoo 
veterinarians are monitoring her. 
</P>
<P>
"Our veterinarian contacted other giraffe keepers and no one had heard of 
anything like it," said <PERSON>Nancy Hollenbeck</PERSON>, assistant director of the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
To find out conclusively what is wrong would require that the giraffe be 
anesthetized and X-rayed, she said. That poses a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> risk of death, and 
zoo officials decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
"She walks normally, she eats normally, and she shows no sign of pain," said 
<PERSON>Hollenbeck</PERSON>. The current theory is that it's a muscle contraction that grew 
progressively worse until last <DATE>summer</DATE> and now seems to have stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The giraffe's crooked neck isn't the only new oddity for visitors at the zoo. A 
pair of tapirs recently arrived from <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> to take up residence at 
the zoo. The giant hog-like animals with their long flexible snouts wallow in 
muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
They're far from cute, but the male and female are starting to show an interest 
in each other, and that's good news to zoo officials. The tapirs, relatives of 
the rhinoceros, are an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
There's always something new to see at the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara Zoo</LOCATION> no matter how many 
times you've been there. Because it's a small, compact zoo, it's an easy place 
to take children. The entire 81-acre grounds can be covered in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Located on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, the <LOCATION>Santa Ynez Mountains</LOCATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Clark Bird Refuge</ORGANIZATION>, it's more than a zoo. The garden-like grounds make it a 
horticultural paradise, especially with the addition of a new cactus garden. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's small, the zoo is home to more than 150 kinds of animals -- rare 
animals like the lesser panda, the black and white ruffed lemur, and the golden 
lion tamarin. 
</P>
<P>
It has the usual sampling of elephants, lions, sea lions, monkeys, snakes, and 
a large collection of birds including the rare <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> mynah and a flock of 
flamingos. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest exhibits is the nocturnal hall, a dark setting for the 
animals of the night who sleep during the day. Special lighting reverses night 
and day for the animals and makes it possible to see the night monkey and 
<PERSON>Geoffroy</PERSON>'s cat as they skitter around glassed-in enclosures that look like 
their natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The spookiest exhibit in the nocturnal hall is the re-creation of an old mine 
shaft that is home to a swarm of bats that cling to the beams and flutter 
around as the sounds of the night are piped in. 
</P>
<P>
For children, there's a lot to do at the zoo. A miniature train takes riders on 
a one-mile spin around the zoo grounds. A playground comes in handy when the 
kids need a break from the animals. Or, the children can buy crackers in the 
gift shop and feed the goats in the farmyard exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN: The <LOCATION>Santa Barbara Zoo</LOCATION> is open daily from <TIME>10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TIME>, and 
from <DATE>June 11 through Sept. 3</DATE> (Labor Day) from <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m</TIME>. The elephant 
training demonstrations are usually at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> and the sea lions are generally 
fed at <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> Admission is <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$2</MONEY> for senior citizens and children 2 
to 12 years, and free for those under 2 years. For more information call 
962-5339.

29-YEAR-OLD TOPPER THE GIRAFFE PUT TO SLEEP; AT ZOO SINCE 1962

<P>
Topper, a 29-year-old <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> giraffe, died <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> when his 
chronic foot problems prompted veterinarians to put him to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The death of <ORGANIZATION>Topper</ORGANIZATION> leaves <ORGANIZATION>Checkers</ORGANIZATION>, one of his two longtime mates, as the only 
<LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> giraffe at the zoo, although three Masai giraffes -- a different 
subspecies -- live in an adjoining enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Topper was brought to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> at the age of 2 in <DATE>mid-October, 1962</DATE>, after 
being caught in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>. With Checkers and another mate, Freckles, who died in 
<DATE>1984</DATE>, the 18-foot-tall giraffe sired 21 children, many of whom have populated 
zoos throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
His son Blackjack was for years the Wild Animal Park's breeding male giraffe. 
He died in <DATE>1987</DATE> at the age of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Topper, who suffered from painful foot problems, on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> was 
visited by several of his longtime keepers. He then was led into the giraffe 
barn, where veterinarians injected him with a lethal dose of a sedative. The 
giraffe collapsed onto hay bales, put in place to cushion his fall. 
</P>
<P>
Topper will be cremated at the zoo after an autopsy. LORI GRANGE

The elephant lost its trunk. The 16-foot-tall giraffe lost its head. 
</P>
<P>
Both injuries were the result of a <DATE>1954</DATE> hurricane that roared through this 
<LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> town. But don't worry: The elephant and giraffe recovered and are 
doing just fine. Unlike most other creatures, these animals can grow back any 
missing parts. 
</P>
<P>
They are members of the menagerie here at <ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION>, the oldest topiary 
garden in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Topiary is the art of shaping shrubs and trees into geometric forms, ornamental 
designs, animals, birds, even humans. 
</P>
<P>
Green Animals, a seven-acre estate overlooking <LOCATION>Narragansett Bay</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION>, 
has 80 pieces of topiary scattered among the snapdragons, dusty millers, 
verbenas, marigolds, nasturtiums, zinnias, and other flowers and ornamental 
grasses. 
</P>
<P>
Here at <ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION>, gardeners have clipped, trimmed and pruned shrubs and 
trees into such shapes as tea cups, spirals, gumdrops, flower baskets, a 
policeman, a man on a horse, a bird bath, a trophy cup, a sail boat, a 
pineapple, an obelisk and an oversized, overstuffed chair. 
</P>
<P>
From the animal world, gardeners have created dogs, peacocks, reindeer, a boar, 
a donkey, a camel, a hen, a lion, an ostrich, a rooster, a swan, a unicorn, an 
alligator, a pig, the elephant, the giraffe and a big, round teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
Green Animals was started in <DATE>1872</DATE> by the industrialist <PERSON>Thomas Brayton</PERSON>. His 
chief gardener from <DATE>1905</DATE> to <DATE>1945</DATE> was <PERSON>Joseph Carreiro</PERSON>, who was succeeded by his 
son-in-law, <PERSON>George Mendonca</PERSON>, who ran the gardens until <DATE>1985</DATE>, when <PERSON>Ernie Wasson</PERSON> 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wasson</PERSON>, 40, is a transplanted Californian who received his degree in 
horticulture from <LOCATION>Cal State Humboldt</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest and best topiary gardens in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> are here; <LOCATION>Longwood Gardens</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Ladew Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Disney World</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Wasson</PERSON>, a former 
<ORGANIZATION>Longwood Gardens</ORGANIZATION> horticulturist. 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Thomas Brayton</PERSON> died in <DATE>1939</DATE>, his daughter, <PERSON>Alice Brayton</PERSON>, also a 
horticulturist, inherited the gardens. She owned and operated <ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION> 
until her death at age 94 in <DATE>1972</DATE>. She left the gardens to the Preservation 
Society of <LOCATION>Newport County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, the organization that owns many of the famous 
old mansions of <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Topiary gardens can be traced . . . to ancient <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. Topiarius in <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION> means 
garden. Pliny the Younger, who lived from 62 to 110 AD, had a famous topiary 
garden," <PERSON>Wasson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> has many topiary gardens. So does <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. There's a cemetery in the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION> mountains of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> that has 
topiary figures that are mind-boggling. A topiary garden in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> has a herd 
of elephants." 
</P>
<P>
But <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> remains the mecca of topiary gardens. "Almost every garden in 
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> has topiary," said <PERSON>Wasson</PERSON>, who recently returned from a visit to 40 
topiary gardens in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, including one that is 300 years old. 
In <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, topiary gardeners are known as tree barbers. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through <ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION> with his trimmer in hand, <PERSON>Wasson</PERSON> stopped to prune 
Spot the dog and again to snip away at the ostrich. A self-described 
perfectionist, <PERSON>Wasson</PERSON> often visits zoos to study animals in order to achieve 
realistic shapes for his garden creations. 
</P>
<P>
All the figures here at <ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION> are crafted from growing <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 
privet, yew and boxwood. 
</P>
<P>
"Slow-growing shrubbery is, of course, preferred," said <PERSON>Wasson</PERSON> with a grin.

<LEADPARA>  Plans for what is believed to be the world's first giraffe barbecue have drawn
protests from animal-rights groups, according to a report Thursday.;    The
Star newspaper said a social group called Die Afrikaner Klub plans to roast a
2,800-pound giraffe on an 18-foot-long spit May 4. It said it would take 20
hours to cook the animal.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CLUB PLANNING TO THROW A GIRAFFE ON THE BARBIE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The Star said the event appeared to be the world's first giraffe barbecue.;
   <PERSON>Charles Harper</PERSON>, chairman of the club, said there was strong interest in the
event and that the club already had sold 300 tickets at <MONEY>$40</MONEY> each.;   
Barbecues, called braais, are a popular form of entertainment in <LOCATION>South
Africa.</LOCATION>;    Several animal-rights groups denounced the plan. They said it was
irresponsible to kill a wild animal as "a gimmick.";    "It is extremely
barbaric to stick a giraffe on a spit. Surely we are trying to move away from
this type of thing. It totally devalues wildlife," said <PERSON>Christine Berry</PERSON> of
Beauty Without Cruelty.;    But a spokeswoman for the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the barbecue was not illegal since
giraffes are not on the endangered-animal list. The society said it was no
worse than slaughtering a cow or a sheep.  </TEXT>

   Rocky the lion roars with hunger
and Josefa the polar bear sweats in front of a fan. Porota, the
only hippo, stands in a concrete water tank not much larger than
she, looking doleful.
   The <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> zoo is in bad shape.
   About 1,800 animals are crowded onto 47 acres of land. The
budget of <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> a year is hardly enough to feed them, let
alone provide mates or enough living space and caretakers.
   ``The worst is that, a year ago, we had to kill the goats and
cows to feed other animals,'' said <PERSON>Juan Romero</PERSON>, a veterinarian who
is the zoo's director.
   Five years ago, a hippo died after eating a can and its head was
sold for <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> to buy food for other animals. Now, the head is
displayed in a trendy disco called Hippopotamus.
   A flamingo choked to death on a coin tossed by a visitor. Toto
the giraffe died after swallowing a plastic bag. A condor, used to
soaring over mountains, can barely spread his great wings without
hitting the bars of his cage.
   Porota is not the only solitary animal. The zoo also has only
one rhinoceros, giraffe and elephant.
   Replacing animals was too expensive for municipal
administrations that suffered inflation, recession and near
bankruptcy in recent years. An elephant can cost <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY> and a
rhino <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY>.
   When it opened 102 years ago, the <PERSON>Buenos Aires</PERSON> zoo was an oasis
of shady paths and exotic animals in the noise and pollution of a
city that would grow to a population of 10 million.
   Now, the grass is gone from many enclosures, leaving only dust
and concrete. Some buildings are boarded up and there are few
attendants to remind visitors not to feed the animals, try to catch
them or poke them with sticks.
   Last month, the city leased the zoo to <PERSON>Gerardo Sofovich</PERSON>, a
television host and animal lover, who said he would invest <MONEY>$5
million</MONEY> to buy new animals and spruce the place up.
   Among his plans are building an aquarium and conducting public
education programs about animals and the outdoors.
   Some critics say <ORGANIZATION>Sofovich</ORGANIZATION>'s motives are more mercenary than
philanthropic. They claim his proposed admission fee of about <MONEY>$2</MONEY>
would recoup his investment in a single year and effectively close
the zoo to the poor.
   ``Sofovich ... doesn't want to improve the quality of life of
the animals, but rather enrich himself,'' said <PERSON>Raquel Celoria</PERSON>, who
leads a neighborhood group opposed to the deal.
   The Association for the <ORGANIZATION>Defense of Animal Rights</ORGANIZATION> believes the
number of animals should be reduced by half rather than increased.
   Other opponents cite <ORGANIZATION>Sofovich</ORGANIZATION>'s friendship with President <PERSON>Carlos
Menem</PERSON> and zoo director <PERSON>Romero</PERSON>, a former business partner, in
claiming favoritism.
   Romero responded: ``Those who are protesting now, why didn't
they do anything when the animals were starving?''
   ``People say stupid things,'' Sofovich commented. ``It's not as
if we're going to put in a disco, like some people say. We are
going to do what ... governments could not'' because they didn't
have the money.

<TEXT>
   When <PERSON>Dr. Mitchell Bush</PERSON> talks to the animals at
the <ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, they run for cover.
   ``I don't think there's any animal in the zoo that likes me,''
the zoo's chief veterinarian says ruefully.
   The same furry creatures that would have nuzzled the jovial
Doctor <PERSON>Doolittle</PERSON> cringe in fright when <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> appears, even though he
fought a valiant but unsuccessful round-the-clock battle <DATE>last
weekend</DATE> to save the life of the zoo's newest panda cub.
   Hsing-Hsing, the zoo's giant male panda, ``knows my voice,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
said. But when <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> starts talking, <LOCATION>Hsing-Hsing</LOCATION> lumbers down to his
moat and paces worriedly back and forth.
   Cheeky orangutans who cadge soft drinks from zoo visitors
scramble for safety when <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> shows up. The great apes, he says, can
spot him in a crowd of several hundred tourists and squeeze into a
blind corner in their cage, out of harm's way.
   ``My colleagues ask me, `how can you practice if none of your
patients likes you?''' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   ``I don't relish being the villain, but that's just a fact of
life. I've become used to it. The reality of performing my job is
that it's not conducive to making friends with the animals.''
   A friendlier cageside manner might help, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> concedes. But let's
face it, he says. Who can blame the animals? Who would you prefer?
The veterinarian with his probing fingers and hypodermic needles? Or
the keeper who brings food, maid service and small talk into the
cage?
   ``Most animals like their keepers,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> says.
   A big, bearded bear of a Californian, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, 48, came to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION> from the faculty of <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins Medical School</ORGANIZATION> early
in <DATE>1972</DATE>, just before <LOCATION>Hsing-Hsing</LOCATION> and his panda mate, Ling-Ling,
arrived from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as a gift to President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> for the American
people.
   Over the years, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has presided over most of Ling-Ling's
heartbreaking attempts to breed successfully in captivity. She has
lost five cubs since <DATE>1983</DATE>, most of them victims of their mother's
recurring kidney or uterine infections.
   The latest cub, an unnamed male, died <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> after 39 hours
of fighting an infection transmitted by Ling-Ling. Assisted by a
dozen or more zoo veterinarians and pediatric specialists from
nearby <ORGANIZATION>Children's Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> injected the premature cub with
antibiotics and a serum containing <LOCATION>Hsing-Hsing</LOCATION>'s antibodies to
bolster its fragile immune system.
   The cub, which weighed only 3.1 ounces at birth, was removed from
its 250-pound mother and placed in an oxygen-rich incubator. There
it was fed a special formula through a tube into its stomach and
cuddled by a rubber glove filled with warm water to simulate
Ling-Ling's motherly paw.
   ``Every effort was made to pull this cub through its illness,''
said zoo director <PERSON>Michael Robinson</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> says the giant panda couple probably will be mating early
next <DATE>spring</DATE>, and once again he'll be crossing his fingers.
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is working seven days a week treating everything
from elephants and rhinos to tiny hairy-footed hamsters. ``It seems
like one thing after another,'' he says.
   Among his more memorable challenges were performing a root canal
on a polar bear and playing midwife to a pregnant bongo, an African
forest antelope that tips the scales at 600 pounds and requires
three operating tables to lie on. ``A very stressful procedure,''
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> says.
   Of all his animals, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> says the bears are his happiest
patients. ``Bears just seem to go on and on and on, and they never
give us any problem,'' he said. The most difficult to treat are
giraffes, which tower 16 to 18 feet and risk injury or death when
they fall to the ground under anesthesia, even with ropes erected as
a safety net.
   How does he treat a giraffe for a sore throat?
   ``With benign neglect,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> replied. ``You very rarely hear a
giraffe get vocal, except when they're young. I haven't heard them
say a thing, so I assume there's no complaint.''

<TEXT>
   A giraffe barn on pop music
superstar <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>'s ranch went up in flames, but the
animals were evacuated safely, authorities said.
   Firefighters on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> also kept flames from reaching a nearby
animal compound and chimpanzee house at the ranch in the <LOCATION>Santa Ynez
Mountains</LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, officials said.
   When firefighters reached the remote ranch, the barn was
destroyed and the three giraffes kept there already were evacuated,
said Capt. <PERSON>Charlie Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Barbara County Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman.
   Jackson, whose menagerie includes a chimpanzee named Bubbles,
ostriches, llamas and boa constrictors, was not at the ranch at the
time, said a spokesman for the singer.
   The blaze left an estimated <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> in damage.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but it was
believed to have been accidentally ignited, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.

WILDLIFE -- UP CLOSE 'N' PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, oh best beloved, there was a summer school for all the wild 
animals of the field and forest, veldt and savanna, water hole and river 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The school was at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> east of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, where 250 
animal species, 47 of them endangered, roam over 700 spacious acres in the dry, 
sunny <LOCATION>San Pasqual Valley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <DATE>summer</DATE> school was for the birds -- and for the tigers, gorillas, 
wildebeests, rhinos and, yes, even for weak and puny man cubs. And for their 
parents, too. But at this school, the animals were the teachers and the 
students were the humans. 
</P>
<P>
The school was such a success and the humans learned so quickly that the 
animals got together and voted to continue the program. (Let the record show 
that the giraffes had to be bribed with carrots and that <PERSON>Gainda</PERSON>, the Indian 
rhinoceros, demanded more quality petting time.) 
</P>
<P>
So once again this <DATE>summer</DATE>, from now through <DATE>August</DATE>, the Wild Animal Park is 
offering one-, two-, three- and five-morning classes for youngsters from Grade 
1 through high school. The emphasis is on hands-on learning. Students join 
teachers, staff biologists and keepers to pet, feed, count, look at, listen to 
and -- most important -- learn about the creatures whose world we share. 
</P>
<P>
And for adults? They haven't been forgotten. From now through <DATE>September</DATE>, animal 
admirers and wildlife photographers ages 12 and up can sign up for special 
family and photo caravan safaris into the huge exhibits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These open-air, bumpy expeditions, with 10 guests and two guides standing in 
the back of a truck, spend a couple of hours driving on the dirt roads through 
four of the park's five major habitats, the East and South African, and the 
<LOCATION>Asian Plains</LOCATION> and Asian Waterhole, about 320 acres in all. The guides stop the 
truck at various places to talk about the different animals and hand out 
carrots and apples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Taste of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"The caravans are a little taste of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Larry Killmar</PERSON>, curator of 
mammals. "They're not so rugged or stressful as a safari in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, but they 
get the people down close." 
</P>
<P>
Right! One minute you're adjusting your sunglasses, the next you're looking up 
to see three tons of beady-eyed rhino barreling up to the truck. Then he -- or 
she -- stops and thrusts that huge wrinkled face and rubbery lips right next to 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to shriek or faint. Yech -- kissed by a rhino! Instead, hand over 
an apple and grab your camera. This is a rare chance to shoot wildlife photos 
from a distance of six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your telephoto lens too, to snap candids of this year's crop of shy 
babies. Says <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON>, who has been with the park since it opened in <DATE>1972</DATE>: 
"<DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>August</DATE> is the heavy calving season. We can have as many as eight 
births in a day -- they happen right out there in the exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
If feeding fruit to rhinos seems unnatural when the park's goal is to create an 
authentic living setting for the animals, you are right. And when excessive 
contact with humans does interfere with the animals' social group behavior, 
park biologists eschew it. 
</P>
<P>
But, <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON> says, offering treats to unpredictable and easily spooked Indian 
rhinos is the safest way to manage these 6,000-pound creatures. 
</P>

<P>
"From day one we get the rhino calves used to touching by the keepers," <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON> 
says. "If you give them apples and carrots and goodies, they'll do anything for 
you. This allows us to move them around -- even crate them -- without using any 
tranquilizers." 
</P>
<P>
Each caravan has its own surprises. On a recent outing, Wild Animal Park 
spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> spotted a newly laid ostrich egg lying on the muddy river 
bank. The eggs are a favorite target for hawks, so he stopped to collect it. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors handed it around and agreed it felt large, heavy and very hard. 
Just the right size for an omelet, someone commented. "Do you know how to cook 
an ostrich egg?" Hanscom asked. "You put the egg and a rock in a pot of boiling 
water. When the rock's done, so is the egg." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters coming to the park from the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> area usually are dropped off 
by their parents or ride the bus from <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, but residents of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
probably will find that the park is too far for a daily drive. 
</P>
<P>
A solution is to enroll the child in a one-day class (held each <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME>) and combine it with an all-day family visit to the park. Human cubs, 
grades one through six, join a "Wild Walkabout," visiting koalas and kangaroos 
and all the other strange fauna and flora from the Down Under continent, while 
students in grades seven to 12 enroll in the class called "Close Enough to 
Touch," similar to the photo caravans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Budding Zoologists 
</P>
<P>
The older students actually accompany the keepers into the exhibits, through 
double-chain-link gates to help feed and count the zebras and gazelles and feel 
the giraffe's warm breath when it bends down for a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
If a budding zoologist begs for a three-day class, consider a mini-vacation for 
the family at one of the golf and leisure resorts east of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> or motel 
accommodations in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Start a day at the Wild Animal Park with a ride on the <PERSON>Wgasa Bush</PERSON> Line 
monorail. The monorail runs around the hills above the major habitats and 
provides an overview of the 2,500 animals that live behind special fencing 
called "inrigging." 
</P>
<P>
The fencing isn't all that tall, but it has a tremendous overhang at the top. 
As our monorail tour guide <PERSON>Becky Boomer</PERSON> announced: "The animals get up next to 
the fence and look up. When they see something over their heads, they think 
they can't jump out." 
</P>
<P>
On the ride, keep an eye out for a family of wild golden eagles circling 
overhead. The eagles are a few of the wild birds that have taken up residence 
in the surrounding hilltops and are getting fat on the gophers and mice that 
help themselves to animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
"We call them locals," <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> says, explaining that the Wild Animal Park 
spends between <MONEY>$41,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$46,000</MONEY> monthly on animal food. The grocery bill 
would be higher, but the park actually grows some of its own browse food, such 
as eucalyptus, on the park's 1,800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
After the ride, visitors walk around the 1 1/4-mile <ORGANIZATION>Kilimanjaro Trail</ORGANIZATION> for a 
closer look into the special, smaller exhibits: the <LOCATION>Sumatran</LOCATION> tiger's woody 
hollow, the elephant enclosure, the lowland gorilla's lair and the cheetah's 
grassy plain. The animals are fascinating to watch, but their presence points 
to the Wild Animal Park's real purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Coloration 
</P>
<P>
The park's protective coloration -- the <LOCATION>Nairobi Village</LOCATION>'s thatched snack bar, 
outdoor cafe, T-shirt shop, souvenir store, live animal shows, the petting 
kraal -- is designed like a theme park to attract humans. But, <ORGANIZATION>Hanscom</ORGANIZATION> says, 
the park's real purpose is 'to breed endangered species, and to study breeding 
problems of animals in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says, researchers discovered that flamingos wouldn't lay 
fertilized eggs unless there were at least 100 birds in the flock. "It's the 
number that seems to click the hormones and make them go," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Southern White Rhino . . . for years, the two in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo 
just ignored each other. Then they brought 20 females out here to the animal 
park and moved the male out here to retire, but all he needed was space and a 
harem. In 11 years, he sired 65 calves." 
</P>
<P>
However, numbers aren't always a determining factor. There are cheetahs in the 
wilds, but genetic studies reveal that they're very inbred, probably because 
they live in isolated family groups. As a result, many females are sterile or 
there's a high infant mortality. So the park is breeding cheetahs with better 
genes, then making them available to other zoos. 
</P>
<P>
The park's <DATE>summer</DATE> programs are scheduled almost every day of the week. Photo 
caravans run on <DATE>Wednesday, Thursday</DATE>, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE> afternoons from <DATE>May 
through September</DATE>. Groups of 10 booking together can go any day. Each caravan 
is 1 3/4 hours long; tickets are <MONEY>$50</MONEY> for adults 16 and older and <MONEY>$35</MONEY> for 
children 12-15 with an adult. Children under 12 are not permitted on this 
caravan. The East African and the Asian Plains caravan leaves at <TIME>2:30 p.m</TIME>. The 
caravan to the South African habitat and the Asian Waterhole leaves at <TIME>4:30 
p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
You can take both tours for a full 3 1/2-hour safari; <MONEY>$75</MONEY> for adults and <MONEY>$50</MONEY> 
for children. Because <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> members get a big discount 
on all special tours, it may be possible to save money by joining the zoo at 
the time you enroll. The photo caravans always are sold out and must be booked 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Caravans are similar to photo caravans but emphasize learning about 
and visiting family groups of animals rather than photography. They run <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
evenings from 5:30 to <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> Tickets are <MONEY>$55</MONEY> for one adult with one child, and 
<MONEY>$80</MONEY> for one adult with two children. Children must be 8 or older and be with an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day <DATE>summer</DATE> school runs <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE> from 9 to <TIME>11:30 a.m.</TIME>, 
with a separate class for each grade level from 1 to 9. The three-day 
summer-school program runs <DATE>Monday, Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>1 
p.m</TIME>. The fee is <MONEY>$50</MONEY> and five different classes serve different grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day program runs each <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> and costs <MONEY>$22</MONEY> 
to <MONEY>$35</MONEY>. Different classes are designed for three age groups. 
</P>
<P>
The "Keeper Connection" is a two-session career exploration class for 
10th-to-12th graders who are considering animal-related careers. The fee is 
<MONEY>$50</MONEY>; the first session in <DATE>August</DATE> is on the 11th, and participants have a choice 
for the second second sesssion of any day between <DATE>Aug. 14</DATE> and 18. 
</P>
<P>
You can enroll by telephone and pay by credit card. Call the <ORGANIZATION>Summer School 
Hotline</ORGANIZATION> at (619) 740-9383, or the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> at (619) 236-0163. You also can 
write to the <ORGANIZATION>Summer School</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 551, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
92112-0551, but expect a several-week processing delay. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Park hours are <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> through <DATE>Sept. 4</DATE> (Labor Day), and <TIME>9 
a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> after. The park is 30 miles north of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on Interstate 15, 
then east on Highway 78. From <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> take Interstate 5 south to <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>, 
then <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 78 east to the park. A ticket package (entrance, monorail ride, 
animal shows and exhibits) is <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$6.20</MONEY> for ages 3-15, ages 2 
and under free. Stroller and wheelchair rentals are available. No pets, please; 
the wild animals frown on it.

<LEADPARA>  SEVERAL HUNDRED feet below, a rust-colored scar cuts like a razor through the
glistening Okovanggo swamps. Willie Phillips taps a leathery finger on the
airplane window.;    "There's the new buffalo fence," the big-game hunter
said. "Come back here next spring, and you'll see dead animals all along it."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BOTSWANA'S GIANT FENCE IS KILLING WILDLIFE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The fence runs along the northwest rim of the Okovanggo, an
8,500-square-mile wilderness teeming with game in <LOCATION>northwest Botswana</LOCATION>, where
the <LOCATION>Okovanggo River</LOCATION> makes a fan-shaped inland delta before dying in the sands
of the <ORGANIZATION>Kalahari Desert.</ORGANIZATION>;    Besides cutting migration routes for some of the
<ORGANIZATION>Okovanggo</ORGANIZATION>'s rarest herds, the "buffalo fence" under construction also places
outside the fence one of the wildest and most remote sections of the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>,
the <LOCATION>Magwegqana</LOCATION> peninsula.;     'It's a paradise';    "It's a paradise, I'm
telling you, a paradise," <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. "And it'll all be cattle country
now.";    The fence is the latest part of a long-range plan by the government
to cordon this sprawling, desert nation into cattle and wildlife zones.;   
The fences already have opened massive tracts of formerly wild country to
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s cattle industry. They also have killed tens of thousands of wild
animals -- giraffe, springbok, zebra, eland -- that become tangled in the
sharp wires as they follow their centuries-old migrating routes. In the <DATE>last
decade</DATE>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s population of 300,000 wildebeest was reduced to a little
more than 1,000; they either died in the fences or of thirst in their
water-poor enclaves.;     Government defends fences;    Government officials
defend the program as necessary to <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s lucrative beef trade.
Environmentalists, they say, exaggerate the threat and underestimate the
ability of wildlife to adapt to the fences.;    <PERSON>Ove Nielsen</PERSON>, chairman of the
<ORGANIZATION>Botswana Meat Commission</ORGANIZATION>, complains that foreigners are trying to turn his
country into "a gigantic zoo.";    <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, long considered one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s
most conservation-minded countries, recently has come under increasing attack
from international environmental groups -- partly because of the new fences
and partly for the proposed dredging of 15 miles of river leading out of the
swamps.;     Dredging draws attention;    The dredging, intended to tap the
<ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>'s precious water, has drawn more international attention in recent
weeks. <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> threatened to boycott <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s diamond industry if the
dredging isn't stopped. But many people think the buffalo fence poses the
greater threat.;    "As far as I'm concerned, this is worse than the
dredging," said one environmentalist in <LOCATION>Gaborone</LOCATION>, the capital.;    <ORGANIZATION>Coert Van
Hasselt</ORGANIZATION>, a lawyer based in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, represents a coalition of
environmental groups threatening to launch a global boycott of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s beef
industry because of the fences.;    One concern is the timing of the
construction. Many of the Okovanggo's animals have left the swamp area to
migrate north toward the <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> highlands, where the rains begin in early
<DATE>January</DATE>. If the fence is finished in the next few months, environmentalists
argue, these animals will be caught outside.;     Delay promised;    In
response, the <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> government promised only to plant the tall, wooden
posts for the fence, but to hold off stringing the steel wire until the rains
subside and the animals return to the central Okovanggo.;    But a <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION>
investigator said this month that an inspection showed that the wire was being
put in place and that the new fence's first casualty -- a young giraffe -- had
been found tangled and dead along one completed stretch.;    To
environmentalists, it is as though one of the world's greatest natural
treasures is being sacrificed for the benefit of a handful of major cattle
owners.;    To many Botswanans -- and to many landowners throughout <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> --
it is as though they are being asked to remain primitive and poor so
well-heeled foreigners will have a place to come on vacation.  </TEXT>

   Zoo Story: When Bad Things Happen to Good Beasts

   New York -- Judy, a Baringo giraffe at Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo, has twisted her ankle. Over at the St. Louis Zoo, a
King penguin is limping from a torn toenail. An elephant at
Washington's National Zoo is down in the mouth with an
impacted tooth. And at the San Diego Zoo, a Gila monster is
feeling as hideous as it looks, thanks to a nasty mouth
infection.
   Zoo animals, like the people who come to gawk at them, get
sick once in a while. The difference is that their doctors
never charge them and sometimes they even make house calls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I would say our health plan is as good as Blue Cross,"
said <PERSON>Dr. Robert A. Cook</PERSON>, chief veterinarian for the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, the
Central Park Zoo and the <LOCATION>New York Aquarium</LOCATION>. "Dental's
included . . . there's no deductible."
   Dr. <ORGANIZATION>Cook's Animal Health Center</ORGANIZATION>, a handsome two-story
building on the grounds of the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION>, is one of the
biggest zoo hospitals in the country. The health center
oversees the well-being of the society's more than 9,000
animals. If a recent visit is any indication, members of this
zoological health plan receive better medical care than most
of their <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> neighbors -- the human ones, that is.
   It starts with a no-holds-barred checkup for every
newcomer. A recent morning found <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> busy arranging for
the arrival of a group of tamarin monkeys from another zoo,
which would stay at the clinic for a month-long quarantine
period.
   "They'll undergo TB tests, chest X-rays,
electrocardiogram, <ORGANIZATION>CBC</ORGANIZATION> {complete blood count}, a biochemical
profile, a viral screen, a physical exam-plus dental work, if
they need it," said <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>, an easy-going fellow with a
cage-side manner soothing to tamarins and tapirs alike.
   His day had started, like most, with the <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> rounds
accompanied by the center's two other veterinary clinicians.
Apart from the quarantined animals -- a group of deer, some
caged sugar gliders (marsupials from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>) and a <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>
rat bound for the zoo's <ORGANIZATION>Mouse House</ORGANIZATION> -- the clinic's patients
that day included a diabetic monkey, an orphaned baby black
buck (the spiral-horned Indian antelope), a
bedraggled-looking <PERSON>Shama</PERSON> thrush suffering from feather loss,
and <PERSON>Whoopi</PERSON>, an ailing penguin from the <LOCATION>New York Aquarium</LOCATION>.
   "She had lost a lot of weight and wasn't keeping food down
-- she has a fungal infection," said <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>. "She's been on
experimental treatment for about two months."
   Grabbing a walkie-talkie, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> set out on a quick tour
of the wards -- a series of indoor/outdoor cages, clean
despite the healthy zoo stench. Whoopi was poking around her
outdoor enclosure as a veterinary technician tried to
interest her in a fish.
   "I just repeated an endoscopy -- a flexible fiberoptic
examination of the stomach -- on her yesterday," said <PERSON>Dr.
Cook</PERSON>.
   And how exactly does one go about examining the stomach of
a penguin? In the clinic's large surgery, which boasts an
operating table, electrocardiograph unit and ultrasound
machine, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> showed off his tool of choice.
   "This is used for looking at the colon of humans. We use
it for looking at the stomachs of animals," he said. "Most of
our equipment comes from ordinary hospitals."
   The king-sized operating table with hydraulic lifts is
another matter. The veterinary team uses it for working on
hefty patients such as a gorilla or zebra. Anything bigger --
a camel, for instance -- can simply be laid out on the
surgery floor. And for operating on newborn birds and other
diminutive patients, veterinarians rely on microscopes and
microsurgical tools.
   Keeping animals anesthetized during surgery requires even
more specialized equipment. A four-foot-long endotracheal
tube is used on giraffes' throats, and gas masks of all
shapes and sizes line one wall, including a test-tube-sized
mask used on snakes and small birds. To put a sea lion under,
<PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>'s team fashioned a gas mask from a plastic
disinfectant jug.
   The biggest challenge zoo vets may face is getting the
invalid to the hospital. When it comes to dealing with a
stubborn patient -- a Siberian tiger, say -- the clinic
boasts a veritable arsenal of scoped rifles, blowpipes and
pole syringes -- all of which can be used to anesthetize
animals from a safe distance. In the clinic's pharmacy, <PERSON>Dr.
Cook</PERSON> pulled out a paper target.
   "Every once in a while I practice on the rifle range," he
said. "You have to be pretty good."
   The knocked-out animals are then carried over to the
clinic on stretchers or boards, where vets take advantage of
the animal's anesthetized state to do a full physical
checkup, do a little root canal, even clean their teeth.
   Not that every animal makes it to the clinic. Say you've
got a sick elephant. "We'd go to the elephant," <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>
said, showing off a full array of portable hospital equipment
-- including an X-ray machine.
   He also goes to the whales. On a recent weekday, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>
made his house calls at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Aquarium -- which he or
a colleague will visit twice a week, along with the <ORGANIZATION>Central
Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION>. First on the list was <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION>, a 1,500-pound walrus
with an eye infection. <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION> are old
acquaintances: He had guided her through a painful tusk
infection requiring four operations in one year.
   Now, a tuskless <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION> bounded up out of her pool to greet
her trainer, <PERSON>Martha Saif</PERSON>, a lanky blonde in T-shirt and
shorts who came with bucket of fish and a bottle of eyedrops.
<PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON> had been administering the drops several times a day
on the instructions of <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> and a veterinary
ophthalmologist.
   "She's come a long way as far as that eye goes," <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>
said, as <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION> snuffled up squid after patiently enduring a
quick examination.
   Since most of the sea mammals at the aquarium are trained,
these examinations are relatively painless for doctor and
patient alike. It would be hard to imagine a better patient
than <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>, a beluga whale with a scraped eye, who
obediently pulled up at poolside and lifted her head over the
edge on <PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON>'s instruction.
   "She's much improved -- the area of redness has cleared up
quite a bit," <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> said, as <PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON> put in the whale's
eye ointment. After receiving several fish as a reward,
<PERSON>Marina</PERSON> placidly presented her tail for <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> to take a
blood sample.
   "That's terrific, <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON>, sounding a lot
like the parent of a child getting its finger pricked, as <PERSON>Dr.
Cook</PERSON> carefully inserted a butterfly needle.
   A dolphin with some minor scrapes on its tail and a seal
with a cut snout rounded out <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>'s visit. Occasionally,
he'll even work on fish. "I did multiple surgery on a lung
fish with cancer," he said modestly.
   But veterinary skill and dedication notwithstanding, zoo
patients do eventually go the way of all flesh. While showing
a visitor out of the <ORGANIZATION>Animal Health Center</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> paused to
ask a technician to turn on a fan.
   "A geriatric antelope passed away in the night," he
explained, as a sickly odor spread down the corridor from the
necropsy room, where pathologists conduct a full autopsy on
every deceased animal.
   The departed are gone but not forgotten. Zoo pathologists
see to it, by preserving a piece of all the animal's organs
in a large jar for future research. A back room in the clinic
is a veritable library of animal organs, with jars going back
as far as 20 years. In a bizarre twist, death has made
neighbors of "<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s Hartebeest, 5-691," "Hispaniolan Boa,
<DATE>'87</DATE>" and "Sea Lion, 10-10-90" -- all of which are grouped on
neighboring shelves, a stone's throw from the bottled
reproductive tract of a wisent (the nearly extinct European
bison).
   So after spending a 12-hour day in such exotic company --
living and dead -- what kind of pet does <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> go home to?
A tame lion cub, perhaps, or a lama tethered in his backyard?
   "A parrot," he said. "My wife's allergic to cats and
dogs."

Chiropractic for Animals Is
A Fast-Growing Specialty;
Some Vets Are Skeptical

   For a chiropractor, manipulating the bones in the neck may be strictly routine. 
But when the patient is a giraffe, it is a little tougher. 

   <PERSON>Daniel R. Kamen</PERSON>, a chiropractor here, first climbed up an 11-foot ladder. 
Then he placed his hands on the giraffe's neck. 

   Whack! 
The giraffe swung its powerful neck against <PERSON>Mr. Kamen</PERSON> and knocked him to the ground. 
"I felt ridiculous, but I wanted to see if it could be done," the 31-year-old chiropractor says. 

   Touchy giraffes are just one problem facing practitioners of one of the medical world's faster-growing specialties, animal chiropractic. 
A growing number of chiropractors are manipulating (or, as they put it, "adjusting") the bones of horses, dogs, cats, llamas and parakeets. 

   At least as a sideline, "several hundred" chiropractors now look at Fido as well as his owner, estimates <PERSON>Werner E. Hoff</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, chiropractor. 
This compares with perhaps a dozen when he first tackled an animal's bad back a decade ago, <PERSON>Mr. Hoff</PERSON> says. 

   A few chiropractors now practice on animals full time, including several who are also veterinarians. 
<PERSON>Mr. Kamen</PERSON> has even started an association of animal chiropractic -- called "Animals Crackers." 

   The animal-chiropractic field, however, hasn't been universally acclaimed. 
"We aren't aware of any body of scientific literature established to prove that chiropractic is useful or not useful for animals," says <PERSON>Arthur Freeman</PERSON>, the executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Veterinary Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>. 
"I don't think veterinary chiropractic has been around long enough," <PERSON>Dr. Freeman</PERSON> adds. 

   Whatever the strictures, animal chiropractors say they are getting results -- even where traditional veterinarians flopped. 
For instance, an anorexic dog regained its appetite after chiropractic relieved its hind-leg lameness, says <PERSON>Sharon L. Willoughby</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Port Byron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, chiropractor-veterinarian. 

   <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> says her work has restored a female parakeet's love life. 
Following a neck injury, the patient sat in the bottom of her cage, didn't eat and didn't move about. 
Her cage-mate -- a male -- fed her by dropping food in her mouth. 

   "Her bones were so tiny that when I adjusted her neck, I thought I had broken it," <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> says. 
But within minutes, the invalid started turning her neck to preen her feathers. 
Though she had never laid an egg before, she soon laid and hatched six. 
"Chiropractic made her much more amorous," <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> says. 

   In <LOCATION>Buffalo Grove</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Michael Soto</PERSON>, a jeweler and racehorse owner, turned to <PERSON>Mr. Kamen</PERSON> when a back problem plunged one of his horses into a losing streak. 
After the treatment, the horse won <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> in one race and <MONEY>$4,500</MONEY> in another. 

   Another equine example: <PERSON>Kathryn Sickling</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> businesswoman and horse breeder, recalls a favorite horse made lame by a nerve injury. 
Three veterinarians prescribed rest, but that didn't help. 
One vet talked of euthanasia. 

   Ready to "try anything," she says, <PERSON>Ms. Sickling</PERSON> called in <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON>. 
She also shelled out <MONEY>$80</MONEY> to have a professional masseur massage her beloved beast. 
"A week later, I was riding the horse. 
Nobody could believe it," <PERSON>Ms. Sickling</PERSON> says. 
"A few years ago, nobody ever thought about chiropractic for animals. 
So many animals are killed that don't need to be." 

   Animal chiropractors concede that traditional veterinary techniques often work where theirs would serve no purpose. 
But <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> says the success others had with chiropractic made her switch careers. 
After 13 years as a veterinarian, "I couldn't see why I wasn't getting more animals better," she says. 
"Sixty-five percent of my income came from giving vaccinations and removing sex organs," she adds. 
"I was really burned out. 
I considered going into acupuncture." 

   Then one of her clients decided to take a chronically lame dog to a chiropractor. 
"I thought it was pretty silly, but the dog started walking more normally thereafter," <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> says. 
"This was a turning point in my life." 

   <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> gave up her veterinary practice and started studying chiropractic to earn her second doctorate. 
Today, she lives in a large house with a dog, two cats, five chickens and a goat that likes to walk on her horse's back. 
She practices chiropractic only on animals. 

   To work on a horse, <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> climbs up on a couple of bales of hay. 
Some chiropractors place a padded 2-by-4 against a large animal's bones and pound the board with a mallet. 
<PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> uses her bare hands. 
To develop the strength to manipulate a large animal's bones, she had to practice weight lifting. 

   But the animal chiropractor's worst problem is the law. 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Veterinary Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Dr. Freeman</PERSON>, laws in all 50 states restrict medical treatment of animals to veterinarians. 

   That isn't a problem for practitioners like <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON>, who are already veterinarians. 
Many others, like <PERSON>Mr. Kamen</PERSON>, stay within the law by working on animals free of charge, usually for friends or human patients. 
Some states allow chiropractors to work with animals on a veterinarian's referral. 

   But many chiropractors run into trouble. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hoff</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION> chiropractor, says he treated hundreds of horses -- until veterinarians got a court order two years ago barring him and other <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> chiropractors from working on animals. 

   Veterinarians say they are just thinking of the animals. 
Many chiropractors say the vets are just protecting their turf. 
However, many chiropractors also urge caution. 
"Personally, I think we need more validation of these procedures for animals," says <PERSON>Donald L. Harris</PERSON>, the executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Chiropractic Association</ORGANIZATION> -- who himself occasionally has practiced chiropractic on animals when a veterinarian requested it. 
He says the association supports veterinary chiropractic to the extent it is permitted "but wouldn't support it where it is prohibited." 

   The debate over the usefulness of chiropractic for animals doesn't help members of a profession that has suffered decades of derision. 
In <LOCATION>Davenport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, medical students used to drive by <ORGANIZATION>Palmer College of Chiropractic</ORGANIZATION> jeering, "Quack, quack, quack," <PERSON>Dr. Willoughby</PERSON> says. 

   The field began in <DATE>1895</DATE>, when <PERSON>Daniel David Palmer</PERSON>, the father of chiropractic, performed the historic first adjustment in <LOCATION>Davenport</LOCATION>. 
He founded <ORGANIZATION>Palmer College</ORGANIZATION>, now the world's largest chiropractic school. 
His premise was that the displacement of vertebrae can interfere with nerves, disrupt the body's functioning and produce numerous ailments. 

   For years, the profession suffered from exaggerated cure-all claims of some early enthusiasts. 
But it has gradually gained much more acceptance. 
As part of a court-case settlement last month, the <ORGANIZATION>American Hospital Association</ORGANIZATION> recently dropped its objection to giving chiropractors rights to practice in hospitals. 

   But nothing was said about, say, admitting a goat with a sore back to the emergency room.

   A British acrobatic troupe postponed its
opening performance at the <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION> World Festival because of
delays in getting its animal costumes out of customs quarantine.
   The costumes were in boxes marked ``rabbit ears,'' ``cat paws''
and ``giraffe,'' and customs officials apparently feared the boxes
contained animals or parts of them. The ``giraffe'' actually had
nothing at all to do with an animal _ it's a circus term for a
6-foot unicycle.
   The 17-member troupe Circus Burlesque retrieved its costumes and

<TEXT>
   It was enough to make a little girl cry.
   The hand-carved carousel at <ORGANIZATION>Quassy Amusement Park</ORGANIZATION>, a favorite of
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> children since <DATE>1919</DATE>, was auctioned off piece by piece
to high-rolling antiques dealers and collectors for a total of
<MONEY>$638,000</MONEY>.
   By <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, the four dozen wooden horses, zebras,
giraffes and other animals that had ridden together for decades
were being separated and taken to faraway places like <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state.
   ``It chokes you up a lot more than you thought it would,'' said
<PERSON>George Frantzis</PERSON>, whose family has owned the amusement park for
three decades.
   The merry-go-round was built in <DATE>1902</DATE>. Quassy bought it in <DATE>1919</DATE>
and operated it until this <DATE>summer</DATE>. Experts say only about 70
hand-carved wooden carousels remain of the estimated 6,000 that
dotted the American landscape at the turn of the century.
   The Quassy carousel fell victim to a trend _ a bidding frenzy
among private art collectors that has caused the value of antique
carousels to skyrocket. The <PERSON>Frantzis</PERSON> family said it could no longer
afford to maintain or insure the carousel and decided to replace it
with one made of fiberglass.
   Bidding opened when <PERSON>Jimmy Filler</PERSON>, a scrap-iron dealer from
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, bid <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> on the prize of the carousel, a lion.
Seattle antiques dealer <PERSON>Sam Pemberton</PERSON> outbid Filler, offering
<MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>. He said he would restore the lion and sell it.
   ``We've never had a lion and we wanted to get one,'' <PERSON>Pemberton</PERSON>
said.
   One after another, the wooden animals were sold _ sea horses,
camels, reindeers, a tiger and a goat.
   A camel went for <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>, a tiger for <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY>, a giraffe for
<MONEY>$27,500</MONEY>, and finally, the Wulitzer organ went for <MONEY>$21,500</MONEY>. Filler
ended up buying six animals.
   The <PERSON>Frantzis</PERSON> family had hoped a collector would purchase the
entire carousel and keep it intact, but no one came forward.
Schoolchildren in Old Saybrook even wrote to <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, asking
him to buy the merry-go-round.
   But <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> was not in the park when bidding on the individual
pieces was complete and auctioneer <PERSON>David Norton</PERSON> offered one last
chance to keep the colorful herd together. A bid of <MONEY>$766,000</MONEY> _ <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> above the total of the separate bids _ would have saved the
carousel. No one raised a hand.
   ``The machine has been sold piecemeal!'' Norton shouted.

I couldn't be sure how many were out there. They had just shaken me from a deep 
sleep, a herd of cavorting hippopotamuses bellowing like out-of-tune tubas as 
they blundered and splashed in the dark waters a hundred feet from my tent. 
</P>
<P>
No one had said anything about camping with hippos, I thought as I listened to 
their midnight mirth on the shore of <LOCATION>Lake Baringo</LOCATION>. I lay awake most of the 
<TIME>night</TIME>, tracking their sounds through my canvas tent and waiting to sidle into 
the darkness to the distant latrine. But even when the revelry subsided and the 
camp seemed calm, the snorts and grunts of a lone hippo grazing between the 
tents kept me stranded inside. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finally left the tent, the African sun was burning through the 
dawn clouds. The hippos were back in the lake resting, only their heads poked 
through the water, brown bumps peeping at the shore. We eight campers peered 
back, shaking our heads in awe and amusement at our obnoxious neighbors. I 
walked toward the lake to get a closer look. Two hippos yawned, showing 
cavernous, pink mouths. Others paddled closer, then circled out in single file 
and disappeared into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Camping," a friend said as we walked back to our tents, "is the only way to 
see <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
That's the sentiment that convinced me to go camping for the first time. Until 
then, my idea of roughing it had been staying at a motel without an ice 
machine. But as our group reached the halfway point on a two-week camping 
safari through <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s most popular lakes and game parks in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of <DATE>last 
year</DATE>, I couldn't imagine better accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are more comfortable ways to go on safari. One can see 
elephants grazing or lions playing in the high grass as easily from a lodge as 
from a campsite. But to fully experience the world beyond a minibus window, 
camping is authentically best. The sound of a hyena prowling outside your tent 
wraps you in the romance and reality of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The snow-covered peak of <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>'s Mt. Kilimanjaro loomed through a sheath of 
clouds like a celestial being. On the blazing plain below, a bearded wildebeest 
scampered before a dozen grazing zebras, darting and leaping in a lunatic 
dance. A jackal ran ahead of the bus, then dived into the brush. A small herd 
of elephants grazed near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
We had just arrived in <ORGANIZATION>Amboseli National Park</ORGANIZATION> after a four-hour trek on the 
dusty, pockmarked roads from <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>. Our guide, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, sat amused in the 
driver's seat, politely jerking the minibus to a stop with each oohhh and aahhh 
from behind. "We will get much closer to the animals," he said. "Are you sure?" 
someone asked. "Yes, yes. I am sure. Trust me," he said, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
A 30ish member of the Kikuyu tribe with extensive knowledge of the game parks, 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> not only tracked animals but maneuvered the minibus to within a few feet 
of fighting elephants and feeding lions. Amboseli, one of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s smallest game 
parks, is famous for its herds of wildebeests, <ORGANIZATION>Burchell</ORGANIZATION>'s zebras, water 
buffaloes, gazelles and a handful of the endangered rhinoceroses, but it's the 
elephants that seize the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the elephants have been heavily poached for their ivory during the 
last decade, the gray giants seemed to be everywhere in <LOCATION>Amboseli</LOCATION>. They grazed 
in herds numbering from a few individuals to a few hundred, always with 
sentries posted for their only predator, man. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside our minibus, a calf tried to filch a bunch of grass that another calf 
had shaken free of dirt. A bull inexplicably dropped to its front knees and 
kicked its hind legs like a circus performer. Two juveniles squared off in 
play, their trunks entwined, one driving the other like a sumo wrestler into 
our shadow. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk we drove to our campsite, marked by a stone in a cluster of thorn trees 
surrounded by the the dusty plain. 
</P>
<P>
This is the no-frills camp. Those wishing more pampered treatment can choose 
from several luxury tour operators who offer campsites with permanent tents and 
private baths, meals served on fine china and good wines. But we were 
comfortable enough in our rickety abodes, sleeping in bags on thin foam 
mattresses and dining on staples -- lots of bread, cheese and fresh fruit. The 
cost was about <MONEY>$1,200</MONEY> each. 
</P>
<P>
Our first night in the bush was cool and quiet; it surprised me. I expected the 
night to be more menacing and claustrophobic. The cook managed a good meal of 
pasta, potatoes and beans on a fire that brought our group together under the 
sparkling canopy of the <LOCATION>Southern Hemisphere</LOCATION>. Over drinks, we traded stories of 
travels and careers, and drifted into the darkness to our tents. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few days our routine was to drive in the morning to view 
wildlife and return in the heat of the day to camp, some to sit at the shaded 
table to read or write letters, while others washed clothes or napped. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon I followed the sounds of laughter from my tent to the edge of 
camp, where three young Masai herdsmen leaned against a minibus, talking with a 
few of our group. They wore traditional red cloth, tied like a toga over their 
lanky frames. Elaborate red and yellow earrings dangled from their spool-sized 
lobes. Their hair, braided and matted with red ocher and fat, stained the backs 
of their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of them let us examine his weapons. He appeared to be in his 20s, 
but no one was sure -- years are not counted by the <LOCATION>Masai</LOCATION>. We touched the sword 
and spear he used to protect his cattle from predators. The Masai protect their 
herds fiercely, for not only do they measure their worth in cattle, they live 
on milk and blood drawn from living cows. 
</P>
<P>
We spent two more hours together. They were intrigued by our jewelry, cameras 
and sunglasses. Then they returned to the bush to watch their cattle graze 
under the high sun. We went back to writing and reading about the people of 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in <LOCATION>Amboseli</LOCATION>, we headed north through the lush forests and 
grasslands of <LOCATION>Mt. Kenya</LOCATION>, then out on the plains to the <ORGANIZATION>Samburu Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION>. We 
set up camp on the sandy banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro, a muddy oasis amid a 
parched landscape of desert scrub and savanna that's home to a range of 
wildlife. It's one of the few places in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to see the reticulated giraffe 
and the <PERSON>Grevey</PERSON>'s zebra, together with Marabou storks, gazelles, dik-dik and 
gerenuk (varieties of antelope), and, of course, vultures. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu brought home the usual risks of camping: a snake near the latrine, 
warnings of scorpions and of crocodiles. An unusual risk, too: "There has been 
some trouble with Sudanese refugees," our guide said as he explained why two 
guards armed with machine guns had been hired to patrol the camp. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> was 300 miles from our camp, an unlikely source of danger. Only after our 
return to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> did the reason become clear: In <DATE>July, 1989</DATE>, 
poachers and bandits were believed to have slain five tourists, including a 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> woman, in the game parks. Since then the Kenyan government has 
stepped up patrols and instituted a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. The 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> currently says security has "improved markedly" but 
cautions against solo camping. 
</P>
<P>
We moved west from <LOCATION>Samburu</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Lake Baringo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s lake region in the scar 
of the <LOCATION>Rift Valley</LOCATION>. The rough roads carried us slowly through the late-morning 
bustle of small villages. A man, twirling a blade of grass in his teeth, walked 
his bicycle past a woman balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. Outside 
the villages, herdsmen pushed their goats and cows through the valley fields. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous of the <LOCATION>Rift Valley</LOCATION> lakes is <LOCATION>Lake Nakuru</LOCATION>, where, in one of the 
world's greatest bird spectacles, 2 million flamingos gather in alkaline waters 
to feast on its algae. 
</P>
<P>
One sees a bustle of pink and white as the birds skittishly preen, feed, honk 
and flap. Their spindly necks and legs belie the gracefulness they reach in the 
air, black-spotted wings and outstretched bodies in effortless flight which 
concludes with a running splash in the shallow waters. 
</P>
<P>
The national park at <LOCATION>Lake Nakuru</LOCATION> pales in comparison with the others; we saw 
only a few water bucks and oryxes there. But, as with the hippos at <LOCATION>Lake 
Baringo</LOCATION>, the best wildlife encounters took place at the campsite. As we set up 
camp under the tall acacias, water bucks grazed in the lush green grass, dozens 
of Vervet monkeys skittered about and a handful of baboons retreated to the 
bushes behind our tents. 
</P>
<P>
At night a group of bush pigs crashed through the food tent, bumbling in the 
dark through the cans and pots. The cook screamed to scare them off, and a few 
of us laughed as he muttered about his sleepless night. 
</P>
<P>
We left the <ORGANIZATION>Rift Valley</ORGANIZATION> -- and the only campsites with showers and toilets -- 
for three days in <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara</ORGANIZATION>, the largest and last game park on our safari. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION> ranges over 974 square miles that adjoin the Serengeti 
Plain of <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> and is famous for the more than 1 million wildebeests and 
thousands of zebras, gazelles and antelopes that migrate there once a year. 
</P>
<P>
We found instead a smattering of gazelles, giraffes, topi and anxious predators 
amid an Edenic landscape of grassy plains and acacia trees. 
</P>
<P>
A male lion, his ribs showing through an emaciated body, moved slowly along the 
plain. The wind rustled his black mane. Behind him, in the golden camouflage of 
the savanna, three lionesses licked and nuzzled their cubs as they grappled for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, five giraffes marched in a row, heads bobbing in unison. Shafts 
of light broke through a low cumulus canopy onto hundreds of <ORGANIZATION>Thomsen</ORGANIZATION>'s gazelles 
as they grazed. 
</P>
<P>
These and other images that unfolded during the next three days enraptured me 
as we crisscrossed the vast <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara</ORGANIZATION>. Even the driving rainstorm that 
shortened our last game drive and toppled my tent left me secured by this 
noble, pristine landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It was our <TIME>last night</TIME> on safari. The rain had soaked my tent and sleeping bag 
and left me only a small spot to sit on. I waited for the storm to end, 
remembering a conversation I had with a Kikuyu merchant at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you like our country?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite beautiful," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but it is only beautiful to the foreigner," he said. "To us it's only 
very poor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the realities of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> -- the potholes of its capital, the poaching of 
its wildlife -- belie much of the land's romance. Some of us carried <PERSON>Karen 
Blixen</PERSON> books and other adventure stories to help us imagine a world long gone. 
</P>
<P>
But as we drove through <PERSON>Masai Mara</PERSON> for the final time, a shared, primeval 
heritage still seemed to beat on these vast plains. It was quiet and empty and 
I watched the bus tracks dissolve in the grass. I wished to see a giraffe or 
gazelle for the last time, but there was nothing, only a solitary, crooked 
acacia twitching in the wind.

<HEAD>New Central Park Zoo Opens Amid Fishfare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking for lions and tigers and other big
animals? Not in the new Central Park Zoo.
   The zoo, which officially opened amid much fanfare <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
instead has a more eclectic offering: the <PERSON>Golfodulcean Dart</PERSON> poison
frog, the tufted puffin, the plumbeous water redstart (that's a
bird, folks).
   ``It doesn't seem like a zoo to me. It doesn't have any
elephants or any giraffes,'' complained <PERSON>Daniella Alonzo</PERSON>, 10, one of
the first visitors to the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> renovation, who nevertheless
said the zoo was ``nice.''
   There are 450 animals from more than 100 species. Unlike the old
zoo, the new zoo has no large animals because of space.
   ``This is a mini-zoo, to show things likely to arouse people's
interest and a sense of caring,'' said <PERSON>Dr. William G. Conway</PERSON>,
general director of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the
zoo for the city <ORGANIZATION>Parks Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   A 4-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of
the opening as the new attractions, housed in three different
``habitats,'' drew 13,701 first-day visitors. Most didn't share
<PERSON>Daniella</PERSON>'s disappointment.
   ``These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who
have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON>Patricia Benitez</PERSON>, who
toured the <ORGANIZATION>Tropic Zone</ORGANIZATION> habitat with classmates from her <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>
day camp.
   Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the <ORGANIZATION>Polar
Circle</ORGANIZATION> is home to polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the
<ORGANIZATION>Temperate Territory</ORGANIZATION> is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea
lions.
   Mayor <PERSON>Edward I. Koch</PERSON> cut the ribbon to officially open the new
zoo before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named <ORGANIZATION>Finn</ORGANIZATION>.
   Finn, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the
middle of the park, waved to <PERSON>Koch</PERSON>, waved to the visitors, caught
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request.
   The renovation was supposed to cost <MONEY>$28 million</MONEY>, but came in at
about <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, partly because work took several months longer
than anticipated, <ORGANIZATION>Parks Commissioner Henry Stern</ORGANIZATION> said. Construction
began in <DATE>April 1985</DATE>.
   The commissioner was enthusiastic over the results. ``The other
zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said <PERSON>Stern</PERSON>, referring to
the zoo that was shut down in the <DATE>winter of 1983</DATE>. ``So we've built
a humane zoo, a zoo for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>.''
   There was one other new feature: visitors, who once toured for
free, now pay <MONEY>$1</MONEY>; senior citizens pay <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>, while kids come
through for a quarter.
   ``When I learned they were charging, I insisted the zoo has got
to cost less than an ice cream cone. If you can find an ice cream
cone for less, I'd like to see it,'' said <PERSON>Stern</PERSON>. ``Times have
changed.''

FT  18 JUN 92 / Backer sought to save London zoo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> ZOO, the world's oldest zoo and one of the capital's leading tourist
attractions, is to close in <DATE>September</DATE> unless a private backer can be found.
The zoo, which occupies 36 acres in the north part of <ORGANIZATION>Regent</ORGANIZATION>'s Park, has
been in financial difficulties for some time. Attendances so far this year
have been up to 30 per cent below last year and the zoo has a deficit of
Pounds 2m on annual running costs.
Sir <PERSON>John Chapple</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, which runs
the zoo, said closure was the only option 'that will ensure the survival of
the society as a whole'.
He said discussions were continuing with interested parties, but he refused
to name them. A government bail-out is unlikely after it refused further
grants last year and told the zoo to put its house in order.
As part of a royal park, the zoo is technically the property of the Queen,
but is managed by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of National Heritage</ORGANIZATION> and leased to the
society for a peppercorn rent.
It has nine listed buildings. They include the <LOCATION>Mappin</LOCATION> terraces, built for
bears in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> with a donation from jewellers <ORGANIZATION>Mappin &amp; Webb</ORGANIZATION>; and the
penguin pool, designed in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> by <PERSON>Berthold Lubetkin</PERSON>. The oldest listed
buildings, dating from the <DATE>first half of the last century</DATE>, include the camel
and giraffe houses, both by <PERSON>Decimus Burton</PERSON>.
The listed buildings need repairs estimated at Pounds 15m. Under the terms
of the lease the society is responsible for repairs, but last year the
government agreed to assume responsibility if the zoo surrendered the site.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Heritage Department</ORGANIZATION> is not legally bound by planning
regulations, but it said it would seek planning permission in the normal way
if it decided to demolish one or more of the buildings.
Options for the site are limited by regulations for royal parks. The
department said yesterday there was 'no question at all' of office or
residential development, and it was 'most unlikely' that a commercial
development such as a theme park would replace it. The most likely options
appear to be reversion to general park use, or a scaled-down zoo.
The zoo's likely demise was first announced last year, but after a
cost-cutting programme it broke even in <DATE>March</DATE> and cancelled closure plans.
It has cut jobs over the past few years, and the remaining 150 staff are
likely to be made redundant.
Dr <PERSON>Jo Gipps</PERSON>, zoo curator, estimated that it would take six months to find
alternative homes for the animals so that the breeding programme could
continue. He was confident none would have to be destroyed. Some larger
animals may be moved to the society's other site at Whipsnade Wild Animal
Park, <LOCATION>Bedfordshire</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>London Tourist Board</ORGANIZATION> said the closure would not have a significant impact on
tourism as few people went to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> just to visit the zoo. In <DATE>1991</DATE> the zoo
was the ninth most popular attraction in and around <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, with 1.1m
visitors.

   EC TOSSES BARBS AT U.S. STATES

<TEXT>
   In its annual report on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade barriers, the <ORGANIZATION>European
Community Commission</ORGANIZATION> expressed alarm about what it called a
growing trend toward protectionist or biased legislation by
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> states. It also signaled <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> fears about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
congressional calls for limits on foreign investment and
criticized laws that cover activities outside the country.
   While <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> protectionism hasn't increased in the past
year, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials said many points in the report stemmed
from the failure to conclude the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of talks
within the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ORGANIZATION>. The report
doesn't specify any threat of action, but if the current
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> trade negotiations collapse, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> could file
complaints under <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> about specific trade practices.
   Among the barriers cited are measures encouraging or
requiring state agencies to "buy American." For example,
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> forbids imported goods and several states ban
foreign steel in new highways. More than half the states
restrict foreigners' land ownership, and some curb foreign
banking and insurance firms.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Association of State Development Agencies</ORGANIZATION>
said the states like job-creating foreign trade and
investment, and at least 35 place a "high priority" on
attracting such investments and brokering U.S.-foreign
ventures.
                                                                                                       

   NEW CHERNOBYL DATA RELEASED
                                                                                                       

   Five years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has identified 500,000 people contaminated by
radiation and is giving medical care to 300,000 a year.
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> left unchanged at 31 or 32 the deaths resulting
directly from the Ukrainian power plant explosion on <DATE>April
26, 1986</DATE>. Many Soviet and Western researchers dispute the
official death toll, which has stood for three years, and
assert that at least 500 and as many as 10,000 people have
died of cancer and other illnesses caused by the accident.
                                                                                                       

   NORWAY CANCELS WHALING SEASON
                                                                                                       

   For the first time since the <DATE>16th century</DATE>, <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION> called off
its whale hunt this year. The <ORGANIZATION>International Whaling
Commission</ORGANIZATION> for five years has banned <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and other nations
from commercial whale hunting, but allowed them to kill a few
whales each year for scientific purposes, such as gathering
birth-rate and mortality data. <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> said research hunting
would resume next year. Environmentalists say the research
kills by <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are disguised commercial
hunts, as much of the meat is sold.
                                                                                                       

   GIRAFFE BARBECUE PLAN PROTESTED
                                                                                                       

   A South African social group's plan for what could be the
world's first giraffe barbecue has drawn flak. Die <PERSON>Afrikaner
Klub</PERSON> has already sold 300 tickets at <MONEY>$40</MONEY> each for the <DATE>May 4</DATE>
roast of a 2,800-pound giraffe. Barbecues, or braais, are a
popular entertainment in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. Animal advocates
denounced killing a wild animal as "a gimmick." The barbecue
isn't illegal, as giraffes aren't endangered.
                                                                                                       

   GLOBAL EFFORTS ARE REWARDED
                                                                                                       

   German Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hans-Dietrich Genscher</PERSON> received

   <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s tough anti-inflation program is threatened by a
rash of court cases that seek restitution of funds the
government froze in attacking runaway prices.
   The stampede of cases -- an estimated 6,000 in two days
this week -- was triggered by a <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> court ruling that
<LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION>'s temporary seizure of financial assets last year
was unconstitutional. The ruling poses a fresh challenge to
the government's economic policy just as inflation for <DATE>March</DATE>
came in at the first one-digit monthly rate since <DATE>June</DATE>.
   About two-thirds of the money circulating in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s
economy was frozen. Some companies and individuals have used
legal loopholes to free some of the cash, but about 6.7
trillion cruzados novos (<MONEY>$26.39 billion</MONEY>) remain frozen. The
government had pledged to return the money, with interest, in
12 monthly installments starting in <DATE>September</DATE>.

lifting a price freeze that disrupted production and

ATLANTA ZOO, ONCE AN ANIMAL CONCENTRATION CAMP, GAINS SOME RESPECT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE DIRECTOR IS CREDITED FOR A TURNAROUND DURING HIS SIX-YEAR 
TENURE. THE PARK IS HALFWAY THROUGH A $50-MILLION RENOVATION.

<P>
There was a time when the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> zoo was regarded as a kind of animal 
concentration camp. One keeper ate rabbits from the petting zoo, and other 
animals lived and died there in unnatural ways. 
</P>
<P>
All that was before Director <PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON> came along with his imagination and 
enthusiasm and organizational skills. Six years later and halfway through a 
<MONEY>$50-million</MONEY> renovation, the zoo is respected in the zoological world, and <PERSON>Terry 
Maple</PERSON> is a very tired man. 
</P>
<P>
"This zoo has been enormously difficult to build. It has taxed me in every 
imaginable way. It has taken every ounce of energy I've had," <PERSON>Maple</PERSON>, 43, said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie B. probably does not appreciate the effort, though he has benefited from 
it. The popular lowland gorilla, named for former Mayor <PERSON>William B. Hartsfield</PERSON>, 
lived alone in a cage for 27 years. Now he lives in a lush, jungle-like 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
There are new displays of flamingos and rhinos; a <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara</ORGANIZATION> exhibit for 
giraffes, lions and elephants; a replica of the Indonesian rain forest for 
orangutans; a Sheba Sumatran tiger forest, where tigers will be bred under the 
auspices of the <ORGANIZATION>American Assn. of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened those exhibits fast and furious. We recovered faster than any zoo 
ever recovered. And the pace was painful," <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But the growth period was not as painful as the zoo's situation at the time 
<ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION> arrived. Parade magazine had rated the zoo one of the 10 worst in the 
nation. Just <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> was budgeted each year for zoo maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Twinkles, a 15-year-old elephant, died while on loan to a traveling circus in 
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. In addition to the rabbits that wound up on the keeper's dinner 
table, at least eight other zoo animals perished. The decapitated body of a 
baboon was found in a dump truck. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> and his staff envisioned more 
than that. They wanted to build a firm foundation of support. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in <LOCATION>Friends of Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION> has swelled from 5,000 to more than 
53,000, making it the fifth-largest nonprofit zoo support group in the country, 
said <PERSON>Cheryl Moody</PERSON>, director of membership. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance has risen and is expected to exceed 900,000 visitors this year, up 
from about 260,000 in <DATE>1984</DATE>. Adult ticket prices have climbed from <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> to 
<MONEY>$6.75</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's budget, less than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, is <MONEY>$7.7 million</MONEY> this year, and 
the staff has been expanded to 115 from 40. 
</P>
<P>
After ending <DATE>1989</DATE> with a <MONEY>$48,000</MONEY> deficit, the zoo is on the verge of operating 
in the black, said business manager <PERSON>Dennis Baker</PERSON>. This year's goal is amassing 
a <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> surplus to help the zoo weather the lean winter months. 
</P>
<P>
All this requires a kind of showmanship that has become a fact of life for 
modern zoos. Recent promotions for <ORGANIZATION>Zoo Atlanta</ORGANIZATION> included Father's Day at the 
Zoo, the chance to adopt a lovebird on <DATE>Valentine's Day</DATE>, and a "summer beach 
party" in <DATE>February</DATE>, billed as the <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta Beach Bash</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's progress has not gone unnoticed. It has regained its membership in 
the zoological parks association and has been widely praised by zoo 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON> is a natural leader, and he has an incredible commitment to 
wildlife and wild places," said <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON>, executive director of the 
association. "He has brought those things as well as his incredible enthusiasm 
to <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION>, and all have just fallen into place behind him." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Llewellyn Haden</PERSON>, chairman of the zoo's governing board, said, "He, in many 
ways, is the zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Maple, a psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> who had 
served as deputy director and curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Audubon Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, said 
his tenure is something of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
He had intended to stay three months, he said, but "I got sidetracked into 
building a local zoo." Now he is considering going back to academic life so he 
can have time for his family and to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not writing my resignation," he said. "I am totally committed to this 
place. The question is, 'Can the old zoo director squeak out a book somehow and 
still be zoo director?' There are not enough hours in the day." 
</P>
<P>
In the same breath, <ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION> also spoke of the challenges that lie ahead for the 
zoo. Besides financial challenges and promotional challenges, there are the 
bear exhibits -- an embarrassment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly an animal welfare issue," <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> said. "They're one of the last 
vestiges of the old zoo. It's hard to accept that they exist."

<LEADPARA>  SEVENTY-FIVE years ago, the San Diego Zoo collected animals the way the
Salvation Army collected junk.;    Sailors, passing through town, donated
bears after their cuddly mascots outgrew their ships. An alligator, which had
terrorized neighbors, was lassoed and dragged to the zoo. Rattlesnakes,
unearthed by construction workers, were regularly dropped off. Most of the
zoo's original residents had been abandoned after the city hosted the
1915-1916 Panama California International Exposition.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those modest early days are being remembered and celebrated at the zoo,
which is observing its 75th anniversary with special events and new exhibits
throughout the year.;    The first of these, <LOCATION>Gorilla Tropics</LOCATION>, opened this
<DATE>weekend</DATE>. It's a 2.5-acre African rain forest habitat for six gorillas and more
than 200 birds.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> is among the best known and most
respected in the world. Living amid its lush canyons, mesas and gardens are
more than 3,500 animals and 7,000 plant species.;    Birthday animals; The zoo
houses some of the rarest species on earth. Many animals living there are
found nowhere else in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It also boasts the largest collection
of Chinese animals outside <LOCATION>China.</LOCATION>;    The zoo is welcoming even more rare
animals throughout the year as birthday presents fly in from the international
zoo community. In <DATE>January</DATE>, the zoo, which has more koalas than any zoo outside
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, got four more from an Australian wildlife preserve. The zoo threw a
party for the huggable koalas, which are by far the zoo's favorite
attraction.;    "This is truly an exciting time for the zoo," said <PERSON>James
Dolan</PERSON>, the director of animal collections. "Some of the animals being sent to
us for our 75th birthday are so rare they are not exhibited in the <LOCATION>Western
Hemisphere</LOCATION>.";    Making their first North American appearance are Siberian
weasels from the <LOCATION>Leningrad Zoo</LOCATION>, Corsac foxes from the <LOCATION>Moscow Zoo</LOCATION>, and from
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> some shaggy-haired mountain dwellers called Mishmi takins. A takin
looks like a cross between a mountain goat and a moose.;    Not all the
animals on display will have a pulse.;    Memorial <DATE>Day weekend</DATE>, <DATE>May 25-27</DATE>, a
builder from <ORGANIZATION>LEGO Co.</ORGANIZATION> will use its famous building blocks to erect an
8-foot-tall gorilla. The ape will stick around for a month.;    Meanwhile,
animal-shaped plants have sprouted recently throughout the zoo's 100 acres.
Hoping to become one of the premier spots for topiaries, the zoo's
horticulturists have been sculpting leafy flamingos, gorillas, koalas,
giraffes and other creatures.;    During its anniversary, the zoo will
continue to look less and less like a zoo. Since the mid-1980s, the zoo has
undergone major renovations to make it look wild enough to please tigers,
bears, alligators and the rest of the menagerie. The master plan directs that
the zoo be divided into areas where birds, mammals, reptiles and plants from
the same climatic zones live together. The old notion of grouping only the
same species together is considered passe.;    Three such realistic exhibits
have been completed so far. The zoo has recreated two rain forests and an
African kopje (pronounced COPY), an outcropping of volcanic rock that juts up
from the plains. The creation of a tundra, a grasslands, a desert, a savanna
and other climatic zones are planned into the <DATE>21st century</DATE> as funds permit.;  
 Simulated rain forest; Visitors will be able to see the <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Gorilla
Tropics</ORGANIZATION> exhibit from a suspension that spans a waterfall. The apes will roam
past pools and waterfalls through a forest of fig and sausage trees,
wildflowers and African grasses. There will be outcroppings and fallen trees
for gorillas to climb on.;    Many of the birds that will fly through gorilla
country are rarely seen in zoos. The flock includes snowy-headed robinchats,
African pygmy geese, blue-naped mousebirds and emerald starlings.;    In case
the gorillas or their visitors aren't convinced they're in a jungle, the
sounds of an African rain forest will play through hidden speakers.;    Zoo
officials hope the gorillas behave better than the sun bears did <DATE>two years ago</DATE>
when they were moved into their multimillion-dollar rain forest. The bears,
which formed bear pyramids to scale the walls and escape, quickly trashed the
place. They destroyed the sod, stripped the trees of their bark and even
ripped apart an artificial tree that contained a honey feeder in it.;    For
visitors who want to get close enough to pet the animals, there is always the
Children's Zoo. In the kiddie corral, goats, sheep and two homely pot-bellied
pig brothers named <PERSON>Huey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duey</PERSON> tolerate rambunctious toddlers.;    Why are
the animals so mellow?;    "It's their job," said one zoo keeper watching her
flock. "They really have a pretty easy life. Not much is expected of them.";  
 Zoo officials hope that <DATE>1991</DATE> -- with all the extra festivities -- will be one
of their biggest years ever for attendance. They aren't sure, however, if the
turmoil in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, which has been discouraging people from traveling
long distances, will result in bigger or smaller crowds.;    "It could go
either way," said <PERSON>Georgeanne Irvine</PERSON>, a zoo spokeswoman. "I personally think
people will need a little relief and will come to the zoo to escape.";     IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED; The zoo's actual birthday is <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>. Throughout <DATE>October</DATE>,
children under 15 years will be admitted free. And on <DATE>Oct. 7</DATE>, no one will be
charged.;    Regular admission is <MONEY>$10.75</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for children 3 to 15
and free for those 2 and under. The zoo, in the city's famous <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, is
open daily from <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>  </TEXT>

"I'd love to go, I really would," said my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"But?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know. Bugs. Snakes. Stuff that eats you: lions and leopards and 
tigers." 
</P>
<P>
"No tigers in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, but no toilet paper either. No hot water. And food: I like mine completely 
dead. Look, I'd love to see the elephants before they're gone. I'd love to see 
a giraffe at dawn, eating off the top of a thorn tree. I'd love to see one of 
those sweet little deer-y animals with the long necks. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Gerenuks." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever. I'm sure I'd love it all, but I am not sleeping on the ground over a 
mamba hole with tsetse flies up my nose." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what you're missing," I told her, "but I tell you what. It 
being our anniversary and all, suppose I take you to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> -- lions, giraffes, 
rhinos, the whole nine yards. And promise you soft beds under netting, good 
food, maybe even a little dance music. And Kleenex." 
</P>
<P>
"Kleenex?" 
</P>
<P>
"Kleenex." 
</P>
<P>
"You're on." 
</P>
<P>
I take mild issue with <PERSON>Thomas Romeo</PERSON>'s accompanying contention that "Camping is 
the only way to see <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>." Agreed, camping is truly a blast. But there are 
many ways to experience this disappearing <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION>, ranging from the suicidal to 
the sybaritic. I have been lucky enough to sample most of them, usually as the 
<PERSON>Blanche Dubois</PERSON> of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, relying on the kindness of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
In a gentler time, I had walked through the sleepy villages of <LOCATION>Gambia</LOCATION> and slept 
on a chief's hammock. 
</P>
<P>
I had driven cross-country through the Tanzanian night in a Land Rover piloted 
by a madman intent on bagging a dik-dik for his brother in <LOCATION>Ujiji</LOCATION>, and ridden a 
gravid "mammy Wagon" 100 miles with an infatuated pig on my lap. I had been in 
a forest fire in the <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION> (OK, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>), a riot in <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION>. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Never, never had I done time in what my wife calls "a proper bed." It was a 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
For the <LOCATION>Kleenex</LOCATION> crowd -- which is most of us -- <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> probably is the best bet, 
for several reasons. First, it's better organized for the tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Second, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s terrain (and consequently its fauna and flora) is wildly 
varied, from desert to jungle to bush to forest to a snow-capped mountain right 
on top of the <LOCATION>Equator</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to get out of the capital of <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> as quickly as possible. It is 
a scruffy, dysfunctional city with all the charm of Depression-era 
<LOCATION>Poughkeepsie</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Tack a note for friends on the trunk of the thorn tree at the <ORGANIZATION>New Stanley 
Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. (If you have no friends, fake it; it's one of the things you do in 
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>.) 
</P>
<P>
Then scoot. 
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes away by twin-engined bush plane is the <PERSON>Masai Mara</PERSON>, a vast, 
numinous game reserve just over the border from <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>'s fabled <LOCATION>Serengeti</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Our gutty little aircraft plunged from the high plains into the savannah, and 
we were met at the gravel strip by one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s ubiquitous "Combis": 
four-wheel-drive mini-vans, topless, perfectly designed for illegally standing 
on the seat, head and torso untrammeled, the better to play <ORGANIZATION>Lord of Creation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A meddle of monkeys, four wart hogs and a lone, stately eland later, we drove 
through the gate of the <ORGANIZATION>Mara Safari Club</ORGANIZATION>, in time for passion fruit cocktails 
all around. 
</P>
<P>
Passing through a grand spotless lodge of polished hardwood (the club opened 
only last <DATE>December</DATE>), we were escorted to our "tent." Tent? Our quarters were to 
the traditional conception of a tent as the <ORGANIZATION>Trump Tower</ORGANIZATION> is to a tepee. 
</P>
<P>
Shaped like a Quonset hut in canvas, the tent was easily 30 feet long, not 
counting 10 more feet of front "patio" furnished with leather camp chairs. 
Inside were carpets over a stone floor; two large, comfortable beds with 
netting and electric lanterns for reading; a shower, a toilet, a dressing table 
with padded seat, mirror, fluorescent light, and 24-hour hot water from an 
individual outdoor heater fueled by a wood fire. And Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
Africa can overwhelm even the most fearless, but there are few introductions 
more felicitous than sitting on one's own patio, feet up, <ORGANIZATION>Tusker</ORGANIZATION> beer in hand, 
overlooking a sharp bend in the <LOCATION>Mara River</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In the mud below, an amorphous bulge of hippos lazily jostling for position. 
Right across the little river, in the high grass, a kaffeeklatsch of baboons, 
toting their baboonlets papoose-style. Downriver, a monstrous crocodile 
snorkeling up on a bobbing pair of Egyptian geese, just for practice. 
</P>
<P>
The real adventure was to begin after a dip in the club pool and a buffet lunch 
in the lodge with more dishes than a <ORGANIZATION>Tupperware</ORGANIZATION> party. 
</P>
<P>
The real adventure began, of course, on the first Combi run through the vast 
<ORGANIZATION>Mara</ORGANIZATION>, teeming with game; and the morning run, and the next evening run and the 
next morning run -- each adding a hundred individual grace notes to future 
memories of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the intention here to babble about animals; the section isn't large 
enough. Each sally outside one's cosseting quarters, however, holds its own 
transcendent moment, as well as its own frisson. 
</P>
<P>
Mara moment: An acacia tree, sequined with vultures, shading a family of sleek 
and pot-bellied cheetahs after their breakfast run at an unlucky herd of 
impalas. (The family that preys together stays together.) 
</P>
<P>
Mara frisson: A low-throated midnight scream from an adjoining tent -- 
blessedly followed by a relieved giggle. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian named <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, sliding into bed, had toed something warm and 
wiggling and shot from his sack like a man possessed. It turned out to be an 
unexpected hot-water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, after a five-course dinner, coffee and cognac, a dance by the 
local <PERSON>Masai</PERSON> and an evening of deliciously gory stories by <PERSON>Mike Clifton</PERSON>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Mara Club</ORGANIZATION>'s "resident naturalist." 
</P>
<P>
Back into <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> and back out again, this time on a Combi ride north to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Samburu Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, past fields and farms and roadside stores. Samburu is on 
the edge of the encroaching desert, just this side of bandit country, in 
terrain as different from the <LOCATION>Mara</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> is from <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Sharova Shaba</ORGANIZATION> perches picturesquely on the banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro River. 
Its 80 rooms -- two tiers of indigenous wood and stone blending so well with 
the landscape that you can't see the compound until you're upon it -- are the 
epitome of luxury in the wilderness: 
</P>
<P>
Over the beds, but still inside the obligatory netting, are adjustable ceiling 
fans, for cold or hot. 
</P>
<P>
There are cushioned wicker chairs, a modern bathroom, tiled floors, 
flashlights, bug bombs (which we never used), Kleenex (!) and picture windows 
front and back, one overlooking river and bush, the opposite one improbably 
framing a tangle of trees, ferns and a small zoo's worth of peculiar jumping 
and burrowing things. 
</P>
<P>
The grounds are imaginatively and impeccably landscaped with natural streams, 
bridges, magnificent old baobab trees and flowers a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> florist would 
kill for. 
</P>
<P>
The dining lodge is open-air, up on stilts, with a 360-degree view that 
includes a huge, meandering swimming pool below. 
</P>
<P>
And food to match: Just for openers, breakfast comes equipped with eight 
different juices; scones and rolls and toast and pastries; the standard eggs 
and cereals, and an open-end choice of bacon, ham, sausages and some tasty if 
unidentified meatstuffs that it's probably best not to question. 
</P>
<P>
Routine is the same as in the Mara -- if a game run can ever be considered 
"routine" -- with nighttime dance shows by native Samburu and Somali tribes who 
do things with head and body that <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> only dreams of. 
</P>
<P>
This is gerenuk country, and reticulated giraffe and oryx and <PERSON>Grevey</PERSON>'s zebra 
and a whole platoon of critters found nowhere else on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu moment: A water buck, head and horns as still as a trophy, standing in 
the grass, only its nostrils moving, telling him a tale of life or death. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu frisson: Coming over a rise and finding our Combi grill to tusk with a 
pair of extremely large elephants in flagrante delicto. Male elephant charges 
Combi. Combi is faster. Driver: "Well, I suppose I'd be mad too." 
</P>
<P>
Like tacking a note to the thorn tree, one must spend a night at <ORGANIZATION>Treetops</ORGANIZATION>. 
Obligatory. This is the three-story wooden barracks on the edge of a water hole 
-- a pond, really -- just inside the central <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s Aberdare reserve. The 
place <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth of Britain</ORGANIZATION> climbed up as a princess and climbed down a queen. 
<PERSON>J.S. Prickett</PERSON>, resident griot, remembers. 
</P>
<P>
He was there. Prickett still tells the old tales -- the good old tales -- and 
he still feigns annoyance when his nightly talk is interrupted by arrival of 
the first herd of elephants and the bar/lounge empties in a cacophonous dash 
for rooftop or camera pit. 
</P>
<P>
Treetop rooms are clean, comfortable but small -- just big enough for 
double-deck beds, but it doesn't matter. Nobody sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
The pond and banks below are spotlighted, the animals have long since 
accustomed to the glow, and nocturnal beasties roam the area all night long. 
There is a late-evening feast at the long communal table, and mostly there is 
the thrill of just being within touching distance of the mysteries of an 
African night. 
</P>
<P>
Treetops moment: On the fringe of a circle of elephants trunking for salt is a 
hard-muscled Cape buffalo, preening and pawing and looking for all the world 
like what he is -- the most feared and dangerous beast in all of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the night charges another buff, straight through the startled ring of 
elephants, straight into the braced horns of buff No. 1. No. 1 is knocked 
halfway across the pond. No. 2 snorts, does a little soft-shoe, and trots back 
into the forest. We'll never know. 
</P>
<P>
Treetops frisson: Have you ever had a bush baby up your pant leg? 
</P>
<P>
Sometime or other you've got to wind down from all that Combi riding to begin 
to make the transition back to what is laughingly known as "the real world." 
There is no better place in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> than the Old World pomp of the <ORGANIZATION>Mount Kenya 
Safari Club</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of what the Kenyans call "The Mountain of the Gods," the club's 
manicured grounds roll out, golf-course green, into an infinity of lakes, 
groves, gardens and forest. 
</P>
<P>
One may have a massage or a swim or a Combi ride or a shopping spree, or one 
may sit on one of the terraces and lose oneself in the graceful gyrations of 
the resident flamingos and egrets and storks and herons and ibises, and plot 
ways to stay another day. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a coat-and-tie banquet, and a very sophisticated little combo 
winding up its international-song gig with a rousing chorus of "Jambo, Bwana." 
</P>
<P>
It's beyond corny, beyond touristy, and everyone joins in and then toddles off 
to bed, exquisitely pampered and pooped. 
</P>
<P>
It's all a far cry from camping out -- the antithesis of camping out. In lieu 
of a campfire there was a pleasant, gregarious man, assigned just to us, who 
came in to stoke our personal little bedroom blaze as a chill night straddled 
the <LOCATION>Equator</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere down below, a Kikuyu group was entertaining the late-nighters, doing 
a series of drum riffs in undulating, intricate rhythms that somehow 
recapitulated a glorious fortnight in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On my wife's night stand was a fresh box of Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
Camping, shmamping. It doesn't get any better than this.

<HEAD>Zoo Poised To Become Leader in Next Century, Director Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was a time when the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> zoo was
regarded as a kind of animal concentration camp, a place where one
keeper ate rabbits from the petting zoo and where other beasts
lived and died unnaturally.
   But that was before zoo director <PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON> came along with his
imagination and enthusiasm and organizational skills. Six years
later and halfway through a <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> renovation, the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> zoo
is a respected model in the zoological world, and <PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON> is a
very tired man.
   ``This zoo has been enormously difficult to build. It has taxed
me in every imaginable way. It has taken every ounce of energy I've
had,'' says <PERSON>Maple</PERSON>, 43.
   Willie B. probably does not appreciate the effort, though he has
benefited. The popular lowland gorilla, named after former <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
Mayor <PERSON>William B. Hartsfield</PERSON>, lived alone in a cage for 27 years;
now he lives outside, in a lush, jungle-like habitat.
   There are new displays of flamingos and rhinos; a <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara</ORGANIZATION>
exhibit for giraffes, lions and elephants; a replica of the
Indonesian rain forest for orangutans; a Sheba Sumatran tiger
forest, where tigers will be bred under the auspices of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Association of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums.
   ``We opened those exhibits fast and furious. We recovered faster
than any zoo ever recovered. And the pace was painful,'' <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> said.
   But the growth spurt was not as painful as the zoo's situation
when <ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION> came aboard. Parade magazine had rated the zoo as among
the nation's 10 worst; only <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> was budgeted each year for zoo
maintenance.
   A 15-year-old zoo elephant named Twinkles died while on loan to
a traveling circus in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>. In addition to the rabbits
that fell victim to the keeper's appetite, at least eight other zoo
animals perished, including a baboon whose decapitated body was
found in a dump truck.
   The name was changed to <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> and his staff
envisioned more than semantic changes _ they wanted to build a firm
foundation of support.
   Membership in <LOCATION>Friends of Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION> has swelled from 5,000 to
just over 53,000, making it fifth largest among non-profit zoo
support groups in the country, said <PERSON>Cheryl Moody</PERSON>, director of
membership.
   Attendance has increased from about 260,000 in <DATE>1984</DATE> to a
projected 983,870 this year, though adult ticket prices have
climbed from <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$6.75</MONEY>.
   The annual budget, less than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, is <MONEY>$7.7 million</MONEY>
this year; the staff has nearly tripled, from 40 to 115.
   The zoo, which ended <DATE>1989</DATE> with a <MONEY>$48,000</MONEY> deficit, is on the
verge of operating in the black, said business manager <PERSON>Dennis
Baker</PERSON>. This year's goal is to create a <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> surplus to help the
zoo through the lean winter months.
   All this requires the kind of showmanship that has become a fact
of life for modern zoos. Recent promotions for <ORGANIZATION>Zoo Atlanta</ORGANIZATION> included
Father's Day at the Zoo, the chance to adopt a lovebird on
<DATE>Valentine's Day</DATE>, and a ``summer beach party'' in <DATE>February</DATE> billed as
the <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta Beach Bash</LOCATION>.
   The zoo's progress has not gone unnoticed. It has regained its
membership in the AAZPA, and has been widely applauded by zoo
professionals.
   ``<PERSON>Terry Maple</PERSON> is a natural leader, and he has an incredible
commitment to wildlife and wild places,'' said <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON>,
executive director of the AAZPA. ``He has brought those things as
well as his incredible enthusiasm to <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION>, and all have just
fallen into place behind him.''
   <PERSON>Llewellyn Haden</PERSON>, chairman of the zoo's governing board, said,
``He in many ways is the zoo.''
   But <PERSON>Maple</PERSON>, a psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Institute of
Technology</ORGANIZATION> who had served as deputy director and curator of the
<ORGANIZATION>Audubon Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, says his tenure is something of an
accident.
   He had intended to stay three months, he said, but ``I got
sidetracked into building a local zoo.'' Now he is considering a
return to academic life, where he would have time for his family
and time to write a book on his experiences.
   ``I am not writing my resignation,'' he said. ``I am totally
committed to this place. The question is can the old zoo director
squeak out a book somehow and still be zoo director? There are not
enough hours in the day.''
   But in the same breath, <ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION> also talks of the challenges that
lie ahead for the zoo. There are financial challenges and
promotional challenges. And then there are the bear exhibits _ an
embarrassment, he said.
   ``It's strictly an animal welfare issue,'' <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> said. ``They're
one of the last vestiges of the old zoo. It's hard to accept that
they exist.''

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Mobile Guide:
   London Zoo Is Closing Down?
   ----
   By Paul Levy

   London -- When the British find that they have no further
use for one of their institutions, their first thought is
often to send it to America, as they did with the Queen Mary.
In the case of London Zoo, however, this solution does not
appear to be available. The Central Park Zoo, for example,
has problems of its own, as do many zoos that are dependent
on municipal funding.
   Still, London Zoo is special. In the first place, there is
its literary celebrity, as in Hilaire Belloc's "Jim, Who Ran
Away From His Nurse, &amp; Was Eaten by a Lion" (moral: "always
keep a-hold of Nurse/For fear of finding something worse"),
which is set at London Zoo, as is the late Sir Angus Wilson's
"The Old Men at the Zoo," in which the animals in Regent's
Park even survive a nuclear war. And there is "A Man in the
Zoo" by Bloomsbury Group member David ("Bunny") Garnett, in
which a spurned lover offers himself to the zoo, and is
accepted, for exhibition as a specimen of Homo sapiens.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the second place, <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION> is architecturally
significant. It is chock full of protected, "listed"
buildings. When I visited the zoo recently, the koala bears
who now inhabit <ORGANIZATION>Bertold Lubertkin</ORGANIZATION>'s listed <ORGANIZATION>Gorilla House</ORGANIZATION>
(<DATE>1933</DATE>) were as somnolent as ever, and the penguins in the
same architect's listed abstract sculptural Penguin Pool
(<DATE>1934</DATE>) seemed to be suffering as much as the visitors from
the unseasonable <DATE>June</DATE> chill. The birds in <PERSON>Lord Snowdon</PERSON>'s
as-yet-unlisted aviary were almost grounded by the cold, and
the elephants were huddled for warmth in Sir <PERSON>Hugh Casson</PERSON>'s
modern and still-unlisted <ORGANIZATION>Elephant House</ORGANIZATION>. I couldn't see what
was going on in <PERSON>Decimus Burton</PERSON>'s listed Giraffe and <ORGANIZATION>Hippo
House</ORGANIZATION> (1836), and the monkeys and apes were sheltering from
the weather in their houses opposite his listed II Clock
Tower (1830).
   Finally, some of the animals in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo are unusual.
When I visited, <LOCATION>Chia Chia</LOCATION> the giant panda was in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>,
where it was hoped he could be persuaded to father a new
entry in the international giant panda stud book, which is
overseen by <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo's <PERSON>Jo Gipps</PERSON>. He also looks after the
breeding records of the golden lion tamarin (a small South
American squirrel monkey) and those of Sumatran tigers. His
two pairs of young Asian lions are particularly important, in
view of the recent discovery that the captive population of
Asian lions in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is made up not of purebreds, but of
animals that have at some point acquired an admixture of
African-lion bloodlines.
   Not counting insects, there are 8,000 animals at the
"mother of zoos" (it opened in <DATE>1826</DATE>) that will have to be
rehoused or disposed of if it closes, as is now threatened,
in <DATE>September 1992</DATE>. There is obviously an element of
brinkmanship in the posture of the new director general,
<PERSON>David Jones</PERSON>, and the zoo's treasurer, <LOCATION>Lord Peyton</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Yeovil</LOCATION>.
The zoo is losing approximately <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> a year, has cash
reserves of only <MONEY>$8.25 million</MONEY>, and doesn't seem able to
attract the 1.4 million visitors it needs every year to stay
in the black. In <DATE>1988</DATE> the government gave it a
once-and-for-all grant of <MONEY>$16.5 million</MONEY>, and <PERSON>Michael
Heseltine</PERSON>, the minister for the environment, and his junior
minister, <PERSON>David Trippier</PERSON>, are standing pat.
   In this zoo poker game <PERSON>Mr. Trippier</PERSON> is now claiming that
his ministry is reflecting the most up-to-date thinking about
zoos -- that such urban institutions are unsuitable, even
immoral, from a conservation point of view. His critics say
it is hypocritical of the government to latch onto the
prejudices of animal-rights activists. Lord <PERSON>Peyton</PERSON>,
meanwhile, has called the ministry's bluff by hinting that it
will be the Department of the Environment's fault if the
animals have to be put down.
   The British, as is well-known, are wacko about animals.
Old ladies really do leave their fortunes to cat and dog
homes. The government has to call a general election within
the next year, and as the Tory newspaper the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>
said in a recent editorial, "The zoo's directors know that no
government facing an election in the next few months could
face doing so against a background of mass executions of
animals taking place a few miles north of Westminster."
Perhaps it is malicious to suggest that this was the reason
that the deadline for closing the zoo was just moved ahead to
<DATE>1992</DATE>.
   Of course, the zoo may not close at all, if sufficient
funds can be raised. But it is perhaps not too early to think
about what the worst case would entail. <PERSON>Auberon Waugh</PERSON>, in his
column in the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> (the Conservatives are much
more exercised about the issue than is the <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>), has
made two modest proposals. As nobody would actually want to
buy a bunch of gorillas, kangaroos and alligators, why not
make the zoo into a temporary game park? Encourage Japanese
and American businessmen to stalk and shoot whatever animals
they choose, photograph them with their trophies, then take
the game away and "give it to the poor to eat." The rarest
species, "strange birds, as well as flying foxes, koalas and
centipedes," should be kept for a great <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> gastronomic
festival, "where Britons can taste delicacies from all over
the world, which they might otherwise miss from their life's
experience."

STOWERS STUDENTS ON SAFARI, READING WITH THE ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the outside, <ORGANIZATION>Stowers Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cerritos</LOCATION> looks no different than 
the other elementary schools in the <ORGANIZATION>ABC Unified School District</ORGANIZATION>. But inside, 
the school has been turned into a jungle. Cheetahs, zebras, gorillas, tigers 
and other wild animals and exotic vegetation created in crepe paper leap from 
the walls of classrooms, the library and administration buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 600 students at the school are on an African reading safari, aimed 
at stimulating them to read. It started <DATE>March 2</DATE> with a visit to the campus by 
an ocelot, and will end <DATE>May 26</DATE> with a "read-in" in a tent, a barbecue and rides 
on an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The student body has been challenged to read a total of 1 million extra minutes 
by the end of the expedition. Homework assignments do not count. Parents keep 
track of outside reading and report the results to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students earn "reading tracks" or paw prints. Kindergarten through third-grade 
pupils earn one paw print for 90 minutes of reading and fourth- through 
sixth-grade students earn one for 180 minutes. Paw prints cover the walls and 
ceilings of the school. Students who have earned 25 tracks get their pictures 
posted in the principal's office. Students receive prizes that include pizzas 
and trips to <PERSON>Knott</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Berry Farm</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone participates -- students, teachers, librarians and administrators. 
Whenever jungle music is heard over the intercom system, everyone drops 
whatever they are doing to read something other than assignments. On <DATE>Fridays</DATE>, 
students and teachers wear jungle attire to get in the reading mood. 
</P>
<P>
The school scores above district and state averages on the state reading tests, 
and Principal <PERSON>Decla Johnson</PERSON> says she wants the students to do even better. 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said she hopes the students will develop a lifelong love for reading.

<P>
Dr. <PERSON>Dolittle</PERSON> would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
"Deck the hall with boughs of holly," sang 9-year-old <PERSON>Christopher Jett</PERSON>, huddled 
around the sea lion pool at the Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. "Fa la la la 
la, la la la la." 
</P>
<P>
It's a precious Christmas image: Cherub-faced youngsters strolling down 
snow-covered streets, serenading families that flock to their doorsteps bearing 
warm cider and cookies. Try that in most big cities today and you're liable to 
get mugged or chased down the block by the neighborhood watch. 
</P>
<P>
Here in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, however, the great yuletide custom lives on, albeit with a 
twist. Carolers don't sing to people anymore. They sing to animals. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, a few Sundays before <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, throngs of Chicagoans gather to 
warble a message of Peace on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Good Will Toward Mammals</ORGANIZATION> to the lions, 
gazelles, elephants, giraffes, hedgehogs, armadillos, iguanas, turtles, 
turtledoves, partridges and all the other species on display at the 35-acre 
urban animal park just north of <LOCATION>The Loop</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not supposed to anthropomorphize, but I think they love it," insisted 
<PERSON>Carol Leifer</PERSON>, a zoo spokesperson. " . . . I have seen spectacled bears swaying 
to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Little <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> had no idea that "anthropomorphize" meant to attribute human 
characteristics to animals. He just knew that singing to animals in a cage was 
a lot more fun than doing it at home. "I tried singing to my cat but he 
scratched me," <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
Caroling to the animals began here 14 years ago when a handful of volunteer zoo 
workers did it on a lark. Over the years, the popularity has mushroomed to the 
point where it has probably become the city's most widely attended Christmas 
event. More than 7,000 people took part this year. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, everyone assembled first around the outdoor sea lion 
pool where <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>, sometimes known as <PERSON>Ron Solomon</PERSON> (remember, it's a tradition 
with a twist), arrived toting his satchel full of mackerel and herring. He 
tossed the fish into the pool, where Junior, the 800-pound major-domo of the 
water, and the rest of his pals merrily munched away to the strains of "O Come 
All Ye Faithful." 
</P>
<P>
From there, the choristers broke up according to animal preference. Some headed 
over to the lion house, some to the children's zoo, some to the large mammal 
area, and, yes, some to the reptile exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand snakes," admitted <PERSON>Eryl Morgan</PERSON>, nervously turning her back to a 
reticulated python as she belted out a verse of "Jolly Old St. Nicholas." "But 
I can't see any of them with all these people in here. Besides, I'm not really 
singing to them. I'm singing to a plate of glass." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan might not have been crooning to the snakes, but the snakes might have 
been thinking otherwise. <PERSON>Clarence Wright</PERSON>, the curator of the reptile house, 
said snakes have ultra sensitive lower jaws and scales and probably pick up 
vibrations from the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't bother them, but they're just aware of it more (than normal 
crowd noise)," he explained. "They're probably moving around a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Experts are unsure how much other animals appreciate the musical interlude. "It 
certainly doesn't distress them," said <PERSON>Steve Thompson</PERSON>, the zoo's director of 
conservation of science. "Either they see it as 'just those silly humans again' 
or they may actually enjoy it. It's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Some carolers swear that when they start singing en masse, lions roar back, sea 
lions bark and even snakes flick their tongues in time to the music. 
</P>
<P>
While the motivation behind such actions is open to debate, senior lion keeper 
Art <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said he has noticed that big cats seem to enjoy classical music and 
jazz. Once, he said, the lions started "roaring like crazy" when a brass 
ensemble played outside their cages. 
</P>
<P>
As for Christmas carols, <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said the cats could probably take them or 
leave them. When the singing began, leopards, jaguars and other cats did begin 
pacing back and forth anxiously. But <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said such nervous behavior 
probably had less to do with the sound than the sight of hundreds of sumptuous 
looking youngsters massed tantalizingly just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"They react to the little size of the children," he explained. "The children 
are just the right size to eat."

COLLECTORS BRING CAROUSEL ANIMALS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lion, a tiger, a bear -- and jeweled horses -- have found a haven in the 
Rolling Hills home of Jo and Rol Summit. 
</P>
<P>
The animals are carousel figures the Summits have collected and carefully 
restored since he first bought her a small carousel horse as a gift for their 
second wedding anniversary in <DATE>1959</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in medical school," Jo Summit recalled. "I was teaching. . . . We 
didn't have any money, but he knew I had always wanted one. He scraped enough 
money together, saved it in bits and pieces to buy it. It has always been this 
very personal and loving thing." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Summits' animals are quartered in their living room, bedrooms, den 
and in a basement gallery. The collection includes about 50 figures, all carved 
between the <DATE>1880s</DATE> and the <DATE>1920s</DATE>, the heyday of the American carousel business. 
</P>
<P>
When the Summits got their first horse, they didn't intend to start a 
collection, <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said. But about <DATE>four years later</DATE>, they saw a picture of a 
giraffe in a magazine layout. They searched out the owner and bought it. The 
giraffe "looked at us with those big soft eyes," she said, and the Summits were 
hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse was special. . . . But we knew if we broke that limit -- if we got 
the giraffe -- it wouldn't be enough. It was going to start us collecting." 
</P>
<P>
By the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> they had a rabbit, another horse, a dragon and a sea 
monster. Over the years, they have restored about 275 animals, many of which 
they later traded or sold. 
</P>
<P>
Rol Summit, a psychiatrist at County-Harbor <ORGANIZATION>UCLA Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, has carved 
legs, ears, teeth and saddles. He has set glass jewels and has gold-leafed 
horses' manes. Jo Summit has removed old paint, sanded and repainted her 
animals and attached tails made of real horse hair. The couple also runs a 
small business, called Flying Horses, that supplies restoration parts to 
carousel operators and private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Summits have animals from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. But most of 
the animals were carved by the major carvers in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Summit has two favorite carvers: <PERSON>Daniel C. Muller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marcus C. Illions</PERSON>. She 
values <PERSON>Muller</PERSON> for his realism. "He carved wonderful crenulated ribbons, rivets 
and stitching. His saddles were carved to look like tooled leather," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And she appreciates <PERSON>Illions</PERSON> for the exuberance of his horses. "Illions made 
elaborate tossed manes. Then he added gold leaf to the manes, and gold and 
silver leaf to the trappings to show them off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There once were about 2,000 carousels across the country, but the Depression 
put most of the manufacturers out of business, according to <PERSON>Brian Morgan</PERSON>, 
chairman of Friends of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Monica Carousel</ORGANIZATION>. The growth of more thrilling 
rides after World War II forced many operators to close their machines. 
</P>
<P>
About 170 operating merry-go-rounds exist today, said <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON>, who also is 
treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION>National Carousel Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, an organization formed in <DATE>1973</DATE> to 
promote carousel preservation. Local riders can take a spin on wooden carousels 
on the <LOCATION>Santa Monica Pier</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Griffith Park</LOCATION>, at <LOCATION>Shoreline Village</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Magic Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Knotts Berry</PERSON> Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from broken-up machines are often bought by collectors. Many choose 
their animals for pragmatic reasons, <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said, but she based her 
selections on sentiment. "I picked the ones that I loved." 
</P>
<P>
An antique dealer once offered to trade some of the Summits' horses for one of 
three big cats he was having trouble selling. 
</P>
<P>
"He had two lions and a tiger and a whole bunch of horses," <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said. "He 
was selling the horses like crazy, but he couldn't move the lions or the tiger 
because they were bigger and cost more." 
</P>
<P>
When they agreed to the trade, she chose between the lions. 
</P>
<P>
"The other lion had lovely carvings," she said. "It had boars' heads behind the 
saddle. My lion didn't even have a saddle." 
</P>
<P>
The lion's former owner -- a lion tamer -- had all the trappings removed so it 
looked more realistic and placed the lion outside his arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The lion had this huge, dramatic mane," <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said. "All of that just made 
it special to me." 
</P>
<P>
When the couple began collecting, very little information about carousels was 
available, she said. They found one book, and they spoke to carousel operators 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Monica Pier</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Knotts Berry</PERSON> Farm, <LOCATION>Griffith Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean Park</LOCATION> 
in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beverly Park</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Beverly</LOCATION> and La Cienega boulevards. (The latter 
two parks no longer exist.) 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know why we were interested. At first they thought we were crazy," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But their curiosity paid off when they met Illions' sons, <PERSON>Rudy</PERSON> and Barney 
Illions. <PERSON>Rudy Illions</PERSON> was then in his late 60s and working as a machinist for 
the rides at <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rudy Illions</PERSON> revealed that his father was ambidextrous. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us he was very fast," she said. "He would go along from left to right, 
all the way to the front of the horse. Then he would switch the mallet and 
chisel and keep going." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's collection, which includes a number of Illions' figures, is 
arranged to illustrate different stages of restoration, an informative point 
for the many groups -- ranging from schoolchildren to senior citizens and 
antique collectors -- that visit the Summits' home. Two of Illions' horses are 
in a white primer coat and other figures have been left in factory paint. 
</P>
<P>
"Some we do in mint condition to show people what they were like -- all sparkle 
and perfect and smooth and zowie," <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some we restore partially, leaving all the cracks and dings . . . we think 
they show their age and the love of thousands and thousands of riders if you 
leave on some of that patina of the years." 
</P>
<P>
In the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>, <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said, the couple stopped buying animals because 
the number of carousel animals available declined, and prices began to climb. 
She said they will not buy an animal that comes from an operating machine 
because they don't want to encourage breaking up machines. 
</P>
<P>
Among factors contributing to the breakup of machines are the high costs of 
upkeep and liability insurance, said <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON> of the Friends of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Monica 
Carousel</ORGANIZATION>. Liability insurance for the <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> carousel this year was 
<MONEY>$14,000</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Susan Maysels</PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Monica Pier 
Restoration Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Maintenance and operating costs were about <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of restoring a merry-go-round can be prohibitive -- between <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> 
and <MONEY>$800,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON> said. But he said collectors pose the biggest danger to 
wooden carousels that are still operating. 
</P>
<P>
"The auction houses realize they can sell the broken-up machines and make a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
Carousel animals can sell for <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> each and rare animals for more 
than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>, <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON> said. In <DATE>1978</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Carousel Society</ORGANIZATION> was formed 
to promote collection of carousel animals rather than preservation of operating 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Some collectors believe the wooden animals should be replaced with fiberglass 
figures, <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The collectors have a point, too," she said. "The machines are very badly worn 
with the constant use. . . . Unfortunately, what tends to happen is that once a 
machine is broken up, it doesn't tend to be put back together. The old ones are 
being worn away. The details are being worn away. If the wood is bare and 
unprotected, that's very sad. But it's also sad to break them up." 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Jo Summit</PERSON> would like carousels to go round and round for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a marvelous, magical device. The carvings, the lights, the music. It's 
fun and it's not scary. It's not only for children. It's for adults too."

   Would you like a giraffe in your garden, or a unicorn, perhaps?
Or a grouping of neat geometric figures _ an orb, a triangle, a
spiral?
   Or how about setting your guests adrift in a maze? Or giving
your herb garden a bit of pizazz by making it into a knot?
   The gardener with patience, work and imagination can do all
these things.
   But before undertaking such a project, you may want to find out
what others have created in these special gardens.
   Many botanical gardens and others open to the public around the
country have knot gardens, a formal style of arrangement of herbs
popular in Elizabethan times. One at <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Botanic Garden</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, for example, is an exact replica of a garden described by a
16th century writer, <PERSON>Thomas Hill</PERSON>, (under the pen name Dydymus
Mountaine) in his book, ``Gardener's Labyrinth.''
   Topiary is the art of pruning and training plants into
sculptured shapes. A master of that art was the late <PERSON>Harvey S.
Ladew</PERSON>, who became intrigued by topiary during visits to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
His gardens in <LOCATION>Monkton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, were developed between <DATE>1929</DATE> and <DATE>1971</DATE>
and include a hunting scene, a Chinese junk, <ORGANIZATION>Winston Chrchill</ORGANIZATION>'s hat
and V-for-victory sign, a unicorn and sea lions.
   Back in the <DATE>1870s</DATE>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON>Thomas E. Brayton</PERSON>
purchased an estate on the shores of <LOCATION>Narragansett Bay</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, because he wanted a topiary garden. His garden,
<ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION>, has more than 60 topiary pieces, including a camel,
giraffe and elephant started 70 years ago, and a horse and rider
dating back more than 40 years.
   Both the Ladew and <ORGANIZATION>Green Animals</ORGANIZATION> gardens are open to the public,
and other examples of topiary can be found in other public gardens.
   Topiary reached the height of its popularity in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in the
<DATE>17th century</DATE>, a period when mazes also were in vogue.
   But the concept of the maze, or labyrinth, is far older than
that. According to Greek mythology, <ORGANIZATION>Daedalus</ORGANIZATION> built a labyrinth on
<ORGANIZATION>Crete for King Minos</ORGANIZATION> in which to house the Minotaur. And <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
King Amenemhat III</ORGANIZATION> built himself a funeral temple in the form of a
labyrinth.
   But these were not garden mazes. The garden variety _ made from
growing plants _ is traced back to the still-flourishing specimen
at <ORGANIZATION>Hampton Court Palace</ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. It was laid out around
<DATE>1700</DATE>, when <PERSON>King William III</PERSON> lived there. An estimated half-million
tourists visit it each year.
   In <LOCATION>Rydal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>H. Thomas Hallowell Jr.</PERSON> built himself a smaller
version of the <ORGANIZATION>Hampton Court Maze</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1940s</DATE> as a way to use
1,600 English boxwood plants. It, too, is still in fine shape,
though it is not usually open to the public.
   Anyone can see the labyrinth in <LOCATION>New Harmony</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind</LOCATION>. It is a
replica, or possibly the original, planted there by the Harmonists,
or Rappites, followers of the German separatist <PERSON>George Rapp</PERSON>. Rapp
founded this separatist model community on the <LOCATION>Wabash River</LOCATION> in the
<DATE>early 19th century</DATE> but later moved on, leaving his maze, which may
have symbolized obstacles that have to be overcome to find the
meaning of life. The tower in the center _ rough on the exterior,
attractively furnished within _ symbolized ultimate achievement.
   And Colonial <LOCATION>Williamsburg</LOCATION>, visited by countless people every
year, also has a maze, at the Governor's Palace.
   But how about making your own knot garden, topiary figures or
maze?
   The knot garden probably will be the simplest.
   Here are some pointers from <PERSON>Bernard Currid</PERSON> in ``Herbs &amp; Their
Ornamental Uses,'' published by the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>) Botanic Garden:
   First, draw a plan, visualizing both pattern and color. Mark it
off in squares, covering the dimensions of the available plot.
   In planning, remember that most of the herbs you'll be using
like light, well-drained soil and full sun.
   Herbs should be compact by nature and able to withstand
trimming. And the foliage should be sufficiently varied in color to
delineate the various features of the knot.
   Plants mentioned by <PERSON>Currid</PERSON> include gray and green santolinas,
germander, winter savory (a form of lemon thyme with leaves edged
in white), hyssop, Roman wormwood, edging box, dwarf forms of
lavender and golden variegated sage.
   Gardeners contemplating topiary should start by pruning the
plant roughly into shape, according to the <ORGANIZATION>BBG</ORGANIZATION>'s handbook,
``Trained and Sculptured Plants.'' Once the plant is established,
yearly clipping is necessary to maintain and refine a clear
outline. But don't prune topiary in late autumn or winter in areas
where freezing weather may occur. It could damage the plant.
   Plants favored for topiary are boxwood, yew, hemlock, privet and
arborvitae. Privet is not an evergreen, and it may not look
attractive in winter.
   Topiary also needs plenty of water to keep it in shape during
hot <DATE>summer</DATE> weather, so the gardener who cannot supply it shouldn't
attempt it.
   For mazes, boxwood is a favorite plant. The labyrinth at <LOCATION>New
Harmony</LOCATION> is made of <LOCATION>Amoor River</LOCATION> privet, noted for its hardiness. The
<ORGANIZATION>Hampton Court</ORGANIZATION> maze is yew, and the <LOCATION>Colonial Williamsburg</LOCATION> maze is
holly.
   Patience is the key for these projects. It takes time for the
work to look its best.
   The boxwood plants in <PERSON>Hallowell</PERSON>'s maze in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> grow
about an inch each year. They were about 6 inches high when he
planted them in the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and are now about four feet high.

   Hippos and Calliopes: A Great Circus Parade
   ----
   By Gail King
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11

<LP>
   Milwaukee -- Had Baraboo, Wis., been better equipped with
bathrooms, Baraboo would be the dateline on this story. As it
happened, Baraboo, a town of 8,000 residents 120 miles
northwest of Milwaukee, had the world's greatest collection
of circus wagons, but Milwaukee had bathrooms and Ben Barkin,
and that's why The Great Circus Parade takes place in
Milwaukee each July.
   Mr. Barkin got involved back in 1963 when C.P. "Chappie"
Fox, who was director of Baraboo's Circus World Museum,
wanted to stage a parade to show off the museum's collection
of rare circus wagons. He met turndowns on all sides until he
got to Mr. Barkin, Schlitz's PR man, who had happy childhood
memories of watering circus animals on the Milwaukee
lakefront in exchange for free tickets. Mr. Barkin believed
there was a good market for the authentic nostalgic Americana
that circus parades represent, but he insisted that the
thousands of people who might come would need the facilities
of a city. In 1963, Schlitz put up $125,000 for Milwaukee's
first Great Circus Parade. Now years past official
retirement, Mr. Barkin has found a second career as full-time
volunteer coordinator of the parade. For the July 15
production he raised $1,403,000 (the budget called for
$1,375,000) from several large corporate donors, some
foundations, and thousands of individual circus fans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Barkin</PERSON> has his hand in every aspect: loading the
wagons onto the circus train at <LOCATION>Baraboo</LOCATION>, riding the train
through <PERSON>Madison</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> suburbs, unloading the wagons
on the lakefront in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>, and locating, housing and
feeding the animals (762 horses, 21 camels, one pygmy hippo,
a giraffe, four boa constrictors and assorted other creatures
-- <PERSON>Mr. Barkin</PERSON>'s budget allowed for 2,800 bales of hay and 50
mammoth tents).
   It rained on the parade this year, a cold intermittent
drizzle that cut the crowd a tad, but very little else went
wrong. The <ORGANIZATION>Baraboo High School</ORGANIZATION> band kept its white clown
suits spotless through blocks of mud and manure. The giraffe
behaved admirably (although he refused to enter his
high-canopied parade wagon without a bribe of Froot-Loops);
the pygmy hippo (who had spent the pre-parade days napping)
rose to the occasion and roared; the 40-horse hitch clomped
forward, backward and neatly around corners; the harem girls
(members of the <LOCATION>Milwaukee Ballet</LOCATION>) stayed atop their camels
with varying degrees of grace; the eight-camel hitch pulling
the <ORGANIZATION>Temple Tableau</ORGANIZATION> did not spit or split; the top hats and
tail ribbons on the elephants stayed put; the sunburst wheels
did not spin off the antique wagons; the 50-year-old steam
calliope did not explode; the arms of the stupendously
energetic carillonneur playing the Musical Bells of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>
(built in <DATE>1892</DATE> in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Ringling Bros.</LOCATION>) did not give
out; and the bands played on and on.
   The threats of racial violence that bedeviled parade
planners had pretty much quieted down before parade time;
nevertheless there was a high profile of uniformed police.
(Let's hear a circus hurrah right here for No. <DATE>1939</DATE> {a black
man} and No. 1371 {a white man}, who handled the corner of
Third and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> with amazing teamwork and patience.)
   Circus parades developed in the <DATE>early 19th century</DATE> as a
means of transportation and an advertising ploy for traveling
shows. Wagons were added to the entourages around <DATE>1850</DATE>, when
circuses started using tents. Circuses having always involved
heavy hype, the wagons immediately became moving posters,
touting (with liberal doses of artistic and advertising
license) the shows' attractions.
   Baraboo got more than its fair share of such equipment,
because the Ringlings wintered their show there from <DATE>1884</DATE> to
<DATE>1918</DATE>. Their Baraboo cousins, the <LOCATION>Moellers</LOCATION>, built circus
wagons. This circus heritage is commemorated in the town by
the <ORGANIZATION>State Historical Society of Wisconsin's Circus World
Museum</ORGANIZATION>. When the museum opened in <DATE>1959</DATE> there were three or
four wagons on display, but more importantly, there were
still people in <LOCATION>Baraboo</LOCATION> who understood and appreciated
circus-wagon construction and decoration. The 76 wagons that
rolled through <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>'s streets with their perfectly
restored, repainted and regilded wooden carvings were
selected from the museum's collection of more than 150.
   Circus wagons fall into three general categories: tableau,
band wagons and animal cages, all built to be heavily loaded
and pulled by horses over rutted roads and muddy circus
grounds. The tableau wagons evolved from decorated baggage
carts to elaborately engineered telescoping masterpieces
designed to transport only imaginations. They still do. The
heavily gilded red-and-green Twin Lions Telescoping Tableau,
built in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> more than 100 years ago (four-layered and 17
feet, seven inches from the street to the tips of the lion's
ears), was one of the most fantastic things in the parade.
   <PERSON>Mr. Barkin</PERSON>'s insistence on authenticity has made parade
day a magnet for horse fans. In addition to the hitches of
Belgians, Clydesdales and Percherons that pulled most of the
wagons, there were mules, <LOCATION>Morgans</LOCATION>, Lippizaners, miniature
horses, tiny donkeys and spectacularly costumed equestrienne
teams.
   (The horses account for one of the prime sideshows of the
affair. Sidewalk bookies take bets on where horse droppings
will land; for a quarter you chalk out and initial a circle
on the street. There apparently are unlimited -- and probably
unprintable -- refinements to this activity, but this year
the rain washed away the whole business.)
   In the days of circus street parades, most shows owned a
band wagon that served as a <ORGANIZATION>Pied Piper</ORGANIZATION> at the end of the
procession.
   The Great Circus Parade sported a dozen, including the
111-year-old superbly carved Lion and Mirror; the gloriously
painted, red, white and gold <ORGANIZATION>Great Britain Bandwagon</ORGANIZATION> (pulled
by a matched set of eight black Percherons with red
trappings); and the wonderful 40-horse hitch, the 10-ton Two
Hemispheres, the largest band wagon ever built. The Two
Hemispheres and the rollicking, steam-spewing calliope made a
truly grand Grand Finale.
   "It's the joy," <PERSON>Mr. Barkin</PERSON> declared as the last strains of
the calliope faded away. "It is the joy that this brings to
people; it lifts the spirit of the community -- that's the
one thing this means to me."

The sight of the iguana is not uncommon in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a census of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Animal Regulation</ORGANIZATION> indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The spiny-backed lizard made famous by such writers as <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee Williams</ORGANIZATION> and 
<PERSON>James M. Cain</PERSON> is the most popular exotic critter in the city. There are 511 
residents who hold iguana permits. 
</P>
<P>
Monkeys are next on the list of documented animals with 43, followed by such 
unusual house pets as tarantulas (14), scorpions (11), llamas (9), boa 
constrictors (8), raccoons (4), alligators (2), deer (male) (1), tigers (1) and 
African lions (1). The iguana, which is common to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, is apparently a 
favorite of the heavy Latin population here. <PERSON>Meyer Levine</PERSON> of Animal Regulation 
theorized that while some permit-holders might station the animals in their 
yard as watch-lizards, others could be trying to raise little iguanas "because 
they are considered a delicacy." 
</P>
<P>
Although it's not reflected in the city figures, the exotic animal population 
has decreased with the recent move of singer <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>'s menagerie to his 
new ranch in the <LOCATION>Santa Ynez Valley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> has one-year permits to keep a llama, a chimp and a deer at his 
one-acre estate in <LOCATION>Encino</LOCATION>, having previously disposed of a baby giraffe and a 
boa constrictor. "We had an inspector out there the other day and all the 
animals were gone," <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's chimp, <LOCATION>Bubbles</LOCATION>, may well prefer the seclusion of the <LOCATION>Santa Ynez 
Valley</LOCATION> since the humiliation of <DATE>last year</DATE> when the animal was denied entry with 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> into <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> because of quarantine laws. 
</P>
<P>
There's an Ortega in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> who doesn't like <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>. However, 
an <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> on <LOCATION>Central Avenue</LOCATION> in Duarte feels differently. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robert Ortega</PERSON>, the principal of <ORGANIZATION>Northview Middle School</ORGANIZATION>, wants to rename his 
school after <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, no matter what Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON> might 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with politics," <ORGANIZATION>Northview</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said. "I just think 
it would be very good publicity for us to have one of the first schools in the 
country named after <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega plans to poll local school officials as well as <ORGANIZATION>Northview</ORGANIZATION>'s students. 
</P>
<P>
"The poll of the students will be structured," he said, explaining that merely 
asking the students who they'd like to name the school for would likely result 
in a rock group being honored. 
</P>
<P>
"You might wind up with <ORGANIZATION>AC/DC Middle School</ORGANIZATION>," <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> noted. 
</P>
<P>
Pershing Square was called Central Park back then. On <DATE>Feb. 21, 1889</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>City 
Council</ORGANIZATION> established the first <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Department of Parks</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
To mark the anniversary <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the city Recreation and <ORGANIZATION>Parks Department</ORGANIZATION> is 
throwing a noontime party in the plaza near Olvera Street, featuring ethnic 
dance groups as well as a presentation by Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> of memorabilia to 
be placed in a time capsule. 
</P>
<P>
The capsule, which will be buried in the plaza, will contain such items as two 
feathers from the endangered <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> condors at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Zoo</LOCATION>, a 
bottled grunion from <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Marine Museum</ORGANIZATION> and a letter from <LOCATION>Bradley</LOCATION> to 
whoever is mayor of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in the year <DATE>2089</DATE>, assuming it's someone 
different.

<TEXT>     ERROR ERROR ERROR ALL FILES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED YOU STUPID BAZOOTIEHEAD;   
Ha ha! Considering what a wonderful invention computers are, they certainly
have a way of making you sometimes feel like pouring coffee into their private
parts and listening to them scream. Of course you should not do this. The
first rule of data processing is: "Never pour hot beverages into a computer,
unless it belongs to somebody else, such as your employer.";    For many of
us, the first "hands-on" experience with computers occurs in the workplace.
This was certainly true in the newspaper business. One day we reporters came
to work and discovered that our old, slow, horse-drawn typewriters had been
replaced by sleek, efficient computers with keys that said mysterious scary
things like "BREAK" and "NUM LOCK." Fortunately we were trained by highly
skilled professional computer personnel who spoke no English. "Before you
macro your <ORGANIZATION>ASCII</ORGANIZATION>, you have to format your RAM," they would advise us, in a
tone of voice clearly suggesting that any member of the vegetable family
should know this instinctively.;    So we reporters were wary at first, but
after just 175 weeks of training, we discovered that, instead of writing on
clumsy, old-fashioned paper, we could create lengthy stories entirely on the
computer screen, and then, simply by pushing a button, send them to the Planet
Zembar. Or maybe even farther. We definitely couldn't find them anywhere in
the building.;    "Where the hell is my story?" we would say, shaking the
computer personnel by their necks. But the lost stories always turned out to
be our own fault. We had invariably committed some basic bonehead
data-processing error such as -- you are going to laugh when I tell you this
-- failing to modem our ROM BIOS VGA megahertz cache.;    But gradually we got
the hang of it, and today we journalists routinely use highly sophisticated,
multimillion-dollar computer systems to perform a function that is vital to
the survival of a free society, namely, sending personal messages to each
other. Walk into a newspaper, and you'll see serious-looking journalists
clattering away on their keyboards; it looks as though they're writing
important stories about the plight of the Kurds, but in fact they're sending
each other the joke about what the male giraffe said to the female giraffe in
the bar. In the old days, journalists had to transmit jokes manually.;    Also
computers now have "spell-checkers," which enable us to catch and correct
common misspellings such as "bazootiehead.";    Of course there are some
problems. You have probably read about computer "viruses," which computers get
when they're left uncovered in drafty rooms. This is bad, because if you're
working on an infected computer, it will periodically emit electronic sneezes,
which unfortunately are not detectable by the naked eye -- the word "achoo"
appears on the screen for less than a millionth of a second -- and you'll be
showered with billions of tiny invisible pieces of electronic phlegm, called
"bytes," which penetrate into your brain and gradually make you stupid.;   
This is definitely happening to me. I'll sit down at my home computer to write
a thoughtful column about, say, foreign policy, and I'll type: "In view of the
recent dramatic changes in the world geopolitical situation, it's time to play
some solitaire." My computer has a solitaire-playing program on it, probably
invented by the Japanese in an effort to sabotage the American economy. I used
to think solitaire was boring, but now that my brain is clogged with computer
boogers I find it more fascinating than, say, the <ORGANIZATION>Sistine Chapel</ORGANIZATION>. I spend
hours moving the little electronic cards around, staring at the screen with
the same facial expression as a mullet, while the computer sneezes on me. None
of this was possible just 15 years ago.;    The computer is also a great
teaching tool for young people. For example, my home computer has an
educational program that enables you to control an entire simulated planet --
its ecology, its technology, its weather, etc. My 10-year-old son and his
friends use this program a lot, and we've all learned some important
ecological lessons, the main one being: Never, ever put 10-year-old boys in
charge of a planet. ("Let's see what happens when you have volcanoes and
nuclear war!");    So if you don't already have a home computer, I strongly
recommend that you get one. Of course before you buy, you'll want to know the
answers to some pertinent questions, especially: What did the male giraffe say
to the female giraffe in the bar? The answer -- this'll kill you -- is: "The

<DESCRIPT>  ANIMAL; ARTS; BOOK; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  NOTHING has brought out the worst and the best of the human animal more than
our meetings with the other species on this planet. There is a unique power in
the human-animal meeting, whether it is as individuals or as separate races,
stranded together on the globe. For some of us, specific animals have the
power of totems -- metaphors for our own dreams and the virtues for which we
strive. So many books about animals never transcend the level of "Our Friend
the Squirrel" to reach that of our personal experience. Books that do need be
neither flashy nor expensive, although some of the best are both.;   A new
book that is both expensive and beautiful is Great Cats: Majestic Creatures of
the Wild,  edited by John Seidensticker and Susan Lumpkin (Rodale, 240 pp.,
$40). Anyone interested in felines will find something of interest in this
large-format encyclopedia. "Great Cats" contains a number of essays on
specific species, ranging from the more exotic such as snow leopards and
ocelots to pumas, lions and jaguars, as well as essays on behavior, domestic
cats and the place of cats in zoos. The writing varies from exciting to arid;
the many photographs, drawings and charts are a delight.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Alan Rabinowitz</PERSON> is a research zoologist specializing in wild cats. His
second book, Chasing the <ORGANIZATION>Dragon</ORGANIZATION>'s Tail: The Struggle to Save <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s Wild
Cats  (<ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>, 242 pp., <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>), is a detailed account of the two years he
spent in a Thai forest at the request of that country's government. <PERSON>Rabinowitz</PERSON>
was invited to study the wildlife there, especially its leopards and tigers.; 
 He found himself in a long, hard and so far unsuccessful fight to save the
animals and their place, a fight he found particularly ironic in a Buddhist
country. The author's first book, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>: One Man's Battle to Establish the
World's <ORGANIZATION>First Jaguar Preserve</ORGANIZATION>, about his earlier effort in <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>, is now
available in paperback (Anchor Books, 370 pp., <MONEY>$12</MONEY>).;   Saving the elephant;  
Just in time for the holidays, two books on the perennial favorite, the
African elephant, have appeared. The books have similar formats, and both also
have introductions by <PERSON>Richard Leakey</PERSON>. The African Elephant: Twilight in <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION>
by <PERSON>Roger L. DiSilvestro</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Wiley</ORGANIZATION>, 206 pp., <MONEY>$34.95</MONEY>) is the weaker of the two. The
elephant as a subject is so large and complex that anything short of a genuine
textbook will be limited. But <PERSON>DiSilvestro</PERSON> errs on the side of simplicity; the
reader hungers for more.;   Elephants: The Deciding Decade, a book of essays
edited by <PERSON>Ronald Orenstein</PERSON>, with many fine photographs by <PERSON>Brian Beck</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Sierra
Club</ORGANIZATION>, 160 pp., <MONEY>$35</MONEY>), partly solves this problem by its different authorial
voices and points of view, focusing more on specific aspects of the elephant
than an overview. The reader is forewarned: It is impossible to read about the
elephant without feeling. A sense of outrage, as well as beauty, is intrinsic
to both these books.;   There are a lot of good coral reef books available,
but if you're a reef fan like me, you can't have too many. An ecosystem as
gorgeous, complicated and alien as the coral reef can always yield a new view.
If you didn't know already that coral is an animal, along with anemones, sea
fans and sponges, it's time to find out how wide are the limits of zoology.;  
Reef: A Safari Through the Coral World  by <PERSON>Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Sierra
Club</ORGANIZATION>, 200 pp., <MONEY>$25</MONEY>) is an excellent introduction. Stafford-Deitsch also writes
with enough scientific concision to satisfy the reef veteran. For a book this
large and well-produced, the price is surprisingly low.;   While crocodilians
don't lend themselves to a certain warm, domestic coziness, alligators and
crocodiles have always held a special totemic magic. Eyelids of Morning: The
Mingled Destinies of Crocodiles and Men by <PERSON>Alistair Graham</PERSON> with photographs by
<PERSON>Peter Beard</PERSON> (Chronicle Books, 260 pp., <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY> paperback) is a general
exposition on the reasons for that magic.;   <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> focuses on the
relationship of Africans to the crocodile, but also shows many cultural
artifacts, such as cartoons and advertisements, from around the world. Graham
tells a few harrowing tales of man-eating, with equally harrowing stories of
the destruction by man of a fabulous beast.;    A Social History of the
American Alligator by <PERSON>Vaughn L. Glascow</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>St. Martin's</ORGANIZATION>, 260 pp., <MONEY>$29.95</MONEY>) covers
much of the same ground as <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>'s book, focused exclusively on the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. This is a sociocultural history of mixed success: It covers the
familiar journey from prey to endangered species, but with the inevitable
shallowness of such a broad canvas. Much less flashy, but ultimately more
meaningful, is Gator! An Eye-Opening Adventure (Ten Speed Press, 80 pp., <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>
paperback). Author <PERSON>Lawrence T. Mahoney</PERSON> dedicates his book to the Lizard King
-- <PERSON>Jim Morrison</PERSON> -- and the general weirdness of this book does <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> honor.
Mahoney and photographer <PERSON>Richard Benson</PERSON> tell the story of the nights of
<DATE>September 1988</DATE>, when the state of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> opened a month-long nocturnal
alligator season, the first since <DATE>1961</DATE>. A bizarre True Story at a great
price.;   One book deliberately ignoring the more sexy of our favorite animals
is Here Today: Portraits of Our Vanishing Species by <PERSON>Susan Middleton</PERSON> and <PERSON>David
Liitschwager</PERSON> with a foreword by <PERSON>Wendell Berry</PERSON> (Chronicle Books, 143 pp.,
<MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>). The two photographer-authors focused on those species that live, or
are trying to live, in our own habitats, such as the salt marsh harvest mouse,
the Shasta crayfish and 34 other animals and plants quickly disappearing from
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. A representative of each species is pictured both in
black-and-white and color plates, using photographic techniques that
essentially eliminate background; each tuft of fur, every stamen and feather
appear in sharp and splendid relief.;   An ecological vision;   <PERSON>James Balog</PERSON>
remains the most original and powerful wildlife photographer working. Balog
has more than technique and field experience; he has an artistic vision of an
animal's ecology. In his <DATE>1990</DATE> book  Survivors: A <ORGANIZATION>New Vision of Endangered
Wildlife</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Harry N. Abrams</PERSON>, 144 pp., <MONEY>$49.50</MONEY>), <PERSON>Balog</PERSON> used techniques developed
in fashion photography to represent the "new landscape" in which wild animals
find themselves. "I have created images of animals in exile from a lost <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION>,
adrift in the ether of a planet now made alien to them." And so he has, in a
vision radical and disturbing. Balog shows us a gray wolf where it stands on
its hind legs, alone in a cinder-block room, howling; he gives us the mute
orangutan, against a white wall, its arms spread and palms open in offering.
Each of the 84 color plates, each with an anecdotal explanation, is startling,
strange and unforgettable.;   Finally, a classic of wildlife writing and
photography has been reissued in a lovely edition. <PERSON>Peter Beard</PERSON>'s The End of
the Game: The Last Word From Paradise  (Chronicle Books, 224 pp., <MONEY>$22.95</MONEY>
paperback) focuses not only on the elephants of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, but its other life:
giraffes, rhinos, <LOCATION>Masai</LOCATION>, railroads, invaders. To Beard, the game was both the
quarry and the act of hunting it, and he watched both of them come to an end
in his lifetime. His silvery and sepia photographs are awful and sublime. The
real elephants' graveyard is here: not the enormous field of white bone, but
the graphic series of aerial shots of one butchered carcass after the other. A
sorrow and a triumph.  </TEXT>

   Firefighters battling blazes that charred
nearly 6,000 acres of brush said they were confident the flames
would not burn a shelter for exotic animals or burn the area around
giant trees in <LOCATION>Sequoia National Park</LOCATION>.
   Barring sudden gusts, the 3,300-acre fire northwest of <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> did not present a threat to the Wildlife Way Station or a
home for 125 emotionally disturbed children, said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest
Service</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Kim Vanderhaar</PERSON>.
   The flames were 1{ miles away from the animal shelter and about
3 miles beyond the home for children in <LOCATION>Little Tujunga Canyon</LOCATION>, she
said.
   Officials at the wild animal shelter were cautious but confident.
   ``All the animals are confined, because we can't guard a
free-roaming animal very well,'' said <PERSON>Martine Colette</PERSON>, spokeswoman
for the animal shelter about 30 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>.
   The shelter houses alligators, tigers, bears, horses, giraffes
and a variety of other abandoned exotic pets and wild animals that
wandered into neighborhoods.
   The fire in the <ORGANIZATION>Angeles National Forest</ORGANIZATION>, which was <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>
contained as of early today, forced evacuations of seven homes.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the
blaze, which officials estimated will be surrounded at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and extinguished <TIME>24 hours later</TIME>.
   More than 800 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and
three helicopters that began dropping water and fire-retardant
chemicals at dawn <DATE>Monday</DATE> as the blaze burned dry brush in
inaccessible mountainous terrain.
   Three <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> men were booked on <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> bail for
investigation of starting a forest fire with an illegal campfire,
but they were released <DATE>Monday</DATE> and no charges were to be filed, said
Deputy <PERSON>Hal Grant</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff's Information Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It appears a 10-year-old boy has admitted to it,'' <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> said.
``He told arson investigators he started a campfire that got out of
control.''
   The fire was one of several _ including a 1,500-acre fire near
trees up to 2,700 years old in <LOCATION>Sequoia National Park</LOCATION> _ that erupted
during the weekend as an autumn heat wave blasted <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> with
temperatures near 100 degrees in some areas and sent dry desert
winds gusting to 30 mph.
   In <LOCATION>Sequoia</LOCATION>, 600 firefighters worked to make sure the fires kept
away from the 3-square-mile <ORGANIZATION>Giant Forest</ORGANIZATION>, a grove of trees
considered the largest living things on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Michele Case</PERSON>. The fire was burning away from the trees
as of <DATE>today</DATE>, she said.
   The trees can generally survive forest fires because their soft
bark can withstand considerable heat and flame, although ``a
sequoia tree is fire-resistant, not fireproof,'' <PERSON>Case</PERSON> said.
   Elsewhere in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, other blazes consumed about 1,300 acres
of brush.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Edmund Akenhead</PERSON>, for 18 years the editor of the
crossword puzzle in The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, has died at age 77, the
newspaper reported <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Akenhead, who died <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, joined his family's law firm in
<LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION> in <DATE>1936</DATE>. After war service in the Glider Pilot Regiment he
took a legal post in the <ORGANIZATION>Colonial Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dar-es-Salaam</LOCATION>, in what
is now <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, where he began setting crosswords for the
<ORGANIZATION>Tanganyika Standard</ORGANIZATION>.
   Returning to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, he became the third editor of The Times'
crossword in <DATE>1965</DATE>.
   The Times's obituary said: ``He began the practice of returning
edited puzzles to their compilers with detailed reasons for his
alterations, which quickly produced a consistent standard of
excellence from his team of 10 compilers, most of whom he himself
recruited.
   ``He allowed no sloppiness of thought or expression: `As a
lawyer I cannot pass IOU as meaning debt. It is evidence of
acknowledgment of debt'; or `The dictionaries do not define okapi
as a giraffe. The fact that it is related to the giraffe does not
make it one.'''
   Akenhead retired from the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>. His coat of arms,
granted by the <ORGANIZATION>College of Heralds</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, incorporated a miniature
crossword puzzle.
   He is survived by his wife and two sons. Funeral arrangements
were not announced.

<TEXT>
   Lion tamer <PERSON>Gunther Gebel-Williams</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
he plans to retire from the <LOCATION>Ringling Bros.</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus</ORGANIZATION>, where he has been riding elephants and subduing Bengals for
the past two decades.
   Dressed in blue sequined tights and jacket, the trim, blond
<PERSON>Gebel-Williams</PERSON>, 54, said he wanted to retire ``while I'm still on
top.''
   He said he would tour with ``The Greatest Show on Earth'' for two
more years before retiring at the end of the <DATE>1990</DATE> season.
   ``Tiger training is like race car driving, like boxing. You have
to be really on top all the time. It's not possible to feel not so
good one day. ... There has to be the time to say, that's it,''
<PERSON>Gebel-Williams</PERSON> said in a thick, German accent flanked by a
40-year-old elephant, <PERSON>Nellie</PERSON>.
   Ringling Bros. President <PERSON>Kenneth Feld</PERSON> said he plans to replace
Gebel-Williams with eight to 10 people doing various parts of the
many animal acts Gebel-Williams now performs alone.
   ``It's the most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with,''
<PERSON>Feld</PERSON> said. ``Once in a lifetime there's a <PERSON>Gunther Gebel-Williams</PERSON>.''
   Gebel-Williams was born in the German town of <LOCATION>Schweidnitz</LOCATION>, which
is now a part of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, and was 12 years old when his widowed
mother was hired by <PERSON>Circus Williams</PERSON> as a wardrobe seamstress.
   He soon began working with animals and became a master showman at
age 16. He took over the business after owner <PERSON>Harry Williams</PERSON> died
and, in <DATE>1968</DATE>, caught the eye of <ORGANIZATION>Feld</ORGANIZATION>'s father, circus producer <PERSON>Irvin
Feld</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Irvin Feld</PERSON> wanted to hire Gebel-Williams to create a second
touring unit of his circus. He bought the entire German troupe for
<MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> when <ORGANIZATION>Gebel-Williams</ORGANIZATION> refused to leave it.
   Gebel-Williams has remained in the center ring since, becoming
famous for his flashy showmanship, his flowing gold hair and his
taming of tigers, elephants, horses, giraffes and other animals.
   His body is covered with scars _ bearing more than 500 stitches
at last count. When asked about them at a news conference,
<ORGANIZATION>Gebel-Williams</ORGANIZATION> quickly flung off his jacket, unbuttoned his shirt
and rolled up his sleeves to show evidence of several near-fatal
scrapes.
   True danger lurks with the elephants, not lions and tigers,
because they are not housed in cages and they can easily snap most
chains, he said.
   ``A tiger's in a cage, a horse is on a chain. It's much easier to
deal with them. But elephants are loose all the time,'' he said.
``And they have strong personalities. They get jealous. My wife can
never come close to one of them.''

   Evie, an 8-year-old female giraffe, died
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> about 11 hours after falling on her side, zoo officials said.
   ``She passed away at <TIME>2:30 a.m.</TIME>,'' said <PERSON>Ted Grannon</PERSON>, operations
curator for the <ORGANIZATION>Mesker Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION>. The body was taken to <ORGANIZATION>Purdue
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Lafayette</LOCATION> for an autopsy to determine the cause
of death, he said.
   Zoo director <PERSON>Ron Young</PERSON> said <PERSON>Evie</PERSON> fell flat on her side <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
about <TIME>3:15 p.m.</TIME>, but he was not sure what caused the accident.
   ``She was kind of running around in the sun when all four feet
went our from under her and she landed on her side,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
``We don't know if the wind was knocked out of her or whether she
hit her head.''
   Evie had been on her back since the accident, and attempted
about every 30 minutes to get back on her feet, zoo officials said.
   Zoo veterinarians <PERSON>Dr. Craig Butler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dr. Stan Epperson</PERSON> treated
<PERSON>Evie</PERSON> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with relaxants, pain relievers and fluids, and
even took X-rays of her neck and her legs but found nothing broken,
<PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   Evie, worth <MONEY>$12,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>, came to the zoo in <DATE>1982</DATE> from
<LOCATION>Abilene</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Her mate, <PERSON>Gerry</PERSON>, came from the <LOCATION>Cheyenne Mountain
Park Zoo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1981</DATE>, <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.

The respected <ORGANIZATION>Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia</ORGANIZATION> made a rare <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> tour stop 
this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, bringing a striking production of <ORGANIZATION>Rudyard Kipling</ORGANIZATION>'s "Just So 
Stories" to audiences in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ramo Auditorium</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted and directed by <PERSON>Graham Whitehead</PERSON>, "How the Camel Got His Hump," "The 
Sing Song of Old Man Kangaroo," "The Elephant's Child" and "The Cat Who Walked 
by Himself" were brought to exuberant life by the four-member troupe. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tom Miller</PERSON>'s eye-catching organic design -- nubby fabrics, woven mats and 
pillars and his over-sized masks and puppets crafted from basketry, rope, fur 
and feathers -- plus <PERSON>Steven Naylor</PERSON>'s original music played on gourds, drums and 
xylophones are just right for a show set "when the world was so new and all." 
</P>
<P>
The cast -- <PERSON>Sheldon Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rhonda McLean</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kenneth Wilson-Harrington</PERSON> -- 
whether wearing costumes or manipulating puppets, uses deft body language to 
convey humor and well-observed characteristics of a whole gallery of animals 
including a monkey, hippo, ostrich, giraffe and snake, as well as the title 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Diane Pitblado</PERSON>'s narration, occasionally rushed a bit at <LOCATION>Caltech</LOCATION> to compete 
with very young, noisy audience members, remained true to <ORGANIZATION>Kipling</ORGANIZATION>'s whimsical 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Old Man <PERSON>Kangaroo</PERSON>'s "pride is inordinate," Yellow Dog Dingo grins "like a 
coal-scuttle," the camel is "most 'scrutiating idle," the elephant child is 
filled with " 'satiable curtiosity" and the cat "walks by his wild lone."

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Swaying across the shimmering plains - African
elephants are reputed to be impossible to train. But three of them carried
Michael J Woods through the Okavango Delta - on their terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS

<TEXT>
SIX WHITE, black and tan wild dogs, the rarest and most endangered of
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s carnivores, reluctantly rose to their feet and disdainfully stepped
aside as we pushed into the thick thorn scrub where they were resting in the
heat of the day.
For the first time in my life I felt quite invisible, my universally feared
human form subsumed into that of the African elephant on which I was riding,
for the dogs had no inkling of our presence. All they noticed were the great
grey ghosts padding almost silently past. This magic was to be repeated
again and again during our safari. For almost a week, I became an elephant.
Even giraffes with small calves and notoriously grumpy lone bull buffaloes
allowed us to come much closer than I had believed possible.
Sadly, the only animals it was necessary to avoid were wild elephants and we
had more than our fair share of encounters during our five-day elephant-back
safari from Abu's camp, run by <PERSON>Ker and Downey</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Okavango Delta</ORGANIZATION>.
Generally speaking, distant animals would be easily deterred by the sight of
<PERSON>Randall Moore</PERSON>, the owner of the three riding elephants, <PERSON>Abu</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bennie</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Kathy</PERSON>. He accompanied us on foot and was armed in case of problems. Twice,
though, we were followed. On the first occasion a troubled <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> repeatedly
sent deep, rumbling growls far into the forest from her vibrating body; on
the second, it needed two shots, fired over the head of a persistent bull,
before he would retreat.
Each of the three adult elephants carried two passengers on its back,
sitting in a mixture of saddle and play-pen with the handler or mahout
riding astride the elephant's neck. From here the animals were controlled
with verbal commands, prods from the bull hook and rewards of cattle nuts.
African elephants are reputed to be impossible to train, being larger and
supposedly of more uncertain temperament than their Indian counterparts.
While <PERSON>Randall Moore</PERSON> has proved this to be a fallacy, I always felt our trip
was conducted on the elephants' terms.
Once, when they worked themselves into a frenzy of fear over a non-existent
danger and finally bolted with us on board, there was little Abu's handler
could do about it, in spite of beating him over the head with the bull hook
until its fibreglass handle shattered, sending the business end spinning
into the undergrowth. The elephants simply came to a halt when they felt it
was safe to do so.
Riding an elephant in these conditions was a little like sitting upstairs in
a silent, invisible, all-terrain, open-top, double-decker bus driven by an
ever hungry, somewhat obstinate and slightly unpredictable eight-year-old
guided by calls and prods from the top deck. They are an ideal form of
transport in the intricate web of sandy islands and shallow, clear waters of
the <LOCATION>Okavango</LOCATION>, for they are undeterred by all but the thickest thorn scrub
and the view from high on their backs is unsurpassed.
Our expeditions were enlivened by the presence of seven baby elephants, aged
between three and five, orphans of culling operations in <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> national
park, which turned each outing from a gentle walk into a foray with a gang
of vandals, tearing branches from trees, uprooting grasses and shrubs and
generally leaving a trail of destruction behind.
When we walked along the channels which snake through the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>, the babies
would indulge in serious feeding, snatching succulent rushes as they passed
or pulling down with their small trunks the carefully selected fluffy
seed-heads of reeds.
Although the water is rarely more than 6ft deep, occasional pools exceeded
that, and then the youngsters would completely disappear. First a trunk tip
would come questing above the surface - followed by a little elephant, black
and gleaming, which would bob up before slipping under again.
Now and then a spirit of abandon would overtake the babies and they would
thrash and beat the water with their trunks, throwing spray high into the
air with great exuberance. Once, we came to a small mud wallow and this they
could not resist, falling on to their sides and working their way into the
dark morass, or picking up gouts of mud and tossing them over their backs
and under their bellies.
The activities at Abu's Camp are not restricted to elephant riding, and keen
fishermen may take a mokoro (a canoe punted by a local guide) out on to the
water where the catches can be prolific. Game drives are also on offer, and
one afternoon I escaped with a driver and a safari truck to look for the
wild dogs again.
After a two-hour search, we came across them lying in long grass and stayed
with them as they began to grow increasingly restless, greeting one another
and preparing for an evening's hunt. With the sun sinking in the sky, they
rose as a group and trotted off to look for supper.
Ever the showman, on the last morning <PERSON>Randall Moore</PERSON> found it impossible to
conceal his circus roots and treated us to a whole series of elephant film
stunts, from mock charges to babies crawling through the sand. This,
together with the occasional need to fire over the heads of wild elephants
and the slow acting sedative administered to <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> after her nervous bolt on
the first day, left me slightly uneasy.
On the other hand, I treasure the memory of riding with a slow, steady
elephant rhythm across a shimmering plain of waving golden grass, studded
here and there with copper-leaved mopane trees and bordered by a frieze of
rustling lala palms, their blue-green foliage making feathery rosettes
against the clear blue sky of the Kalahari winter.
<PERSON>Michael Woods</PERSON>' elephant-back safari was arranged by <ORGANIZATION>Twickers World</ORGANIZATION>, of 22
Church Street, <LOCATION>Twickenham</LOCATION>, TW1 3NW, 081-892-7606, and was run from Abu's
Camp in the <LOCATION>Okavango Delta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>. The camp has en-suite facilities and
includes such luxuries as a daily laundry service and hot water bottles.
Elephants make unstable platforms for photography, so keen photographers
could combine an elephant-back safari with a stay at one of Ker and <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION>'s
photographic safari camps in the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>. The winter weather is dry,
pleasantly warm during the day but rather cold at night. Potential elephant
riders should note that they will be required to sign a comprehensive
release form, and agree not to sue, before being allowed to ride. From
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, elephant-back safaris cost from Pounds 3,037 per person for a total
of nine days.

After five years of reinvigoration in the hands of a small group of investors, 
<PERSON>FAO Schwarz</PERSON>, the venerable purveyor of <MONEY>$4,500</MONEY> life-sized stuffed giraffes and 
other luxury toys, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that it had been sold to a Dutch retailing 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch firm, <ORGANIZATION>NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer</ORGANIZATION> (KBB), declined to disclose the 
purchase price. The selling group included <PERSON>Peter C. Morse</PERSON>, the chairman; <PERSON>Peter 
L. Harris</PERSON>, chief executive, and other investors and executives of the toy store 
who acquired it in <DATE>1985</DATE>. FAO <PERSON>Schwarz</PERSON> said it expects its <DATE>1990</DATE> sales to exceed 
<MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>, up from <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is at least the fifth sale of <ORGANIZATION>FAO Schwarz</ORGANIZATION> and the second to 
European owners since the firm's founding family sold it in <DATE>1963</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Morse is expected to step down as chairman. But <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> and his management team 
are to remain, <ORGANIZATION>KBB</ORGANIZATION> said. In an interview, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> refused to discuss terms of 
the sale. But, he said, "there would have been no reason to sell it if there 
wasn't a significant profit for the investors." 
</P>
<P>
Originally opened in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> in <DATE>1862</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>FAO Schwarz</ORGANIZATION>, on <LOCATION>Fifth Avenue</LOCATION>, was for 
decades best known for being the most prestigious toy store in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. It now 
also has a flagship store in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and 15 other outlets around the 
country, including one that opened less than two weeks ago in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> and 
one in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>South Coast Plaza</LOCATION>. Additional stores are expected to 
open in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and, eventually, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's growth stagnated in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, and its share of the toy retail 
market plummeted as it continued to concentrate on expensive luxury toys. 
Customers were intimidated by the high prices, and the toy market was 
increasingly dominated by mass retailers such as Toys R Us and discount outlets 
such as <ORGANIZATION>K mart Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But the group headed by <PERSON>Morse</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> investment banker, and <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, a 
Californian who is a former president of the <ORGANIZATION>Gemco</ORGANIZATION> retail chain, broadened <ORGANIZATION>FAO 
Schwarz</ORGANIZATION>'s inventory to include a wider selection of lower-priced items, 
redesigned the stores, re-established a mail order catalogue and moved the <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> store from its home of 50 years to roomier and more modern quarters in the 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> building on <LOCATION>Fifth Avenue</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The store's new home featured a one-minute shopping section -- where shoppers 
in a hurry could pick up already-wrapped gifts -- a hair salon for kids and 
plenty of display room for lower-priced, mass-market toys such as <ORGANIZATION>Barbie</ORGANIZATION> and GI 
<PERSON>Joe</PERSON>. There was room, as well, for <ORGANIZATION>FAO Schwarz</ORGANIZATION>'s traditional fare -- life-sized 
stuffed animals, <MONEY>$500</MONEY> rocking horses and toy sports cars that cost more than 
some real cars. The store also sought to provide an outlet for new, smaller 
entrepreneurial toy makers. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>KBB</ORGANIZATION>, a publicly traded company, had sales in <DATE>1989</DATE> of <MONEY>$1.67 billion</MONEY> and a profit 
of <MONEY>$43 million</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>KBB</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>FAO Schwarz</ORGANIZATION> is its first acquisition in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>. It owns several retail chains made up of over 1,200 stores in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, including the six-store upscale chain of De <ORGANIZATION>Bijenkorf</ORGANIZATION> 
department stores in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>M&amp;S Mode</ORGANIZATION>, a women's clothing retailer with 
more than 200 shops.

   Activists opposed to the sale of game
animals marched <DATE>Saturday</DATE> outside a supermarket where rattlesnake,
deer, and bear meat were being offered in a test-marketing study.
   But the <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> wholesaler who supplied the meats to the store
said they were healthful, none were from endangered species and he
didn't know ``what all the squawk is about.''
   About 20 sign-carrying protesters stood outside the Cub Foods
store on the city's west side, handed leaflets to passers-by, and
chanted, ``Don't shop Cub, give Big Bear a hug.''
   The chants referred to <ORGANIZATION>Big Bear</ORGANIZATION>, a rival grocery chain whose
slogan is ``Give' em a Big Bear hug.''
   ``What we want are the meats taken off the market,'' said <PERSON>Robin
Russell</PERSON>, director of Protect Our Earth's Treasures.
   ``What they're (Cub officials) trying to do is expand
exploitation of animals,'' he added. ``We want them to say the
market study is done and that's it.''
   <PERSON>Allan Roosz</PERSON>, meat department manager at the store, declined
comment. Telephone calls <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to Cub headquarters in
<LOCATION>Stillwater</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, were not answered.
   <PERSON>Terry Wilhite</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> meat merchandiser for the grocery chain,
said the products came from <ORGANIZATION>Czimer Foods</ORGANIZATION>, a distributor in
<LOCATION>Lockport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. He said the market was the only Cub store in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>
offering such fare.
   The meats offered at <ORGANIZATION>Cub Foods</ORGANIZATION> ranged from deer at <MONEY>$7.99</MONEY> a
pound, to whole rattlesnake for <MONEY>$14.99</MONEY> each. Black bear shoulders
were priced at <MONEY>$9.99</MONEY> a pound.
   Columbus Zoo Director <PERSON>Jack Hannah</PERSON> had called the store to
complain about its sale of giraffe meat, <ORGANIZATION>The Columbus Dispatch</ORGANIZATION>
reported <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Cub Foods quit selling African game after
receiving complaints about such sales.
   <PERSON>Rudy Czimer</PERSON>, vice president and manager of wholesaling for
<ORGANIZATION>Czimer Foods</ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that protests
were nothing new to the family business his father began in <DATE>1914</DATE>.
   ``This has been going on for years ... I get letters all the
time,'' <PERSON>Czimer</PERSON> said. ``I don't know what all the squawk is about.
   ``The animals are raised on game farms, and there's not anything
on the endangered or protected (species) lists. The government
watches us on that,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION>Czimer Foods</ORGANIZATION> does not
raise the animals, but purchases them from ranches all over the
nation.

<HEAD>Kenya Burns $3 Million in Elephant Tusks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Setting fire to 2,500 ivory tusks worth <MONEY>$3
million</MONEY>, President <PERSON>Daniel arap Moi</PERSON> said he wanted to draw attention
to a continent-wide slaughter that threatens to wipe out <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s
elephant in 10 years.
   Hundreds of government officials, diplomats, journalists and
conservationists watched <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as Moi put a torch to the 12 tons
ivory atop a 20-foot pile of wood.
   The pyre was placed on a hill in <LOCATION>Nairobi National Park</LOCATION>
overlooking the vast <LOCATION>Athi Plains</LOCATION> that are home to gazelle, rhino,
giraffe, zebra, lions and other wild animals.
   ``Actions speak louder than words,'' <PERSON>Moi</PERSON> said. ``<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> cannot
appeal to the world to stop buying ivory if at the same time we are
selling the very same commodity.''
   Conservationists and many nations have called for a worldwide ban
on the ivory trade.
   <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s elephant population has fallen from 65,000 in the l970s
to about l7,000. In all of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, poaching has cut the elephant
population from an estimated 1.5 million in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> to fewer than
700,000 today.
   <PERSON>Iain Douglas-Hamilton</PERSON>, an elephant expert, said the burn was
``immensely important'' and he hoped it would help make people in
ivory consuming nations aware that if they ``buy, wear or sell
ivory, they're helping kill elephants.''
   Moi said he also will destroy 270 rhino horns <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> confiscated
from poachers, but did not say when.
   Despite a rhino horn trading ban, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s rhino population has
dwindled from 65,000 in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> to an estimated 4,000.
   Conservationists say the ban has failed because the horn is still
highly prized in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, where it is sold in powdered form as
an aphrodisiac.
   Moi said his government will continue to destroy all ivory
confiscated within its borders.
   ``I hope our action will help persuade others to appreciate the
urgent need to take drastic steps to halt the wanton slaughter of
elephants by declining to trade in ivory and its products both
within <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and beyond,'' <PERSON>Moi</PERSON> said.
   The ivory burned <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> represented four years' worth of tusks
confiscated from poachers.
   More than 600 gallons of gasoline fueled the fire, since ivory
only burns under intense heat. The top half of the pyre was
blackened after about an hour.
   <PERSON>Richard Leakey</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s director of wildlife, said the government
has increased the number of game patrols and he said poaching has
fallen drastically in the past two months.
   About 300 elephants were killed in the <DATE>first five months of 1989</DATE>.
   Ivory fetches <MONEY>$109</MONEY> to <MONEY>$154</MONEY> a pound on the world market, with the
higher prices going for the increasingly rare larger tusks. An
average tusk weighs nearly 11 pounds, down from nearly 22 pounds a
decade ago.
   <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> has joined a growing list of countries that support a
worldwide ban on the ivory trade. Conservationists say the ban would
likely work because the elephant tusk is used only for decorative
purposes.
   The EEC, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> buy up to <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of
ivory on world markets. But in <DATE>June</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the
12-nation <ORGANIZATION>European Economic Community</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>
imposed bans on ivory imports.
   The <LOCATION>Lausanne</LOCATION>, Switzerland-based 102-nation Convention on
<ORGANIZATION>International Trade</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Endangered Species</ORGANIZATION> will meet in <DATE>October</DATE> to
consider a worldwide ban.
   <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> oppose the ban. They say they
have successfully protected their elephants while herds in other
African nations have declined.
