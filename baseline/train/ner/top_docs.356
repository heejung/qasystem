<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE BISCOTTI from my youth were lemon yellow, tasted mostly of anise and were
as hard as a rock. You had to dunk those babies in coffee or your molars would
come unhinged. Now, biscotti are pretty sophisticated, especially in the Bay
Area where they're almost required at any place that sells cappuccino.;   
Recently I tried several varieties of biscotti from Nonni's, a San Francisco
company. All were exceptional, and none needed softening in your favorite
beverage.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     You might be tempted to call the originali biscotti plain, but they're far
from it. Lots of flavor from ground almonds and walnuts, though they were a
trifle sweet. The company suggests trying them with espresso or red wine,
though I don't think I'd break out my best cabernets. Try a sweet wine, such
as the traditional Vin Santo.;    The cioccolati biscotti have a veneer of
chocolate on the side, which provides a nice contrast. Chocolate decadence
biscotti taste like very good chocolate chip cookies with a delightful
bittersweet chocolate undertone. My favorite is aptly named cioccolato
paradiso. These heavenly biscotti combine chocolate and almond cookies with
slabs of white chocolate.;    Incidentally, <ORGANIZATION>Nonni</ORGANIZATION>'s is so named because the
recipes come from company president <PERSON>Steve Sirianni</PERSON>'s grandmother. Nonna is
Italian for grandmother.;    An eight-ounce bag of Nonni's biscotti retails
for about <MONEY>$5.50</MONEY>. They're available at <ORGANIZATION>Williams-Sonoma</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION>'s, Cost Plus
Imports and at The Perfect Blend in <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;    Perhaps the best name in <LOCATION>Bay
Area</LOCATION> biscotti is La Tempesta. In <DATE>December</DATE>, the <LOCATION>South San Francisco</LOCATION> company
introduced a line of mini biscotti in three-ounce bags.;    Overall, I didn't
like them as much as <ORGANIZATION>Nonni's</ORGANIZATION>. My favorite were the <PERSON>Toscani</PERSON>. They have a nice,
toasty almond flavor and just the right crunch. Gianduia have toasted
hazelnuts with a squiggle of milk chocolate. I thought the mezz amore -- made
with almonds and bittersweet chocolate -- were too hard and dry.;    La
Tempesta mini biscotti run about <MONEY>$2.75</MONEY> (<MONEY>$3.25</MONEY> for the mezz amore version that
is dipped in bittersweet chocolate). Available at <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>'s, at
<ORGANIZATION>Cosentino</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Zanotto</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, at <ORGANIZATION>Draeger</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION> and at the

<LEADPARA>  WHEN Mom told you to eat your vegetables, I have a feeling she didn't mean the
ones from Cocolat's garden. Delicious milk-chocolate carrots with shiny orange
skins come in cutesy wooden crates ($10.95 for 2.8 ounces). A bittersweet
chocolate pumpkin splits in half to reveal "seeds" of cocoa-dusted almonds
($13.95 for 4.5 ounces). Another peekaboo confection is the purple
foil-wrapped eggplant with milk and dark chocolate mini veggies ($13.95 for
4.5 ounces). And my favorite, two remarkably authentic-looking ears of corn
done in white and milk chocolate. The ears, wrapped in real corn husks, have a
slight crunch like Nestle's Crunch, but they're much better ($11.50 for three
ounces). Available at Cocolat stores throughout the Bay Area.;    With a name
like Food for the gods, it's logical the company should make a cookie dubbed
Zeus Supreme. More than just a cookie, as they say in their literature, it's
square and thick, like a brownie. But it tastes like a chocolate chip cookie
with dates and almonds mixed in. Very good. Other cookies include Apollo's
Gold (peanut butter, chocolate and walnuts) and Medusa's Stone (pecans,
coconut and chocolate). Cookies cost $8 and $8.50 a dozen. And Food for the
gods delivers. Call (408) 274-3857.  </LEADPARA>

<LEADPARA>  I DON'T use the term addictive too often, but Rippa Baci di Dama cookies fall
into that category. The only thing that keeps you from consuming mass
quantities in record time is that these cute numbers are individually wrapped
-- for your protection, you might say.;    The cookies (the name means lady's
kisses) look like miniature hamburger buns with a thin chocolate filling.
They're not cheap, but that's probably a good thing. Prices range from 40
cents to 75 cents for individual cookies and $8 to $10 for half-pound sacks.
Get them at the Gourmet Giraffe in Los Gatos, Caffe Classico in Campbell, The
Coffee Roasting Club in Morgan Hill and Gilroy, Continental Deli in Aptos and
La Villa, Villa Lanza and Marco's, all in San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (hbox);    The biscotti wars continue. After writing about biscotti a few
weeks ago, I've been flooded with biscotti from all over the <LOCATION>South Bay.</LOCATION>;   
<ORGANIZATION>Venice Biscotti</ORGANIZATION> are made in <LOCATION>Los Altos</LOCATION>. All three varieties have what I call a
good crunch factor -- crunchy enough to hold up under dunking, but not so hard
that you feel as if you were high tackled by <PERSON>Ronnie Lott.</PERSON>;    The amaretto
contain almonds and a subtle flavor of amaretto. Chocolate has that classic
veneer of chocolate on the side. Anisette has a depth charge anise flavor that
continued to mushroom long after I finished munching. I felt as if I had
swallowed a bottle of sambuca.;    <ORGANIZATION>Venice Biscotti</ORGANIZATION> are sold nationwide and are
available locally at <ORGANIZATION>Draeger</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Los Altos</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Whole Foods</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> and
Gene's <LOCATION>Quito Market</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Saratoga.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Sheila Weisberg</PERSON> makes low- and no-fat
biscotti in her <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> home. I liked the low-fat (no shortening but with
nuts or chocolate) better than the no-fat, which I found dry and hard. An
eight-ounce bag sells for <MONEY>$7</MONEY>, and you can mix flavors. No-fat comes in
cinnamon-spice, with and without raisins, vanilla, lemon and anisette. Low-fat
comes in chocolate-nut, orange-almond, chocolate dipped and chocolate
chocolate chip. If you live within a reasonable distance, <PERSON>Weisberg</PERSON> will
deliver. Call (408) 741-0232.;    Finally, (I hope) a <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> company called
Biscotti di Nonna, not to be confused with <ORGANIZATION>Nonni</ORGANIZATION>'s biscotti in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>,
sent me its biscotti. The plain has a hint of anise. It's very nutty and
slightly chewy, rather than crisp and dry. The chocolate-coated (on one side)
version is crisper and slightly dry. Have this one with a cappuccino and hold
the powdered cocoa.;    The only problem is that I lost the company's business
card and there is no listing for <ORGANIZATION>Biscotti di Nonna</ORGANIZATION> in the telephone directory.
So if you're still out there, <ORGANIZATION>Biscotti di Nonna</ORGANIZATION>, let us here from you.  </TEXT>

The best way to describe the Great Chocolate Cover-Up is with the words that 
appear on its two-tone pink label: "A scandalously delicious way to dip fruit, 
cookies, snacks . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It's a new product from <PERSON>Sara Brook Desserts</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>: chocolate coating in a 
jar. You soften the coating -- it comes in white and dark chocolate -- in the 
microwave oven and use it straight from the jar to paint fresh fruit, cookies, 
pretzels, dried apricots, nuts and whatever else you can think of. The Cover-Up 
can also serve as an ice cream sauce and as the dessert dip at a fondue party. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage is, you don't have to transfer it to a bowl or pot. That means 
your clean-up load is lessened by at least one bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover-Ups are available at <ORGANIZATION>Irvine Ranch Farmers Markets</ORGANIZATION> and at Pavilions 
markets in <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arcadia</LOCATION>. The suggested retail 
price is <MONEY>$3.50</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A romantic tin of chocolate-infused cookies could make a splendid Christmas 
gift. In gold trimmed with magenta and black, the container holds 10 ounces of 
Tuscan-style chocolate biscotti. To make sure you know these cookies are for 
dipping, the tin is adorned with an old-fashioned sketch of a child about to 
plunge one into a cup. 
</P>
<P>
Inside are three types of biscotti from <ORGANIZATION>La Tempesta Bakery Confections</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>South 
San Francisco</LOCATION>. They are cioccolotti, biscotti dipped in bittersweet chocolate; 
gianduia, hazelnut biscotti covered with milk chocolate mixed with hazelnut 
creme; and amore cioccolato, chocolate biscotti that contain both almonds and 
hazelnuts and are dipped in bittersweet chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested retail price is <MONEY>$15</MONEY>. Shops that stock the tin include <PERSON>Neiman 
Marcus</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION> Farms, <LOCATION>South Pasadena</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Montana Mercantile</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Fred 
Segal</PERSON> Espresso in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>; An Occasional Basket, <LOCATION>Woodland Hills</LOCATION>; the 
Social Graces, <PERSON>Van Nuys</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Village Kitchen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another candidate to assuage the craving for chocolate is Green Street 
Restaurant's AFCC. That's the staff code name for the <ORGANIZATION>Almost Flourless 
Chocolate Cake</ORGANIZATION>, an intense dessert that gives you two pounds of Belgian 
chocolate diluted with only two tablespoons of flour. It's <MONEY>$32</MONEY> and must be 
ordered a week in advance -- which may try the patience of some chocoholics. 
</P>
<P>
Other Green Street treats available by advance order include a 
chocolate-raspberry cake, <MONEY>$33</MONEY>; a Snicker layer cake, <MONEY>$35</MONEY>; key lime and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
cheesecakes for <MONEY>$29</MONEY> each; and a carrot cake for <MONEY>$35</MONEY>. The restaurant's popular 
zucchini bread is also for sale. The price is <MONEY>$4.25</MONEY> a loaf or <MONEY>$1</MONEY> for two 
slices.

<LEADPARA>  REMEMBER when the only ice cream novelties were ice cream sandwiches,
Creamsicles and drumsticks? Now, there are so many varieties even the sticks
are different. The sticks that Haagen-Dazs uses look like flattened water
wings.;    But there's nothing flat about the Haagen-Dazs Caramel Almond
Crunch Bar. This bar has rich vanilla ice cream wrapped around a layer of
caramel and covered with almond-studded milk chocolate. The chocolate in this
and all the Haagen-Dazs novelties is Callebaut Belgian chocolate.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Haagen-Dazs Peanut-Butter Crunch Bar combines chocolate, crushed
peanuts and a center section of peanut butter. The taste wasn't bad, but when
I bit into it, the center peanut butter cylinder flew in the other direction.;
   In case you missed your morning <PERSON>Rice Krispies</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Vanilla Crisp Crunch Bar</ORGANIZATION> has
crisped rice in its chocolate coating. This is one of those ideas that
probably sounded great when first conceived, but doesn't work, at least not
enough to make you run out and buy it.;    All the Haagen-Dazs crunch bars are
2.1 ounces and come in single or three-bar packs. Single bars cost about <MONEY>99
cents</MONEY>, three-packs about <MONEY>$2.59</MONEY>.;    If you want the taste of pure,
unadulterated chocolate (well, slightly adulterated anyway -- it has some
cream and egg in it), try Haagen-Dazs Fudge Bar Pops. Fudgy and delicious.
<ORGANIZATION>Orange &amp; Cream Bar Pops</ORGANIZATION> are a '90s version of the Creamsicle. In this
incarnation, eggy vanilla ice cream is covered with orange sorbet. The pops
are light and refreshing though not exactly low-calorie. Both pops come three
to a box (2.5 ounces each) and cost <MONEY>$2.59</MONEY>.;    Butterfinger, never one of my
favorite candy bars (I was an Almond Joy and a Mounds guy), has a new ice
cream bar. It has a nice, caramel crust that's not too sweet and a decent ice
cream center. But if you're squeamish, don't read the ingredient list.
Butterfinger Ice Cream Bars cost <MONEY>$2.79</MONEY> for a six-pack of 2.5-ounce bars.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle Crunch</ORGANIZATION> has two ice cream bars. Vanilla Crunch Lite (<MONEY>$2.49</MONEY> for six
2.5-ounce bars) is sweetened with <ORGANIZATION>NutraSweet</ORGANIZATION> and is <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> fat-free.
Unfortunately it's also <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> boring, and slightly crystalline to boot
(guess they didn't put enough stabilizers in). Chocolate Crunch (<MONEY>$2.69</MONEY> for six
three-ounce bars) not only has a richer, more genuine ice cream flavor, but
the outer coating is crisper and sweeter, much more like the <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Crunch</ORGANIZATION>
candy bar.;    The Champ (<MONEY>$3.09</MONEY> for three 4.2-ounce bars) was introduced last
year but I couldn't find it in the markets I checked. It's reminiscent of the
old-fashioned ice cream bars with two improvements. It has a darker, denser
chocolate coating and an inner layer of Spanish peanuts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   White chocolate will be the hot chocolate of the
'90s, food experts at a convention of chefs say. The drink of choice
at coffeehouses and ski lodges soon may be white chocolate
cappuccino.
   Europeans have enjoyed white chocolate for years, but the
confection has gone largely ignored in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Because
federal regulations forbid the term ``white chocolate,''
manufacturers were wary of marketing the candy. The success of
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s White Alpine candy bar, introduced in <DATE>1985</DATE>, has changed all
that.
   <PERSON>Marty Friedman</PERSON>, editor of the Florida-based New Product News,
named white chocolate as one of the top 15 new food trends during
this week's <ORGANIZATION>International Association of Food Professionals</ORGANIZATION>
convention.
   ``It's the last unexplored avenue in the chocolate world,'' said
<PERSON>Janice Wald Henderson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> editor of Chocolatier magazine and
author of a white chocolate cookbook. ``White chocolate was the last
stone unturned.''
   Henderson's cookbook contains recipes for white chocolate
waffles, white chocolate pound cake, white hot chocolate, white
chocolate bread pudding and white chocolate German cake.
   ``It's a big hit now,'' said <PERSON>Liz Echendia</PERSON>, co-publisher of The
Confectioner, a national trade publication. ``It's a new taste that
hasn't been around before.''
   White chocolate, introduced in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> after World War I,
comes from the cocoa bean and differs from milk chocolate and dark
chocolate only in that it lacks a liquid chocolate extract, the
substance that gives standard chocolate its ``bitter, sharper
flavor,'' according to chocolate experts.
   ``It has many of the flavor notes of milk chocolate but it has a
lighter, cleaner taste,'' said <PERSON>Carl Anderson</PERSON>, a vice president of
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>White Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, where the 40-cent <ORGANIZATION>Alpine
White</ORGANIZATION> with Almonds bar has become one of the top-selling 25 candy
bars in the country.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> circumvented the white chocolate definition problem by
describing the contents of the bar as ``what Europeans call `white
chocolate''' on the back of the label. Otherwise, it's referred to
only as ``Alpine White.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if deep down inside, people think it
has less calories than other chocolate,'' said <PERSON>Friedman</PERSON>. ``It looks
so pristine and white. It's one of the biggest successes in the
candy world.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> also sells white chocolate chips, white chocolate-coated
ice cream bars and bulk white chocolate for individual consumers and
candy manufacturers.
   Anderson attributed the popularity of white chocolate to a
general trend among consumers for ``lighter food.''
   ``You're seeing a move away from harder brown liquors to rum and
vodka, you'll be seeing lighter soft drinks, people are eating more
fish and chicken than beef,'' he said. ``We have some research
showing that thewhite color and cleaner taste is appealing.''
   <PERSON>Henderson</PERSON> also has a theory about why people like white chocolate.
   ``I love the texture, it's exceptionally creamy and rich,'' she
said. ``That's what good desserts are all about. Otherwise, eat an
apple.''

<LEADPARA>  IN THE past few weeks, Dreyer's has introduced 19 new frozen desserts in four
categories. I couldn't taste them all, but here are my notes on some of them.;
   Nonfat Frozen Yogurt Inspirations is a completely new line and an
impressive alternative to ice cream, with only 70 calories for a three-ounce
portion. The mixed berry in particular has a lively berry flavor that really
jumps out at you, with bits of raspberry, blueberry and blackberry. Cherry is
creamy with a clean cherry taste. And vanilla (80 calories) has a nice, subtle
vanilla flavor and lush texture. Other flavors include chocolate, mocha,
strawberry and raspberry.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DREYER'S OFFERS NEW LOW-CAL TREATS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Tasting Notes
Food Editor Sam Gugino is available for questions from 4 to 6 p.m. Wednesdays
at 920-5539. Or you can write to him at the San Jose Mercury News, 750 Ridder
Park Drive, San Jose 95190.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Moving up the fat ladder, low-fat Frozen Yogurt Inspirations are 96-percent
fat-free. <ORGANIZATION>Heath Bar</ORGANIZATION> is so delicious I had to check the nutrition label twice.
Yes, only 100 calories for a 3.5 ounce serving. It's incredibly rich and just
sweet enough with crunchy caramel candy bar nubbins strewn throughout.
Boysenberry has a pronounced berry flavor, a creamy texture and no artificial
aftertaste whatsoever. Mocha Fudge has more fudge than mocha, but the fudgy
chocolate is so rich and genuine, who cares? The other new low-fat yogurt
flavor is chocolate sundae (chocolate with marshmallow creme swirls).;   
Among the premium ice creams, <PERSON>Dreyer</PERSON>'s peanut butter cup is a real winner, a
wonderful balance of fudge and peanut butter cascading through rich vanilla.
Just in time for <DATE>summer</DATE> campfires comes S'Mores, an ingenious blend of
chocolate, nuggets of chocolate-covered grahams and marshmallows. Not bad,
though the marshmallows sort of get lost.;    <ORGANIZATION>White Summit</ORGANIZATION> combines chocolate
ice cream with bits of <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s Alpine white chocolate. A good idea in theory,
but the delicate white chocolate is overwhelmed. Likewise in the limited
edition (available only through <DATE>June</DATE>) Chocolate Fudge Sundae; walnuts
overpower the chocolate.;    <ORGANIZATION>Strawberry Revelations</ORGANIZATION> is a pleasant vanilla ice
cream with ribbons of strawberry syrup through it. The syrup is good (<PERSON>Dreyer</PERSON>'s
uses Smuckers), but I didn't get the sensation of fresh berries. You'd do just
as well with the Grand Light version, and save some calories, since this line
is <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT> fat-free and has only 100 calories and four grams of fat in a
four-ounce portion.;    S'Mores also comes in a Grand Light version along with
chocolate almond fudge and fudgescotch swirl.;    <PERSON>Dreyer</PERSON>'s frozen desserts are
available at Lucky's, <LOCATION>Nob Hill</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Petrini</PERSON>'s stores. Prices range from about
<MONEY>$4.29</MONEY> to <MONEY>$4.89</MONEY> for a half gallon.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; On <DATE>Oct. 11</DATE>, <PERSON>Dreyer</PERSON>'s
will conduct its fifth annual contest for "Assistant Ice Cream Tasters." Five
children (under 12) and 20 adults from around the country will be selected for
a one-day tasting binge at a <PERSON>Dreyer</PERSON>'s ice cream factory. The results of the
winners' tasting will help to determine the company's new flavors for <DATE>1992</DATE>. If
you'd like to participate, submit an essay of 150 words or less on why you
would make a "grand" ice cream taster. Send entries to: Assistant Ice Cream
Taster, <PERSON>Dreyer</PERSON>'s Grand Ice Cream, <ORGANIZATION>5929 College Ave.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> 94618. Entries
must be received by <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> and will be judged on creativity.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IT'S 2 p.m. The soup on the cafeteria steam table is crusted over and the
salad bar looks as if it's been sitting in the sun too long. What's quick,
nutritious and good tasting for lunch?;    Fantastic Foods of Novato has six

<TEXT>     (box) <PERSON>Splittin</PERSON>' Peas is so rich and creamy it's hard to believe it has no
meat stock or dairy products and no fat -- technically, it has less than one
gram, which qualifies as "fat-free." A 10-ounce serving (when water is added)
has only 165 calories.;    (box) All-O-Round Spaghetti features whole-wheat
noodle rings in what is described as a, "zesty tomato sauce." I'd amend that
to say, "reasonably satisfying." This one has 211 calories and two grams of
fat.;    (box) Whole-Wheat Alphabet Soup has a delicious miso broth with a
slight oniony undertone. It has 150 calories and less than one gram of fat.;  
 (box) <PERSON>Leapin</PERSON>' Lentils Over Couscous (all the containers are decorated with
some variation on dancing vegetables) is a hearty number with loads of fiber
and a pleasant tomato flavor. This fat-free meal has 180 calories.;    (box)
The only disappointment was Cha-Cha Chili (208 calories, 2 grams of fat) which
was dull and pasty.;    (box) <PERSON>Jumpin</PERSON>' Black Beans is a fat-free soup that I
didn't try.;    All these lunch alternatives cost about <MONEY>$1.39</MONEY> and are
available at stores such as Bread of Life in <LOCATION>Campbell</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Whole Foods Market</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bumble Bee Health Foods</ORGANIZATION> in Mountain View.;    (hbox);    If you
want to splurge a little -- in calories and price -- I suggest one of three
new individual quiches from <ORGANIZATION>Nancy's Specialty Foods</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern</ORGANIZATION> has an
unmistakable regional flavor, courtesy mostly of green chilies and
fire-roasted peppers. Spring Vegetable is a mild blend of several vegetables
with three cheeses, <ORGANIZATION>Cheddar</ORGANIZATION>, mozzarella and Parmesan. My favorite is the
Italian, with robust roasted pepper, vegetable and cheese flavors.;    These
quiches, and three others I tasted <DATE>several months ago</DATE>, are well-made with
tender crusts and all-natural ingredients. They cook up in a jiffy in the
microwave oven and smell terrific while they do. They cost from <MONEY>$1.99</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY>
and are available in the supermarket frozen food section.;    (hbox);    For
dessert, or maybe with that afternoon coffee, try three new biscotti from <ORGANIZATION>Cafe
Brio</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Redwood City</LOCATION>. Though they are not classical in shape and taste more
like cookies than biscotti, they're still worth trying. Almond Spice has a
subtle gingersnap flavor. Chocolate Chip Espresso tastes like a very good
chocolate-chip cookie. Double Chocolate is for those who can't get enough
chocolate from chocolate chips alone. All the biscotti have a good crunch
factor -- hard enough to hold up under dunking but not so hard that they
loosen bridgework. An eight-ounce bag costs about <MONEY>$5</MONEY> and is available at Whole
Foods Market and <LOCATION>Cafe Verona</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Penguin</ORGANIZATION>'s Place Frozen Yogurt in
the <LOCATION>Vallco Fashion Park</LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Draeger</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Los Altos</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  FOR THOSE of you for whom Valentine's Day is a chocolate feast, check out
Cocolat. Recently, I tried a few of Cocolat's confections. I was bowled over
by the "eat-me-up" chocolate heart box. It's milk chocolate wrapped in
burgundy foil with a cute bow. But the kicker is the filling -- bittersweet
chocolate balls filled with the best vanilla caramel you ever tasted. It's
worth the $14.95 price tag.;    Other goodies include milk-chocolate filled
apples ($11.95), chocolate heart pendants ($10.95) and hand-crafted,
truffle-filled red velvet boxes ($25). There are several Cocolat stores in the
Bay Area including one at the Stanford Shopping Center, (415) 328-5548.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (hbox);    Apple-cinnamon flavors don't usually do much for me, but I liked
the new Quaker Oats apple cinnamon rice cakes. Though sugar-free, there is a
touch of sweetness from something called "natural apple cinnamon flavor." And
at only 40 calories each, these rice cakes make great snacks. A 4.9-ounce
package sells for about <MONEY>$1.79</MONEY>.; (hbox);    Yoplait has introduced pudding made
with yogurt. This is an interesting switch because in the past companies like
Yoplait have taken yogurt, essentially a health food in its pure form, and
mucked it up with sugary preserves. Now they're taking pudding and supposedly
making it more healthful by adding yogurt.;    The vanilla pudding has a
yogurt texture and tastes like yogurt mixed with pudding. It's not as cloying
as some puddings. The chocolate tastes less like yogurt and more like real,
almost scratch, chocolate pudding. A multi-pack of four 4-ounce packs retails
for about <MONEY>$1.89</MONEY>.;    On the other hand, new Yoplait light yogurts are awful.
Sweetened with <ORGANIZATION>Nutrasweet</ORGANIZATION>, they have only 60 calories per 4-ounce container,
about half of regular Yoplait yogurt. But the blueberry I tasted had only the
faintest blueberry flavor and didn't taste like yogurt at all, which for some
people is a good thing, I suppose. Strawberry-banana was even worse. It
reminded me of the penny candy I used to eat as a kid.; (hbox);    A while
back I slammed Jack-In-The-Box for its feeble attempt at a cheesesteak
sandwich. Now it's time to bestow kudos for its chicken fajita pita -- only
300 calories if you don't load up on the guacamole. The sandwich is made of
grilled chicken, grilled onions, shredded American cheese, tomatoes and leaf
lettuce, all stuffed into a pita pocket. It's available after <TIME>10:30 a.m.</TIME> and
costs <MONEY>$2.69</MONEY>.; (hbox);    If you're wondering where to get that Spam sushi
<PERSON>Joyce Gemperlein</PERSON> mentioned last week, it's available at Bento Xpress, 211
<ORGANIZATION>Jackson St.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, and 23 <ORGANIZATION>N. Milpitas Blvd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>. A box of four sushi
and some marinated bean sprouts costs <MONEY>$3</MONEY>. Hey, don't knock it until you've
tried it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Everybody knows chocolate milk comes from brown cows. 
But few people know what happens when cows eat chocolate candy bars. 

   Some farmers in the <LOCATION>Middle Atlantic</LOCATION> states have discovered that several sweet things happen. 
Feed bills go down. 
The milk's butterfat content goes up -- and the milk fetches a higher price. 

   That's because milk prices are based on butterfat content. 
The standard for whole milk is <PERCENT>3.5%</PERCENT> butterfat. 
For every tenth of a percentage point over that level, a farmer can make an extra <MONEY>$1.28</MONEY> per 100 gallons. 

   <PERSON>William Flickinger</PERSON>, a livestock nutritionist in <LOCATION>Dover</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, tells the 60 dairy farmers he advises -- from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> -- to mix chocolate with the ration of hay, soybeans, alfalfa and grains their herds consume. 
On those farms, the average cow eats four to eight pounds of chocolate a day -- about a tenth of its total diet. 

   "They love it," says <PERSON>Ralph McGregor</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Dover</LOCATION> farmer who follows the regimen. 

   For their chocolate supply, <PERSON>Mr. McGregor</PERSON> and the others rely on the salvage center at <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hershey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, where damaged KitKats, <PERSON>Reese</PERSON>'s Pieces and the like pile up by the ton. 

   The price is right. 
At about <MONEY>$60</MONEY> a ton, damaged chocolate is a cheaper source of food and energy for cows than corn, which runs <MONEY>$85</MONEY> a ton. 
Besides, nutritionists say a candy bar, loaded with carbohydrates, sugar and fat, has about twice the energy of an ear of corn. 
And cows need plenty of energy to produce milk. 

   Each month <PERSON>Stephen Mason</PERSON> travels 120 miles from his farm in <LOCATION>Chester County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, to pick up 15 tons of reject chocolate. 
He figures adding chocolate to his cows' diet has raised the fat content of their milk to <PERCENT>3.9%</PERCENT>, so he pockets an extra <MONEY>$5.12</MONEY> for every 100 gallons. 

   Chocolate doesn't change the cows' behavior, says <PERSON>Mr. Flickinger</PERSON>, and it doesn't make them gain weight. 
Rather, the nourishment is milked out of them. 

   But the cows don't show much restraint when there's chocolate around. 
"If you put a pile of candy bars out in a pasture," <PERSON>Mr. Flickinger</PERSON> says, "they'd go eat themselves to death." 

   Still, he sees no immediate danger of chocoholic herds. 
"Hershey can't afford to make enough mistakes to keep all the dairymen in the North on candy."

<LEADPARA>  COOKIES 'n cream. Sometimes we like 'em together, sometimes apart.;   Healthy
Choice has a new line of 98 percent fat-free ice creams (technically called
frozen dairy desserts). I was impressed with the three I sampled. Vanilla (120
calories, two grams of fat per four-ounce serving) is rich and creamy with
good vanilla flavor. Strawberry (120 calories, two grams of fat) has a nice
jammy taste. RockyRoad  (140 calories, one gram of fat) is a good version of
this favorite with rich chocolate flavors and pleasant nutty and marshmallow
accents. Other flavors include Neapolitan, chocolate, praline &amp; caramel,
old-fashioned vanilla, wild berry swirl, Bordeaux cherry and cookies 'n cream.
About $2.79 for a quart, $4.19 for a half gallon.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Wholesome Choice is a new line of low-fat cookies from <ORGANIZATION>Pepperidge Farm</ORGANIZATION>
(<MONEY>$1.79</MONEY> for 12 cookies). Each cookie has two grams of fat or less and no
tropical oils. Raspberry Tart was my favorite of five sampled (a sixth, <ORGANIZATION>Apple
Oatmeal</ORGANIZATION>, wasn't available). It reminds me of a linzer cookie, crisp with a
not-too-sweet jam center and a light blanket of powdered sugar. Chewy, fruity
<ORGANIZATION>Cranberry Honey</ORGANIZATION> was my second favorite. I can do without Date Walnut, Oatmeal
Raisin and especially Carrot Walnut, which has a raw-dough taste.;   But if
you really like the taste of raw dough, try <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON>'s Chocolate Chip
Cookie Dough Ice Cream (<MONEY>$2.59</MONEY> a pint). Yes, vanilla ice cream with real raw
cookie dough including sugar granules that aren't fully incorporated. My wife,
a dough freak from way back, had only one complaint. "Not enough dough.";  
<ORGANIZATION>Fig Newtons</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s third most popular cookie, is celebrating it's 100th
birthday this year. It's been a long time since Mom popped a few in my lunch
box. So imagine my surprise when I found out that <ORGANIZATION>Fig Newtons</ORGANIZATION> aren't Fig
Newtons any more. They're just Newtons. That's because Newtons now come in
strawberry, raspberry and apple flavors. Both the strawberry and raspberry are
too sweet for me (restaurant critic <PERSON>David L. Beck</PERSON> says he freezes them to cut
the sweetness). Apple is OK. But if you're going to eat a <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>, which, let's
face it, is a pretty dowdy cookie, you might as well go for the original.;  
You can make a different kind of cookies 'n cream by mixing cut-up Newtons
into vanilla ice cream.; FIG NEWTON ICE CREAM; 2 eggs; 2/3 cup sugar; 1 3/4
cups milk; 2 cups cream; 2 teaspoons vanilla; 12 <LOCATION>Fig Newtons</LOCATION>, cut up into
bite-size pieces;  Beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until thick and
cream-colored. Add milk, cream and vanilla. Mix well. Fold in <LOCATION>Fig Newtons</LOCATION>.
Pour into hand-cranked ice cream maker such as <ORGANIZATION>Donvier</ORGANIZATION>. Follow manufacturer's
directions. Or, pour into shallow pan and freeze. Serves 4.  </TEXT>

   Detroiters upset over a threatened corporate collapse are hitting the sauce -- the chocolate sauce, that is. 

   With local newspapers bannering the possible shutdown by next month of <ORGANIZATION>Fred Sanders Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a 112-year-old area confectioner renowned for its candies, baked goods, ice cream and dessert sauces, loyal chocoholics are jamming many of the 21 Sanders stores still open. 

   <PERSON>Colleen Shaughnessy</PERSON>, a secretary at a local insurance company, needed three trips to pick up a trio of double-chocolate layer cakes, six almond tea cakes, five pounds of chocolate-covered raisins, 11 large cans of milk chocolate sauce and a 20-ounce jar of bittersweet chocolate sauce. 
Although she promptly air-expressed part of the hoard to an executive who had moved to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, she says she's keeping three cans of sauce "here at my desk for future emergencies." 

   The toppings are causing the greatest hysteria. 
Sales have been so brisk that the company adopted a two-container limit. 
But this didn't daunt customers at the downtown <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> store who, during a single lunch hour last week, grabbed up more than three dozen jars and cans of butterscotch and chocolate sauces (in regular, milk, bittersweet and swiss varieties). 

   "I take over a lot of troubled companies," says <PERSON>Jay Alix</PERSON>, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. 
"This is the first time I've ever seen so much consumer devotion to the product." 
<PERSON>Mr. Alix</PERSON> adds that <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> has had calls from people as far away as <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> "who say, 'I gotta have that fudge sauce.'" 

   Among the anxious are ex-Detroiters <PERSON>Dave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Lindsay</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, who ordered one case of sauce and may go for another. 
"The only thing I regret is I can't get their vanilla ice cream," <PERSON>Mrs. Lindsay</PERSON> says. 
"That'd be tough to ship." 

   For some fans, whose desperation is as emotional as it is gastronomic, the sauce is like <ORGANIZATION>Proust</ORGANIZATION>'s madeleine. 
"It's my youth," sighs <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> native <PERSON>Henry Geller</PERSON>, now a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, lawyer, who grabbed an extra jar on a recent visit. 
"I'm addicted to it because it brings back memories of what I did when I was growing up." 

   Such dedication might not save the business. 
Long plagued by financial and managerial problems, it is facing bankruptcy for the second time in eight years. 
<PERSON>Mr. Alix</PERSON> says these travails have made it hard to find funding for a bailout. 
"People think this is the best fudge sauce in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>," he notes, "but the banks don't think this is the best deal in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>."

<LEADPARA>  ABOUT a quarter of the way through our tour of the Hershey's chocolate factory
in Oakdale, the 3-year-old behind me had a question. Her face pressed up
against the glass that separates the tourists from the vats of chocolate, she
tugged at her mother's shorts and whispered urgently, "How do we get in
there?";    It was the question on all of our minds. And we hadn't even seen
the room where they package the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups yet.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Road Trip  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The walking tour through the <LOCATION>Hershey</LOCATION>'s plant is enough to drive a normally
docile person to extremes. By the time the tour guide ushers you past the last
pink conveyor belt bearing <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s Kisses to destinations in 13 Western
states, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, you want to take a mallet to the windows,
tackle the guy who watches over the chocolate-chip machine and position your
mouth at the spot where the newly formed chips tumble onto the line leading to
the bagging machine.;    Tours sell chocolate;  <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s knows this. That's
why it still conducts free tours -- in an age when most manufacturers, faced
with increased liability insurance costs, live in fear that some oaf might get
his shirttail caught in the candy conveyor and sue them for every Kit Kat bar
they've got.;    <ORGANIZATION>Not Hershey's</ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION>Oakdale</LOCATION> plant, in the <LOCATION>San Joaquin Valley</LOCATION>
just off Highway 120 (better known as the Road to Yosemite), herds more than
100,000 people through on tours every year.;    The air-conditioned visitors'
center -- where the wait for a tour can be up to an hour at the height of the
<DATE>summer</DATE> season -- is the place to start. Besides the usual <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s souvenirs
(cups, kites, shoelaces, T-shirts, baseball caps, etc., all with the logo),
there's an astounding display of candy bars -- every type <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s makes, and
in bulk.;    All of this really primes you for the tour -- and makes it even
more difficult to handle being separated by safety glass from the action in
the chocolate factory. There you are, so close to the department where rows of
vats -- each containing 1,000 pounds of liquid chocolate -- are stirred by
mechanical arms. And yet you are so very far away.;    Still, it's quite a
sight for a true chocolate lover. Near the end of the half-hour tour, our
group trooped upstairs to a viewing area from which we could see, all at once:
1) Kisses being wrapped and weighed, 2) <PERSON>Reese</PERSON>'s Peanut Butter Cups coming down
the assembly line and 3) Milk Chocolate with Almonds bars (both large and
giant-size) coming out of the chocolate cooling tunnel.;    At this point, a
clump of mature tourists was contemplating leaving retirement for a chance to
work in the factory. Children were hurling themselves against the glass.
Several young women were about to crack emotionally.;    Return to safety;  We
got back on the bus and headed toward the relative safety of the visitors'
center. As we piled off, our tour guide handed us a coupon good for a free
candy bar, and a stampede toward the bins ensued. The 3-year-old behind me
chose a bag of milk chocolate Kisses.;  DETAILS; Tours of <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Chocolate
USA</ORGANIZATION> are given from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE>. The visitors'
center, 120 <LOCATION>S. Sierra Ave.</LOCATION>, is open <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5:30 p.m. Monday-Friday and
10 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>4:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. <LOCATION>Oakdale</LOCATION> is about 2 1/2 hours from <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, on
Highway 120. To get to the visitors' center, go straight through the only
stoplight in town, on to <LOCATION>South Yosemite Avenue</LOCATION>. Turn left on East G Street;
make an immediate right into the parking lot. Information: (209) 848-5100.  </TEXT>

   A department store is offering Japanese Cupids the
ultimate arrow this <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day _ a <MONEY>$7,700</MONEY>, 10{-ounce heart of
pure gold engraved with the sender's message.
   Two of the palm-sized hearts have been sold so far, one to a
devoted husband seeking a special gift for his wife's <DATE>77th birthday</DATE>
and the second to a bank, said <ORGANIZATION>Hanshin Department Store</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>Toru Imamura</PERSON>.
   More cost-conscious schoolgirls and secretaries choose from a
wide array of fancy chocolates and novelty gifts.
   Besides the old standbys _ chocolate hearts with long ribbons
and miniature chocolate whiskey bottles _ this year's items have a
decidedly domestic flavor. ``Sir Dean'' chocolate fish come paired
in a sardine tin with rollback top.
   Flip up the lid to another can of chocolates and you find
chocolate bandages in familiar red, white and blue wrappers with
the warning, ``This chocolate is not medicated sweets.''
   ``Baby Choco'' is softly nestled in a mini-package of disposable
diapers with a smiling tot on the front.
   For the objects of this sweet attention and invention, all is
not a bed of roses. Obligatory chocolates given to male bosses and
colleagues outnumber those of romantic intent, spurring receiving
males to compete in an annual popularity contest.
   The possible embarrassment of being giftless at the end of the
day is enough to keep some men home from work, according to a
<ORGANIZATION>Daimaru Department Store</ORGANIZATION> survey of 400 men aged 20 to 30.
   Less drastic ways of avoiding embarrassment are broad hints,
extra nice behavior or even buying one's own chocolates for
prominent display. A few men console themselves by saying that
<ORGANIZATION>Valentine's Day</ORGANIZATION> is a foreign holiday with a short postwar history.
   Chances are good that generosity on <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day will be
returned on <DATE>March 14</DATE>, called ``White Day'' by Japanese candy makers
who urge men to give their favorite women hard candies.

<TEXT>     Tangerine juice isn't cheap -- about <MONEY>$1.99</MONEY> a pint, <MONEY>$3.59</MONEY> a quart and <MONEY>$5.99</MONEY>
a half gallon. But it's a nice, seasonal treat, especially if you're nursing a
nasty head cold.; (hbox);   I don't normally buy canned coffees from
supermarkets because I find them either harsh or insipid. An exception is Le
Grand Cafe by <ORGANIZATION>Melitta</ORGANIZATION> (<MONEY>$3.59</MONEY> for an 11.5-ounce can). In addition to having
some heft from <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> Arabica beans (most mass-produced coffees use
cheaper robusta beans), Le Grand Cafe is one of the few canned coffees that
uses an extra-fine grind. That draws out the maximum flavor from the coffee
made with a drip method.; (hbox);   Some fresh-baked biscuits with your coffee
and juice? That little doughboy from <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> has churned out a new line of
biscuits and twists called <ORGANIZATION>Hearty Grains</ORGANIZATION>. The company makes a big deal about
how these refrigerated, ready-to-eat items, "provide whole grain taste and
crunchy texture." But the first ingredient in each of the four products is
bleached enriched flour. So much for whole grains.;   On the plus side, all
four have no cholesterol and are low in fat -- two grams per serving. All
except Oatmeal Raisin Biscuits (90 calories) have 80 calories per serving.;  
As for taste, <ORGANIZATION>Cracked Wheat &amp; Honey Twists and Country Oatmeal Twists</ORGANIZATION> (both
<MONEY>$1.89</MONEY> for 10 twists) fall somewhere between rolls and soft bread sticks. I
preferred the latter for its nuttier flavor. Better than the twists are
Oatmeal Raisin Biscuits and Multi-Grain Biscuits (both <MONEY>$1.19</MONEY> for eight
biscuits). I liked the Multi-Grain better. Must have been that "whole grain
taste.";   Also new from <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> are Oven Lovin' Cookies (<MONEY>$2.99</MONEY>). None are
going to rival your family favorites, but they might be a decent alternative
if, in the holiday hubbub, you don't have time to make cookies from scratch.
Chocolate Chip uses <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s semi-sweet chocolate chips. Candy Cookies use
<PERSON>Brach</PERSON>'s candies and aren't as sweet as you might think. Also available are
cookies made with <PERSON>Reese</PERSON>'s pieces.;   The ready-to-bake dough comes in
refrigerated 18-ounce resealable tubs. The yield is listed as 30 to 36
cookies, but those cookies are awfully small.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  SPRITZ BUTTER COOKIES; 1/2 cup blanched sliced almonds (1.5 ounces); 3/4 cup
sugar; 1 cup unsalted butter; 1 large egg; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract; 1
teaspoon almond extract; 2 cups bleached all-purpose flour; Dash salt; Glace
cherries, sugar sprinkles or dragees (see note);  Place 2 oven racks in upper
and lower thirds of oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.;   Place almonds on
cookie sheet and bake them, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes or until
lightly browned. Cool completely.;   Food processor method: Process almonds
and sugar in food processor until they are ground powder-fine. Cut butter into
a few pieces and add them with motor running. Process until smooth and creamy.
Add egg and extracts and process until incorporated, scraping sides of bowl.
Add flour and salt and pulse just until blended.;   <ORGANIZATION>Electric</ORGANIZATION> mixer method:
Soften butter. Grate almonds powder fine. Cream together sugar and butter in
mixing bowl until fluffy. Add egg and extracts and beat until blended. On
lower speed, gradually add flour, salt and grated almonds and mix until
incorporated.;   For both methods: As soon as dough is prepared, scoop it into
large pastry bag, fitted with number 6 or 7 (about 1/2-inch diameter) large
star pastry tube, or a cookie press and pipe rosettes or stars about 1 3/4
inches in diameter onto ungreased cookie sheets, 2 inches apart.;   For best
shape, hold bag or press so that tube is straight up with toothed edge just
barely touching cookie sheet. Squeeze or press firmly without moving it until
shape is as wide as you desire. Stop pressure completely and push tube down
slightly. Lift tube straight up and away. If dough is too soft and impressions
indistinct, chill dough briefly in bag or press. Decorate with glace cherries,
sugar sprinkles or dragees.;   Bake 10 to 12 minutes, depending on size or
until pale golden. For even baking, rotate cookie sheets from top to bottom
and front to back halfway through baking period. Use small-angled metal
spatula or pancake turner to transfer cookies to wire racks to cool
completely.;   Store cookies in airtight container at room temperature or in
refrigerator or freezer. Cookies will keep 1 month at room temperature,
several months frozen. Makes about 3 1/2 dozen 2-inch cookies.;   Note:
Dragees are hard candies used to decorate baked goods.-- -- From "Rose's
Christmas; Cookies" by Rose Levy; <PERSON>Beranbaum</PERSON> (<PERSON>Morrow</PERSON>).; See SPRITZ , Next Card;
(box) SPRITZ; from Previous Card; SNOWMAN COOKIES; 3 1/2  cups all-purpose

teaspoon almond extract; Cinnamon red hots for buttons, see note; Mini
chocolate chips for eyes; <ORGANIZATION>Reese</ORGANIZATION>'s Peanut Butter cups, cut in half, for hats;
Chocolate frosting to hold hats in place; Green frosting for scarf;  Stir
together the flour and baking powder; set aside. Beat together butter and
cream cheese; add sugar and beat until fluffy. Add egg, vanilla and almond
extract; beat well. Add flour mixture and beat again.;   Begin shaping balls,
shaping a larger ball for the snowman's body and a smaller one for his head.
Flatten slightly when placing on ungreased baking sheet. The balls should
touch each other so that the snowman holds together after baking. Put two red
hots on the larger ball for buttons and two mini chips on the smaller one for
eyes. Bake at 325 degrees about 18 minutes, until set but not brown. Cool.;  
Finish by adding hat -- peanut butter cup half bottom-up held on with
chocolate frosting -- and green frosting scarf piped in place. Makes about 24
large cookies.;   Note: Cinnamon red hots are small red candies slightly
harder than jelly beans, available in the baking section of supermarkets.;
DATE BARS; 1 1/2 cups chopped pitted dates; 1 cup orange juice; 1/4 cup sugar;
Salt; 1/2 cup whole natural almonds, chopped; 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour; 1
1/2 cups quick-cooking oats, uncooked; 1/2 cup packed brown sugar; 3/4 cup
butter or margarine (1 1/2 sticks);  In 2-quart saucepan over high heat, heat
dates, orange juice, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to boiling. Reduce heat to
low; simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture is very thick.
Remove from heat; stir in almonds.;   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease and
flour a 9-inch-square baking pan. In medium-sized bowl, mix flour, oats, brown
sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. With pastry blender, cut in butter or margarine
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.;   <PERSON>Pat</PERSON> half of oat mixture onto bottom
of pan. Evenly spread date mixture onto oat layer. Pat remaining oat mixture
onto date layer. Bake 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool in pan on wire
rack. When cold, cut into 18 pieces. Store in tightly covered container.;   --

THE BIRTH OF A PIE RECIPE: IT STARTED WITH A KISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"How do you think up the recipes?" That's a question food writers hear 
frequently. But the usual answer, "Well, it depends," doesn't help much. But 
it's true. So in the interest of greater understanding, here's the story on 
today's offering, a chocolate hazelnut pie. The recipe began at a benefit 
community supper climaxed by a ravishing display of pie -- a 3-foot-wide, 
16-foot-long stretch paved with row after row of strawberry, rhubarb, apple, 
cherry, lemon chiffon, lemon meringue, chocolate fudge, chocolate mousse, 
banana cream, coconut custard, pecan, apple crumb . . . 17 flavors in all, not 
counting the cheesecakes. 
</P>
<P>
I've had pie on my mind ever since. But what kind of pie? Surely the world 
needs no more recipes for classic fruit pies. (What we need in that department 
are people willing to make them.) I finally decided the pie should be 
chocolate; all the people I know and love and make pie for are chocolate fans. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the people I love the best is a man who has a special weakness for 
Baci (kisses): bite-size Italian confections that combine bittersweet chocolate 
with roasted hazelnuts in a way that <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s would do very well to learn 
from. 
</P>
<P>
OK, <ORGANIZATION>Baci</ORGANIZATION> pie it is. But how to make it? None of my favorite chocolate mousse 
fillings can be published now that uncooked eggs are on the out list, so the 
creamy chocolate part will have to come from baked custard and whipped cream. 
The nut layer should be nougat-like, so it's derived from the almond tart that 
<PERSON>Lindsey Shere</PERSON> perfected for <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s renowned <ORGANIZATION>Chez Panisse</ORGANIZATION> restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The crust is basically old-fashioned flaky piecrust, but it's made even richer 
and flakier by being bound with sour cream instead of water, an idea that comes 
from the "counterfeit puff pastry" given in <PERSON>Maida Heatter</PERSON>'s "Book of Great 
Desserts." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is absolutely typical. You get an idea, then you go with what you 
know, borrowing a little here and a little there. Then, if what you're making 
is Baci pie, you eat nothing else for about three days so the calories in a 
single slice don't rise up and kill you dead. 
</P>
<P>
BACI PIE 
</P>
<P>
8 ounces hazelnuts (filberts), scant 2 cups 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups whipping cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons Frangelico or other hazelnut liqueur 
</P>
<P>
Crust 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
3 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Cream 
</P>
<P>
Spread hazelnuts on shallow pan and toast at 350 degrees 15 minutes or until 
golden. Cool, then rub between palms to remove as much skin as possible. Grind 
nuts into coarse crumbs and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar with 3/4 cup whipping cream in heavy, non-reactive saucepan. 
Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture thickens to texture of 
light cream sauce, about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in nuts and liqueur. Pour warm filling into Crust, increase oven heat to 
400 degrees and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until filling is lightly browned and 
almost set. (Will bubble up and then subside.) 
</P>
<P>
Grind or chop chocolate into fine crumbs, then stir in egg yolks. Heat 
remaining 3/4 cup cream just to boiling point. Pour over chocolate, stirring 
until mixture is smooth. Gently pour chocolate mixture onto pie filling, return 
to oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake another 12 to 15 minutes or until 
chocolate layer is just set. Cool on rack and chill thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Completely cover top of pie with <ORGANIZATION>Chocolate Cream</ORGANIZATION>, putting cream through pastry 
tube or swirling decoratively with back of spoon. Serve at once. Makes 1 
(9-inch) pie, or 9 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Crust 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons lard or solid shortening 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, salt and sugar in bowl. Rub in lard with fingers (or use food 
processor) until mixture resembles meal. Cut or process in butter only until 
large lumps about size of baby lima beans form. Add sour cream and stir or 
process as briefly as possible, until dough holds together. 
</P>
<P>
Form dough into round cake, about 1-inch thick, wrap tightly in plastic wrap 
and chill 3 to 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Roll dough between 2 sheets wax paper to 1/8-inch thickness. Chill. Line oven 
bottom with foil to catch any drips. Press foil onto 9-inch pie pan, shiny side 
down, to obtain shape of pan. Remove foil and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Peel wax paper from dough, fit pastry into pan and cover with pre-shaped foil, 
pressing so foil is snug all around. Bake at 375 degrees 20 minutes or until 
set, then remove foil and continue baking until shell is lightly browned, about 
20 minutes longer. Makes 1 (9-inch) crust. 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Cream 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons cocoa powder 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup whipping cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon Frangelico or other hazelnut liqueur 
</P>
<P>
Place cocoa in small, deep bowl and very slowly stir in 1/2 cup whipping cream. 
Cover and chill. At serving time, whip chocolate cream until stiff, then fold 
in sugar and Frangelico.

cheese freeze from her childhood in Ohio, Van der Vort didn't say where her

<HL> Hershey To Take On Nestle's Quik With New Chocolate Milk Powder </HL>
<AUTHOR> Dale M. Mazer (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> HSY </CO>

<DATELINE> HERSHEY, Pa.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is introducing a powdered chocolate milk mix to compete against Ovaltine and <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s Quik in the <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> powder-additive segment of the milk flavoring market. 

   The product, which took <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION> about three years to develop, will appear on most supermarket shelves by <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE>. 

   The company already dominates the syrup-additive part of the market, claiming about a <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> share of the segment, which has about <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales annually. 
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle S.A.</ORGANIZATION> claims about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of that segment. 

   Hershey hopes to capture a bigger portion of the powder segment, which <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> dominates with a <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> share. 
But catching up to <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> won't be easy. 
In the powder business, <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION> ranks a weak third, with only about <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of the market. 
<ORGANIZATION>Sandoz Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>'s Ovaltine has about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> "has a very strong lead," acknowledged <PERSON>Anthony J. Pingatore</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s grocery products group. 

   Analysts said most consumers automatically associate the <LOCATION>Hershey</LOCATION> name with good chocolate. 
<PERSON>William J. Wason</PERSON>, a food industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s last venture into the field, a chocolate milk licensed through dairies, was a major success. 

   "This will be a nice plus for them outside of the candy area," he said, noting that having another Hershey-name product is "free advertising" for its candies. 

   Hershey launched a powder milk additive, <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Instant</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>1956</DATE>. 
Consumers weren't particularly fond of its taste, and it didn't dissolve easily in cold milk. 
The company pulled it off the shelves in <DATE>July</DATE> to replace it with the new mix. 

   <PERSON>Albert F. Germann</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing manager, said the old product was "no better or worse than any other product on the market." 

   But the new milk mix will be pushed by the company as distinctly different from the rival brands, especially <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s. 
Hershey's consumer taste tests showed that the product has a more chocolatey and less sugary flavor. 

   Hershey hopes its packaging will provide advantages, too. 
The product comes in a plastic container with a wide mouth that can accommodate larger spoons. 
In contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s container is made of cardboard and has a narrow mouth, both unpopular features, according to <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION> consumer tests. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Germann</PERSON> said the media campaign planned for the new mix will be "the heaviest advertising <PERSON>Hershey</PERSON> has ever done for a new product," but he declined to disclose the size of the budget. 

   Humorous television commercials that run for 10 to 30 seconds will be aired beginning <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> over all major networks, cable and syndication. 
The commercials feature a herd of cows lowing, "It's Neeewww!" 

   Hershey also said it plans to distribute more than 100 million coupons in inserts in <DATE>Sunday</DATE> newspapers on <DATE>Sept. 18</DATE>. 
Next month, direct-mail packets with free samples of the mix will be sent to about 18 million <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> households with children. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Hershey</ORGANIZATION> expects a number of national mass merchandisers, including K mart, will carry the product by <DATE>November</DATE>. 

   The company said it gave careful thought to the timing of the introduction. 
"Fall is the beginning of the high-consumption period for chocolate milk," <PERSON>Mr. Germann</PERSON> said, "primarily because it's back-to-school season."

<LEADPARA>  MAIDA Heatter is the queen of tarts -- and pies and cakes. Ice cream and
cookies, too. And while you're at it, throw in mousses, puddings and poached
fruit.;    In fact, just about everything Maida Heatter makes is delicious.
But perhaps more important, recipes in each of her six dessert books work
perfectly (at least the ones I've tried, anyway). A fact that somehow
mystifies her.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A SWEET CONVERSATION WITH THE QUEEN OF DESSERTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I'm at a loss to explain it. I've never known any other way to do them,"
she said. "The funny thing is that when I started to do recipes, I didn't know
how. So I used <PERSON>Craig Claiborne</PERSON>'s books as an example.";    <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> and her
husband <PERSON>Ralph Daniels</PERSON> were in the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> a while back plugging her most
recent book, "<PERSON>Maida Heatter</PERSON>'s Best Dessert Book Ever" (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>).
Over breakfast at the <ORGANIZATION>Claremont Resort Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, the silver-haired
(she won't reveal her age) and surprisingly thin (yes, she does eat her own
desserts) <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> talked about how she became <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first lady of
desserts.;    "I asked <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> if he would retire from being an airline pilot
and spend more time at home. I said, 'Why don't you open a coffee shop. I'll
make the brownies and you can schmooze with the guys.' ";    In addition to
brownies, <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> made salad dressings and ratatouille ("raah taah too eee,"
she says with deliberation) in her home kitchen. Soon brownies gave way to
chocolate mousses, queen mother's cakes and "anything we could take in the
station wagon.";    When word of <ORGANIZATION>Heatter</ORGANIZATION>'s wondrous confections spread beyond
her <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> home, <PERSON>Claiborne</PERSON>, then food editor of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, came
to call. After a few samplings, he urged her to write a cookbook.;   
Fortunately for <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON>, that wasn't hard to do.;    "I used to write every
recipe in long hand to have a record for myself. Then I'd mimeograph 100
copies of each and <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON> would hand them out to customers to try out for
themselves. So by the time I was ready for my first book, I had the most
tested recipes you can imagine," she said.;    Her first book, "<PERSON>Maida
Heatter</PERSON>'s Book of Great Desserts" (<ORGANIZATION>Alfred A. Knopf</ORGANIZATION>) came out in <DATE>1974</DATE>. Despite
instant acclaim it and subsequent books received, <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> never contracts for
a book until it is finished.;    When new dishes are perfected, she types the
recipe on a typewriter that sits next to the stove. Then she piles the typed
sheets on the floor of the dining room. When the pile gets to be about a foot
high, she knows it's time for a new book.;    <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> fans take note: The
current pile is about six inches high.;    In the <DATE>past 16 years Heatter</DATE> has
become almost a folk hero for professional and amateur dessert makers alike.
Superstar chef <PERSON>Wolfgang Puck</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claiborne</PERSON> are two of her biggest admirers and
closest friends.;    (When I was a student at the <ORGANIZATION>Restaurant School</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> in the mid '70s, making <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON>'s Royal Viennese Walnut Torte was
de rigueur. And it seemed as if half the restaurants in town had at least one
<PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> dessert on the menu.);    In <DATE>1983</DATE> <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> made key lime pie and
brownies for President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> when he hosted the economic summit in
<LOCATION>Williamsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1988</DATE> she was named to <ORGANIZATION>Cook</ORGANIZATION>'s Magazine Who's Who of
Cooking in America.;    Though her mother was an excellent home cook (her
father was famed broadcaster <PERSON>Gabriel Heatter</PERSON>), <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> gives most of the
credit for her dessert deftness to the 20 years she spent as a fashion
illustrator in <LOCATION>New York.</LOCATION>;    "When I'm in the kitchen, I'm amazed at how many
times I make a dessert that relates to a design class I took. In school, I
learned balance, proportion and center of interest. If I knew anything about
music, I'd say it relates to food too. But the fact is, I'm tone deaf," she
said.;    In the <DATE>past decade</DATE>, <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> has seen two significant changes in
dessert making. The first is a move away from ornate and elaborate desserts to
ones that are simpler and more straightforward. The second trend is desserts
with more intense flavors.;    "Now I use more of everything in my recipes
whether it's rum, chocolate or vanilla. I hate to say it, but I have a vanilla
ice cream in one of my other books that is blah compared to the one in my
current book because now I use Tahitian vanilla beans, and more of them," she
said.;    She also has become fond of using pepper in desserts to jack up the
taste. A number of the desserts in her new book contain finely ground white or
black pepper.;    "Something happens when you combine sugar and pepper if you
use the right amount. The pepper seems to bring out the flavor without getting
in the way," she said.;    The trend toward simplicity suits <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> just
fine. When asked for her favorite dessert she quickly responds, "chocolate ice
cream." And she admits to being "totally charmed" by a plain loaf cake.;   
But what really turns <PERSON>Heatter</PERSON> on is just making desserts, any desserts, in the
spacious kitchen (it occupies an entire wing) of her waterfront home.;   
"Seeing my name in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times or in the window of <ORGANIZATION>Saks</ORGANIZATION> doesn't do a
thing for me. I'm never prouder than when I take something out of the oven.";
HONEY BISCOTTI;  7 ounces (1 3/4 cups) whole unblanched (skins-on) almonds;  3
large eggs;  1/2 cup mild and light honey;  1 teaspoon vanilla extract;  1/2
teaspoon almond extract or 1/4 teaspoon bitter almond extract;  3 cups plus 1
tablespoon sifted unbleached flour;  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder;  1/4
teaspoon salt;  1 1/4 teaspoons white pepper, ground fine;  1 1/4 teaspoons
ground ginger;  1/2 cup granulated sugar;   Heat oven to 375; bake almonds in
wide, shallow pan, in oven center, stirring once, for 13 minutes. Set aside to
cool.;    Adjust two racks to divide oven into thirds and reduce temperature
to 300. Line two 12-by-15 1/2-inch cookie sheets with baking pan liner paper
or aluminum foil, shiny side up, and set aside. Beat eggs in a small bowl with
honey and vanilla and almond extracts to mix well; set aside.;    Sift
together flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, ginger and sugar into large bowl
of an electric mixer. Add beaten egg mixture all at once to dry ingredients
and beat on low speed, scraping bowl as necessary with rubber spatula, until
mixture holds together. Slowly beat in nuts. Mixture will be thick, gooey and
rubbery.;    Lightly flour large work surface and turn dough onto floured
area. Lightly sift flour over top of dough. Cut dough in half. With wide dough
scraper (or with wide spatula or pancake turner), turn one piece of dough few
times to flour lightly all sides and form dough into elongated oval about 10
inches long. Place lined cookie sheet next to oval of dough.;    Now is when
you need confidence. Dough will be soft and will lose shape when you transfer
it. (If you use more flour and make a dough that will hold its shape, it will
be too firm to spread out as it should during baking.) With both hands (or
with the dough scraper) pick up dough and quickly transfer to cookie sheet,
placing it diagonally on the sheet. However the dough flops on the sheet, it
will be OK. Reshape with your fingers and/or press dough scraper against sides
of dough to straighten shape. (It should be only about 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide
in middle and 1/2 to 3/4 inch high.);    Repeat with remaining half of dough
and second cookie sheet. With wide pastry brush, brush excess flour off dough.
Bake two sheets at a time for 50 minutes, reversing sheets top to bottom and
front to back once during baking to ensure even browning. (The shapes will
flatten and spread.);    Remove sheets from oven. Reduce temperature to 275.
Peel paper away from back, or with large spatula, or using flat-sided cookie
sheet as a spatula, release baked strips and transfer to large cutting board.;
   Cutting strips into narrow finger shapes should be done slowly and
carefully. With a serrated bread knife, cut strips on a sharp angle into
cookies 1/2 inch wide. Sometimes it is best to start each cut with serrated
knife and finish with a straight knife.;    Place them on a cut side, next to
each other, and bake again for 35 to 45 minutes (depending on width). After
about 20 minutes, or when cookies are half baked, turn upside down and bake
until dry. Watch carefully; do not over bake. (While they are warm, they will
feel a bit soft, but when they cool they will become crisp and hard.) They
should be golden brown all over but not look burned. Cool and store airtight.
Makes about 40.; DOUBLE CHOCOLATE POTS DE <LOCATION>CREME</LOCATION>;  1 pound semisweet or
bittersweet chocolate;  2 cups milk;  1 tablespoon dry instant espresso or
coffee;   Pinch of salt;  6 large egg yolks;  1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract;
  Chop chocolate fine and set aside. In large heavy saucepan over moderate
heat, stir milk occasionally until it just barely starts to boil. Add
chocolate and whisk until smooth. Add the espresso or coffee and salt and wisk
until mixture just comes to boil again.;    Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat yolks
just to mix. Ladle the boiling mixture slowly into yolks, beating on low speed
only to mix. Mix in the vanilla. The mixture should be as smooth as honey;
pour hot mixture through a fine strainer into pitcher.;    Pour into 10 pots
de creme cups or 8 souffle dishes, demitasse cups or wine glasses.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Refrigerate</ORGANIZATION> uncovered for about half an hour only until chilled, and then
cover and refrigerate a few hours longer (3 to 4 hours minimum) or until the
next day. (If not covered, a skin will form on the top.);    Serve with a
small spoonful of soft whipped cream on each portion, with a light sprinkle of
unsweetened cocoa powder over cream.; GREEN APPLE ICE;  1 1/2 pounds (4
medium-large) tart apples (preferably <ORGANIZATION>Granny Smith</ORGANIZATION>);  1 cup unsweetened apple
juice;  1 cup granulated sugar;  2 teaspoons lemon juice;  1 teaspoon vanilla
extract;   Calvados or applejack, optional;   Peel the apples with a vegetable
parer. Cut them in half from the top to bottom. With a melon baller remover
the cores. With a small sharp knife cut a small groove above and below the
cores to remove the stems and fibers. Cut each piece in half, making quarters.
Place in a heavy saucepan with the apple juice and sugar.;    Cover and cook
over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until
tender.;    With a slotted spoon transfer the apples to the bowl of a food
processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Process until pureed. Through
the feed tube gradually add the syrup remaining in the saucepan, and process
until smooth.;    Strain through a wide but fine strainer set over a bowl.
Stir in the lemon juice and vanilla. Cool.;    <ORGANIZATION>Chill</ORGANIZATION>, preferably in the
refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.;    Freeze in an ice cream churn
according to the manufacturer's directions.;    If you wish, serve with a bit
of the optional Calvados or applejack spooned over the top.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Fancy Foods Generally Not Lean Foods, But Some Change Is Afoot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-fat cheeses, all-fruit jams and low-calorie
crackers are making inroads in the fancy foods industry, and
health-conscious eaters can find satisfaction in the gourmet
section if they look carefully.
   ``All-natural'' was a common rallying cry as purveyers showed
off 20,000 foods at the <ORGANIZATION>36th Annual International Fancy Food</ORGANIZATION> and
Confection Show last week. But even if all-natural, which generally
has no legal meaning, most of the samples spread out for potential
customers were more likely to be buttery or chocolatey than
slimming.
   ``People are trying to eat healthy most of the time,'' said
<PERSON>Ronald Tanner</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Association</ORGANIZATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Specialty Food Trade Inc.</ORGANIZATION> ``And then when they're splurging,
they're really splurging.''
   Most of the time, people who buy fancier foods try to satisfy
their urges with foods that carry rich flavors but at little cost
to the waistline.
   ``Flavor is the real big selling point. People want to eat
healthy, but they don't want to just eat lettuce,'' <PERSON>Tanner</PERSON> said.
   For the first time, this year's trade show included a seminar on
healthy foods.
   So, there are mustards _ green chili mustard, sage mustard, wine
and champagne mustards, sweet mustards. And wild rice. Organic
baked beans. Oats added to pancake mixes. Organically grown teas.
Goat's milk yogurt. Organic maple syrup. Eleven-calorie cookies.
   But just as in the supermarket, consumers should read labels at
gourmet shops. Organic doesn't mean low-calorie, and
cholesterol-free doesn't mean no fat. A sugar-free product may have
as many calories as one with sugar.
   Le Slim Cow, a butter substitute made with buttermilk, was
promoted as having half the fat of butter or margarine. And just 57
calories, compared with 103 calories per serving of butter.
However, its makers, <ORGANIZATION>St. Hubert of Rolling Hills Estates</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
warn that the high moisture content of Le Slim Cow makes it
unsuitable for frying.
   <ORGANIZATION>Elan Foods Inc.</ORGANIZATION> has introduced a chocolate-covered frozen yogurt
bar that's available east of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and should be
available nationwide in a year or so, said <PERSON>Joanne Biltekoff</PERSON>, who
runs the company with her husband.
   While a bar has 230 calories and 13 grams of fat, a premium ice
cream bar has 350 calories and 22 fat grams.
   Salsas and chile sauces were plentiful at the show _ <LOCATION>San Angel</LOCATION>,
La Preferida, <ORGANIZATION>Montezuma</ORGANIZATION>, Corn Mother red and green salsas, one made
with eggplant, one with dried tomatoes, one from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   Generally, these have little fat, though eating them with
tortilla chips cancels any advantage. Try them with bread or
vegetables instead.
   The <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> brand of breads includes varieties made from
stone-ground grains, but the company's booth also included rich
brownies. And a <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> company called Food <DATE>2000</DATE> offered vegetarian
chili. There were organic vegetable pates from <ORGANIZATION>Threefold
International Co</ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. in carrot, chestnut, mushroom and other
flavors.
   But temptation lurked everywhere.
   Across the aisle from <PERSON>Golightly</PERSON> sugar-free candies was a big pan
of tiramisu, the Italian dessert made with high-fat cheese.
   Walk down another aisle and go from butter cookies to spicy meat
to potato pancakes. Pates seemed to be everywhere. And chocolate.
Chocolate shaped like hair dryers, chocolate with every kind of nut
imaginable, chocolate sauce, chocolate cookies, even
chocolate-covered caramel corn.

<LEADPARA>  WHAT could be a more simple dessert for the holidays than buttery shortbread?
This Scottish treat is a basic trinity of butter, sugar and flour that was
created as a delicacy generations ago.;   The simplicity of the mixture makes
it perfect for numerous holiday variations. Merely add flavorings, raisins,
fruit peel or nuts to the basic recipe, or take it a step further by altering
the shape of the shortbread.  </LEADPARA>

   Wendy's International Inc. is taking an in-your-face
approach to health-conscious food marketing.
   While McDonald's promotes a seaweed-filled McLean Deluxe
burger with only 310 calories and 9% fat, Wendy's new ads
unabashedly proclaim the delights of a quarter-pound,
all-beef hamburger topped with a slice of cheese, three
sizzling strips of bacon, gooey cheddar cheese sauce and
sliced mushrooms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ads feature beefy <PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s founder <PERSON>Dave Thomas</PERSON> dodging
obstacles in a car in his rush to reach one of his
restaurants. Once there, he sinks his teeth into the juicy
sandwich, which has at least 600 calories, and says, "When
you got to have one, you got to have one."
   "McDonald's does what it wants to do," says <PERSON>Denny Lynch</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Wendy</PERSON>'s vice president for communications in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
"We feel we have our finger on the pulse of what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
wants. They want options."
   Wendy's and other food companies are well aware that
consumers insist they want to eat fat-free foods but still
reach for fat-laden products in supermarkets and restaurants.
At a time when the <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> dough boy has taken to jogging
on a treadmill to promote a new low-fat <ORGANIZATION>Lovin</ORGANIZATION>' Lite brownie
mix (100 calories, two grams of fat per serving), these
companies are overtly celebrating tasty, caloric, fatty
foods. Their ads use words like "creamy" and "rich" to push
both hefty homestyle foods and gourmet delicacies.
   Consider <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION>'s Haagen-Dazs. The growing popularity
of frozen yogurt isn't stopping Haagen-Dazs from promoting
its sinfully rich ice cream -- and introducing two new
flavors, coffee toffee crunch (300 calories and 19 grams of
fat per four-ounce serving) and coffee almond crunch -- in
the company's first national TV ad campaign this <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   <PERCENT>Sixty percent</PERCENT> of the <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> budgeted for the ad
campaign will go to pitch Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The rest
will promote the company's new frozen yogurt (130 calories
and three grams of fat per three ounces of vanilla).
   In one suggestive print ad, a woman describes the
sensation of talking to her boyfriend on the phone while
eating a coffee almond crunch ice cream bar (360 calories, 26
grams of fat). "Slowly his voice started to drift away.
Completely consumed, I carefully lifted the thick Belgian
chocolate off. Then I immersed myself in the creamy center,"
she says seductively.
   "There's a significant difference between consumer
behavior and what consumers say they do," says <PERSON>Yves Coleon</PERSON>,
Haagen-Dazs marketing vice president, reflecting on the
company's marketing strategy. "A year from now, when we look
at <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of their sales will revolve around their
core product line and not the <ORGANIZATION>McLean Deluxe</ORGANIZATION>. There's a sense
of absurdity in this whole game."
   <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which has seen its cream-based soups
maintain a lead over a low-sodium line, agrees. <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s
newest product, cream of broccoli (80 calories and five grams
of fat per eight-ounce serving), has become the company's
most popular soup in 35 years, helped by a
multimillion-dollar campaign this winter. Ads present it as a
creamy ingredient for use in main dishes, appealing to
households accustomed to pouring an old standby, cream of
mushroom (100 calories and seven grams of fat per eight
ounces), into casseroles.
   "We think of it as the right product at the right time,"
says <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s communications manager <PERSON>Kevin Lowery</PERSON> of the
broccoli soup. Overall, he adds, consumers still prefer the
company's richer soups, with chicken noodle (60 calories and
two grams of fat per eight ounces) and cream of mushroom
leading the pack and cream of broccoli not far behind.
   The nation's most popular frozen food entree derives <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT>
of its calories from fat: Stouffer's macaroni and cheese (250
calories and 13 grams of fat per six ounces). Stouffer made a
multimillion-dollar pitch this <DATE>winter</DATE> for its line of
"Homestyle" entrees, which are heavy on gravy and starch and
include fried chicken and mashed potatoes (350 calories, 18
grams of fat in a 7 1/8 ounce serving) and <PERSON>Salisbury</PERSON> steak
with macaroni and cheese (350 calories, 18 grams of fat in 8
5/8 ounces).
   Stouffer ads appealed to consumers' cravings for homemade
food that would fill them up. Print ads promised: "No fads.
No frills. No tricks. No shortcuts." But <PERSON>Stouffer</PERSON> still
hedged its bets; the ads also noted that the dishes each
weigh in at fewer than 370 calories.
   "What we've seen in the <DATE>last two years</DATE> is that many of our
basic original products like macaroni and cheese are showing
growth," says <PERSON>Ed Marra</PERSON>, senior vice president, marketing, at
<ORGANIZATION>Stouffer Foods</ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION>Nestle USA</ORGANIZATION>. (<ORGANIZATION>Stouffer</ORGANIZATION> also
produces Lean Cuisine, a line of low-fat frozen entrees that
is fighting a fierce price war with <ORGANIZATION>Heinz</ORGANIZATION>'s Weight Watchers
and <ORGANIZATION>ConAgra</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Healthy Choice</ORGANIZATION>.)
   In pushing foods that taste rich, marketers are playing on
consumers' search for comfort. "Food is one of the easiest
and cheapest ways to give to ourselves," says <PERSON>Judith Langer</PERSON>,
president of <ORGANIZATION>Langer Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> market
research firm.
   Food marketers also realize that children have a
particular weakness for treats and often influence their
parents' shopping lists. Skippy, in TV ads directed at
children, boasts that it has made its regular peanut butter
creamier and its chunky brand even chunkier with more
peanuts, though both types still have 190 calories and 17
grams of fat in a two tablespoon serving. A new flavor of
peanut butter -- roasted honey nut -- is being test marketed
on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Skippy</ORGANIZATION>, a brand of <ORGANIZATION>CPC International
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Englewood Cliffs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   Similarly, <ORGANIZATION>Hershey Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reformulated its crunchy
<PERSON>Reese</PERSON>'s peanut butter cup. It put in three times more peanuts
and raised the fat content from 17 grams to 18 grams. The
confection, which still has 280 calories, hit grocery store
shelves in <DATE>March</DATE>. In new TV ads, the candy explodes in a
display of spontaneous combustion.
   "We're not going to become a nation of ascetics," says
<PERSON>Allison Cohen</PERSON>, a specialist in consumer behavior at <ORGANIZATION>Ally &amp;
Gargano</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ad agency. "The '90s are going to be the
decade of the health-conscious individual, but if {consumers}
have to compromise too much, it's not going to sell."
   <ORGANIZATION>Nestle USA</ORGANIZATION>, convinced that this is a "back to basics"
decade, is pitching its Tollhouse semisweet chocolate chips
to consumers who, it says, are more eager than ever to bake
at home. Its TV ads, which feature a girl, her mother and her
grandmother mixing up cookies, promote <ORGANIZATION>Tollhouse</ORGANIZATION> more as a
traditional family activity than a rich dessert product.
   Still, purveyors of rich foods have to choose their words
carefully, says <PERSON>Ms. Langer</PERSON>. "It's OK to market indulgence
food products as rich. But I doubt somebody would come along
and say: `Here's something high in salt.'"

GELATO'S RICH FLAVORS JUSTIFY THE SUPERLATIVES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Why all this warm and fuzzy talk about a food that's ice cold? It's because
gelato, the Italian word for ice cream, is justly famous for the intensity of
its flavors.;    When you wrap your lips around a spoonful of peach gelato,
chances are you'll say, "Now that's peach!" not "This has a nice peachy
flavor.";    Gelato is a word used for both ice cream and water ice, but
strictly speaking it's an ice cream -- a mixture of egg custard, sugar and
other flavorings -- while a water ice is a sorbetto.;    A characteristic of
the best gelati made in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Palermo</ORGANIZATION> is the addition of a second flavor
to bring out the aroma of the main ingredients, such as a hint of orange in
the strawberry gelato or a pinch of cinnamon in the chocolate.;    The
following recipes provide a flavorful primer for this dessert. Some are based
on smooth fruit purees, and some are made with chunks of fruit, nuts or
candy.;    In fruit-based gelati, ripeness is important in bringing out the
best flavor. Choose fruit that is soft and fragrant.;    Chocolate-Hazelnut
Gelato gets its intense flavor from roasted, ground nuts and Frangelico, the
hazelnut liqueur, plus melted semisweet chocolate.;    <ORGANIZATION>Cappuccino Gelato</ORGANIZATION> is
made with instant espresso and Kahlua.;    <ORGANIZATION>Lemon Gelato</ORGANIZATION>, a refreshing treat
for hot <DATE>summer</DATE> nights, is flavored with fresh lemon juice and finely grated
lemon peel.;    Banana-Honey Gelato gets a flavor accent from lemon juice.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Peach Gelato</ORGANIZATION> combines peaches, Grand Marnier liqueur, orange juice and lemon
juice.;    <ORGANIZATION>Dried Cherry-Chocolate Chunk Gelato</ORGANIZATION> uses half a cup of cherries and
a 3-ounce bar of semisweet chocolate per eight servings.;    To make gelato,
you need an ice cream machine. If you don't own one, these recipes and the
potential for grins on the faces of your family and guests are reason enough
to consider making the investment.; CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT; GELATO;  1 cup
hazelnuts;  6 egg yolks;  1 1/3 cups whipping cream;  1/8 teaspoon salt;  2
cups half-and-half;  3/4 cup sugar;  4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped

the hazelnuts in a cake pan and toast in a preheated 350-degree oven 10
minutes, or until the skins start to crack. Cool slightly; place in a kitchen
towel and rub together to remove the skins. Grind finely in a food processor.;
   In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolks, cream and salt. Combine the
half-and-half and sugar in a saucepan. Bring the liquid to a simmer, add the
chocolate and cover. Remove from the heat and set aside 5 minutes, or until
the chocolate has melted.;    Slowly whisk the hot chocolate mixture into the
egg yolk mixture, then return to the saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the
mixture begins to thicken slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 7
minutes. Let cool.;    Stir in the ground nuts and the hazelnut liqueur.

<TEXT>
   Shortly after noon on the <DATE>second day of the</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>National Candy Wholesalers Association</ORGANIZATION>'s summer convention, sugar
shock hit and the guy in the big M&amp;M costume started to look fuzzy.
   No thanks, no mas, enough already. No more chocolate bars,
gumdrops, gumballs, rock candy, licorice sticks, fudge, toffee
crunch, jelly beans, peppermint creams, caramel-coated popcorn,
<ORGANIZATION>Moon Pies</ORGANIZATION> or Mellow-Munchies.
   Take away your heart-shaped <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day boxes, your Count
Dracula treats for Halloween, your chocolate Easter bunnies. Get
thee hence, Garbage Can-dy, <ORGANIZATION>Heavenly Passion</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pee-Wee</ORGANIZATION>'s
Playhouse Fun Paks.
   Glucose levels were going through the roof of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
Convention Center when the semiannual confab of 6,500 candy
wholesalers got into full swing <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. At midday, sales people
began tempting passersby with heaps of sweets, chewing gum and
munchies at 630 booths covering the floors of two large exhibition
halls.
   Other conventioneers swarmed through the ``sample room'' filling
small paper tote bags with goodies while a tape-recorded voice
repeatedly urged guests to exercise restraint. ``Thank you, and
have a sweet tooth,'' the voice said.
   The hottest items on the market this year seem to be gummy bears
_ a chewy confection long popular among European children _ upscale
``gourmet'' chocolates from such exotic locales as <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, and
bubble gum that looks like pizza, served in a tiny Domino's Pizza
box.
   For the health-conscious, there is tofu chocolate (``non-dairy,
no white sugar, no cholesterol''), granola bars and ``high-fiber''
candies coated with yogurt.
   For those who don't care, there are white chocolate lollipops in
the shape of big-bosomed blondes and ``shelf-stable'' cotton candy
in cardboard <LOCATION>Ringling Bros.</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Barnum &amp; Bailey</ORGANIZATION> circus wagons.
   Licorice comes in vines, ropes and twists. Popcorn comes in
barbecue, nacho and jalapeno flavors. Kids' candies come in toy
light bulbs, water pistols, skeletons, skulls, rockets, whistles,
snakes, UFOs, spaceships and parachute jumpers.
   Two of the oldest candy brands in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> _ both introduced in
<DATE>1912</DATE> _ are still on the market, according to industry historians.
They are the Nut Goodie bar, made by <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON>'s of <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>,
and the Goo Goo Cluster manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Standard Candy Co.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn</LOCATION>.
   Association president <PERSON>Ernest D. May</PERSON>, a candy packager and
distributor from <LOCATION>Grove City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, said the <MONEY>$9.6 billion</MONEY> candy
business is growing steadily after a slump in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> caused
partly by high sugar prices and a stagnant population in the
biggest candy-buying age bracket, 15 to 30.
   Consumption had risen to <MONEY>19.3 pounds</MONEY> of candy per capita last
year, and <DATE>May</DATE> says the wholesalers' goal is 25 pounds for every
American man, woman and child by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   ``It's a real challenge but I think it's reachable,'' <DATE>May</DATE> said
in an interview. ``The future is bright.''
   After gummy bears, what fantastic new candy treat is next?
   ``If I could answer that,'' he replied, ``you and I could both
retire.''

   Every dog has its day, and a <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> retailer is
hoping that day is <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu Department Store</ORGANIZATION> is going all out this year to make
sure its pet-owning customers have a vast array chocolates,
cookies, fish sausages and other drool-inducing delicacies to
choose from.
   ``I'm buying chocolates for my boyfriend, so why not for my
dog?'' said <PERSON>Ayako Endo</PERSON>, a 22-year-old office worker.
   Miss <PERSON>Endo</PERSON> said buying a <MONEY>$3.50</MONEY> gift set of goodies was the least
she could do for her 12-year-old English setter.
   ``They're good,'' she said. ``I eat them too.''
   As in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, Japanese celebrate <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day by
giving sweets to a loved one. <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu</ORGANIZATION> is hoping to expand the concept
a bit to include animals.
   ``We've been selling the chocolates for about three years, but
this is the first year we have gone all out,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu</ORGANIZATION> pet shop
clerk <PERSON>Yoshiko Kashiwazaki</PERSON>, pointing to a large table covered with
heart-shaped gift sets wrapped in red-and-yellow ribbons.
   A poster showed two furry creatures cuddled up over the slogan:
``For Lovers, Sweet Valentine.''
   ``I love you only,'' said one. ``Me too,'' replied the other.
   Shoppers are eating up the idea.
   ``I just love cats and dogs,'' said 12-year-old <PERSON>Yuki Kuwahara</PERSON>,
who bought a chocolate and chew-bone gift for a Maltese dog she's
rather fond of. ``We don't have a pet of our own.''
   Most of the customers who purchase sweets for their dogs are
women in their 30s or 40s, <LOCATION>Kashiwazaki</LOCATION> said.
   The chocolates come in both the regular brown and milky white
colors, ``contain 13 different vitamins and are made with only the
purest milk,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>Morinyu Pet Foods</ORGANIZATION>, the company that
makes them.
   Morinyu, a subsidiary of the huge <ORGANIZATION>Morinaga Milk Industry Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Ltd.</LOCATION>, began producing the chocolates six years ago, intending them
to be used as rewards given to show dogs during training.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu</ORGANIZATION>, which sells a variety of gourmet pet foods, decided
to open the pet <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION> corner because sales of the chocolates
had increased each year in mid-February, <LOCATION>Kashiwazaki</LOCATION> said.
   ``As far as I know we're the only department store doing this,''
said <PERSON>Masataka Tajima</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Tokyu</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sales Promotions Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hundreds of thousands of chocolates are sold for <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day
in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> each year. The chocolates are given by women to men, who
often return the favor on <DATE>March 14</DATE>, which is known as ``White
Chocolate Day.''

<TEXT>     The dairy industry figures the choice is between the milk and the candy
bar. At least that'll be how they pitch a new national advertising campaign
aimed at persuading children and teen-agers to drink more chocolate milk.;  
But dentists and consumer advocates worry about the cavities: chocolate milk
contains sugar as well as cocoa.;   "Chocolate milk is a beverage with a
uniquely satisfying, chocolately taste that's a fun break from other types of
snacks and beverages," said <PERSON>George de Jager</PERSON>, head of the marketing and
advertising department for the <ORGANIZATION>National Dairy Board.</ORGANIZATION>;   And that will be the
message in an advertising campaign to begin in mid-March by the members of the
<ORGANIZATION>Milk Work Group</ORGANIZATION>, which includes the <ORGANIZATION>National Dairy Board</ORGANIZATION> and other state and
regional dairy organizations, the board said.;   But a spokesman for the
<ORGANIZATION>American Dental Association</ORGANIZATION> said it's the wrong message to be sending
children, whose teeth are more vulnerable to decay and cavities than adults.; 
 "Personally, I would not recommend my patients get on chocolate milk. You've
got to lace it with a bunch of stuff to make it sweet, and that's going to
cause a lot of trouble," said <PERSON>Dr. Heber Simmons</PERSON>, a pediatric dentist in
<LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>;   Despite his own reservations, <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON> said a glass of
chocolate milk at meal times shouldn't be a problem. It's between-meal snacks
on sugary foods or drinks that are the biggest decay threat.;   "Teeth do real
well for three meals; in-between snacking gets everyone in trouble," <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON>
said Monday.;   And once children start drinking chocolate milk, <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON> said,
they may refuse to drink anything else, especially plain white milk.;  
<PERSON>Simmons</PERSON> instead recommends children snack on cheddar cheese, which contains a
decay-inhibitor; popcorn or fresh fruit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s top two confectioners, <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury Schweppes
PLC</ORGANIZATION> and Kit Kat-maker <ORGANIZATION>Rowntree PLC</ORGANIZATION>, have become tempting targets
for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Swiss bidders in what the British have dubbed the
candy bar wars.
   The bidding and stake-building reflect a trend among consumer
companies to go global by acquiring existing, strong brands, which
are almost prohibitively expensive to create from scratch, analysts
say.
   The moves also reflect Swiss companies' concerns about the
approach of <DATE>1992</DATE>, when the Common Market is to become one
barrier-free market of 320 million consumers.
   Because <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> is not a member, Swiss companies are eager
to buy operations within the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>, said
<PERSON>Felicity Smith</PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION>Hoare
Govett Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
   The candy bar wars also underscore the key roles <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION> and
Rowntree play in the industry and the importance of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> as a
confectionery market.
   The two companies rank among the world's largest
chocolate-makers, as do the Swiss suitors for <ORGANIZATION>Rowntree</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nestle S.A.</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Jacobs Suchard S.A.</ORGANIZATION>
   The American company <ORGANIZATION>General Cinema Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which said it wants
to increase its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION>, has interests in movie theaters
and soft drink bottling.
   In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> _ the third-largest chocolate consuming country in
the world after <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION> has the largest
share of the <MONEY>$3.9 billion</MONEY> chocolate market, or <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>,
according to the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION>Henderson Crosthwaite Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
   Rowntree comes in a second with <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT>, and <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-based Mars
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is third with <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT>, the firm said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION>'s brands also include <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> Dry soft drinks.
   Many Britons are not happy that two of their venerable
institutions are being raided by foreigners.
   ``The fate of the (<ORGANIZATION>Rowntree</ORGANIZATION>) Yorkie bar has stirred the nation
into a fit of patriotism,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> newspaper said.
``The Little English lobby has been in a lather...''
   <PERSON>Rowntree</PERSON> hasn't made a direct approach to the government about
possible intervention, but it is discussing the matter with ``one
or two people,'' a <ORGANIZATION>Rowntree</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   In accordance with British practice, the spokesman wasn't
identified.
   In <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION>'s case, <ORGANIZATION>General Cinema</ORGANIZATION>, which is headquartered in
<LOCATION>Chestnut Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, said last week that it would increase its
<PERCENT>17.7 percent</PERCENT> stake in the British company, possibly through a
tender offer.
   London-based <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION>, whose brands include <PERSON>Peter Paul</PERSON>'s Mounds
and Almond Joy candy bars, said any involvement or interference
from <ORGANIZATION>General Cinema</ORGANIZATION> would be ``unwelcome, and strongly resisted.''
   It was more than a year ago that <ORGANIZATION>General Cinema</ORGANIZATION> first became a
major shareholder in <ORGANIZATION>Cadbury</ORGANIZATION>, whose shares fell <MONEY>15 cents</MONEY> to finish
at <MONEY>$6.51</MONEY> on <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Rowntree</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, last week
became the reluctant target of a hostile, <MONEY>$3.9 billion</MONEY> bid from
<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest food company with interests in
chocolate and coffee.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>, which has acquired almost <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Rowntree</ORGANIZATION>, offered
<MONEY>$16.64</MONEY> a share for the company, which rejected the bid.
   The offer from <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> _ whose brands include <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s Crunch _
is said to be the largest by a non-British bidder for a British
company. <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Vevey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, also recently reached
an agreement to acquire the <ORGANIZATION>Buitoni SpA</ORGANIZATION> foods group, including its
<LOCATION>Perugina</LOCATION> chocolates business, from Italian businessman <ORGANIZATION>Carlo de
Benedetti</ORGANIZATION>.
   Separately, competing suitor <PERSON>Jacobs Suchard</PERSON>, another Swiss
company with chocolate and coffee interests, has amassed a <PERCENT>21
percent</PERCENT> stake in <LOCATION>Rowntree</LOCATION>, which didn't welcome that move, either.
   Zurich-based <PERSON>Jacobs Suchard</PERSON>, which makes the triangular
Toblerone chocolate bars, initially paid <MONEY>$11.78</MONEY> a share for its
Rowntree shares.
   Rowntree's shares finished at <MONEY>$17.30</MONEY>, up <MONEY>nine cents</MONEY>, on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> currently has a <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> share and <ORGANIZATION>Suchard</ORGANIZATION>, <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT>,
of the British chocolate market.
   ``What it is all about is globalization of consumer products
markets,'' said <PERSON>David Lang</PERSON>, a food analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Henderson Crosthwaite</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``You have the multinational companies at the moment trying to
accumulate tremendous brand strength in a narrow product line, but
internationally.''
   Lang added: ``The scramble for shelf space is some of it and the
big brands are the only ones that can get it.''
   ``Satellite advertising and international travel are creating a
greater homogenization,'' <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> said. ``The supermarket shelves of
the world are starting to look like one another.''
   Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a <ORGANIZATION>Quaker</ORGANIZATION> grocer's
shop in <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>northeast England</LOCATION>, in the <DATE>18th century</DATE>, had pre-tax
profit of <MONEY>$210 million</MONEY> on sales of <MONEY>$2.67 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  IN 1916, the Campbell Soup Co. published "Help for the Hostess," a booklet of
cooking-with-soup recipes. This was one of the earliest (if not the first)
examples of what has become a major branch of modern American cookery, not to
mention product promotion.;    Today more than 80 percent of the 325 million
cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup produced annually by Campbell's are used for
sauces, which pretty much defines back-of-the-box success.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THOSE ENDURING BACK-OF-BOX RECIPES
GOT A HANKERIN' FOR THAT CHIP DIP FROM PARTIES
PAST? MOM'S YUMMY RICE KRISPIES THINGIES? WAIT NO
MORE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story;  Michael McLaughlin is author of "The Back of the Box Gourmet"
(Simon and Schuster).;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 11/1/91, pg. 2E); 
Because of an editing error, the amount of margarine in a Food section recipe
for Rice Krispies Treats was incorrect. The recipe requires 1/4 cup margarine
or butter.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Test kitchens such as those at <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION>General Foods</ORGANIZATION> still produce
hundreds of recipes a year (always hoping for another enduring classic), and
millions of us still reach for the recipe printed on the box even before we
reach for knife, bowl or pan.;    Why, after nearly 30 years, are we still
stirring up <ORGANIZATION>Lipton's Famous California Dip</ORGANIZATION>? What is it, after 50 years, that
still leads us to crave <ORGANIZATION>Rice Krispies Treats</ORGANIZATION>? Why, even though the recipe is
60 years old, is it possible to find Toll House Cookie crumbs among the keys
of my word processor?;    These are tough questions. Scientists have disproved
the secret addictive substance theory, stating categorically that there is
nothing slipped into these simple, tasty recipes that causes us to begin
hungering for another batch at precisely the same moment the next semitrailer
load of the main ingredient arrives at our neighborhood supermarket.;    So,
if not narcotic, how about nostalgic?;    There is something uniquely American
about the belief that time saved in the kitchen is time that can be used to;
otherwise improve our quality of life. While it would be risky to credit
something like canned soup with the beginnings of women's liberation, it's
true that when Mom took off her apron and went to work outside the home, more
and more meals came from the back of the box.;    For many members of a
generation (or two), such speedy cuisine now constitutes "home cooking," and
when times are tough, it's easy for us to wax nostalgic about bar cookies made
from little more than melted marshmallows and crisp rice cereal. (For most of
the rest of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, it should be noted, back-of-the-box cooking isn't
nostalgic at all -- it's reality, there being even less time to spend in the
kitchen nowadays than there was when the <ORGANIZATION>Rice Krispies Treat</ORGANIZATION> was young.);   
For both the nostalgic and the merely hungry, certain back- of-the-box
classics have emerged over the years. Green Bean Bake, <ORGANIZATION>Toll House Cookies</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Lipton California Dip</ORGANIZATION> are still with us because they are so good, so easy and
so right.;    You might say the sour cream rises to the top.;    Famous onion
dip;    Who has not at one time succumbed to the hypnotic pleasure of this
way-of-life-in-a-bowl, with chips? It may seem as if <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has been whipping
up this dip for centuries but, in fact, it's a relatively new back-of-the-box
formula that first appeared on <LOCATION>Lipton</LOCATION>'s Onion Recipe Soup Mix, circa 1963.;   
When my pajama-clad brothers and I were small, huddled at the top of the
stairs listening to mysterious adult partying below, "onion dip" seemed the
height of grown-up sophistication. Later, when the three of us were allowed to
hold our own ersatz parties while our parents were away at the real thing, the
dip (plus smoked oysters, olives and cubes of Cheddar cheese on toothpicks,
washed down with 7UP) was always on the menu.;  THE FAMOUS LIPTON <LOCATION>CALIFORNIA</LOCATION>;
DIP RECIPE; 1 envelope Lipton Onion Recipe Soup Mix; 1 pint (16 ounces) sour
cream;   <ORGANIZATION>Blend Lipton Onion Recipe Soup Mix</ORGANIZATION> with sour cream in bowl. For
creamier dip, add more sour cream. Cover and chill. Makes about 2 cups.;   
Gilding the lily: While the point of any back-of-the-box recipe is speed,
letting the dip chill for a couple of hours or so and stirring it occasionally
will result in a smoother, better-tasting dip. The terminally hasty can speed
things up by stirring in 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk or cream.; (hbox);   
Ketchup in, and ketchup on, keeps the meat loaf moist and flavorful. This
classic from <ORGANIZATION>Heinz</ORGANIZATION> also includes an odd but tasty touch of pineapple, which is
especially nice if you include a bit of ground pork in place of some of the
beef.;  RED MAGIC MEAT LOAF; 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef; 1 cup soft bread
crumbs;  1/3 cup plus 1/4 cup Heinz Tomato Ketchup;  1/4 cup chopped onion; 1
egg, slightly beaten;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/8 teaspoon pepper;  1/4 cup
drained crushed pineapple;   Combine beef, bread crumbs, 1/3 cup ketchup,
onion, egg, salt and pepper in large bowl. Mix well. Form mixture into 8-by-4-
by-1 1/2-inch loaf and place in greased shallow baking pan. Bake at 350
degrees for 40 minutes. Remove from oven.;    Combine remaining 1/4 cup
ketchup with pineapple and spoon over top of loaf. Bake an additional 30
minutes. Let meat loaf stand 5 minutes before slicing. Makes 6 servings.;   
Gilding the lily: This meat loaf could use a touch more pepper. Also you can
replace about 1/3 of the beef with ground pork (not too lean, not too fat) for
a moister, better-tasting result.; (hbox);    This is it -- one of the seven
most popular <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Kitchens</ORGANIZATION> product recipes ever, chosen from a field of
more than 16,000, and perhaps the quintessential back-of-the-box formula. For
a generation or two of potluck suppers, church socials and other communal
gatherings, this uncomplicated casserole was easily the most familiar dish on
the table. As noted earlier, <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the Cream of Mushroom Soup that
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s sells every year is used in sauces, most, I'll wager, in this
classic vegetable side dish.;  CLASSIC GREEN BEAN BAKE; 1 10 3/4-ounce can
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup</ORGANIZATION>;  1/2 cup milk; 1 teaspoon soy
sauce;  Dash pepper; 4 cups cooked green beans (see note); 1 2.8-ounce can
french-fried onions;   Combine undiluted soup, milk, soy sauce and pepper in 1
1/2- quart casserole. Stir in green beans and 1/2 can onions. Bake at 350
degrees 25 minutes or until hot. Stir. Top with remaining onions and bake 5
minutes more. Makes 8 servings.;    Note: Buy 2 9-ounce packages frozen cut
green beans (thawed and cooked) or 2 16-ounce cans cut green beans (drained)
or about 1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, cooked, for this recipe.;    Gilding
the lily: For a crunchier texture, substitute French-cut green beans, thawed
and drained but otherwise uncooked. Shoestring potato sticks (do they still
exist?), sliced almonds, packaged croutons or cubes of fresh white bread can
be used on top of -- but not stirred into -- the beans. Add them about halfway
through the cooking process and bake until lightly browned.; (hbox);    Unlike
most of the best-known back-of-the-box recipes, this all-American cookie
classic began long ago and far away from any corporate test kitchen. In <DATE>1930</DATE>,
at the <ORGANIZATION>Toll House Inn</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Whitman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ruth Wakefield</PERSON> chopped a milk
chocolate bar into chunks and stirred them into a batch of dough for her
Butter Drop-Dos. She assumed that during the baking the chocolate would melt
and mix throughout the dough. She wanted chocolate cookies. What she got were
chocolate chunk cookies.;    With typical <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> frugality, she served
them anyway, and the cookies were a hit. She renamed them <ORGANIZATION>Chocolate Crispies</ORGANIZATION>,
and when the recipe appeared in a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> newspaper, regional sales of
chocolate bars boomed. The chocolate maker (<ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>) responded by producing a
small tool designed to cut chocolate bars into chunks and then turned out a
chocolate bar already scored to break apart into small bits.;    Such moments
of food destiny can only be appreciated in retrospect. Who can imagine a world
without chocolate chip cookies? Without <PERSON>Mrs. Fields</PERSON> and Famous Amos? What, no
<ORGANIZATION>Keebler</ORGANIZATION> elves?;    Fortunately, <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> bowed to the inevitable with
commendable mercenary grace, and in <DATE>1939</DATE> bought the <ORGANIZATION>Toll House</ORGANIZATION> name and began
manufacturing the semisweet chocolate "morsels" we bake today.;    After 40
years (and uncounted tons of warm cookies washed down with untold gallons of
ice-cold milk), <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s original agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>Toll House Inn</ORGANIZATION> expired.
They were now allowed to alter the original recipe and did so slightly,
eliminating the direction to sift the flour, omitting the tiny amount of water
called for, shortening the baking time by two minutes and omitting the need to
grease the baking sheets.;    These minute changes were in response to modern
ingredients and modern impatience to cut to the chase -- in this case, a
molten chipper snarfed straight from the cookie sheet. Tampering with a
successful back-of-the-box formula is a tricky business, akin to omitting one
altogether, but for the most part <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s changes have been well received. A
few crotchety duffers (I among them) insist the original original makes the
better cookie. Here it is.;  THE ORIGINAL ORIGINAL TOLL HOUSE COOKIES; 1 cup
plus 2 tablespoons sifted flour;  1/2 teaspoon baking soda;  1/2 teaspoon
salt;  1/2 cup butter, softened, or shortening; 6 tablespoons granulated
sugar; 6 tablespoons brown sugar, packed;  1/2 teaspoon vanilla;  1/4 teaspoon
water; 1 egg; 1 package (1 cup) <ORGANIZATION>Nestle Toll House</ORGANIZATION> Semi-Sweet Chocolate
Morsels;  1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts;   Sift together flour, baking soda
and salt in bowl and set aside. Combine in separate bowl butter, granulated
and brown sugars, vanilla and water. Beat until creamy. Beat in egg. Add flour
mixture and mix well. Stir in chocolate morsels and walnuts. Drop by
well-rounded half teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees
10 to 12 minutes. Makes 50 cookies.; (hbox);    There can be no denying the
easy appeal of a cookie or bar that requires no baking. This back-of-the-box
favorite, developed in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>, has long been a staple in houses where
ravenous kids, sudden company or midnight hungries disrupt otherwise well-laid
plans. As with many of the most enduring and effective back-of-the-box
formulas, it almost seems as if these treats have usurped the original purpose
of the product in question. I know there must be people who eat <PERSON>Rice Krispies</PERSON>
for breakfast, but who and where are they? Three ingredients (good keepers
all), two pans and about five minutes of work are all it takes to create this
sweet, spontaneous snack.;  RICE KRISPIES TREATS; 2 1/4 cup margarine or
butter; 1 10-ounce package (about 40) regular marshmallows or 4 cups miniature
marshmallows (use fresh marshmallows for best results); 6 cups <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s Rice
Krispies cereal;   Melt margarine in large saucepan over low heat. Add
marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add cereal,
stirring until well coated.;    Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press
mixture evenly into buttered 13-by-9-by-2-inch pan. Cut into 2-inch squares.
Makes 24 squares.;    Gilding the Lily: Stir 1 cup raisins or 1 cup peanuts
(or a combination) into the mixture along with the cereal. Stir 1/4 cup peanut
butter into the marshmallow mixture just before adding the cereal.  </TEXT>

EASY-TO-MAKE GIFTS THAT ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART AND THE KITCHEN;

<P>
HOLIDAYS: FOODS THAT FREEZE WELL OR DON'T REQUIRE REFRIGERATION MAKE THE SAFEST 
EDIBLE PRESENTS.

<P>
A flood of letters overwhelms The Times Food Section this time of year with 
requests for making ahead and mailing edible gifts to loved ones both near and 
far. There's something extra special about gifts of food -- they show 
thoughtfulness and are the perfect addition to a holiday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Foods that freeze well, such as quick breads and muffins, or those that require 
no refrigeration, such as cookies, candies, preserves, sauces and cakes travel 
and store best. They can be frozen or covered tightly and sealed, then 
decorated in festive wrappers that boast the colors of the season. Dress up 
packages with ribbons and holly leaves and include the recipe so the recipient 
can make them next year. 
</P>
<P>
Proper wrapping is essential to ensure the quality of the gift, regardless of 
the type of food that is stored. Without it, it is impossible to preserve color 
or flavor. After consulting several published sources on the subject, The Times 
was able to compile the following suggestions for freezing, storing and mailing 
edible gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a moisture / vapor-proof wrapping paper that is intended for freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When foil is used as a wrapper, heavy foil is preferred. Put foil-wrapped 
bundles in plastic bags for additional protection against punctures or holes in 
the freezer compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wax paper doesn't provide adequate protection and isn't recommended for 
freezing. But transparent plastic wrap, with its tremendous clinging quality 
that eliminates air pockets, is very pliable and an acceptable covering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure all containers are clean or sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't freeze cake batter, cream fillings, puddings and custards, mayonnaise 
or potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wrap cookies, cakes, breads and candies individually in plastic and store 
in airtight containers for maximum freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freeze fragile or irregularly shaped items on a baking sheet, then wrap as 
desired. But do not leave in the freezer more than 24 hours since unwrapped 
goods develop off flavors. A few hours to stiffen should be sufficient for 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fill containers with shredded tissue paper or packing straw to keep fragile 
gifts from breaking. Do not use popcorn or other edibles that may absorb fumes 
during transit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use freezer tape or fabric tape to seal lids of containers that might open 
or spill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep perishable foods refrigerated or frozen until ready to eat. Provide 
instructions for thawing and serving, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Label everything. 
</P>

SHOPPING: LESS IS MORE: NO FAT, NO YOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cholesterol watchers can look forward to the debut this month of a new 
cholesterol-free egg noodle substitute. 
</P>
<P>
The word "substitute" may sound like a warning that you'll be getting a poor 
imitation of the real thing. But these noodles cook, look and taste like 
regular egg pasta. 
</P>
<P>
They're called No Yolks, in honor of the absence of the cholesterol-rich 
portion of the egg. The noodles do include eggs -- but only the whites. The 
other ingredients are enriched durum wheat flour and enriched corn flour, which 
provides a faint egg-yolk color. 
</P>
<P>
No Yolks can be used in any noodle dish -- salads, main dishes, soups and so 
forth. Manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Foulds Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Libertyville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, they come in three 
widths -- medium, broad and extra-broad -- and cost about <MONEY>$1.25</MONEY> for a 12-ounce 
bag. They'll be introduced in some independent markets next week, in Hughes 
Markets the following week, with wider distribution anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the nutrition information on the product label, a 2-ounce serving 
(dry measure) of No Yolks contains 210 calories, 10 fewer than 2 ounces of 
regular egg noodles. Protein and carbohydrate content are the same. Fat content 
is 1 gram lower (2 grams in No Yolks, 3 in regular egg noodles). Interestingly, 
the sodium content is higher -- 40 milligrams in No Yolks compared to 10 in 
regular noodles. But the cholesterol content drops to 0 in the substitute 
compared to 51 milligrams (a <ORGANIZATION>United States Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> figure) in 
conventional egg noodles. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Health Valley Foods Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <ORGANIZATION>Irwindale</ORGANIZATION>, has recently launched several fat-free 
items. 
</P>
<P>
The first to appear, in <DATE>May</DATE>, were fat-free cookies, little powerhouses of fiber 
and fruit that come in five flavors: apple, date, Hawaiian fruit, apricot and 
raisin-oatmeal. Reading the label is like scanning the shelves at a 
natural-foods store. The Hawaiian fruit cookies contain a whole-grain-and-fiber 
blend made of organic whole wheat and oats; concentrated pineapple, pear and 
apple juices; papaya, pineapple, raisins, dates, banana flakes and mango. They 
also contain soy lecithin, high-chromium yeast and dulse, a sea vegetable that 
functions as a source of dietary fiber and as a thickening agent. Three of 
these cookies provide 75 calories, 3 grams dietary fiber, no cholesterol and 
less than 1 milligram of fat. 
</P>
<P>
The "fat-free" label for products that contain a trace of fat is perfectly 
legitimate, according to <PERSON>Bernie Landes</PERSON>, director of education at <ORGANIZATION>Health Valley 
Foods</ORGANIZATION>. "There is no food that is <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> fat-free unless it is synthetic," he 
said, explaining that small amounts of oil occur naturally in whole grains and 
tiny traces of fat may appear even in fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations give companies a choice of declaring less than 1 milligram of fat 
on the label or rounding off to the nearest gram. And a product with a 
naturally occurring but nutritionally insignificant quantity of fat is entitled 
to be called fat-free, <PERSON>Landes</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Health Valley introduced fat-free muffins and fruit bars in <DATE>July</DATE>, followed by 
jumbo cookies later that month. Look for these products in supermarkets and 
also in natural foods stores. You'll pay about <MONEY>$1.89</MONEY> for a package of 16 small 
or 9 jumbo cookies; the muffins are <MONEY>$2.69</MONEY> for six, and the individually 
packaged fruit bars retail for about <MONEY>$2.49</MONEY> for a package of four. 
</P>
<P>
Another product aimed at the health-conscious customer is <PERSON>Spicer</PERSON>'s Wheat 
Snacks. These are tiny hollow morsels that look like kibble or bits of elbow 
macaroni. They are made from expanded wheat kernels and are intended to keep 
you feeling so full you won't be tempted to consume rich, fattening foods. 
</P>
<P>
Flavors include natural, chocolate, Cheddar cheese, barbecue and sour cream and 
onion. The natural flavor tastes sweet, as does the chocolate, which has a dark 
chocolate color but not its distinctive flavor. Spicer's suggests combining 
either of these with low-fat milk for a breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-ounce packs are handy to carry about when you're on the run and 
unable to stop for a conventional meal. Although the snacks contain no 
cholesterol, they are not fat-free. A 1-ounce serving contains 5 grams of fat 
and 100 calories, according to the label. And the ingredients list indicates 
that corn oil has been added. 
</P>
<P>
The snacks sell for about <MONEY>99 cents</MONEY> a pack, and they're available at a variety 
of outlets, including major chain markets.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of sweet-toothed buyers, sellers and
distributors stepped into a child's fantasy <DATE>Friday</DATE> as they wandered
from booth to booth at a candy convention sampling free chocolates,
picture cookies and Gummy bears.
   And they had plenty to smile about: Candy industry news is
sugar-coated.
   Americans will spend about <MONEY>$12 billion dollars</MONEY> this year to
consume about <MONEY>5 billion pounds</MONEY> of chocolate and non-chocolate
treats _ nearly 20 pounds per person. In the past five years, the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> confectionery business has grown <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>
annually, according to industry figures.
   ``Candy is rolling strong,'' said <PERSON>Jerry Prescott</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>DEBS</ORGANIZATION>, a confectionery distributor that tracks candy sales and
trends. ``Chocolate is still an in-thing. The concerns over acne
have been kind of disproven, you've got the dollar up so some
pretty big advertisers are coming in.''
   At the 43rd annual <ORGANIZATION>National Candy Wholesalers Association</ORGANIZATION>
convention, which began <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and ends <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, there was little
talk of cavities or the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> surgeon general's report earlier this
week about the importance of good nutrition in preventing diseases.
   ``The whole issue of health has dissipated so much,'' said
<PERSON>Shelley Grossman</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Candy Wholesalers Association</ORGANIZATION>.
``As consumers have become more aware of their own health, they are
much more likely to treat themselves to something like candy.''
   Scant few granola bars or health snacks could be found on the
convention floor, though companies like <ORGANIZATION>Quaker Oats</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Veryfine</ORGANIZATION>
juices had displays and microwave popcorn appeared popular.
   New sweets like Boogers, green and squishy and designed to look
like the real thing, and Slime Slurps, gummy monsters that change
color, had glitzy booths. Old reliables touted their time-tested
sweets.
   ``Pez is more than a candy _ it's a system,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Pez Candy Co.</ORGANIZATION>
president <PERSON>Scott McWhinnie</PERSON>, popping open a new Garfield dispenser to
demonstrate. ``It's great tasting and fun to play with at the same
time.''
   Pez was developed in <DATE>1927</DATE> in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, and the dispenser
was introduced, sans heads, in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in <DATE>1950</DATE>. Character heads and
flavors were added in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1952</DATE>. Today Americans
consume about <MONEY>1 billion</MONEY> Pez candies anually, <PERSON>McWhinnie</PERSON> said.
   But until recently, the company hadn't resolved the common
childhood lament: Pez topple over. ``Pez dispensers have feet,''
<PERSON>McWhinnie</PERSON> said, proudly. ``Now they stand up.''
   Tucked in a corner of a floor redolent of chocolate, <PERSON>Martin B.
Palmer</PERSON>, the president of the the 110-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Palmer Candy Co.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Sioux City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, was handing out the LaFama, a chopped pecan and
cream bar covered in chocolate.
   The company uses 90-year-old copper kettles to make the bars,
which bear the same goofy package lettering used when the bar
debuted in <DATE>1914</DATE>.
   ``Good candy doesn't go out of style,'' said <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON>, 31, the

<LEADPARA>  I USUALLY spend New Year's Eve with several close friends: First an early
dinner in our favorite Chinese restaurant, then a movie, and we're ready to
welcome the new year in a festive and frivolous mood. What could be more
elegant than returning to a gorgeously rich array of desserts and iced
champagne in the coziness of one's own home?;   Picture a table of crepes
filled with chocolate, fruits and luxurious creams. Most of the preparation
can be done ahead, so pull out all the stops and use your best china and
crystal flutes. Have the champagne chilled and an urn of coffee ready to be
poured. This will truly be a memorably sweet ending to 1991.  </LEADPARA>

<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AS I WALKED into Louis Smith's kitchen, I knew I was in the home of a serious
cook. The diffused light, which poured through the stained glass window over
the sink, played upon the stately two-story high oak cabinetry and matching
oak floor as Louis took me on a tour. Louis and his wife, Marie,
custom-designed the kitchen to suit their cooking and entertaining style. In
the large kitchen island, Louis had two pull-out shelves installed under the
counter to hold his mixer and processor. At the flip of a wrist, each shelf
moves up to the level of the counter top so Louis can easily prepare recipes
which call for these appliances.;    In one section of the kitchen is a
floor-to-ceiling cabinet designed to store table linens. In another section is
a cabinet which conceals a mirrored wet bar complete with glass shelves to
hold an impressive collection of stemware.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SMITH'S KITCHEN IS HOME OF TRUE COOK
FREMONT MAN FIXED FIRST PIE AT AGE 12  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Weekly Cook  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "I have always enjoyed cooking," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "I was inspired to cook at an
early age by my Portuguese grandfather and my mother, both of whom were good
cooks. I was 12 years old the first time I ever cooked anything. My mother and
father were gone for the day and I made them a lemon meringue pie from a
cookbook recipe. When Mom came home, she said that the pie was absolutely
beautiful and delicious, but she thought that I had successfully dirtied every
dish in the house.;    "I don't like following a recipe, though, anymore,"
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "I think the most important thing when creating a meal is to be
directed by what pleases your palate.";    <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> enjoy cooking
together, making feasts for friends and family. "When my son <PERSON>Dan</PERSON> got married
<DATE>three years ago</DATE>, we made a gourmet dinner for his rehearsal. The menu included
homemade eggplant Parmesan, beef <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION>, soup, salad and my homemade white
chocolate cake.";    <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION> enjoys cooking for large groups. One <ORGANIZATION>Valentine's
Day</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> created a theme feast for some special friends.;    "Our
main dish was individual salmon Wellingtons which were covered with my own
puff pastry and decorated with three puff pastry hearts," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "For the
soup course, we made a puree of red bell peppers and cheddar cheese. Each
guest found their place at the table with chocolate heart name plates which I
designed.";    <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION>'s ability to create a calming atmosphere is critical in
his <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> business: <PERSON>Berge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pappas</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Smith Mortuary</ORGANIZATION>. "My occupation is a
challenge. The loss of a loved one is one of the most difficult times in
people's lives," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.;    "It is up to us to be able to do things for
people at a time when they need help. I consider the people that I work with
not as just business clients, but as friends.";    Once a year at <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>
time, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> honors the Catholic families that he has served with a special
mass at the Holy Family of the Dominican Sisters in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>. "We have over 300
people attending each year.";    After the mass, he hosts a reception with
cookies coffee and tea. "I am the cookie maker and I usually bake about 50
different varieties.";    Since <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> believes cookies are appropriate goodies
any time of the year, he shares some of his favorite recipes for summertime
munching.;     LINZERTORTE COOKIES; 1 1/2 cups (8 ounces) unblanched almonds;

<TEXT>  HOMEMADE GRAPE NUTS;  3 1/2 cups graham flour;  1 1/2 cups light brown sugar; 
1 teaspoon salt;  1 teaspoon baking soda;  2 teaspoons cinnamon;  2 cups
buttermilk;  2 teaspoons vanilla;   Combine dry ingredients; add buttermilk
and vanilla. Mix well. Spread on well-greased jelly roll pan and smooth out.
Bake at 350 for 50 to 60 minutes.;    Let the pan cool overnight. The
following day, break into pieces (granola size). Place these on cookie sheets
(will fill two, each one layer high). Toast in 250 degree oven for 30 to 35
minutes. When cool, store in air-tight containers.;    Note: <PERSON>Ferguson</PERSON> adds
sliced almonds and raisins or other dried fruits to the grape nuts.; 
Raspberry muffins;  <PERSON>Marge Healy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, misplaced a recipe for raspberry
muffins made with raspberry wine. <LOCATION>Alberta Dellamaggiore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, came to the
rescue with this one:;    RASPBERRY MUFFINS;  3 cups flour;  1 tablespoon
baking powder;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/8 teaspoon soda;  1/2 cup margarine or
butter;  1 cup sugar;  1 teaspoon vanilla;  2 eggs;  1/2 cup raspberry wine; 
1/2 cup water;  1 cup coarsely chopped fresh or frozen raspberries;   Lightly
grease muffin cups or line with paper baking cups; set aside. Reserve 3
tablespoons flour. In a mixing bowl, stir together remaining flour, baking
powder, salt and baking soda; set aside.;    In a large mixer bowl, beat
margarine or butter with an electric mixer on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add
sugar and vanilla; beat until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well.; 
  Stir together wine and water. Add flour mixture and liquid alternately to
beaten mixture, beating on low speed after each addition just until combined.
Toss together reserved flour and berries; gently fold into batter. Spoon
batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in a 400 oven for 18 to 20 minutes.
Serve warm. Makes 16 to 18 muffins.;  Buckwheat cakes;  <PERSON>Claire Mundt</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>, requested a recipe for buckwheat pancakes made from scratch. <PERSON>Tammy
Raetz</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View</ORGANIZATION>, sent this recipe. She said that when the cakes are made
frequently -- three times a week, for example -- fresh yeast will not be
required if a little more than a pint of the batter is reserved each time and
kept in a cool place and then used instead of the yeast. Molasses in buckwheat
cakes gives them a good color.;    RAISED BUCKWHEAT; PANCAKES;  2 cups boiling
water;  1/2 cup cornmeal;  1/2 cake yeast;  1/4 cup lukewarm water;  1
tablespoon molasses;  1 teaspoon salt;  2 cups buckwheat flour;  1/4 teaspoon

place to rise over night. It should rise and fall again by morning. Add soda
dissolved in hot milk; stir well and bake cakes on a hot greased griddle.
Makes 20.;  Truffles a la microwave;  <PERSON>Marian Crowel</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, took classes
in microwave cooking recently and wanted to share her knowledge of making
truffles via the microwave. She sent this recipe.;    MICROWAVE CHOCOLATE;

or nut inserted in center. Cover by dipping in white, melted chocolate. Place
on wax paper until set.;     Calls for help;  <PERSON>Carol Koyama</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, is
looking for the following recipes:;    (check) "Sour cream oatmeal cookies.
They're like regular oatmeal cookies except the sour cream gives them an extra

<TEXT>
<P>
Having a hard time figuring out what to pack in your child's lunch box? You're 
not alone. When we asked some of the best caterers in town to come up with 
interesting new ideas for school lunches, the repetition was amazing. There 
were lots of peanut butter sandwiches, chicken or turkey in abundance, and more 
celery than you can shake a stick at. For dessert -- cookies, of course. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lesson here; these caterers understand the aesthetics of eating. They 
know that no food critic is more exacting (or more of a traditionalist) than a 
child, and that the last thing any kid wants is to show up at school with Mom's 
latest experiment. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to kids, caterers know enough to stick with the tried and true. 
And we know that if you try these recipes, your kids will be very happy when 
lunchtime rolls around.

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Gary Parker -- Mercury News; Dolce torinese, upper left, and

(Color)  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  ITALY; ETHNIC; FOOD; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  FOOD historian Waverley Root says, "It's not the pasta that puts the weight on
in Italy, it's the dolci.";    Dolci means sweets, but it's the catchall term
for Italian desserts. You may be thinking less about dessert as you shoehorn
into this summer's beachwear, but the concept of no-bake Italian desserts may
make you think again, especially if their names roll seductively off the
tongue, such as zuccotto, dolce torinese, zabaglione and cassata.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DOLCI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The name zuccotto is derived from zucca, the Italian word for pumpkin,
because zuccotto looks like a halved pumpkin sitting on a plate. A pink
pumpkin, but a pumpkin nonetheless. Zuccotto is nothing more than a dome of
booze-soaked pound cake or spongecake filled with flavored whipped cream. Some
recipes call for pastry cream as well, but I've never tasted a zuccotto that
was as good or as simple as mine (not bragging, you understand).;    And to
make your life even easier in these lazy-hazy days of <DATE>summer</DATE>, you can buy
rather than bake the pound cake. I used to make my own pound cake for this
recipe, until I realized I couldn't tell the difference between it and <PERSON>Sara
Lee</PERSON>'s after a good soaking in orange liqueur and cognac. And frozen pound cake
is easier to work with.;    Though dolce torinese is called a chocolate loaf,
it's basically a very large candy bar. Eat your heart out, Mars and Hershey:
Dolce torinese has you beat by a mile. Waiters in my first restaurant used to
fight over this one.;    Zabaglione is a simple custard made with Marsala
wine. Though classically it is made tableside by tuxedo-clad waiters in
overpriced Italian restaurants, I think that version is too rich. By chilling
zabaglione and cutting it with whipped cream (if one can indeed "cut" anything
with whipped cream), the flavor is less intense. Chilled zabaglione can be
served with poached fruit -- pears are ideal -- or fresh berries.;    Or, you
can make zabaglione ice cream and serve it with a homemade butterscotch
sauce.;    <LOCATION>Cassata</LOCATION> is a Sicilian specialty usually served at <LOCATION>Easter</LOCATION>. There are
a million versions of this dessert, most of them achingly sweet with fondant
icing, marzipan and glaceed fruit. Some are molded, much like zuccotto. And
sometimes cassata is frozen. But the one constant is candied fruit.;    The
cassata I like is a split pound cake layered with flavored ricotta cheese and
frosted with chocolate.;    Assuming you buy a pound cake, none of these
desserts require turning on the oven. And only the zabaglione and amaretto
mousse necessitate using the top of the stove. Nuts can be toasted in the
microwave oven and chocolate can be melted the same way. (Note: Times for
melting chocolate and toasting nuts are for low-power ovens. Lower the time if
you have a high-power oven.); ZUCCOTTO; 2 ounces each, almonds and filberts; 2
ounces walnuts, chopped; 6 ounces semisweet chocolate; 1 envelope (2 1/2
teaspoons) plain gelatin; 2 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup orange liqueur;  1/4 cup
cognac or brandy;  1/2 cup grenadine; 3 cups heavy cream;  1/2 cup
confectioners' sugar (adjust to taste);   <LOCATION>Cheesecloth</LOCATION>; 1 16-ounce pound cake
or spongecake;   Arrange almonds and filberts on a dish in a single layer and
toast in a microwave oven at full power for 5 minutes or until lightly
toasted. Chop coarsely, add to walnuts and set aside. Break 4 ounces of the
chocolate into 1-ounce pieces and melt in the microwave oven at full power for
3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Chop the remaining chocolate coarsely and add to
the nuts.;    In a small cup, sprinkle gelatin over two tablespoons of orange
liqueur. Let set several minutes to soften. Combine remaining orange liqueur
with cognac and grenadine, set aside. Heat gelatin mixture just until gelatin
dissolves. Let cool. Whip cream with sugar. Add gelatin mixture and beat until
stiff. Refrigerate.;    Line a 2-quart bowl with damp cheesecloth. Cut pound
cake into 3/8-inch slices. Then cut about 1/3 of the slices in half on the
diagonal, making triangles. Moisten one side of each piece with the liqueur
mixture. Fit pieces around the inside of the bowl, with moistened sides facing
the cheesecloth. The points of the triangles should be pointing toward the
bottom center of the bowl. Pieces should fan out, forming a star-burst
pattern. Once the bottom layer is formed, you can place slices whole around
the upper sides of the bowl in brick-like fashion. Fill in any gaps with bits
of pound cake. (The pattern need not be perfect. It will show up quite well
when it is unmolded.) The cake should just reach the top of the bowl.;   
Brush the inside of the mold with the liqueur mixture. Take 2/3 of the whipped
cream and mix in the nuts and chopped chocolate. Divide this mixture in half.
Pour half the chocolate-nut mixture in the zuccotto cavity, leveling it. Mix
the other half with the melted chocolate. Add this to the zuccotto cavity,
leveling it. Add the plain whipped cream as the final layer, leveling it so
that it settles just below (about 3/8 inch) the outer layer of cake.;    Fit
the remaining pieces of pound cake over the last layer of whipped cream,
dipping one side in the liqueur mixture first, as above. Fashion them any way
that works to cover the last layer of whipped cream. When done, brush the top
with the remaining liqueur mixture.;    Put a plate on top of the mold, wrap
the bowl with plastic wrap, then refrigerate (or freeze) it several hours or
overnight. To unmold, invert onto a plate. Remove the bowl and cheesecloth.
Cut into wedges. Serves 10 to 12.;    (hbox);    DOLCE TORINESE; 1 1/2  cups
(about 5 ounces) almonds;  1/2 pound semisweet chocolate, cut in small pieces;
 1/4 cup rum;   Vegetable oil or cooking spray;  1/2 pound softened butter; 2
tablespoons sugar; 2 eggs, separated;   <ORGANIZATION>Pinch</ORGANIZATION> salt; 12 butter biscuits such as
Petits Beurre or Social Tea, broken into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch pieces; 
Confectioners' sugar;   Whipped cream (optional);   Arrange almonds on a dish
in a single layer and put in a microwave oven at full power 5 minutes, or
until lightly toasted. Chop coarsely and set aside. Melt chocolate in the
microwave at full power 4 minutes. Combine with rum and set aside.;    Lightly
grease the inside of a 1 1/2-quart loaf pan with vegetable oil or cooking
spray. Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add sugar,
then egg yolks, one at a time. With a rubber spatula, stir in almonds and
chocolate. With clean blades, whip egg whites and salt until stiff but not
dry. Stir half the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the
remainder, blending just until white no longer shows. Fold in cookie pieces,
omitting crumbs.;    Spoon mixture into loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate several hours or more. Run a thin knife around the sides of the
loaf pan and invert onto a serving platter to unmold. Smooth sides and top
with a flexible spatula and sieve confectioners' sugar on top. Cut loaf into
slices and serve with whipped cream on the side, if desired. Serves 8.;    --
Adapted from "The Cooking of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>" by <ORGANIZATION>Waverley Root</ORGANIZATION> (Time-Life Books);
(hbox);    ZABAGLIONE; 5 tablespoons sugar; 2 egg yolks;  1/4 cup dry Marsala
wine;  1/2 cup heavy cream;   In a heat-proof bowl or the top half of a double
boiler, combine sugar and yolks until thoroughly incorporated. Add Marsala and
stir well. Put bowl over gently simmering water and stir with a whisk until
mixture becomes thick and you can begin to see the bottom of the bowl as you
stir, about 8 to 10 minutes.;    At this point, zabaglione can be served hot,
in stemmed glasses with a macaroon cookie on the side.;    To serve cold, with
poached fruit or fresh berries, chill zabaglione. Whip cream until stiff. Fold
into zabaglione and pour over fruit. Serves 4.;    <LOCATION>CASSATA</LOCATION>; 1 pound ricotta
cheese; 2 tablespoons heavy cream;  3/4 cup sugar; 3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup
orange liqueur;  1/2 cup mixed candied fruit, coarsely chopped; 3 ounces
semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped;  1/4 cup rum or cognac; 1 pound cake,
about 10 inches long and 3 inches wide; 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut in
1-inch pieces;  3/4 cup espresso or strong coffee;  1/2 pound chilled butter,
cut in 1/2-inch pieces;   Put ricotta through a food mill or sieve. Then beat
with cream, sugar and 3 tablespoons of orange liqueur with an electric mixer
until smooth. Fold in candied fruit and chocolate and refrigerate.;    Combine
rum or cognac with remaining orange liqueur. Trim and square off edges of
pound cake. Slice lengthwise into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slabs. Drizzle about 2
tablespoons of liqueur mix over each slab.;    Put bottom slab of pound cake
in the middle of the platter. Spread flavored ricotta over the slab. Place
another slab on top and repeat the process until all slabs and ricotta filling
are used up, ending with a plain piece of cake on top. Smooth sides and even
up slabs so they are in alignment.;    Put the 12 ounces of chocolate in a
covered microwave-proof dish and put in a microwave oven at full power for 4
1/2 minutes. Stir in coffee. Place in the mixing bowl of an electric mixer and
beat in chilled butter, one piece at a time, until the mixture is smooth.
Chill frosting until it is spreadable consistency. With a flexible metal
spatula, frost the cake, leaving enough frosting to decorate with a pastry
bag. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours before serving. Serves 8 to 10.;
AMARETTO MOUSSE; 2 packets gelatin (about 4 teaspoons);  3/4 cup Amaretto; 8
eggs, separated;  3/4 cup sugar; 2 cups heavy cream;   Pinch salt;   Sprinkle
gelatin over 1/4 cup of the Amaretto. Put over low heat and remove when
mixture turns clear. Set aside. Mix yolks and sugar well. Add remaining
Amaretto and put in the top half of a double boiler. Stir with a whisk over
moderate heat until it thickens slightly, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from
heat, mix in the gelatin and let cool, stirring a few times.;    Whip cream
until soft peaks form. Whip egg whites with salt until soft peaks form. Fold
whipped cream into egg yolk mixture. Fold in egg whites. Pour into a serving
bowl or wine goblets. Serves 10.  </TEXT>

Watergate salad in the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News Food Section</ORGANIZATION> and that set her to
reminiscing. "In the '70s, my mom made a Watergate cake and I have always
wondered about the name," she wrote. "Was it just a sign of the time or was
there something more? I have never been able to find the name of the
originator. I guess it must be part of a coverup."; WATERGATE CAKE WITH
COVER-UP ICING; Cake:; 1 package white cake mix; 3 eggs; 1/2 cup coconut; 1 3
1/2-ounce package instant pistachio pudding; 3/4 cup salad oil; 1 cup 7UP; 1
cup chopped nuts; Icing:; 2 envelopes Dream Whip; 1 1/2 cups milk; 1 3
1/2-ounce package instant pistachio pudding; 1/2 cup coconut; 3/4 cups chopped
nuts; Mix cake ingredients and pour into greased and floured 9-by-13-inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes.;   Beat Dream Whip, milk and pudding
until very thick. Spread on cooled cake and sprinkle coconut and nuts on top.;
Tangy jam; <PERSON>Joe Malone</PERSON> of Saratoga thanks readers for the recipe for tomato
jam.;   He enclosed a recipe for tomato preserves. "My mother sent this to me
years ago when I was complaining about too many tomatoes. I have successfully
used it for a number of years but discovered that it doesn't use up many
tomatoes," he wrote. The recipe comes from the <DATE>August 1941</DATE> Better Homes and
Gardens.; OLD-FASHIONED TOMATO; PRESERVES; 2 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes; 1/4 cup
lemon juice; Grated rind of 1 lemon; 6 1/2  cups sugar; 1 bottle fruit pectin;
 Peel tomatoes; cut in eighths or crush. Measure tomatoes; there should be 3
1/2 cups pulp. Cook over low heat 10 minutes. Add lemon juice and lemon rind.
Combine tomato mixture and sugar; bring to full rolling boil over high heat,
stirring constantly while cooking. Boil hard 2 minutes and then remove from
heat. Stir in fruit pectin. Skim and seal in hot, sterilized jars. Makes 6
1/2-pint jars.; Calls for help; <PERSON>Julie Normandin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> would like two
recipes: one for the cranberry-nut muffins like those sold at <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION>'s
Cafe. They are large and shaped like a small bundt cake. She also requests a
good pumpkin-nut muffin recipe.;   "I hope you and your readers will be able
to help me find a cookie recipe that my aunt gave me about 30 years ago,"
writes <PERSON>Anne Cavalli</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. The recipe was found in an insert in a flour
bag. Besides the usual ingredients such as sugar, baking soda, salt, butter,
the recipe called for a can of evaporated milk and 3 1/2 cups flour. The
batter was very thick and the cookies were almost cake-like.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  WHEN gingham dogs and calico cats replace frills and furbelows in the nation's

<TEXT>     Cost has something to do with it: <MONEY>$50</MONEY> will buy you a lot more brownies than

experts recommend food.;   "Food is the perfect gift that cannot be priced,"
said <PERSON>Jay Walker</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Catalog Media Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a marketing and promotional
agency. "If I am trying to save money and I buy you a sweater you'll know what
I spend. If I buy you a dozen figs from <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> do you have any idea what I
spent?";   Expounding on his theory that mail-order food is a no-risk gift,
<PERSON>Walker</PERSON> said: "You'll pay <MONEY>$18</MONEY> for 14 pears not because they are worth <MONEY>$18</MONEY> but
because 14 pears is a really neat gift. It's better than a sweater because
it's unique and I never met anyone who didn't like a pear or a pie. Nine out
of nine people like pears; two out of nine people like the sweater you bought
them.";   The mail-order packaging may not be elaborate, but the quality of
the food is as high as ever. To find the best products, all the gifts
considered for our list were purchased under names that would not be
recognized by the companies.;   Companies unable to fill the orders properly
or whose product arrived in poor condition were eliminated from
consideration.;   The shipping costs for some items, often as much as the

HOMEMADE CANDY IS ALWAYS PERFECT GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich evaporated milk serves as a delicious base for homemade candies -- a 
perfect gift for giving. Its creamy, smooth texture helps the candy remain 
moist and fresh for several days. 
</P>
<P>
But be sure to choose the right cooking pan to allow the candy ingredients to 
boil freely without running over. It should be heavy enough to keep candy from 
burning or sticking to the bottom. In general, the pan should be about four 
times as great in volume as the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Using a long wooden spoon that won't get too hot to handle is another plus for 
home candy makers. A candy thermometer is also a good buy since successful 
candy making depends on the temperature and the thermometer takes the guesswork 
out of testing the doneness. Be sure to remove candy from heat as you test for 
doneness so that overcooking does not occur. 
</P>
<P>
Start candy making with Chocolate-Covered Pecans and <ORGANIZATION>Caramel</ORGANIZATION>, or Turtles as 
they are more commonly called. This simple confection is ideal since it can be 
prepared in a relatively short time. 
</P>
<P>
In small saucepan, heat 1/4 cup butter or margarine and 1 cup evaporated milk 
until butter is melted. In separate 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, cook 1 
cup sugar, 1 cup dark corn syrup and 1/4 teaspoon salt until it reaches 
firm-ball stage (244 degrees). Stir often. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly pour in hot milk mixture so that sugar mixture does not stop boiling. 
Stir constantly. Cook mixture until candy reaches firm-ball stage again, then 
remove pan from heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and cool caramel to room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange 4 pecans per Turtle on wax paper and place heaping teaspoon of cooled 
caramel on each. Let cool until firm. Melt 1 (6-ounce) package semisweet 
chocolate pieces on top of double-boiler and spread over caramel. Let cool 
until hardened. 
</P>
<P>
To give chocolate shiny, hard coating, add 1 to 2 tablespoons melted paraffin 
wax to chocolate, if desired.

TREATS FOR MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican Independence <DATE>Day this weekend</DATE> will no doubt inspire a round of 
celebrations. Since parties usually mean chips and dips, this is the time to 
try out a crunchy, full-flavored chip that is authentically Mexican but not 
commonly known: duritos. 
</P>
<P>
Think of duritos as a cross between Indonesian shrimp chips, pasta and 
chicharrones. Raw, they look like strips of hard, ridged, translucent pasta. 
When deep-fried, they puff up like shrimp chips. And they look a little like 
chicharrones -- crisp-fried pork cracklings that also make good snacks. The 
difference is, duritos are made from flour and not from meat. 
</P>
<P>
The raw chips are manufactured in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and exported to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. They're 
available here in a variety of markets, among them the Tianguis chain, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Grand Central Public Market</ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and Market Basket in 
<LOCATION>Lawndale</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can buy bags of fried duritos processed by <ORGANIZATION>Del Mar Foods Co.</ORGANIZATION> of 
<LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION> and packaged under its <PERSON>Don Victor</PERSON> label. Del Mar produces duritos 
flavored with chili powder and lemon in two sizes -- small dippers and 
large-sized chips. The large chips are also available without seasoning, and 
the little dippers come in two additional flavors: shrimp and jalapeno. 
Tianguis carries the <PERSON>Don Victor</PERSON> chips. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street is a good source for another type of treat -- candy. The 
selection of typical Mexican dulces (sweets) displayed in stalls there includes 
biznaga, which is cactus candy. Biznaga is often cut fine and added to the 
filling for chiles en nogada -- fresh poblano chiles stuffed with meat, fruit 
and nuts and topped with walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds. It's a dish linked 
to pomegranate season, which is getting underway now. 
</P>
<P>
Look also for candied sweet potato (camote) and squash (calabaza). Coconut 
turns up in alfajores (blocks of white coconut candy tinted shocking pink on 
one side) and cocadas, baked confections that vendors define as macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
Pepitoria, the Mexican version of pralines, contains either peanuts or pecans. 
And there are individually wrapped circles of mazapan (marzipan) made of 
peanuts ground as fine as dust. 
</P>
<P>
Milk and sugar cooked together is the base for a number of candies including 
jamoncillo (bars of plain milk fudge); rosquilla (ridged bars of 
coconut-flavored milk fudge); marina (balls of milk fudge coated with chopped 
pecans); gorditas de leche (milk fudge patties) and leche quemada (burnt milk 
fudge). 
</P>
<P>
And there's still more -- balls of sweet-sour tamarind-flavored candy, rolls of 
guava paste, melcocha (taffy) and large cookies, either plain or coated with 
multicolored candy sprinkles (grajea). Look for the candies at the stands that 
line the center of the street. 
</P>
<P>
In some Olvera Street shops, you'll find equipment for cooking and serving 
Mexican meals. The <ORGANIZATION>Casa de Sousa</ORGANIZATION>'s stock of pottery includes stunning, large 
talavera-style bowls in deep blue and cream from <LOCATION>Guadalajara</LOCATION> and a hand-painted 
brown dinner set from <LOCATION>Michoacan</LOCATION>. Blue-rimmed, handblown glassware and 
ornamental tin service plates would create a striking table. On the practical 
side, there are molcajetes (rough stone mortars), tortilla presses and iron 
comales (griddles) on which to bake the tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Casa California</LOCATION> offers pottery bean pots and enormous cazuelas that could 
function as serving containers for a large gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Here you will find the highly effective aluminum lime squeezers that are 
manufactured in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. A larger size in the same design is used for oranges. 
Other kitchenware includes wooden spoons, rolling pins and molinillos, the 
wooden beaters that are used to froth hot chocolate. The shop also carries 
yarn-embroidered baskets for tortillas and has at least one of the large, 
unlined copper cazuelas in which Mexican cooks prepare sweets and other dishes.

<HEAD>School Board Bans Chocolate Milk At Lunch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEMBERTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chocolate milk, that longtime
mainstay of kids' lunches, won't be on the elementary schools' menu
come fall because the school board thinks it's unhealthy for
growing minds.
   Instead, a calcium-fortified orange drink may be offered.
   Some teachers and nurses who have expressed concern about
children having sweets at lunch requested the ban, Superintendent
<PERSON>Robert J. Moore</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The panel voted 5-4 this week to discontinue selling chocolate
milk at lunch to the 4,000 pupils in the township's 10 elementary
schools.
   <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said several school employees said they noticed children
who drank chocolate milk for lunch showed signs of hyperactivity in
the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   ``Whether that's scientifically qualified, I don't know,'' <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>
said.
   Chocolate milk outsells regular milk 2-1 at <ORGANIZATION>Aletta Crichton
Elementary School</ORGANIZATION>, Principal <PERSON>Gerald L. DeClementi</PERSON> said.
   ``That's eight cases of chocolate to four cases of white a
day,'' he said.
   DeClementi said he was unaware of behavior problems that might
be tied to the chocolate milk.
   Both he and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said they doubt the ban will provoke an outcry.
   But if it does, school board President <PERSON>Thomas Bridge</PERSON> said the
panel could change its decision.
   Bridge, who cast the tie-breaking vote, said he was a fan of the
banished beverage.
   ``I love chocolate milk,'' Bridge said. ``But yes, there is a
lot of merit to the fact that chocolate has an effect on children.''

<TEXT>
   Lovers seeking the sweetest of gifts on <ORGANIZATION>St.
Valentine</ORGANIZATION>'s Day would be wise to pay a visit to <PERSON>Joseph Schmidt</PERSON>, a
chocolatier for a queen and a president who has elevated
candy-making to an art.
   In his shop on a plain city street, pink and white candy tulips
lay on sculptured chocolate bowls, thin and smooth like porcelain,
hand-painted by the master.
   There are white chocolate swans with long slender necks, and
old-fashioned red velvet hearts, as large and plush as cushions,
stuffed with truffles. Chocolate Cupids float with bows drawn and
hot-lip lollipops beckon for a kiss.
   ``My goal is to create a dream for clients, to fulfill their
fantasies,'' said <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>, expressing the same childlike joy as the
hero of the movie ``<PERSON>Willy Wonka</PERSON> and the Chocolate Factory.''
   Like <PERSON>Wonka</PERSON>, everything <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON> makes is satisfying and delicious.
Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes.
   Some of <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>'s chocolate flowers and shell-like bowls are part
of a touring show of confection art organized by the <ORGANIZATION>American Craft
Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Joseph Schmidt Confections</PERSON>, a 5-year-old love affair of <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>
and partner <PERSON>Audrey Ryan</PERSON>, is no ordinary candy store. Its artistic
and tasty creations have delighted Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, former President
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and thousands of loyal customers.
   <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>, who said he's ``49 going on 30,'' once made a chocolate
replica of the Eiffel Tower for the French ambassador and a giant
panda holding bamboo shoots for a <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Foundation</ORGANIZATION> dinner with
<PERSON>Prince Phillip</PERSON>.
   It is not the size of <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>'s creations, though, that make them
so startling.
   Many of his finest works are small, with the attention to detail
of miniature portraits. The petals on long-stemmed chocolate tulips
are as delicately shaped as real tulips.
   The cost of all this effort? Schmidt works about four hours on
each of his sculptured bowls but sells them for only <MONEY>$20</MONEY>. Big
bonbons laced with liqueurs are <MONEY>$1</MONEY> apiece.
   ``We give away our product because we enjoy it so much,'' said
<PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>, who works almost as long as <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>'s 18-hour days.
   The two former pastry chefs and a staff of 90 people at their
chocolate factory and retail shop each week turn 40,000 pounds of
premium raw chocolate from <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> into treats for the sweet of
tooth.
   All that chocolate adds up to a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> a year business, <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON>
said.
   Valentine's Day, <ORGANIZATION>Easter</ORGANIZATION> and Christmas are their biggest holidays,
but it seems every week is special.
   Even <DATE>Groundhog Day earlier this month</DATE> was an excuse for candied
fantasies, with the cute chocolate animals springing up from the
shelves.
   ``We've created more of an art form,'' <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> said. ``That's <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>'s
love. He spends every night by himself creating.''
   The biggest problem with <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>'s Confections is that the
fragile sculptures don't travel well. For the <ORGANIZATION>American Craft Museum</ORGANIZATION>
show, which is traveling to museums around the country this year and
next, a museum courier had to hand-carry <PERSON>Schmidt</PERSON>'s goodies on the
plane.
   ``There is a sense of magic when you see <PERSON>Joseph Schmidt</PERSON>'s work,''
said <PERSON>Anthea Zonars</PERSON>, assistant curator at the <ORGANIZATION>American Craft Museum</ORGANIZATION>.
``You can go into a chocolate shop and find chocolate roses of all
types. But <PERSON>Joseph Schmidt</PERSON>'s are remarkable. I think they're
beautiful, and they make my mouth water.''
   Schmidt's sells truffles and bonbons by mail in this country and
in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. ``If you want a sculpture, though,'' <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> said, ``You
have to come here and carry it very carefully.''

Desserts in holiday gift catalogues always look tempting. But their prices can 
be hard to swallow. The solution? Make the desserts at home. 
</P>
<P>
What follows are recipes for some of the desserts available in this year's crop 
of mail-order gift catalogues. Some are recipes directly from mail-order 
companies, one comes from a local restaurant, and the rest are facsimiles of 
catalogue desserts developed in The <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times Test Kitchen. All make 
delicious gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to prepare the more perishable desserts at the last minute. The Gift 
Catalogue Strudel made with apples and ricotta cheese should be made no sooner 
than one day before giving. The Lemon Cake, Gift Carrot Cake, <ORGANIZATION>Chocolate Fudge 
Cake</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Macadamia Nut Bread</ORGANIZATION> all store well in the refrigerator for about a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few things to remember if you're mailing the desserts. The obvious: 
Be sure to allow plenty of time for mailing cakes cross-country -- especially 
during the holidays. The post office has delivery schedules you can check to 
calculate how many days your package will spend in transit. Using the proper 
mailing container is essential for on-time delivery. Tins are best for cookies. 
Heavy boxes will probably do fine for firm cakes. Perishable desserts such as 
strudel should be packed apropriately with dry ice and sent through a next-day 
delivery service. If in doubt about the proper packing equipment, leave the 
packing to a professional.

<LEADPARA>  LAST January, in the middle of a snowy Iowa winter, I felt uninspired by a
multitude of advertisements for ice cream treats. Now that warmer weather
approaches, I've looked at the ads again and noticed two new subtly promoted
products. I imagine they'll be more obvious in the weeks to come.;    Both of
these new "frozen novelties" carry bold yellow "sugar-free" banners on their
packages. Dove's sugar-free Three Musketeers Snack Bars are bite-size morsels
of chocolate-coated ice cream, while Nestle's sugar-free Lite Crunch is a
chocolate-coated "frozen dairy dessert" on a stick.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FAT COMPROMISES SUGAR-FREE TREATS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  On the Label  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     According to <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> policy, the label "sugar-free"
can only be used on foods made without nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.
Nutritive sweeteners contribute calories. They include sugar, corn syrup,
dextrose, fructose and honey.;    Current <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> regulations also require
"sugar-free" foods to fit the definitions for "low-calorie" or
"calorie-reduced" foods. Nutrition labels of reduced- and low-calorie foods
are supposed to include a nutrient comparison to a similar "regular" food.
Manufacturers of high-calorie sugar-free foods can get around this requirement
by placing a disclaimer on the package stating that the food is not reduced in
calories.;    Labels misleading;  Neither <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>'s sugar-free Lite Crunch nor
<ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s sugar-free <ORGANIZATION>Three Musketeers Snack Bars</ORGANIZATION> seems to fit the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s low- or
reduced-calorie definitions. They don't include comparative nutrient values on
the labels, nor could I find a disclaimer on either. I believe their labeling
is misleading.;    Take "sugar-free" on a package label as another promotional
"red flag." These products are good examples of the problem. Although both
contain no nutritive sweeteners, they are not calorie-free. They include the
carbohydrates polydextrose, maltodextrin and sorbitol. All three contribute
calories. But of greater concern in these sugar-free treats is their fat
content. Both are high in fat, especially the cholesterol-raising saturated
kind.;    Fatty bars; Fat accounts for seven of every 10 calories in
sugar-free Three Musketeers Snack Bars. Granted, each little half-ounce bar
contains only 4 grams of fat. But eat three bars and you've downed 150
calories and as much fat as in 2 teaspoons of margarine. Since the ingredient
list includes cream, whole milk and cocoa butter (chocolate fat) as the
primary fat sources, I expect about two-thirds of the fat to be saturated.;   
Some of the front panels of the Lite Crunch frozen dairy dessert also state
that it is "reduced fat." According to the <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION> consumer information
service, the <ORGANIZATION>Lite Crunch</ORGANIZATION> dessert has 30 fewer calories and 2 grams less fat
than the regular Crunch dessert. However, fat contributes six of every 10
calories in both bars. Ounce per ounce, both versions have the same amount of
fat, but a Lite Crunch bar weighs half an ounce less.;    Clearly, <ORGANIZATION>Nestle</ORGANIZATION>
reformulated the original Crunch dessert to eliminate sugar and corn syrup
from the product. Lite Crunch isn't just a smaller version, but I want to see
a real change in the relative amount of fat before I will consider a "reduced
fat" claim legitimate. About two-thirds of the fat in the Lite Crunch dessert
is probably saturated.;    Since fat is the major source of calories in these
sugar-free treats, I cannot think of anyone who would benefit from choosing
them over the regular versions. People with diabetes and high blood
triglycerides should avoid them for their fat, carbohydrate and calorie
content. If you have high blood cholesterol, they're too high in saturated
fat. If you don't have specific diet-related health concerns and your diet has
room for a food with little more nutritional value than a candy bar, I suggest
that you just eat the regular versions.; <ORGANIZATION>Dove</ORGANIZATION>'s Sugar-Free Three Musketeers

<LEADPARA>  MOVE over, croissants! There's a new pastry capturing America's attention when
it comes to a tasty snack. It's called rugelach (pronounced ROO-gelah).;  
Well, it's not really new. Until recently, rugelach were a well-kept secret of
regular shoppers at Jewish bakeries, where this delicious pastry is one of the
most popular items. But the word is out. Suddenly rugelach are appearing in
fancy mail-order catalogs, in gourmet food shops and in many supermarkets.  </LEADPARA>

"Fresh From France" cookbook series published by E.P. Dutton and of
"Sensational Pasta," published by HP Books.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     So what are rugelach? Are they cookies or are they pastries? Actually,
they're sort of both. They're made of pastry and are served like cookies with
coffee, tea or milk. Rugelach look like mini croissants. At least, some of
them do. Others are cylindrical in shape, rather like miniature pains au
chocolat (a pastry made from croissant dough with a chocolate filling). In
fact, rugelach have a lot in common with croissants -- they are rich, tender
and flaky.;   But rugelach have an important advantage over croissants. They
are very easy to make.;   Unlike classic croissants, rugelach always have a
filling. The traditional filling is simply "sprinkles" -- you scatter chopped
nuts, cinnamon, sugar and raisins over the dough. With rugelach's new
popularity, many filling variations have been developed, and now rugelach come
in such flavors as chocolate, strawberry, apricot, cheese and raspberry.;
CREAM CHEESE DOUGH FOR RUGELACH; 6  ounces cream cheese (bar type, not
spreadable type); 1/2  pound cold unsalted butter; 2  cups flour; 1/4 
teaspoon salt; 1/3  cup sour cream; 1  teaspoon water (optional);  Cut cream
cheese into tablespoon-size pieces and let soften at room temperature. Cut
butter into small pieces of about 1/2 tablespoon and keep them cold until
ready to use.;   Place flour, salt and butter in bowl of food processor and
process with on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cream
cheese and sour cream, distributing them evenly over mixture. Process with
on/off turns until dough just holds together. Add 1 teaspoon water if
necessary. Wrap dough in plastic wrap, press together into a ball and flatten
to a disk. Refrigerate 4 hours or up to 2 days.; (hbox);    TRADITIONAL
RUGELACH WITH CINNAMON-WALNUT-RAISIN FILLING; Cream Cheese Dough for Rugelach
(recipe above); 1/2  cup sugar; 1  tablespoon ground cinnamon; 1  cup walnuts,
finely chopped; 1/2  cup dark raisins, chopped;  Prepare dough and
refrigerate. Lightly butter 2 or 3 baking sheets. Mix sugar and cinnamon for
filling.;   Divide dough into 4 pieces. Press each portion into a round, then
flatten it. Roll it into 9-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Sprinkle 1/4 of
sugar-cinnamon mixture (about 2 tablespoons) all over circle, then sprinkle
1/4 of nuts and raisins near outer edge of circle. Press with rolling pin so
they adhere to dough.;   Using heavy knife, cut circle into 12 wedges, making
each cut with sharp movement of heel of knife. Tightly roll up each wedge from
wide end to point. Be sure filling is enclosed, as raisins can burn if
exposed. Place cookies on prepared baking sheets with points of triangles
facing down, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Curve each to crescent shape, if
desired. Refrigerate while shaping more cookies. Refrigerate all at least 20
minutes before baking. (Unbaked cookies can be frozen.);   Bake at 350 degrees
22 to 25 minutes or until light golden. Cool on racks. Makes 48.; (hbox);   
CHOCOLATE CHIP RUGELACH; Cream Cheese Dough for Rugelach (recipe above); 1 
cup mini semisweet chocolate chips;  Prepare dough and refrigerate. Lightly
butter 2 or 3 baking sheets. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Press each portion
into a square, then flatten it. Roll it into 9- to 9 1/2-inch square. Trim
edges. Cut into 3 equal strips, then cut each strip into 3 pieces. You will
have 9 squares.;   Spoon 1 teaspoon chocolate chips on each square about 1/2
inch from edge nearest you. Spread chips in row along edge so they are as
close together as possible but are in a single layer. Fold over edge of dough
nearest you to cover chips. Tightly roll up dough, jelly-roll fashion, toward
other side. It will look like a thin cylinder. Cut each cylinder in two, with
heel of heavy knife.;   Place cookies on baking sheets and refrigerate while
shaping more cookies. Refrigerate all at least 20 minutes before baking.
(Unbaked cookies can be frozen.);   Bake cookies at 350 degrees about 22
minutes or until light golden. Cool on racks. Makes 72.  </TEXT>
