YOUTH BEAT: AUSTRALIA OPENS THREE NEW LOW-COST HOSTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three key Australian cities -- <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and Cairns -- have new hostels 
for budget travelers. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, it's not just the youth hostel that's appealing. One of the city's 
charms is that it offers visitors the opportunity to take in city sights and 
enjoy the beach life as well. 
</P>
<P>
You can start your day in the central city area with a visit to the Australian 
Museum and a walking tour through the 200-year-old historic district known as 
"The Rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Then you can take a 10-minute ferry trip across the harbor to <LOCATION>Manly Beach</LOCATION>, or 
grab a bus to the popular surfing suburb of <LOCATION>Bondi Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s new flagship youth hostel, <ORGANIZATION>Hereford Lodge</ORGANIZATION>, has a pool, sauna, rooftop 
recreation area, TV and video lounge, plus a low-cost cafeteria. It's at 51 
<ORGANIZATION>Hereford St.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Glebe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The hostel has 92 rooms. The price per person in a twin room is about <MONEY>$14</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Cup 
</P>
<P>
If you want to experience the exciting atmosphere of one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s premier 
sports events, plan to be in the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> area on the first <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in 
<DATE>November</DATE>. The city comes to a halt as everyone focuses attention on <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 
most important horse race, the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> area is also one of the most popular spots to enjoy another 
Australian custom -- the BYO (bring your own) restaurants. These are 
establishments that allow you to furnish your own wine or beer to enjoy with 
your meal. The minimum drinking age in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is 18. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>'s new youth hostel is at 118 <ORGANIZATION>Lonsdale St.</ORGANIZATION> It can accommodate up to 
140 people, who are charged <MONEY>$13</MONEY> each night. 
</P>
<P>
Cairns, on <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s northeastern coast, draws travelers to investigate the 
Great Barrier Reef. The town has several hostels that compete for business from 
young visitors. In addition to accommodations, they offer opportunities for 
economical trips to the rain forest, plus river rafting and sailing adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cairns youth hostel is at 20-24 McLeon St. just opposite the railway 
station. The single-room rate is <MONEY>$12</MONEY> a night. A bed in a twin room costs <MONEY>$9</MONEY>, 
while a bed in a dormitory room is <MONEY>$7</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
All three youth hostels are members of a network of 130 Australian hostels 
affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION>International Youth Hostel Federation</ORGANIZATION>. If you are not a 
member of your own national youth hostel association, they may request that you 
buy a guest membership, or pay a few dollars extra per night. There are no age 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> also has many independent budget-priced hostels. They tend to supply 
information about each other, so once you start using them you can find out 
about others. 
</P>
<P>
The youth hostels offer young travelers a good place to exchange information 
and develop friendships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Site Vans 
</P>
<P>
When several people begin to travel together, the variety of opportunities 
expand. You can begin to consider new options such as buying a cheap car and 
making more use of campgrounds, where you'll discover another Australian 
novelty, the on-site van. 
</P>
<P>
These are recreational vehicles parked in permanent positions in campgrounds; 
you can rent them by the night or week. 
</P>
<P>
One free source of information about budget accommodations, including some 
youth hostels, budget hotels, tourist homes and campgrounds, is a publication 
called "Destination <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
The guide also covers basic information on what to see and do in key tourism 
areas, and offers advice on a variety of services such as bus passes and tour 
operators. Copies are available from the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Tourist Commission</ORGANIZATION>, 2121 
Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 90067, (213) 552-1988. 
</P>
<P>
If you need to make transportation arrangements after you arrive in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, 
keep in mind that <ORGANIZATION>STA Travel</ORGANIZATION> (formerly Student Travel <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>) has offices in 
<LOCATION>Hobart</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Townsville</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The company specializes in services for all young travelers. They also have a 
network of offices in other countries, including <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, so they can help 
with arrangements and information when you want to move on from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.

  [Text] Direct air links between <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are 
set to be restored. State political reporter <PERSON>Tony Allen</PERSON> says it 
follows meetings between Victorian Premier <PERSON>Jeff Kennett</PERSON> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s international airline, <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION>. 
  [Begin recording] [<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>] <PERSON>Mr. Kennett</PERSON> declared a personal 
black ban on <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ansett</ORGANIZATION> international services to 
illustrate his concern at the airlines using <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> as their 
base. Now, after talks with <PERSON>Mr. Kennett</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION> has announced a 
plan for a weekly direct flight to <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION>'s new <LOCATION>Kansai Airport</LOCATION>. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Kennett</PERSON> said it takes up an unused <ORGANIZATION>Ansett</ORGANIZATION> right that 
expires in <DATE>November</DATE>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Kennett</ORGANIZATION>] And we will support <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION> to get that flight 
awarded to <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION>. If that is the case, then we are able then 
to establish ourselves and to (?prove) up the value of that 
flight. [end recording] 
  As well, <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION> will add three new flights from <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> to 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Auckland</LOCATION> from the end of <DATE>October</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION> says 
it is more expensive to fly from <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> than from the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> tourist markets, but if the new flights prove a 
success, there will be more.

<ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's debt-laden News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> it will merge its four <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> newspapers into two 24-hour publications to avoid shutting down 
its struggling afternoon dailies. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the move, effective <DATE>Monday</DATE>, will likely ease pressure on 
<ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, whose stock price has tumbled about <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> in the last month on 
investor concern about its massive <MONEY>$8.7-billion</MONEY> debt. 
</P>
<P>
The merger of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s best-selling newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Sun</ORGANIZATION>, with the 
city's struggling afternoon broadsheet the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s tabloids, the 
morning Daily Telegraph and ailing afternoon Daily Mirror, will mean the loss 
of about 180 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"As an alternative to closing either (afternoon) paper, it will save well over 
800, probably 1,000 jobs as well as giving the public continuing afternoon 
newspaper service," <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect the savings to be quite considerable," he said. "I think it is a 
business benefit in that it should improve the overall profit of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch declined to comment either about the recent plunge in <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s 
stock price, which has wiped about <MONEY>$515 million</MONEY> off its market value, or a 
sharp rise in the group's short-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> said the changes are linked with News' <MONEY>$830-million</MONEY> investment in 
high-technology color printing plants in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, now an American citizen who spends little time in his native 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, is on an extended visit that will include the company's <DATE>Oct. 23</DATE> 
annual meeting in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> said he welcomes the merger. "It will probably mean a 
loss of jobs for some people, but as far as the community in general is 
concerned, they probably will get a better service," he told reporters in 
<LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The merger of the <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Sun</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> will create the <ORGANIZATION>Herald-Sun</ORGANIZATION> with 
circulation estimated to reach 600,000, he said. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> sells 
175,634 copies a day and the morning Sun 560,444.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: A rumbling in the waterworks -
Jane Martinson on attracting tourists to a sewage plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers of a sewage treatment plant in south-east <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> are considering
plans to turn it into a tourist attraction.
The 10,851 ha plant - which produces more beef than any farm in the region -
treats 55 per cent of the wastewater generated by the city of <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
Natural purification methods rather than chemical treatment are used to
produce effluent, which is deposited in <LOCATION>Port Phillip Bay</LOCATION>. Some 16,000 cattle
graze the grass fertilised by raw sewage; livestock generated just over
ADollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m) in income last year.
Much of the sewage is treated in lagoons, which cover 1,667 ha at the
Werribee site, 35 km south-west of <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. Three large lagoons built in
the past six years have been designed to control odour and produce biogas.
Mechanical aerators speed up the process of digestion and reduce odour,
while covers are being installed to capture methane and other odorous gases.
The methane will eventually be burnt off to generate power.
The plan to create an 'eco-tourist park' focuses on 600 ha of older lagoons.
Over 250 species of birds are found around them. Many rare species have been
recorded, including up to 50 per cent of the world's total of the
orange-bellied parrot.
The area is listed by the <ORGANIZATION>International Union</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Conservation of Nature</ORGANIZATION>
as a wetland of international importance.
A study conducted this <DATE>summer</DATE> by <LOCATION>Melbourne Parks</LOCATION> and Waterways claimed the
sewage plant could attract up to 160,000 tourists a year if developed as an
eco-tourist park. The organisation manages a funding programme which aims to
encourage community use of open spaces and the preservation of wildlife.
Last year it allocated ADollars 6.2m to such schemes.
Melbourne Water, the state-owned authority which manages Werribee, says
there is 'definite commercial potential there' and has commissioned a full
economic analysis of the project.
There are a number of advantages to the plan, not least enhanced public
relations. <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>'s sewers, with their network of old brick tunnels,
suffered three serious collapses two years ago. Sewage spilled into a local
river and it took more than three months to stem the flow.
More recently the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, the government watchdog,
has decreed that checks on effluent discharges into <LOCATION>Port Phillip Bay</LOCATION> are to
be made much more stringent by <DATE>2004</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Water</ORGANIZATION> has committed itself to
complying with the regulations by <DATE>1997</DATE>. It has also earmarked ADollars 32m
for upgrading its two major treatment plants.
The impact on wildlife of a significant increase in visitor numbers is
causing some concern, however. <PERSON>Alex Sandles</PERSON>, the wastewater treatment
manager at <LOCATION>Werribee</LOCATION>, says birds are attracted by the food, security and calm
of the plant. 'The lakes near here tend to be full of waterskiers and other
noise.'
The plan has some support among environment groups. <PERSON>Karri Giles</PERSON>, water
catchment manager for Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, says: 'We are
positive as long as it is done sensitively.'
However, the proposal may be delayed by the shake-up planned for <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>
Water by a state government keen on privatisation. It was to appear before
the authority's board in <DATE>November</DATE>.
Nonetheless, Sandles feels the plan will be implemented. Werribee treatment
plant could become part of a 'complete weekend package' for <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>'s
tourists, he says.

FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Melbourn promoted at NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A chain of moves in the top management of <ORGANIZATION>National Westminster Bank</ORGANIZATION> was
disclosed yesterday, led by the appointment of <PERSON>John Melbourn</PERSON>, the bank's
head of group risk, to succeed <PERSON>Bert Morris</PERSON> as the bank's deputy chief
executive.
The reshuffle is one of the most significant changes to the bank's senior
roster since <PERSON>Derek Wanless</PERSON> was appointed chief executive in <DATE>1992</DATE>. The
changes, which all involve bank insiders, will take place from <DATE>March 1</DATE>.
Melbourn, a 56-year-old who was thought to be a contender for the chief
executive's job when <PERSON>Derek Wanless</PERSON> was appointed, is one of the bank's most
experienced hands, having headed international operations and its
relationships with large companies.
<PERSON>Wanless</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Melbourn</PERSON> is 'a tremendous banker' who would bring a wide
range of experience to the post. Melbourn will work alongside <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> until
<DATE>September</DATE>, when the latter is due to retire.
Melbourn will retain board responsibility for credit risk, and the handling
of large corporate restructurings. But his current deputy, <PERSON>Fred Pointon</PERSON>, has
been appointed to the post of general manager of group risk in his place.
A second significant change announced yesterday is the appointment of <PERSON>Phil
Wise</PERSON>, the current chief executive of group services, as chief operating
officer at <ORGANIZATION>NatWest Markets</ORGANIZATION>, the bank's corporate and investment banking arm.
Wise, 45, has worked with <PERSON>Martin Owen</PERSON>, the chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>NatWest
Markets</ORGANIZATION>, before when the men brought together the bank's treasury
operations.
Like other securities houses, <ORGANIZATION>NatWest Markets</ORGANIZATION> had a good year amid buoyant
bond and equity markets. Wanless has signalled that the bank is considering
ways of building on its investment banking business to help raise revenues.
<ORGANIZATION>NatWest Markets</ORGANIZATION>' two senior managing directors, <PERSON>Roger Byatt</PERSON> and <PERSON>John
Howland-Jackson</PERSON>, have been appointed deputy chief executives. Wise will be
succeeded at group services by <PERSON>Trevor Blackler</PERSON>, general manager of UK branch
business. <PERSON>Stuart Chandler</PERSON>, general manager for human resources and strategic
development, has been appointed to the new post of deputy chief executive
for UK branch business with responsibility for technology and human
resources.

<ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION>, the Australian radio group, and the entertainment group <ORGANIZATION>Village
Roadshow</ORGANIZATION>, which were involved in a hostile takeover bid last week, have
agreed to merge their radio networks, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
In place of its hostile bid, Village will acquire at least 50.1 per cent of
<ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> in two stages via a placement and a partial bid at ADollars 0.55
(USDollars 0.40) a share higher than <ORGANIZATION>Village</ORGANIZATION>'s first offer.
<ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> will issue 52.5m shares to Village and Village will offer ADollars
1.75 a share for 20 per cent of each <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholder's existing
stake.
Village Roadshow's original takeover offer for <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> was ADollars 1.20 a
share, but the market soon moved above this level and on <DATE>Friday</DATE> the shares
closed at ADollars 1.35.
Austereo shares were suspended yesterday at the company's request.
The <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> share issue, together with <ORGANIZATION>Village Roadshow</ORGANIZATION>'s current 12.8 per
cent stake, will take <ORGANIZATION>Village</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholding to 40.8 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION>'s
enlarged capital.
Under the deal, <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> will purchase Village's Triple M radio stations in
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, and may acquire Triple M in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>
by means of the share issue.
The Triple M stations will join the current <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> network comprising
seven stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>.
The merger is subject to clearance by the anti-monopoly <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices
Commission</ORGANIZATION> and approval by <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> shareholders.

<TEXT>
Bouncers were bowled at <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> cricket captain <PERSON>Mike Atherton</PERSON> as soon as the
team landed in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, where the first match of the tour will be played
tomorrow. This time the fast balls came from the Australian press and the
hot topic was sledging - players verbally abusing opponents at the crease.
Atherton was questioned fiercely about a statement he is alleged to have
made after the last Ashes series in <DATE>1993</DATE>. 'The one who really got up my nose
was <PERSON>Steve Waugh</PERSON>,' <PERSON>Atherton</PERSON> is said to have said. 'He spent the entire series
giving out verbals - a bit of a joke really as he was the one bloke on
either side who was wetting himself against the quick bowlers.'
Atherton now claims he cannot remember making the comments, but the issue
highlights two things that will determine <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s success in the coming
Ashes battle: team spirit (sledging or no sledging) and fast bowling.
'Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if <PERSON>Lillee</PERSON> doesn't get you, <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> must.'
That was a chant that turned many an <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> supporter's blood to ice, and
it has been traditional that the side with the best fast bowlers wins Test
series in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
Atherton will be hoping that the tradition is maintained, because this time
round it is <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> that have the stronger pace attack. However, <PERSON>Devon
Malcolm</PERSON>, <PERSON>Phillip DeFreitas</PERSON>, <PERSON>Darren Gough</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Martin McCague</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Joey Benjamin</PERSON>
will need to be at their best, for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> seem to be stronger in every
other department, including team character.
Firing up the troops to take on the ancient enemy has never been an
Australian problem. As <PERSON>Graham Gooch</PERSON> lamented last year: 'Our spirit is
nothing like their's' <PERSON>Atherton</PERSON> will be aware that developing the team's
character will be as important as his other duties if he is to interrupt one
of the worst spells - for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> - since <PERSON>James Lilleywhite</PERSON> first led an
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> touring side to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1877</DATE>. The last three Ashes series have
finished 4-0, 3-0 and 4-1 in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s favour.

<FÊP=106> [By <PERSON>Peter Chen</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 16</DATE> (CNA) -- <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the 
Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> [ROC] are scheduled to hold talks in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> 
later this month to discuss expansion of the current air links 
between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION>Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Office</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>TECO</ORGANIZATION>) in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [16 <DATE>March</DATE>]. 
  TECO Representative <PERSON>Francias Li</PERSON> said the ROC delegation 
would 
be led by Sun Chao-liang, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION>Civil 
Aeronautics Administration</ORGANIZATION>, and his Australian counterpart would 
be <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s representative in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>. 
  Officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Transport Department</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Australian Asia Airlines</ORGANIZATION> (AAA), <LOCATION>Eva Air</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mandarin Airways</ORGANIZATION> 
will take part in the two-day meetings on <DATE>March 24</DATE> and 25. 
  Li said the <ORGANIZATION>ROC</ORGANIZATION> delegates are expected to arrive in 
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> 
on <DATE>March 23</DATE>. 
  "The purpose of the meeting is to discuss bilateral 
expansion 
of the current air links between our two countries," he said. 
  He said the issue was first raised by the officials of <ORGANIZATION>AAA</ORGANIZATION>, 
a 
subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Qantas Airways</ORGANIZATION>, last year. 
  Australia signed an aviation agreement with the ROC in early 
<DATE>1991</DATE>. 
  AAA inaugurated its flights to <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> on <DATE>October 11</DATE> the same year. 
  <ORGANIZATION>Mandarin Airways</ORGANIZATION> followed suit a week later with direct 
flights between <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. Eva air started flying to 
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> in <DATE>September 1993</DATE>. 
  Under the <DATE>1991</DATE> agreement, airlines from the two countries 
are 
allowed to provide four weekly flight between <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>. Additional flights on this route have to be 
approved first by either <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>. 
  AAA has maximized its services with four weekly flights 
while 
<PERSON>Mandarin</PERSON> and Eva provide two weekly flights each. 
  But a faster-than-expected tourist flow from <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> to 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> has called for more flights and the airlines 
operating the route are very profitable, airlines officials said. 
  <ORGANIZATION>Eva Air</ORGANIZATION> has been forced to offer an extra flight to meet 
growing demand, company representative in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> <PERSON>Peter Kwoh</PERSON> said 
in an interview. 
  "All airlines operating between <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> are making profits thanks to a surge in the number of 
tourists from <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>," he said. 
  The number of tourist arrivals from <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> going to 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> 
hit a record high of nearly 109,000 last year, up from 63,500 in 
<DATE>1992</DATE>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Tourist Commission</ORGANIZATION> (ATC). 
  Tourists from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> going to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> totalled more than 
20,000, up only slightly from a year earlier. 
  "The <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> route has been known as the golden route for 
many 
years," <PERSON>Kwoh</PERSON> said, adding "because more and more affluent <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> 
residents like to travel overseas." 
  "They are big spenders in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>," an <ORGANIZATION>ATC</ORGANIZATION> official said. 
  <ORGANIZATION>China Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a parent company of <LOCATION>Mandarin</LOCATION>, said this 
month 
that its subsidiary would expand its current Taipei-Sydney 
flights to <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> later this year. 
  "I believe all the airlines operating between the <ORGANIZATION>ROC</ORGANIZATION> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> will cash in on the growing tourist flow to share a 
bigger market pie," <ORGANIZATION>TECO</ORGANIZATION>'s Li said.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (6): Wheel of misfortune - Nikki Tait
studies the rise of the gambling dens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the growth in visitors to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is a pretty sight, the development of
the country's casino industry - a key factor in the tourism equation - looks
increasingly ugly.
It has been estimated that revenues from Australian casinos could double
over the next five years, to around ADollars 1.25bn per annum, as new
properties in <LOCATION>Cairns</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> come on stream.
This will be the third phase of the industry's development. While casinos
have been operating in <LOCATION>Tasmania</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Territory</ORGANIZATION> for several
decades, these have always been small-scale operations, with aggregate
annual revenues of less than ADollars 50m.
It was only when the <LOCATION>Burswood</LOCATION> casino got going outside <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>,
followed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiters</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Gold Coast</ORGANIZATION>, that the dollar signs
started to clock up. Burswood has around 116 tables, and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiters</ORGANIZATION> almost as
many. The other seven casinos sprinkled across <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> are only in
double-digits, and <PERSON>Alice Springs</PERSON>' has fewer than 20 tables. Burswood alone
accounted for 40 per cent of the industry's ADollars 657m revenues in
<DATE>1992-3</DATE>.
Today, there are two principal reasons why other big states, such as
<LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, are clambering on to the same bandwagon. The
first is an acute desire to attract the Asian tourist dollar - or, at the
very least, not to lose out to competing cities and states. According to
projections from the <ORGANIZATION>NSW Casino Control Authority</ORGANIZATION>, the number of
international visitors to the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> property could top the million-mark by
the year <DATE>2000</DATE>, compared with 1.1-2.2m domestic visitors and 6-7.5m local
visitors or day-trippers.
Secondly, state treasurers, eager to relieve their budgetary pressures, see
tax revenues from gaming dollars as a fairly efficient means of raising new
funds. Consultants say that the substitution effect - the drop in
racing-related revenues, for example, as punters adjust their activities -
is relatively modest.
But as the stakes are raised, the disquiet is growing. In <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, where a
temporary casino opened early this year, there have been reports of a
proliferation of 'gambling problems'. Pawnshops are said to be seeing a
surge in business, and financial difficulties, notably within the city's
large Asian community, are rife.
Meanwhile, the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino development has degenerated into a dirty brawl
between the business interests of <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>, the Australian
businessman who already has a significant stake in the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> operation,
and a consortium of Showboat, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> casino group, and <ORGANIZATION>Leighton Holdings</ORGANIZATION>,
the Australian building company.
Leighton-Showboat appeared to win the right to build and operate the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
property earlier this year, outbidding the <ORGANIZATION>Packer</ORGANIZATION> consortium, which also
included the <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION>'s Circus Circus, by offering an upfront payment of ADollars
376m.
But since then, the <PERSON>Packer</PERSON> camp has unleased a barrage of accusations about
Showboat's probity. <PERSON>Mr Bob Carr</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>NSW Labor</ORGANIZATION> opposition leader, has
levelled some of the more detailed allegations, which hang on fairly tenuous
links between Showboat and a <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> mob figure and seem to baffle US
analysts. Confidential US police reports have been leaked; public relations
advisers and lawyers spurred into action.
The CCC, having assured everyone that extensive probity checks had been
carried out before the Leighton-Showboat choice was made, has set up an
inquiry to look into the allegations.
Sydney residents, meanwhile, tend to view the whole business with a mixture
of contempt and cynicism. Two previous attempts to award a <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino
licence - in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE> - went awry when individuals or companies
involved in the winning bids ran into controversy. It is now a question of
whether the third time is any more lucky.

   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP.</ORGANIZATION> sold its two Australian television stations to <ORGANIZATION>WESTFIELD CAPITAL CORP.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION> paid <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> the equivalent of <MONEY>$555 million</MONEY> for the stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, as well as some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording business. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had said it would sell the television stations and concentrate in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> on the print media. 
The sale partially offsets the cost of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which leaves <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s company with about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the total newspaper circulation in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s major cities. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Westfield Capital</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, enters the scramble among Australian companies to set up television networks. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION> will hold its newly acquired media interests through its <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Northern Star Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which already owns newspapers, radio stations and two television stations in smaller cities. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, <PERSON>David Gonski</PERSON>, said: "Our No. 1 priority will be to go nationwide, either by linking with other networks or by acquisition." 
Analysts said one possibility would be a link with businessman <PERSON>Kerry Stokes</PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s television station in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> and also owns a station in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> and a license for a station in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> last month became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, and <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> is in position to establish a second network after adding <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> station to its television operations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old stowaway who wanted to go to
American but ended up in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by mistake arrived back in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>
today at the end of a 19,000-mile airborne adventure.
   <PERSON>Kristofer Dobrowski</PERSON> was questioned by police and then handed back
to his Polish-born mother, officials at <LOCATION>Schwechat</LOCATION> airport told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. His home address was not released.
   Airline officials were at a loss to explain the incident but said
they were checking security systems.
   Dobrowski was put on a Vienna-bound plane in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> late
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> after he was discovered in the transit lounge of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s
airport without a ticket, travel papers or identity documents.
   ``He is knee-high to a grasshopper,'' said one Australian
immigration officer. ``It seems he wanted to go to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and
mistook the <ORGANIZATION>Qantas</ORGANIZATION> flight destination of <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.''
   With the help of an interpreter, officials found that <PERSON>Dobrowski</PERSON>
had flown undetected from <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION>, and on to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> before being picked up in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>.
   Immigration spokesman <PERSON>Geoff Smith</PERSON> said officials became
suspicious when they realized the boy spoke no English, was
traveling alone and had no travel documents.
   <PERSON>Dobrowski</PERSON>, who is Polish but lives with his mother in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>,
said he was unhappy at his mother's recent remarriage. He said he
did not like his stepfather, so he decided to run away.
   ``He left home <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and went to <LOCATION>Vienna Airport</LOCATION> where he
somehow boarded an <ORGANIZATION>Air Lauda</ORGANIZATION> jet for <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>,'' said
the spokesman. ``He stayed in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> for two days in the transit
area, mostly sleeping while he recovered from his flight from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.''
   When he overcame his jetlag, <PERSON>Dobrowski</PERSON> tagged along with a family
that was flying to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, apparently managing to pick up a
boarding pass he found on the ground and use it to join a flight to
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
   ``But <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> wasn't <PERSON>Kristofer</PERSON>'s chosen destination. With his
poor understanding of English, he mistook <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, which
is where he really wanted to go _ <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,'' said the official
demanded anonymity.
   Qantas paid for him to stay the night at the <ORGANIZATION>Airport Hilton Hotel</ORGANIZATION>
before putting him on a plane home _ as a first-class passenger.

<HL> Herald Apparently Is Won by Murdoch;
Other Firms Scramble for TV Networks

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> apparently won the battle for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest media group. 
But the reshaping of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s media industry will continue, as the scramble to set up television networks intensifies with the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s stations and the impending sale of those owned by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement <DATE>Friday</DATE> under which <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station for the equivalent of <MONEY>$214.3 million</MONEY>. 
Fairfax also acquired most of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s smaller newspapers in the state of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Tamworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, paper, for a total of <MONEY>$30.1 million</MONEY>. 
In return, <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> withdrew its bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> and dropped all legal action against <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s competing <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> offer. 

   The agreement paves the way for <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to take control of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s company has acquired nearly <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, and the end of legal actions means he can step in to control the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> board. 

   Fairfax also will ask the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</ORGANIZATION> to stop an investigation into <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
The tribunal still might continue its investigation, which is based on <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizenship and Australian regulations prohibiting control of television stations here by foreigners. 
But analysts believe such a move isn't likely now that <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> has sold its television operations and <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will sell its two television stations as well. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> emerged from the transactions as the biggest newspaper publisher in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, with about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the total newspaper circulation in the major cities. 
In addition to its own publications, which already cover most of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s company will retain <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> newspapers in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hobart</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, as well as a string of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> suburban newspapers, several magazines and printing and distribution operations. 

   Analysts said the price paid by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, while difficult to determine exactly, makes the complicated transactions a bargain for the Murdoch-controlled company. 
After selling the television operations of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> might end up paying about <MONEY>$536 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$670 million</MONEY> to greatly expand his newspaper-publishing empire. 

   The active bidding for the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> broadcasting operations pushed their prices well above earlier offers for the stations. 
That effectively reduces the cost to <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, because it gives <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> additional cash that will go to <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> when it takes control of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, meanwhile, is in position to lead <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s second television network with its acquisition of the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> station. 
It already owns television stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>. 
Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, when it acquired the television operations of privately owned <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court, a businessman with television stations in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, might join with <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> to establish a national network, analysts speculate. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, under a previous agreement, is to get the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> newspaper business in his home state of <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, but failed in his bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station. 

   But the carving-up of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> also strengthened a competitor of <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> in the race to establish television networks. 
Herald will sell its other television station, in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, plus radio stations in the states of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION>, to businessman <PERSON>Kerry Stokes</PERSON> for <MONEY>$87.1 million</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Stokes</PERSON> owns a television station in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> and a license for a station in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>. 
He also is expected to be a bidder for <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s two television stations, which could make him the leader in a third national network. 

   The buyer of the <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stations is likely to be announced today. 
If another company wins the race for <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s television stations, that bidder is expected to team with <PERSON>Mr. Stokes</PERSON> to form the third network. 
The two <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stations are expected to be sold for a total of about <MONEY>$502.4 million</MONEY>. 

   The carving up of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> was sparked in part by a government proposal to liberalize laws that currently limit a company to owning only two television stations. 
That liberalization, if approved by parliament, would encourage creation of national networks, which would boost profitability for station owners. 

   The government also proposes to reduce the ability of one company to own both a television station and a major newspaper in any city. 
Such a change could present problems for <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, which now will own a television station and a newspaper in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. 

   Some further redistribution of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s media business therefore is likely as the television networks are established and rulings are made on newspaper-television cross ownership. 
Owners of the few independent television stations that remain might sell those businesses if they bid for the <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stations but fail in those offers. 
And <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, who comes out of the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> carve-up with few of the spoils, still might fight to improve his position, analysts say.

casino

<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>, the Australian businessman, and Circus Circus, the large <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
gaming group, yesterday lost their joint bid to build the USDollars 1bn-plus
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino complex, which is forecast to have annual gaming revenues of
around ADollars 500m (USDollars 357.1m) when it comes on stream in <DATE>1997</DATE>.
Instead, the <ORGANIZATION>New South Wales Casino Control Authority</ORGANIZATION> announced yesterday
the winning development proposal had been submitted by <ORGANIZATION>Leighton Holdings</ORGANIZATION>,
the stock market-listed Australian engineering and construction group in
which <ORGANIZATION>Hochtief</ORGANIZATION>, the German construction group, has a 48 per cent
shareholding.
Although the <ORGANIZATION>CCA</ORGANIZATION> stressed no one factor had influenced its decision, the
Leighton bid - made in conjunction with Showboat, a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> casino group -
offered a much higher upfront payment to the <ORGANIZATION>NSW</ORGANIZATION> state in return for the
casino licence.
The consortium has promised to pay ADollars 441m over three years, or
ADollars 376m as a single upfront sum - a figure which even <PERSON>Mr Chris Cullen</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>CCA</ORGANIZATION> chairman, described as 'exceptional'.
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> - whose involvement in the rival consortium was through his Nine
Network and <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Press</ORGANIZATION> companies - said his group had 'bid our
maximum price and came up over ADollars 80m short'. 'On that basis,
(Leighton/Showboat) deserved to win and good luck to them,' said the
businessman, known to be a keen gambler himself.
The <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino is the last, and largest, in a string of such development
announcements in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Growth in the industry is expected to explode
over the next three years. Casinos are due to come on stream in <LOCATION>Cairns</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> during that time and - with <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> included - the
country's total annual gross casino revenues could top ADollars 2bn by the
late-1990s. <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> already has connections with - and a potential direct
interest in - the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> property.
The <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino has always been seen as a 'prize' because of the city's
strong Asian tourist trade. In addition to the upfront licence payment, the
state expects to get annual tax revenues of around ADollars 100m once it
starts operating.
The Leighton/Showboat proposal includes a five-star hotel, serviced
apartments, a floorshow theatre and a 2,000-seat lyric theatre, as well as
the 'themed' casino with its 170 gaming tables and 1,480 gaming machines.
<PERSON>Leighton</PERSON> said the consortium company, called <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Harbour Casino</ORGANIZATION>, would be
floated by <DATE>1995</DATE>.

<HEAD>Beer, Tennis and Impromptu Walks Down Under for Quayle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, acting like
a political candidate on a whistlestop tour of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, quaffed
beer at a local pub, hit tennis balls with underprivileged children
and mingled with crowds in two cities today.
   Obviously enjoying himself on the third day of his trip, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>
paid a surprise visit to the wood-paneled pub at the <ORGANIZATION>Lord Nelson
Brewery Hotel</ORGANIZATION> where his brief stop stunned the clientele.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said <PERSON>Kim Ivey</PERSON>, a banker who was
drinking at the bar with friends in mid-afternoon. ``We were
standing here and he walked up and said, `Hi. I'm <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>.'''
   Quayle, sipping a glass of <PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> beer, chatted with the young
women behind the bar, joked with proprietor <PERSON>Blair Hayden</PERSON> about his
golfing tie and suggested two patrons attend a black-tie dinner at
which he's the guest of honor.
   He called the beer _ which is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s national drink _ good,
but added, ``It has a bite.''
   <PERSON>Ann Larson</PERSON>, 25, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> who chatted with <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>
said, ``It was great. He is really nice.'' She said her friends
``will be spewing. They'll be so jealous.''
   The pub stop capped a day in which <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> spent much of his time
shaking hands and posing for pictures, including several on a boat
tour of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>'s breathtaking harbor.
   The good-natured touring was in contrast to the first days of
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s first trip to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region. The vice president has
highlighted the U.S.-Australia defense alliance, but Australian
officials have protested export subsidies the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> places
on wheat, subsidies the Australians say hurt their exports abroad.
   Australian officials who hoped <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> would say the subsidies
were ending were angered at his public comments. <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said at a
news conference on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, ``We do not believe that it (the
subsidy program) is injuring <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.''
   Senior government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> was exasperated at <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s stance in
a private meeting. <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> said on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the losses ``are not
figments of our imagination. They are cold, hard and brutally
hurtful economic statistics which have adversely affected our
farmers, our wheat farmers.''
   The country's major national newspaper, The Australian, was more
blunt in an editorial, saying, ``Who do you think you are kidding,
<PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>? Read our lips, <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>. Australians are not happy.''
   The vice president and his wife, <PERSON>Marilyn</PERSON>, flew here from
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, their second stop on their five-day trip to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   Taking a cue from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who sometimes spontaneously
stops his motorcade to mix with the crowds, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> jumped out of
his limousine in downtown <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> to shake hands outside one of
the city's landmarks, the clocks at the <ORGANIZATION>Flinders Street</ORGANIZATION> train
station.
   Quayle, trailed by local reporters, also insisted on walking
near the waterfront in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, much to the consternation of his
<ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> agents. ``I wish he would get in the car,'' one
agent said in an exasperated tone.
   Before he left <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> laid a wreath at a war memorial
where a brass plaque honors <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Marines who fought at <LOCATION>Guadalcanal</LOCATION>
in World War II.
   He also stopped by the <ORGANIZATION>National Tennis Center</ORGANIZATION>, home of the
Australian Open, to honor Oz Tennis, a charity that gives poor
children the chance to learn the game. The vice president hit
tennis balls there with former <ORGANIZATION>Wimbledon</ORGANIZATION> doubles champion <PERSON>Paul
McNamee</PERSON> and 11-year-old <PERSON>Michael Memedev</PERSON>.

   <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Group Proprietary Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>,
which owns the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION> and three other major
Australian publications, was placed into receivership <DATE>Monday</DATE> after
banks called in outstanding debts.
   <PERSON>John Fairfax</PERSON>, one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s two major newspaper groups
along with <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Ltd., owes about <MONEY>1.7 billion
Australian dollars</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.31 billion</MONEY>, to its creditors.
   Company officials said directors asked for the appointment of a
provisional liquidator for the group's finance division after banks
refused to agree to a rollover of a debt of <MONEY>850 million Australian
dollars</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$654 million</MONEY>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu</ORGANIZATION> accountancy firm was then appointed
receiver and manager at the request of <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Group</ORGANIZATION>'s banking
syndicate.
   The <ORGANIZATION>ANZ Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION> are owed about <MONEY>1.2 billion Australian
dollars</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$850 million</MONEY>. The remaining debt is in the form of
high-yield, high-risk bonds.
   John <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s oldest media organization, also owns
the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Financial Review</ORGANIZATION>, Business Review Weekly and The
(<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>) Age as well as the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> is the
oldest English-language newspaper in the world continuously owned
by the same family.
   In early <DATE>October</DATE>, the company reported a net loss of <MONEY>59.08
million Australian dollars</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$45.49 million</MONEY>, for the year ending
<DATE>June 30</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE>, three top <PERSON>John Fairfax</PERSON> officials - Chief Executive
<PERSON>Chris Anderson</PERSON>, Chairman <PERSON>Brian Kelman</PERSON> and director <PERSON>Bob Johnston</PERSON> -
resigned amid continuing disputes on renegotiations of the debt.
   John <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>'s problems have been mirrored at <ORGANIZATION>Murdoch's News
Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.
   In early <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> merged four of his newspapers into two
round-the-clock productions in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. The moves came
amidst a plunge in the value of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock that wiped out
more than <MONEY>2 billion Australian dollars</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.66 billion</MONEY>, of the
company's market capitalization.
   Murdoch has been talking in recent weeks with bank lenders about
restructuring <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> debt and hopes to have a deal by early
next year.
   Other media outlets in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have fared poorly as well. Two
of the major private television stations are in receivership and
have fired hundreds of staff. The third recently reported a loss of
<MONEY>618 million Australian dollars</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$511 million</MONEY>.

When the <PERSON>Honorable John Cain</PERSON>, premier of the state of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, 
passed through town the other day, he made a pitch to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' chief 
executives to come invest Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the place as vibrant but expensive," <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> said in an interview after 
lunching with 10 chief executives at the <ORGANIZATION>California Club</ORGANIZATION>. He was en route to 
<LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> to sell <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> as the site for the <DATE>1996</DATE> Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The city is up against <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>; 
<LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>. If <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> wins, the Games are expected to help channel 
tourism and investment into <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> -- specifically <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>, which is on the 
southeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Cain is selling <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> as a gateway to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> with its 24-hour port, 
the largest in the <LOCATION>Southern Hemisphere</LOCATION> and the 10th-largest container port in 
the world. With <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> increasingly aligning itself with its Asia-Pacific 
neighbors, <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> said his state is part of the "most dynamic market at the 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversifying Exports 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>January</DATE>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has attempted to interest other Asia-Pacific countries 
in uniting to promote regional economic cooperation through a so-called Pacific 
Rim Initiative. Earlier this month, Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> invited 11 
countries, including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, to an initial meeting in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>November</DATE> to discuss the international economic and trade environment. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has been restructuring its economy to be 
less dependent on commodity exports by diversifying into export-oriented 
manufacturing businesses. As part of the change, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has cut its 
effective corporate tax rate to <PERCENT>39%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> and liberalized some of the work 
practices of unions. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has aggressively hit the road to lure foreign investors from abroad. 
The states of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> have sent their own investment missions 
abroad, and each has a trade office in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. The Victoria Investment 
Program, for example, is targeting the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West 
Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as primary sources of potential investment. 
</P>
<P>
In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the target industries are biotechnology, tourism 
facilities, advanced manufacturing and materials, and medical and scientific 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking business that capitalizes on our strengths," such as cheap 
energy and tax advantages for research and development, <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies, he said, have discovered <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> as a strategic base 
for Asia-Pacific operations. They include <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>B. F. Goodrich 
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Control Data Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell 
Douglas Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Applications 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in <ORGANIZATION>Mirror Group Newspapers</ORGANIZATION>
received an assurance on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> from <PERSON>Mr David Montgomery</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>'s
chief executive, that the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Mirror</ORGANIZATION> will remain a left-of-centre
newspaper.
'As a result of conversations which took place last week, I have no doubt
that the Daily Mirror's left-of-centre position will continue,' said <PERSON>Mr John
Melbourn</PERSON>, a senior executive director of <ORGANIZATION>National Westminster Bank</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr
Melbourn</PERSON> added that 'left-of-centre' is synonymous with backing the <ORGANIZATION>Labour
Party</ORGANIZATION> in general elections. The banks believe a rightward shift would damage
MGN as a business.
Separately it also emerged yesterday that <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>'s board is likely to issue a
statement this week, reaffirming both the left-of-centre stance of the Daily
Mirror and stating the board's support for <PERSON>Mr Montgomery</PERSON>'s management.
<ORGANIZATION>NatWest</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder and <PERSON>Mr Melbourn</PERSON> has been playing a
leading role in attempts by the bank to restore stability to <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>, after its
employees and the <ORGANIZATION>Labour Party</ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON>Mr Montgomery</PERSON> of attempting to break
the Mirror's traditional Labour allegiance.
Representatives of <ORGANIZATION>National Westminster</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds</ORGANIZATION>,
which between them control 54 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>'s shares as collateral on
loans to the late <PERSON>Mr Robert Maxwell</PERSON>, saw <PERSON>Mr Montgomery</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> for a
briefing on the performance of the businesses. A banker at the meeting said:
'After all <DATE>last week</DATE>'s speculation, we asked him for an assurance that the
newspaper would stay left of centre.' <PERSON>Mr Montgomery</PERSON> gave that assurance.
Earlier in the week, <PERSON>Mr Melbourn</PERSON> sought and received a similar commitment on
the Mirror's political stance from Sir <PERSON>Robert Clarke</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman. He
also asked Sir <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> to stay on as chairman for another year, but suggested
that the board should be slightly reconstituted so that non-executives make
up 60 per cent of all directors. One or two other non-executives are
therefore likely to be appointed.
A banks' representative also had a meeting last week with <PERSON>Lord Hollick</PERSON>, the
Labour businessman who is a non-executive director of <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>. The banker asked
<PERSON>Lord Hollick</PERSON> whether he had a hidden agenda as a director of MGN, following
reports that he plans to make a bid for <ORGANIZATION>MGN</ORGANIZATION>. Lord <PERSON>Hollick</PERSON> told the banks
that he had no hidden agenda and that no bid was planned.

HORSE RACING. <DATE>November 1</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Cup</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Flemington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. <DATE>November 5</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Breeders</ORGANIZATION>' Cup meeting, <LOCATION>Churchill Downs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>.
Increasingly, star racehorses are jetting the globe for cash and kudos.
Long-haul travel does not suit all racehorses, but the success of the
Irish-based Vintage Crop in last year's <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Cup proved an eye-opener
for top owners. Vintage Crop has again been flown to <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, though a leg
injury last week was a worry. A better prospect in a tricksy race (the
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Cup is a handicap) may be fellow long-haul traveller Quick Ransom
from <PERSON>Mark Johnston</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> stable, who receives weight from Vintage
Crop. Quick Ransom shed 18 kilos on the flight to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> but regained
most of them swiftly and is said to be spot on. In <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, the 11th
staging of the lucrative Breeders' Cup races - seven in total, five on dirt,
two on grass, with prize money of Dollars 10m - sees the biggest overseas
challenge yet. A record 26 European horses are due to appear in different
races, half of them from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s raid is strongest in the Classic,
Turf and Mile events (the latter two on grass), while <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s brightest
chance lies with flying mare Lochsong, who faces 13 US rivals in the <ORGANIZATION>Sprint</ORGANIZATION>.
Only Pebbles (<DATE>1985</DATE>) and <PERSON>Sheikh Albadou</PERSON> (<DATE>1991</DATE>) have won for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in 77
Breeders' Cup races. The odds against a British win of any sort are quoted
at a sobering 2-1.
FOOTBALL. <DATE>November 1</DATE>, Uefa Cup, 2nd round, 2nd leg, <PERSON>Athletico Bilbao</PERSON> v
<LOCATION>Newcastle</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Aston Villa v Trabzonspor</ORGANIZATION>. <DATE>November 2</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>European Champions' League
Group</ORGANIZATION> A, <ORGANIZATION>FC Barcelona v Manchester United</ORGANIZATION>. <DATE>November 3</DATE>, European Cup Winners'
Cup, <LOCATION>Austria Vienna</LOCATION> v <LOCATION>Chelsea</LOCATION>, Arsenal v <LOCATION>Brondby</LOCATION>.
Five English clubs compete in European this week, with the hardest task
appearing to face <PERSON>Chelsea</PERSON> who are away to FK <LOCATION>Austria Vienna</LOCATION>, or <LOCATION>Austria
Memphis</LOCATION> as they now prefer to be called. No English club has ever lost to an
Austrian club in a European competition, but <ORGANIZATION>Chelsea</ORGANIZATION>'s walking wounded could
put that right on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. They drew the first leg 0-0 at <ORGANIZATION>Stamford Bridge</ORGANIZATION>,
and it really will be a funny old game if <PERSON>Glenn Hoddle</PERSON>'s men can produce
those 'Goodnight <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>' headlines come <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Also in the Cup Winners'
Cup, holders Arsenal take a 2-1 lead over <LOCATION>Brondby</LOCATION> into the game at <LOCATION>Highbury</LOCATION>.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Uefa Cup</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Aston Villa</ORGANIZATION> entertain <ORGANIZATION>Trabzonspor</ORGANIZATION> after losing 1-0 in
<LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, and Premiership leaders <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> are away to <ORGANIZATION>Athletico Bilbao</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Kevin Keegan</PERSON>'s side nodded off for a while in the first leg. After leading
3-0 they finished the game 3-2 up, and take that advantage to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
Meanwhile, in the big one - the <ORGANIZATION>European Champions League</ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION>Manchester
United</ORGANIZATION> go to <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>. Over 100,000 Catalans have booked their seats in the
Nou Camp, and <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> will be hoping for the kind of refereeing they enjoyed
in the Premier League this month against <ORGANIZATION>Blackburn</ORGANIZATION>.
RUGBY LEAGUE. <DATE>November 5</DATE>, <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> v <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, 2nd <PERSON>John Smith</PERSON>'s Test,
Old Trafford.
What happened to the invincible Kangaroos at <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION>? Great <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s 8-4
victory over the Australians in the first <PERSON>John Smith</PERSON>'s Test has had the
Tourists checking video evidence to see how they managed to lose 'the match
<ORGANIZATION>Great Britain</ORGANIZATION> couldn't win'. The Australians, however, will take heart from
the fact that in <DATE>1990</DATE> they came back from a surprise <ORGANIZATION>Wembley</ORGANIZATION> defeat to take
the series 2-1, and that it is nearly 30 years since they lost a series to
<LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.
MOTOR RACING. <DATE>November 6</DATE>, Japanese Grand Prix, <LOCATION>Suzuka</LOCATION>.
The deaths of <PERSON>Ayrton Senna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roland Ratzenberger</PERSON> apart, this year's
Formula One title chase has been superb unscripted drama - strong
characterisation and a thrilling, if sometimes unbelievable, plot. With two
races to go and only five points between them, the pressure has even got to
two of the sport's <PERSON>Mr Nice Guys</PERSON>, with <PERSON>Michael Schumacher</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Benetton</ORGANIZATION>) and
<PERSON>Damon Hill</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>) hurling ever more vicious insults at each other in the
press. Schumacher could clinch the title at <LOCATION>Suzuka</LOCATION>, but admits it is a
circuit where <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> may have a power advantage. Off the track in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>,
all talk will be of who will be racing for whom next season, and which
engines will power which cars. <ORGANIZATION>Peugeot</ORGANIZATION> announced last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that it is
switching its engines from <ORGANIZATION>McLaren</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> for <DATE>1995</DATE>. This was brought
about by one of the biggest motor racing alliances for many a year, in which
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION> engines are to be used by the <ORGANIZATION>McLaren</ORGANIZATION> team. The German manufacturer
already supplies race engines to the <PERSON>Penske</PERSON> team for <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> IndyCar events, and
both <PERSON>Penske</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>McLaren</ORGANIZATION> are sponsored by Marlboro. The strong tip is that
Mercedes' agreement with the British team will also involve a commitment to
the IndyCar series, and that <PERSON>Schumacher</PERSON> will join <PERSON>McLaren</PERSON> when his contract
with <ORGANIZATION>Benetton</ORGANIZATION> finishes next year.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Sport: The fools who killed off the Hill - Cricket / The sad
slide of Test cricket in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE used to be a grassy mound more or less opposite the pavilion at the
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> cricket ground. They called it The Hill, and for generations of
working class Sydneysiders it was a second home for the <DATE>five days a year</DATE>
when <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> met its touring opponents in the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> Test match.
By all accounts they were a rough lot on The Hill, but they knew about
cricket. The most famous habitue of The Hill was <PERSON>Stephen Gasgoigne</PERSON>, fondly
known as <LOCATION>Yabba</LOCATION>, whose stentorian voice carried clear across the ground from
his position under the old scoreboard.
Even <PERSON>Douglas Jardine</PERSON>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s captain during the <DATE>1932</DATE> bodyline series, is
said to have smiled when Yabba spotted him swatting bluebottles and roared:
'<PERSON>Jardine</PERSON>, leave our flies alone.' So great was <ORGANIZATION>Yabba</ORGANIZATION>'s fame that Sir <PERSON>Jack
Hobbs</PERSON> sought him out and shook his hand across the boundary fence after his
last <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> innings.
The Hill was still there 12 months ago, when <PERSON>Graham Gooch</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Gower</PERSON>
nearly batted <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to victory over <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. But it was no longer a
storehouse of wit and colour; sadly, it was infested by drunken gangs of
English yobs whose grimy flags and football chants smacked of soccer fans at
their worst.
The English antics played some part in the end of <LOCATION>The Hill</LOCATION>, which had become
a source of concern to the <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> police and the cricket
authorities, because of the growing number of hooligans it was attracting.
The area was concreted over <DATE>last winter</DATE>, and now sports the same anonymous
rows of beige plastic chairs as the rest of the ground.
It remains an institution, if only because a nameplate identifies it as
<ORGANIZATION>Yabba</ORGANIZATION>'s Hill in the same type allotted to the adjacent <PERSON>Doug Walters</PERSON> and
(Bill) O'Reilly stands. And there were plenty of would-be <ORGANIZATION>Yabba</ORGANIZATION>'s there
during the classic Test match against <PERSON>Mohammad Azharuddin</PERSON>'s Indians which
finished in a draw on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
Fortunately, there was no repetition of last year's boorish English
behaviour, or of the near-riot at the <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Cricket Ground</ORGANIZATION> recently,
when spectators in the upper stands threw whatever came to hand at those
seated below. But Yabba would surely have been shocked by the drunken chants
of 'boring' which punctuated even those periods when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> were scoring
quickly, and by the ignorance of a large body of spectators - exemplified by
repeated demands for local hero <PERSON>Mike Whitney</PERSON> to bowl after he came on as
substitute.
For their ADollars 20 (Pounds 8.50) a day, the fans on The Hill saw
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> race to 234-for-4 on the first day, only to slump to 313 all out
after a terrific exhibition of swing bowling from <ORGANIZATION>Kapil Dev</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Manoj Prabhakar</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Subroto Banerjee</PERSON>, who was brought in to strengthen the bowling after
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s defeats in the first two Tests in <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> made 483 all out, thanks to a wonderful 206 by <PERSON>Ravi Shastri</PERSON>, a solid
54 by <PERSON>Dilip Vengsarkar</PERSON>, and an imperious 148 not out by 18-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Sachin
Tendulkar</ORGANIZATION> who treated the crowd to every shot in the coaching manual except
the hook.
On the <DATE>last day</DATE>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> collapsed to 173-for-8 as <PERSON>Shastri</PERSON> took 4-for-48
from perfectly flighted left-arm spin on a turning wicket. At the last gasp,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> were saved by a captain's innings of 53 not out by <ORGANIZATION>Border</ORGANIZATION>. Even
so, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> could fairly claim they would have won but for the loss of five
hours to rain, mostly on the third day.
How any cricket lover could find all this boring would be beyond
comprehension but for the surfeit of one-day international cricket which now
dominates the Australian <DATE>summer</DATE>. More than 50 one-day internationals will be
played in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> between <DATE>January</DATE> and the end of <DATE>March</DATE> as
first the World Series Cup and then the World Cup dominate the sporting
headlines.
All guarantee a result, plenty of big hitting and an exciting run-chase in
the final hour, even if the price is several hours of medium-pace trundling
to defensive fields.
The World Series Cup, played in coloured track suits with a white ball under
floodlights, is a particularly inane spectacle to the purist, especially
since there appears to be no reason for its existence other than the
programming demands of <PERSON>Kerry Packer</PERSON>'s Channel Nine TV network.
This year the participants are <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>. No
doubt one of them will win, but will anyone remember once the lights are
turned off?
The World Cup will be more interesting, if only for the reappearance of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> after some 20 years. Curiously, they will be
captained by <PERSON>Kepler Wessels</PERSON>, who played more than 20 Tests for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>
after migrating from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. That will at least remind Australians
that <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> is not the only country willing to take advantage of South
African expatriates.
Meanwhile, the increasingly arcane world of Test cricket moves to <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>
on <DATE>January 25</DATE>, and then to <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> on <DATE>February 1</DATE>. The Indians showed in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
that they are capable of outplaying <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in every department, including
fielding, where they appeared to have absorbed the lessons handed out by
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
Then, back in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, the denizens of The Hill will be roaring as the yellow
track-suited Australians struggle to overcome the blue-suited English, and
so on in the World Cup.
It will be an opportunity for a number of great players, including <PERSON>Gooch</PERSON>, to
play a final innings on a great ground. But can anyone imagine <PERSON>Gooch</PERSON> walking
down to The Hill afterwards to shake hands across the fence?

  [Text] <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 19</DATE> (AFP) -- Greek religious leaders 
held a special mass here <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after their orthodox church 
was set on fire amid ethnic tensions between Greek and 
Macedonian communities. 
  Firefighters were called late <DATE>Friday</DATE> to <ORGANIZATION>St Efimia</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Greek 
Orthodox Church</ORGANIZATION> in the western <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>Bankstown</LOCATION>, 
within Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>'s constituency. 
  The front double doors were ablaze and police said a 
four-litre can which might have contained fuel was discovered 
outside. A police spokesman said it was too early to say 
whether it was linked to the Greek-Macedonian tensions. 
  Earlier this month, a Greek community centre [see previous 
Terrorism Report] and the offices of a state MP, <PERSON>Alex 
Andrianopoulos</PERSON>, were firebombed in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> following 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of 
<LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION> on <DATE>February 15</DATE>. 
  <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> insists that the use of the term, "<LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION>", 
applies 
only to a northern Greek province of the same name and has 
accused authorities in the former Yugoslav republic of 
harbouring territorial designs on Greek territory. 
  Macedonians have also complained that the Australian 
government caved in to Greek lobbying when it decided on <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
to refer to them officially as Slav Macedonians. 
  There are about 700,000 Greek Australians -- a large 
majority 
of whom live in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> -- with about 25,000 of them having 
roots in <LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION>.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Sport: Imperious Lara knocks Border's plans into a spin -
Kevin Brown watches some myths debunked in Sydney / Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR the third consecutive year, the annual Test match at the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Cricket
Ground</ORGANIZATION> faded into a draw, but not without destroying a couple of
long-standing myths.
By the time <PERSON>Brian Lara</PERSON> wrapped up the match on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> with a
couple of overs of wobbly leg-spin - including a googly which the hapless
<PERSON>Mark Taylor</PERSON> failed to pick up - <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> had racked up
1,226 runs, in spite of frequent interruptions for rain. It was a
heart-stirring display batting exhibition, which included six 50s and three
centuries, capped by <PERSON>Lara</PERSON>'s imperious 277, widely lauded as one of the best
knocks ever seen at <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>.
For those with a taste for history (which means almost all cricket watchers)
it conjured up images of the golden age of batting between the wars, when
<PERSON>Bradman</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Ponsford</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hammond</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sutcliffe</PERSON> piled up so many towering
scores. Lara's innings, in particular, announced the arrival of a great
talent, fit to be spoken of in the same breath as masters such as Sir
<PERSON>Garfield Sobers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vivian Richards</PERSON>. After <PERSON>Lara</PERSON> passed 250, when it seemed
almost impossible that any of the toiling Australian bowlers could remove
him, <PERSON>Sobers</PERSON>' record Test score of 365 not out (against <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1957</DATE>) seemed doomed to fall. Fittingly, it took a brilliant run out by
<PERSON>Damian Martyn</PERSON> to send the modest 23-year-old back to the pavilion and a
standing ovation they must have heard in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
Lara's achievement was all the more astonishing given the circumstances in
which it was made. The West Indians came to <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> one down in the five
match series, having drawn in <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> and lost in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> (mostly because
of their abysmal catching.) After losing the toss, captain <PERSON>Richie Richardson</PERSON>
watched <ORGANIZATION>Alan Border</ORGANIZATION>'s Australians score 503 for nine declared, followed by
the rapid removal of <PERSON>Desmond Haynes</PERSON>, the veteran West Indies opener, and
<PERSON>Phil Simmonds</PERSON>, a heroic centurion in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lara</PERSON> came
together at 31 for two, facing what seemed like certain defeat. They parted
at 324 for three, when <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> mistimed a pull shot off the big-hearted
trundler <PERSON>Merv Hughes</PERSON> and was caught in the deep for 109. From there, it was
all downhill for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Keith Arthurton</PERSON> chipped in with 47, and <PERSON>Jimmy
Adams</PERSON> with a painstaking 77 not out.
It was, of course, not supposed to happen that way. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s game plan
was built on two beliefs about the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> which have acquired the
status of received truths: they cannot play spin, and their heads drop when
things are going badly.
Border's team had two specialist slow bowlers, and <PERSON>Peter Leroy</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
groundsman, prepared a brown strip which looked guaranteed to uphold the
<ORGANIZATION>SCG</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation as a spinners' paradise.
<PERSON>Richardson</PERSON>, relying on all-rounders <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carl Hooper</PERSON> for spin, could
only echo fast bowler <PERSON>Ian Bishop</PERSON>'s plaintive cry of 'Where's the grass?'
when he saw the pitch. <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> was too polite to say so, but he will not
have failed to notice that the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> pace attack has been blunted by
grassless wickets in all three Tests so far. This may not be in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
long term interests, since the next Australian tourists in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> are
likely to find themselves batting (or more likely ducking) on the greenest
wickets they have ever seen. But it did appear, when the captains walked out
on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, that all Border had to do was win the toss and score as many
first innings runs as possible before unleashing his spinners on a crumbling
wicket.
Border duly won the toss, and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> got what looked like enough runs,
thanks partly to a sparkling 100 from <PERSON>Steve Waugh</PERSON>. But the script went wrong
when <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lara</PERSON>, refusing to bow to seemingly inevitable defeat,
treated <PERSON>Greg Matthews</PERSON>' flat off breaks and <PERSON>Shane Warne</PERSON>'s more flighted leg
spin with equal disdain. The manner of the result will give great heart to
<PERSON>Richardson</PERSON>'s young team, which is rebuilding after the recent retirements of
stalwarts like <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gordon Greenidge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jeff Dujon</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Michael Holding</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Wes Hall</PERSON>, the fast bowler who played for the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
watched part of the match and was moved to comparisons with <PERSON>Clive Lloyd</PERSON>'s
inexperienced <DATE>1975</DATE> / 76 team, which was thrashed 5-1 in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> but went
on to become undisputed world champions.
The experience will have been less uplifting for the Australians, and it
must have been particularly difficult for <PERSON>Warne</PERSON>, who finished with one
wicket for 116 off 41 overs - his single scalp the wicket of the struggling
<PERSON>Hooper</PERSON>, who continues to promise more than he delivers. However, <PERSON>Warne</PERSON> may
benefit in the long run if his failure lowers the expectations raised by his
seven for 52 in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. That performance made him the latest candidate
for the mantle of <PERSON>Clarrie Grimmett</PERSON>, the best in a long line of match-winning
Australian leg-spinners the last of whom was <PERSON>Richie Benaud</PERSON> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
<PERSON>Warne</PERSON> did not bowl badly in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, and at the age of 23 he has plenty of
time to perfect the leg-spinner's art, perhaps the most difficult in the
cricketing lexicon. Already, for example, he is sufficiently confident to
bowl the 'flipper,' a delivery which <PERSON>Grimmett</PERSON> practised for 10 years before
he dared bowl it in a Test.
However, <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> has raised two big question marks about the slow men: will
<PERSON>Warne</PERSON>'s promise fade on less accommodating pitches in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> later this year; and why does the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> no longer produce
spinners of the calibre of <PERSON>Lance Gibbs</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sonny Ramadhin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alf Valentine</PERSON>?
The first question will be answered soon enough; the second seems destined
to remain a mystery.
The teams move on to <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> with the West Indians requiring one
victory to even the series and retain the Sir <PERSON>Frank Worrall</PERSON> trophy. Both
venues are likely to offer more pace and bounce than the lifeless <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
pitch, giving hope to the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION> that their quick bowlers can finally
match the increasingly confident batsmen. The Australians, deprived once
again of the injury-prone <PERSON>Bruce Reid</PERSON>, will be hoping for further fireworks
from <ORGANIZATION>Warne</ORGANIZATION>. But they may be hard pressed to hold off the resurgent visitors.

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Associated Newspapers</ORGANIZATION>, the UK media group whose newspaper interests include
the Daily Mail and Mail on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, yesterday acquired a 10 per cent stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION>, the Australian radio group which runs stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>.
The stake was bought through a placement of 10m new shares at ADollars 1.15,
costing <ORGANIZATION>Associated Newspapers</ORGANIZATION> ADollars 11.5m (Pounds 5.46m).
The two companies said the investment followed discussions between them
'over recent months', and that they planned a 'long-term business
relationship'.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Associated</ORGANIZATION>'s move comes at a time when bid speculation surrounds
the Australian group. Melbourne-based <ORGANIZATION>Village Roadshow</ORGANIZATION>, which has radio
interests alongside its larger cinema and theme park operations, has a 14
per cent holding in <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION>, and this week announced plans to raise
ADollars 230m of new funds, ADollars 80m of which was conditional upon an
unspecified 'strategic investment' going ahead.
While Village - in which the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s Anglia TV and <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>'s Nine
Network hold minority stakes - has declined to detail its plans, there has
been speculation that <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION> could be the target.
Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION>Austereo</ORGANIZATION>, which only launched on the stockmarket in <DATE>July</DATE>,
reported a loss of ADollars 8.3m for 1993/4. The figure was in line with
prospectus projections, however, and the company has forecast a ADollars
13.9m after-tax profit for the current year.
The managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Associated Newspapers</ORGANIZATION>' radio division in the UK is
<PERSON>Mr Charlie Cox</PERSON>, an Australian.

   <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle-Tacoma</LOCATION> are the
best cities in which to live, the private <ORGANIZATION>Population Crisis
Committee</ORGANIZATION> said after surveying conditions in the world's 100
largest metropolitan areas.
   <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, is the worst, the group said <DATE>Monday</DATE> in an
analysis based on two years of research.
   <PERSON>Sharon L. Camp</PERSON>, the organization's senior vice president, said
the study wasn't a guidebook for retirement or business or
vacations but rather a warning about the dangers of rapid
population growth.
   ``MOre than half of these cities are sinking from the weight of
too many people,'' she said. ``More than anything else, the numbers
... add up to human population overload.''
   The committee analyzed living conditions in the metropolitan
areas, awarding up to 10 points in each of 10 categories.
   <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION>Seattle-Tacoma</LOCATION>
area each accumulated 86 of the possible 100 points.
   Lagos scored 19 points.
   <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION> averages 5.8 people per room in living space, only half
the city's houses have water and electricity and there is only one
telephone per 100 people.
   By comparison <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> average 0.5 person per room
in housing and <LOCATION>Seattle-Tacoma</LOCATION> has 0.4. All residences in those
cities have water or electricity or both. Seattle-Tacoma has 106
telephones per 100 people, while there are 69 in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> and 45 in
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
   Joining the three first-place cities in making up the five most
livable cities were Essen-Dortmund-Duisberg, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and the
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, area. Both rated 85. The <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, Mich.-Windsor,
<LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION> region finished sixth.
   With <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION> at the bottom of the list were: <LOCATION>Kinshasa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, 29
points; <LOCATION>Dhaka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>, 32; and <LOCATION>Recife</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Kanpur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, each with 33 points.
   Two of the world's 100 largest cities - <LOCATION>Bucharest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Rangoon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> - could not be ranked because of lack of data.
   Montreal Mayor <PERSON>Jean Dore</PERSON> said the city, ``like all other major
economic and cultural centers in the world, has to deal with major
social and environmental issues. But our city has an important
advantage over other big cities - <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> wants to preserve its
heritage of the past while setting human scale development as the
keystone of the future.''
   <PERSON>Steve Morris</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Seattle-King County Convention
and Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, said: ``We're always thrilled when <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> get
high marks in these kind of polls.''
   And <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Richard Wynne</PERSON> called his community ``one of
the most convenient cities, a comfortable city and a safe city with
good transport and rich cultural activity.''
   Criteria for the rankings were:
   -<ORGANIZATION>Murders</ORGANIZATION> per 100,000 people: <LOCATION>Capetown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, had the
highest rate at 64.7. Rated at less than one were <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>BAndung</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>.
   -Percent of income spent on food: Most expensive is <PERSON>Ho Chi Minh
City</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT>. Residents of 23 communities spend more
than half their income on food. Food accounted for <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of
income in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   -People per room: <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION> was most crowded at 5.8, while <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> had 5.7. All cities in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, had fewer than
0.5 person per room.
   -Percent of homes with water or electricity or both: At least <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> of homes had water and electricity in <PERCENT>87 percent</PERCENT> of the
Metro areas, although the analysis didn't always take into account
squatter settlements or illegal water and electrical connections.
<LOCATION>Kinshasa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, had two-thirds of
residents lacking running water or electricity or both.
   -Telephone per 100 people: <LOCATION>San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose</LOCATION> has
151 telephones per 100 people. <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ho Chi</PERSON> <LOCATION>Minh City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kinshasa</LOCATION>
have less than 1.
   -Percent of children in secondary school: <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> and
Essen-Dortmund-Duisberg each reported that <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of
youngsters 14 to 17 were attending school. <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lagos</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Lahore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, had fewer than one-third in school.
   -Infant deaths per 1,000 live births: <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, and three
Japanese urban areas (Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto, Tokyo-Yokohama and <LOCATION>Nagoya</LOCATION>)
had five infant deaths per 1,000 births. <LOCATION>Kanpur</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, had 157.
   -Levels of ambient noise: <LOCATION>Dallas-Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and
<PERSON>Manchester</PERSON> were ranked as relatively quiet. Noisiest included <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Karachi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Madras</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Lahore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Surabaya</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Monterrey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>MExico</LOCATION>.
   -Traffic flow in miles per hour in rush hour: Traffic managed
more than 40 mph in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Casablanca</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Belo Horizonte</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and Detroit-Windsor. In <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>, it crawled along at 4 mph.
   -Air pollution: <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> were ranked as
having clean air. Dirtiest were <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>;
<LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Shenyang</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>; and

  Alatas, 61, was admitted to the private <ORGANIZATION>Epworth Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and underwent a three-hour quadruple bypass 
operation on <DATE>Monday</DATE> after suffering a heart attack last month. 
  Bambang said the foreign minister's departure from hospital 
and return to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> would depend on advice from his surgeon, 
Professor <PERSON>Brian Buxton</PERSON>, the hospital's head of cardiac surgery. 
  But he said he had no idea when <PERSON>Alatas</PERSON> would return to work. 
  Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> visited <PERSON>Alatas</PERSON> on 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
  Alatas is a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement and in 
preparations for this year's summit of the <ORGANIZATION>Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation</ORGANIZATION>.

  [Text] Protests have continued in <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> following this 
week's closure of <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s three leading news magazines. 
<PERSON>Michael Maher</PERSON> reports from the Indonesian capital that there 
are signs that the military are not fully behind the <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> 
government's action. 
  [<PERSON>Maher</PERSON>] About 400 journalists and students, many dressed in 
black, gathered outside the department of information to demand 
the return of press freedom. Riot police tussled with 
demonstrators who spilt out on to the road waving banners 
critical of the government's action. It now appears sections of 
the military are also opposed to the bans on the news weeklies 
TEMPO, <LOCATION>DETIK</LOCATION>, and EDITOR. The official spokesman of the armed 
forces, <PERSON>Syarwan Hamid</PERSON>, is quoted in the <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION>SUARA 
PEMBARUAN</ORGANIZATION> as saying that the closures are very regrettable and 
should not have happened. 
  <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s human rights commission has described the bans 
as 
a step backward. However, government officials have since 
issued warnings to at least four other news journals about their 
reporting. Demonstrators say they'll continue their protest 
actions until freedom of expression is restored. 
  [<LOCATION>Melbourne Radio Australia</LOCATION> in English at 0800 GMT on 23 <DATE>June</DATE> 
adds: "The continuing protests come just days ahead of a visit 
to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> by the Australian prime minister, <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> will meet President <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 
[28 <DATE>June</DATE>], but it's not clear if the issue of the magazines' 
closure will be raised. A senior Australian official in 
<LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> said that if the media ban is discussed it will be done 
privately and quietly. <PERSON>Graeme Dobell</PERSON> reports. 
  "[<ORGANIZATION>Dobell</ORGANIZATION>] The senior government official said <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>'s 
meeting with President <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> would be unscripted and it was 
not possible to say whether the prime minister would raise the 
closure of the three Indonesian magazines. He said the foreign 
minister <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON> had put <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s position in parliament 
yesterday, when he described the ban as very disappointing. 
That statement had been passed to the Indonesian ambassador and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s view on freedom of the press had been registered. 
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> leaves on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> for a 48 hour trip to 
<LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> to open an Australia-Indonesia business forum."]

PROVIDING BETTER THAN A BETTING CHANCE

<P>
Visitors to almost any Australian racetrack will be struck by this phenomenon: 
The track's large, comfortable grandstand seating area almost always will be 
deserted. Horseplayers here rarely sit down. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that there is no time to kill between races; indeed, there is no 
time to waste as bettors consult odds on television monitors, compare 
bookmakers' prices and scurry to make wagers. This was the schedule at the 
Warwick Farm races here <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>: The first race was run at 12:40. At 12:55 
there was a simulcast from <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. At 1:05 there was a simulcast from 
<LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>. At 1:10 came a simulcast from <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>. Post time for the second live 
race from at <ORGANIZATION>Warwick Farm</ORGANIZATION> was 1:15. Breathless bettors had the opportunity to 
watch and play 34 races (all with quinella and trifecta wagering) during the 
course of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, citizens in virtually every part of this country had similar 
opportunities, because outlets for the <ORGANIZATION>Totalizator Agency Board</ORGANIZATION>, the country's 
off-track betting network, are ubiquitous. The TAB is the most efficient, 
extensive off-track betting system in the world. 
</P>
<P>
When technology made such systems possible, racing leaders in virtually every 
country sought the best way to implement it. America's first venture into this 
area was horribly botched by <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Off-Track Betting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which 
produced a bloated bureaucracy and wrecked attendance at the tracks. England 
fared even worse, with a system that not only killed attendance but drained 
money from the sport and resulted in pitifully low purses. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> did it right. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of illegal, off-track wagering here used to be massive; the 
neighborhood bookie was as much of a fixture in any community as the 
neighborhood cop. While legal, on-track bookmakers were taxed, the illegal 
operators were siphoning potential revenue from the states and the tracks. So 
in <DATE>1960</DATE> the legislature in the state of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, where <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> is located, 
passed a bill creating the TAB to operate off-track betting shops, telephone 
betting and on-course tote betting. It was so successful that each of 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s six states created its own TAB (each with its own management and 
its own betting pools). They revitalized horse racing in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's TAB was created as a quasi-public authority with two missions: to 
raise money for the state and for the racing industry. The "take" from wagers 
is about <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT>, of which about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> goes to the tracks. In the past 
year, the <ORGANIZATION>TAB</ORGANIZATION> handled <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> in wagers and generated more than <MONEY>$80 
million</MONEY> for purses and track development in this one state alone. "The 
contribution the <ORGANIZATION>TAB</ORGANIZATION> has made to racing is massively greater than anything the 
tracks could generate themselves," said <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> TAB General Manager <PERSON>Neil 
Walker</PERSON>. Because of this contribution, a race like the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Cup could offer 
a <MONEY>$1.6 million</MONEY> purse this year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the <ORGANIZATION>TAB</ORGANIZATION> has reduced attendance at the track, a fact of life that 
tracks accept. "We know you can't have your cake and eat it too," said <PERSON>Pat 
Parker</PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Turf Club</ORGANIZATION>. But the tracks here still 
attract healthy crowds and retain an air of vitality, because on-course 
bookmakers remain legal. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than viewing them as rivals for the betting dollar, TAB and track 
officials know the bookies are an essential part of the game. "They bring 
people to the racecourse," said <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>. "They offer fixed odds and they give 
big players the opportunity to play. And they add a lot of atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bookies' existence creates business for the tote 
because of arbitrage situations. If one horse is 2 to 1 with the bookmakers and 
5 to 1 on the tote, while the odds on another horse are the reverse, sharpies 
will be betting heavily to exploit the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
But if the arrival of the TAB was a bonanza for tracks and state governments, 
it was also a boon for bettors. When smart handicappers had to do battle with 
the bookies, it was a duel of wise guys vs. wise guys. But now <MONEY>billions of 
dollars</MONEY> of unsophisticated money -- they call it "mug money" here -- were 
flowing into the tote pools. "Our dual betting system makes this the best place 
in the world for a punter (horseplayer)," said <PERSON>Shane Templeton</PERSON>, a journalist 
and professional punter in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robbie Waterhouse</PERSON>, the son of the man who used to be <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest 
bookmaker, was breaking into the business and was operating one frigid night at 
a little harness track at the foot of the <LOCATION>Blue Mountains</LOCATION>. In the middle of the 
betting ring was a large drum filled with burning coals where the gamblers 
could huddle to keep warm when they weren't betting. This was, in short, a 
hard-core crowd. One night the tote manager approached Waterhouse and said: 
"We've run out of money. Could you loan us a few thousand dollars?" Waterhouse 
initially wondered if he was being conned, but track officials took him to 
their office and explained that the track always wound up with less money than 
it started with. The on-track wise guys were showing a net profit that was 
being financed by TAB bettors throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> would be a wonderful enough place to play the horses just because it 
offers nonstop action, the chance to watch and bet more than 30 races in an 
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>. But where else on earth does the game offer the wondrous possibility 
that the crowd could win all of the track's money?

<TEXT>
   International media mogul <ORGANIZATION>Rupert
Murdoch</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he will merge four of his Australian
newspapers into two around-the-clock productions.
   The head of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> told a news conference that the morning
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> Sun and afternoon <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> would become The <ORGANIZATION>Herald-Sun</ORGANIZATION>. In
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, the afternoon Mirror and the morning <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> will
operate as the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph Mirror</ORGANIZATION>. All but the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> are
tabloids.
   ``These far-reaching changes are made as part of a commercial
decision to consolidate <ORGANIZATION>News Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>'s competitive positions in both
cities,'' he said.
   The moves come amidst a plunge in the value of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s
stock. It was trading <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at the equivalent of <MONEY>$5.56</MONEY> a share,
<MONEY>$9.42</MONEY> earlier this month.
   The fall has wiped out more than <MONEY>$1.66 billion</MONEY> of the company's
market capitalization and led the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> to
launch an inquiry. <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> told the exchange <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it did not
know the reason for the decline.
   The new 24-hour editions, publishing <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Saturday</DATE>,
are expected to start next <DATE>Monday</DATE>. While <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> said there would
be no cutbacks in editorial staff, other production areas will be
trimmed.
   He said the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Sun and the <ORGANIZATION>Sunday Herald</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> would
continue as separate publications.
   The new <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> paper is projected to have a circulation of
480,000, compared with 600,000 for The <ORGANIZATION>Herald Sun</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> said the move was one part of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s goal to move
to high-tech color printing in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, which would see full
color printing on every second page.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> said he felt the mergers would be
beneficial overall. ``It will probably mean a loss of jobs for some
people, but as far as the community in general is concerned they
probably will get a better service,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> said he did not foresee damage from a reduction in the
divergence of newspaper voices.
   ``If I look at the sort of opinions that come out of the
Telegraph and the Mirror and out of the Sun and the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> and the
two city papers down there, I don't see an enormous divergence of
opinion,'' he said.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Packer raises stake in winning
casino rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>, the Australian businessman who lost a joint bid to develop
the new ADollars 1bn-plus (USDollars 736m) <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino earlier this month,
has raised his underlying interest in Crown Casino, the company currently
developing the rival <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> property.
In a statement to the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated
Press</ORGANIZATION> said that a further 16.7m shares had been acquired, raising its
interest, along with that of its associates, from <MONEY>62.47 per cent</MONEY> to 67.23
per cent. The shares were bought at a price of ADollars 1.49.
Ahead of the latest purchases, which were rumoured to have taken place
earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION>ConsPress</ORGANIZATION> owned around 22 per cent of Crown, while its
associate, <PERSON>Hudson Conway</PERSON>, owned 26.4 per cent. ConsPress also has an option
over some further shares.
Crown won the right to build the ADollars 750m <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> casino <DATE>last year</DATE>,
which, when completed, will be one of the world's largest gaming properties
with 200 tables and 2,500 machines.
The casino is being built on the banks of <LOCATION>Yarra River</LOCATION>, which flows through
the Victorian city.
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>, who had teamed up with Circus Circus, the large <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> gaming group,
was the surprise loser in the fight for the even larger <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> casino
development. His bid was beaten by the Leighton Holdings/Showboat
consortium.

PHAR LAP'S LEGEND LIVES ON IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, I was showing an Australian visitor the main attractions of 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and took him, of course, to the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Memorial</ORGANIZATION>. I said that 
<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was the most universally revered figure in our nation's history, and 
asked him who would have a comparable stature in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor didn't hesitate: "Phar Lap." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there do seem to be more monuments in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to the legendary 
racehorse of the <DATE>1930s</DATE> than to any of the country's founders. His statue graces 
the entrance to <ORGANIZATION>Flemington Race Course</ORGANIZATION>, site of the <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Cup</ORGANIZATION>. The original 
Phar Lap was stuffed by a taxidermist and is on display at a museum in 
<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, where it is a major tourist attraction. His heart has been preserved 
under glass at the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Institute of Anatomy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>. (Naturally, 
it's a gigantic heart.) 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the death of the champion -- after an ill-fated trip to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> 
-- still is a nettlesome issue here. On my first day in this country, the taxi 
driver from the airport recognized my accent and talked at length about how 
Aussies love Americans, how they've never forgotten that we were allies in 
World War II, but added one small proviso: "We'll never forgive you for killing 
Phar Lap." 
</P>
<P>
No great racehorse has ever had a career so melodramatic. Phar Lap was bred in 
<LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and entered in a yearling sale there. A scuffling Australian 
trainer, <PERSON>Harry Telford</PERSON>, loved his pedigree, and persuaded an owner named <PERSON>David 
J. Davis</PERSON> to make the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
When Phap Lap arrived from <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> after a rough crossing of the <ORGANIZATION>Tasman 
Sea</ORGANIZATION>, skin had been torn off his head and he limped out of the tight quarters he 
had occupied on ship. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> didn't want him, and so he leased him to <ORGANIZATION>Telford</ORGANIZATION> 
for three years -- an agreement that would prove to be fateful. 
</P>
<P>
Phar Lap -- the name means "lightning" in <LOCATION>Sinhalese</LOCATION>, the major language of <LOCATION>Sri 
Lanka</LOCATION> -- was slow to bloom, but he won his last nine races as a 3-year-old and 
was a popular champion by the time he was 4 and was preparing for the <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne 
Cup</ORGANIZATION>. Bookmakers stood to lose <MONEY>hundreds of thousands of dollars</MONEY> if he won. 
</P>
<P>
His groom, <PERSON>Tommy Woodcock</PERSON>, recalled the events of that week in a film interview 
made shortly before his death a few years ago: "<PERSON>Mr. Telford</PERSON> got several letters 
that they were going to shoot him or run him down in the road. One morning we 
were going from the racetrack back to the stable and I happened to see this car 
on the road. The car started, and I took Phar Lap to the corner and pushed him 
to the fence. The car comes whizzing around the corner and all of a sudden a 
gun comes out the back window and fires a couple shots. They missed by a couple 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
After that close call, Phap Lap went into hiding before the Cup and arrived at 
<LOCATION>Flemington</LOCATION> under police escort 40 minutes before post time. The crowd roared at 
his arrival, and roared even louder after he carried 138 pounds to victory in 
the two-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being burdened by crushing weights, Phar Lap won 15 of 17 races as a 
4-year-old. As a 5-year-old, he won nine of 10. 
</P>
<P>
By then, <ORGANIZATION>Telford</ORGANIZATION>'s three-year lease had expired, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> was in charge and he 
chose to accept an invitation the trainer wanted to decline: to run in a stakes 
race at the <ORGANIZATION>Agua Caliente</ORGANIZATION> track in <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, 
for the then-incredible purse of <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Woodcock went with him on the ghastly ocean trip, but Phar Lap weathered it 
well enough that he was able to win the <LOCATION>Caliente Handicap</LOCATION> in track-record time, 
beating some of the best horses in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. Now he was an international 
hero -- American newspapers hailed him as the "Red Terror from the Antipodes" 
-- and <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> was planning on running him in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Phar Lap, of course, never got that chance. Woodcock was looking after him in 
<LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, where, he said: "Early one morning he got a little sick -- 
just a little temperature -- but by the next day he was in terrible pain. It 
was pitiful really, all the squealing and the pain he was in. I led him into 
the box (his stall) and he let out one unmerciful squeal and died in my arms." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, flags in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> were flying at half-mast, and headlines in 
newspapers said simply: "HE'S DEAD." 
</P>
<P>
Who or what killed Phar Lap? After the earlier attempts on his life, 
Australians were naturally conspiracy-minded, and a <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> reporter who 
accompanied him on his North American trip reported he was killed by poisoned 
balls of clay that were thrown through the window of his stall. 
</P>
<P>
The truth probably was much less dramatic. <PERSON>Isobel Carter</PERSON>, Phar Lap's principal 
biographer, researched the whole issue in depth and concluded that the horse 
had eaten "highly fermentable green pasture" that caused his stomach to swell 
and brought on a fatal attack of colic. 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious circumstances only added to the Phar Lap legend. 
</P>
<P>
"He came along in the Depression years and he was a symbol of hope and 
optimism," said <PERSON>Gary Gray</PERSON>, who conducted the <PERSON>Tommy Woodcock</PERSON> interview and has 
produced films on Australian racing history here. "He also told the world that 
we could produce horses to beat the best, and we could do a whole lot of other 
things too. We were not just a colony. Phar Lap was a symbol of our emergence 
as a nation."

<P>
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> and Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> reaffirmed 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> their countries' strong military links but differed on the 
contentious issue of trade. 
</P>
<P>
The two topics dominated 90-minute talks at the start of <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s five-day 
visit to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> on the first leg of an Asian tour. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, arriving here for his first visit to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region, was welcomed 
with a 19-gun salute on arrival in this country's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle gave <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> a letter from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> that was "warm and personal" but 
did not delve into hard issues, according to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official. Hawke is 
scheduled to visit the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>June</DATE>, and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>1982</DATE>, when he was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle described <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> -- the site of joint strategic satellite, shipping 
and communication monitoring posts -- as "a solid and steadfast ally," <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On the thorny issue of trade, <PERSON>Hawke</PERSON> argued for a swift end to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Export 
Enhancement Program, under which exporters receive a government bonus for 
increased sales. 
</P>
<P>
He said the program, adopted largely to combat <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> subsidies, 
was also affecting <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s penetration of world markets -- particularly in 
wheat sales -- because it cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two differed on the issue, Australian officials described the 
atmosphere as "very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered a threat this week by <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>David 
Lange</PERSON> to pull out of the ANZUS defense alliance linking his country with 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has effectively suspended <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> from the alliance since 
<DATE>1985</DATE>, after <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said both sides want <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> to remain in <LOCATION>ANZUS</LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> will not change its position of wanting its ships to visit <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> 
without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle continues his tour, his second trip overseas since taking office, with 
visits to <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> before leaving <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>. He will 
also visit <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON>Senator Gareth Evans</PERSON>, 
has called on <LOCATION>Asia Pacific</LOCATION> region countries to put pressure on 
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> to stop its nuclear weapons program. 
  Speaking at the ninth <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Senator Evans</PERSON> said the situation in <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> was 
worrying, but not at crisis point. He said a nuclear-armed 
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> would undermine confidence in the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security 
threat to the region. 
  [Begin <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> recording] For the <LOCATION>North Koreans</LOCATION>, the choice is 
really a pretty straightforward and simple one -- to remain in 
the <ORGANIZATION>NPT</ORGANIZATION> and accept the disciplines of the treaty, including full 
<ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION>] safeguards, or, 
alternatively, it can continue with its nuclear activities in 
violation of its treaty obligations and face not only almost 
universal international censure, but, in time, a package of 
severe and damaging sanctions. [end recording] 
  The five-day <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> conference will discuss the latest 
developments in nuclear technology and the region's demand for 
nuclear energy over the next 50 years.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> should halt all contacts with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
until it lifts martial law and acknowledges that the
anti-government demonstrations are patriotic and democratic, 60
legislators said in a statement <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The lawmakers from the governing <ORGANIZATION>Nationalist Party</ORGANIZATION> said, ``We
should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until
the Chinese Communists lift martial law and end any military
crackdown.''
   They said they will submit their statement to the Legislative
Yuan (parliament) for discussion <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and then relay it to the
Cabinet.
   Hu Chin-heng, a 35-year-old clerk at the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of
Communications</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, began what he said would be a three-day
hunger strike to protest ``Taiwanese indifference'' to
demonstrators in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> who are demanding democratic reforms.
   Students at some universities in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> have signed petitions
supporting the demonstrators in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, but there have been no large
rallies.
   People protesting the Chinese government actions rallied <DATE>Monday</DATE>
in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   About 150 Chinese students living in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> staged a peaceful
protest in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Hague</LOCATION>.
   Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> van den Broek advised Dutch
nationals not to travel to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> because of the unrest. His warning
followed the weekend cancellation of a planned state visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
by <PERSON>Queen Beatrix</PERSON> and her husband Prince Claus.
   Hundreds of Chinese students in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> held rallies in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
   About 300 demonstrators crowded into the courtyard of the
Chinese consulate in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. Some burned photographs of Chinese
Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON>.
   Police blocked the entrance to the consulate building. There was
no violence.
   A similar rally was held in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, where demonstrators
called for the removal of <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s senior leader, <PERSON>Deng
Xiaping</PERSON>, and the lifting of martial law.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> told Australians planning trips
to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> to wait until the situation becomes clear.
   The Taiwanese legislators said the Nationalist government should
offer to open direct trade and shipping links with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> if <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
cancels the crackdown and accepts the protests as patriotic and
democratic.
   The Nationalists fled to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE> when they lost the civil
war to the Communists. The island's government has refused to have
any direct contacts with the mainland authorities.
   But in the <DATE>past two years</DATE> it has followed a flexible policy that
allows Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade through
third countries.
   Legislator <PERSON>Huang Chu-wen</PERSON>, who initiated the statement to the
government, said a military crackdown could set back democracy in
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> by 20 years and ``we would miss a good opportunity to reunite
peacefully.''
   The Nationalists say <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, considered a Chinese
province by both the Nationalists and Communists, should be
reunited under a democratic system. Martial law was lifted in
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE> after it had been in force for 38 years.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>George Herscu</PERSON>, one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
richest men until his <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION> fell on hard times, was
convicted <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on corruption charges.
   The 62-year-old <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> native was found guilty of paying
<MONEY>$77,000</MONEY> in <DATE>1983</DATE> to a <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> state cabinet minister to try to
ease access restrictions to a failing shopping center.
   Herscu had pleaded not guilty to two charges of official
corruption. He claimed he made the two <MONEY>$28,500</MONEY> payments to <PERSON>Russ
Hinze</PERSON>, who at the time was a state minister for roads, to buy him
two racehorses.
   The now-bankrupt Herscu appeared unmoved as the <ORGANIZATION>Brisbane
District Court</ORGANIZATION> jury delivered its verdict at the end of a four-week
trial. Sentencing was scheduled for <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   A Romanian Jew, <ORGANIZATION>Herscu</ORGANIZATION> worked in <LOCATION>Nazi</LOCATION> labor camps during World
War II until being liberated by the Soviet <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1944</DATE>. He moved
to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1950</DATE>.
   As a 25-year-old in <DATE>1953</DATE>, Herscu bought one small grocery store
then others, including one at the <DATE>1956</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Melbourne Olympics</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1959</DATE>,
he went into property development.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Herscu</PERSON> took over <ORGANIZATION>Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s premier
property developer with substantial <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interests. He took out
loans and spent <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, in part on up-market American
retailers, including Bonwit Teller.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>L.J. Hooker Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has disposed of the bulk
of its retail holdings acquired since <DATE>1986</DATE>, including Bonwit Teller
and other department store chains.
   After being steered into shopping-center developments in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hooker</PERSON> grounded on a <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> debt in <DATE>July 1989</DATE>.
Both <PERSON>Hooker</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Herscu</ORGANIZATION>'s personal company, <ORGANIZATION>Hersfield Developments
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, went into liquidation.
   In <DATE>July</DATE>, <PERSON>Herscu</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Sheila</PERSON>, declared themselves
bankrupt. The move came two days before a bankruptcy claim made
against them was to be heard in a <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> court.
   Documents filed with the court showed <PERSON>Herscu</PERSON> had total debts of
more than <MONEY>$382 million</MONEY> and assets of only <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>.
   Once among the social elite of <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Herscu</PERSON> was forced to
move out of his Toorak mansion, an extravagant home that was based
on ``Tara'' from the movie ``Gone With The Wind.''

FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Australia's shrinking violets - Rugby League; Britain
and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in Sydney, and
John Hopkins assess the two sides

<TEXT>
TIMID Australian sportsmen are about as common as possums in <LOCATION>Pontypool</LOCATION>. So
why are <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> suddenly crowded with shrinking violets talking
down <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s chances in today's Rugby League World Cup final at <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION>?
Kangaroos coach <PERSON>Bob Fulton</PERSON> set the tone before leaving for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, warning
that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 2-1 victory in the Ashes series earlier this year was no
guide to form for the World Cup.
'Great <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> should be favourites. We haven't got much in our favour. If
we don't win at <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION>, our Ashes success won't mean the same. In football,
people have short memories,' Fulton moaned.
It doesn't seem to matter who you talk to. Kangaroos captain <PERSON>Mal Meninga</PERSON> and
experienced second rower <PERSON>Bob Lindner</PERSON> both warn that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> will have
their work cut out to beat <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>.
Back in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, some of the experts are going even further. 'If I had to
put up my money I'd back the Poms,' <DATE>1988</DATE> World Cup star <PERSON>Wayne Pearce</PERSON> told
fans in <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> yesterday.
More is at stake than just the World Cup. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have towered over
international rugby league since <DATE>1970</DATE>, the last time <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> won an
Ashes series. But they have never led the all-time league table.
This year's Ashes games left <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> with 52 wins each
since the first Test in <DATE>1908</DATE>. A Kangaroos victory would justify Australian
claims that <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> is now the centre of world rugby league.
So are the wily Australians serious, or are they trying to disarm the
despised Poms before sending out another team of fast-moving giants to take
the trophy back to <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, its home since <DATE>1975</DATE>?
Fulton is clearly concerned about the long lay-off enjoyed by the players
since the end of the domestic season in <DATE>September</DATE>. Easy tour matches against
mediocre opposition like <ORGANIZATION>Sheffield</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Huddersfield</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cumbria</LOCATION> will have done
little to restore match fitness.
And taking a break does affect performance: the world club championship,
played in the Australian off-season, has never been won by an Australian
side, in spite of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s dominance at international level.
Secondly, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s pre-eminence over the <DATE>last 22 years</DATE> has encouraged a
focus on the domestic game, prompting many Australians to rate the local
<ORGANIZATION>Winfield Cup</ORGANIZATION> competition ahead of international games. Some commentators
fear the Kangaroos may not be hungry enough to win.
But the real cause of Australian caution is recent results, which suggest
that playing standards in other countries may be catching up, perhaps
heralding the end of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s long period of dominance.
The first crack in the facade appeared in <DATE>1991</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> unexpectedly
lost 24-8. in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> in the first of a three match series against <LOCATION>New
Zealand</LOCATION>. More seriously, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> were thrashed 33-10 by <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> in
<DATE>June</DATE> in the second Ashes Test, again in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
For perhaps the first time two decades, the British made the Australians
look ordinary. Significantly, the match was played in the kind of soft
conditions the Australians are likely to face at <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> won the series after victories in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, but no-one
who saw the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> Test will forget the electrifying sight of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Offiah</ORGANIZATION>
twice getting away on the left wing, each time denied a try by the narrowest
touch of boot on sideline.
Offiah's chances of escaping today must be improved by the absence of the
the injured <PERSON>Andrew Ettingshausen</PERSON>, the top class full back who forced him
into touch on both occasions. But as successive British tourists have
discovered, the structure of the modern game in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> produces teams
which are very hard to beat. The <ORGANIZATION>Winfield Cup</ORGANIZATION> has expanded and strengthened
considerably since <DATE>1980</DATE>, and now includes teams from <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>
and provincial <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>.
The gradual enlargement of the competition has increased the pool of top
players and coaches available to the national side, and helped the game
maintain its dominance among <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s four football codes, at least in
the core rugby league states of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>.
Ominously for British fans, the strengthening process is likely to
accelerate in the next couple of years, when the competition will be
expanded to include <LOCATION>Auckland</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, adding all the emotions of
international football to the weekly league programme.
Like their British counterparts, Australian coaches put a lot of emphasis on
commitment, physical fitness and tough tackling. But the dry sun-baked
grounds also encourage speed and ball handling skills which are harder to
develop in the freezing dampness of English winters.
The Australians have benefitted over the last few years from the
inspirational captaincy of two outstanding players who epitomise all these
qualities: 'King' <PERSON>Wally Lewis</PERSON> from <DATE>1984</DATE> to <DATE>1990</DATE>, and latterly <PERSON>Meninga</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s most capped player and record scorer with 250 points.
Meninga's success in replacing the legendary <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> has played a big part in
keeping <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> at the top of the rugby league tree, but it places a huge
responsibility on him in the final.
If Meninga and <PERSON>Allan Langer</PERSON> fire on the <LOCATION>Wembley</LOCATION> turf <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s weasel
words over the last few days are likely to be quickly forgotten. If they do
not, all the advance excuses are unlikely to protect Fulton and his men from
a raucous reception back in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>.
