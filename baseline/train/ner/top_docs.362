  [Text] The Government of <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of 
the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, determined to promote bilateral bonds of 
friendship and cooperation between the two states based on the 
universally recognized principles of international law, have 
decided to resume diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level as 
of 2 <DATE>February</DATE>. The designation of ambassadors will be done 
through diplomatic channels. 
  The agreement was signed in <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> on 2 <DATE>February</DATE>, 
corresponding to the <DATE>second day of the second month</DATE> of the [word 
indistinct] year of the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. It was signed for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> by External Relations Minister 
<PERSON>Thomas Sanon</PERSON> and for the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> by 
acting Foreign Minister <PERSON>Chin-Yen Fang</PERSON>. 
  In line with the resumption of diplomatic relations between 
<LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Burkinabe Government</ORGANIZATION> has issued a 
statement, which is read here by <PERSON>Theodore Kilimite Hien</PERSON>, the 
communications minister and government spokesman: 
  [Hien] <DATE>Today</DATE>, 2 <DATE>February</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> and 
the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, have decided to resume 
their diplomatic relations which were suspended in <DATE>1973</DATE>. The 
resumption of relations with the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is based on 
the <ORGANIZATION>Burkinabe Government</ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to establish relations 
and bonds of cooperation with all countries of the world for 
mutual benefit. 
  At a time when African countries are confronted with 
terrible 
economic difficulties that are even threatening national unity, 
it is imperative for <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> to widen the circle of her 
friendship and to find partners in every part of the world, who 
are willing to support her development efforts in a continuous 
manner. By resuming normal relations with <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Burkinabe 
Government</ORGANIZATION> has obtained the assurance from the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 
that it will help our country on its path toward achieving 
progress through the following channels: Self-sufficiency in 
food production through a special agricultural development 
program, namely rice and soya bean production, the promotion of 
the informal sector, the reduction of unemployment, the 
revamping of youth employment schemes, the development and 
improvement of the health sector, and the building of a sports 
infrastructure, including the construction of a sports complex 
in <LOCATION>Bobo Dioulasso</LOCATION> and a sports stadium in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. This 
initial program will be pursued through a wider range of 
operations in the future. 
  In resuming relations with <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Burkinabe Government</ORGANIZATION> 
remains faithful to the fundamental option of its external 
policy, which is based on realistic views and adjustment to the 
changes that are now marking international society. It is in 
line with the same policy of loyalty that <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> hereby 
reaffirms its willingness to maintain, to pursue, and to 
consolidate its relations with the People's Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
  Signed in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> on 2 <DATE>February 1994</DATE>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>February 5</DATE> (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government has lodged a strong protest with the <ORGANIZATION>Government of 
Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> and declared the suspension of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s diplomatic 
relations with <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. 
  According to reports from <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Li Yongqian</PERSON>, Chinese 
ambassador to <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, made serious representations with 
the <ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> yesterday. He solemnly stated 
that as the <ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> had "restored" the 
so-called "diplomatic relations" with the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> authorities, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> lodged a strong protest with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> and declared the suspension of 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s diplomatic ties with <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Li pointed out that by doing so, the <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso Government</ORGANIZATION> 
had gone back on its solemn commitment contained in the 
communique of <DATE>September 15, 1973</DATE> on the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> that it 
recognized the Government of the People's Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as 
the sole legal government representing the entire Chinese 
people, seriously undermining the existing friendly relations 
and cooperation between the two countries and the friendship 
between the two peoples. 
  He announced that the Government of the People's Republic of 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> decided, therefore, to suspend its diplomatic relations 
with <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> as of that day.

<FÊP=106> [By <PERSON>David Wang</PERSON> And <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION> Wu] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 2</DATE> (CNA) -- The Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> [ROC] 
will send agricultural experts to <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> to help the west 
African country develop its agriculture and economy, Foreign 
Affairs Minister <PERSON>Chien Fu</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [2 <DATE>February</DATE>]. 
  Chien, who is currently on a speaking tour here, made the 
statement shortly after the <ORGANIZATION>ROC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> issued a joint 
communique in <LOCATION>Taipei</LOCATION> on the resumption of full diplomatic 
relations. 
  The ROC first established diplomatic ties with <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, 
then known as <LOCATION>Upper Volta</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1961</DATE>, but suspended such ties in 
<DATE>1973</DATE> after the African nation recognized <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 
  Chien said the <ORGANIZATION>ROC</ORGANIZATION> stationed an agricultural mission in 
<LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960</DATE>. "Many Burkina Faso people still 
remembered the achievements of our agricultural mission in 
helping raise their rice production," he noted. 
  The ROC and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> began discussion of resuming 
diplomatic ties two years ago. The Burkina Faso cabinet 
formally agreed to resume ties with the ROC in <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Chien</PERSON> 
said. 
  With an area of 274,000 square kilometers and a population 
of 
9.5 million, <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> became an independent nation in <DATE>1960</DATE> 
after decades of French colonial rule. It is rich in mineral 
resources and produces large quantities of cotton and livestock. 
Its political situation is stable, <PERSON>Chien</PERSON> said. 
  Moreover, <PERSON>Chien</PERSON> added, <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> has great influence on 
other west African nations. "The resumption of diplomatic ties 
with <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> will facilitate our effort to promote 
exchanges with that part of the world," he noted. 
  The ROC now maintains full diplomatic ties with eight 
African 
nations -- <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Guinea-Bissau</LOCATION>, the Central African Republic and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. 
  It has opened a consulate general in <LOCATION>Calabar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> and 
set 
up representative offices in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> 
bearing the <ORGANIZATION>ROC</ORGANIZATION>'s full national title.

ministers, <LOCATION>Chad</LOCATION> requested that the Islamic Republic of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 
assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation 
among countries of the South. This request is vitally important 
to <LOCATION>Chad</LOCATION>, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield 
in southern <LOCATION>Chad</LOCATION>. 
  In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on 
economic, political, and cultural cooperation between <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Conakry</LOCATION>, including discussions on cooperation in the 
exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of 
hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways. 
  In <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> our foreign minister and his delegation met 
with the prime minister and discussed political and economic 
relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the 
initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic 
and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a 
joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic 
cooperation between <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. To acquaint the 
government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high 
economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition 
including products and industries of Islamic <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> be set up in 
<LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. 
  Iran's diplomatic activities in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> are of interest to 
political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first 
is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of 
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> strengthens the position of Muslims in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, especially 
in <LOCATION>Black Africa</LOCATION>. The second is that this activity is 
significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis 
the array of forces by the North against the South. The third 
is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and 
political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with 
experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial 
experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an 
important objective in our country's diplomatic policy. 
  At any rate, <ORGANIZATION>Tehran</ORGANIZATION>'s new look toward <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> has attracted 
the attention of many political experts.

  [Text] The president of Burkina Faso whom our reporter met 
this morning sounded reassuring. <PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON>, who traced 
the background of the <LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION> meeting which led to the devaluation 
of the <ORGANIZATION>CFA</ORGANIZATION> franc, commented on the consequences of this measure 
on <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. Here is President <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON>, speaking to Rock 
<PERSON>Patrice Ouedraogo</PERSON>. 
  [Begin recording] It is true that generally speaking the 
devaluation will affect our debt. We will certainly have a 
bigger debt to pay. It will affect household spending, 
particularly certain goods which are consumed domestically but 
which used to be imported and, surely, there will be the problem 
of revamping the economy. But, generally speaking, with a 
number of backup measures geared toward reducing debt, 
preserving the industrial atmosphere, protecting the consumption 
of essential commodities, and also with the support of the 
international community in financing our investments and 
programs and in some employment generating sectors, we believe 
all this will restore a measure of credibility to our country. 
This will particularly guarantee a higher national production 
and put us in better position to export our products by, 
naturally, boosting agricultural output. And, of course, there 
will definitely be increased external investments. Domestic 
savings was also one area identified as one that should offer 
more support to our economies. In short, therefore, with all 
these measures, coupled with a system of safeguarding what I 
earlier referred to as the industrial atmosphere, we hope that 
our economies will be put in a better position to face 
international competition and sustain the welfare of our people.

  [Text] <PERSON>Burkina Faso</PERSON>, a member country of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Afrique 
Company</ORGANIZATION>, is following with interest the evolution of this 
multinational company. Yves <PERSON>Rolland Billecart</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Air Afrique</ORGANIZATION>'s 
managing director, is here in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> to hold discussions 
with Burkinabe authorities concerning the necessary change in 
this indispensable tool for air transportation. 
  After arresting the company's financial loss a few years 
ago, 
and after making important investments, such as the purchase of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> which increased the transportation capacity of the 
company -- after this stage of spectacular rehabilitation -- <ORGANIZATION>Air 
Afrique</ORGANIZATION> is faced with new difficulties which demand increased 
support from its member countries. This will be the topic of 
the heads of state meeting which opens on 10 <DATE>January</DATE> in <LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION>. 
After his audience with Prime Minister <PERSON>Youssouf Ouedraogo</PERSON> <TIME>this 
morning</TIME>, <PERSON>Yves Rolland Billecart</PERSON> talked to <PERSON>Gerard Sawadogo 
Koudaogo</PERSON> this. 
  [Begin recording] [<LOCATION>Billecart</LOCATION>] This visit to <PERSON>Burkina Faso</PERSON> is 
meant to examine problems specific to <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. We have 
noted with satisfaction that the exportation of agricultural 
products is going on well this year, thanks to greater 
discipline shown by exporters. It is also due to their 
commitments that <ORGANIZATION>Air Afrique</ORGANIZATION> has been able to meet the 
corresponding challenges. These were the major topics of my 
discussions with the prime minister. Earlier, I held a working 
session with the minister of transport, then with the minister 
of employment and labor, and with the minister of culture, whose 
many activities demand traveling, as well as with the minister 
of tourism. So, as you can see, the purpose of my visit was to 
discuss the general problems of the company for the <LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION> 
conference as well as to discuss (?traveling issues). 
  [Koudaogo] Let us then talk with <PERSON>Rolland Billecart</PERSON> about all 
these problems facing <ORGANIZATION>Air Afrique</ORGANIZATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Billecart] Air Afrique</ORGANIZATION> is suffering from insufficient 
funds. 
When I took over the management of the company, there was no 
more capital because it was less than <MONEY>15 billion CFA francs</MONEY>. 
Thanks to efforts made by <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> as well as our results for 
first four years, we were able to build up capital, which was 
good, but still insufficient. Presently, we have capital 
totaling <MONEY>15 billion CFA francs</MONEY>, but we have a long-term debt of 
80 billion, which came purchasing aircrafts and modernizing our 
installations. Therefore, we need to balance the funds. We had 
drawn up a program which consisted of an assistance from the 
<ORGANIZATION>African Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> [ADB]. Unfortunately, the <ORGANIZATION>ADB</ORGANIZATION> board of 
governors did not accept the suggestion of its president and we 
ended up suggesting a new plan which I negotiated with the 
<ORGANIZATION>French Government</ORGANIZATION>. And it is this program which will be 
examined in <LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION>. If, as I expect, this program is accepted, 
<ORGANIZATION>Air Afrique</ORGANIZATION> might be able to arrange [words indistinct] as far 
its capital or a permanent fund is concerned, and have a more 
balanced financial structure. Contrary to what was said, we 
have not envisaged a restructuring of the company. It was 
restructured in <DATE>1989</DATE>. As you know, this resulted in the 
retrenchment of workers and this time, there is no question of 
retrenching workers. [end recording]

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>February 5</DATE> (XINHUA) -- A <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Foreign 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said here today that the setback in 
<LOCATION>Sino-Burkina Faso</LOCATION> relations is not what the Chinese side wishes 
to see, and the responsibility for it rests entirely with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. 
  On <DATE>February 2</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, in disregard 
of the long-standing friendly relations and cooperation between 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, announced the so-called "restoration" of

that the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> has lodged a strong protest with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Government of Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> and announced the suspension of 
diplomatic relations with <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> and cessation of 
implementation of all agreements between the two governments. 
  In recent years, the spokesman pointed out, the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> 
authorities, taking advantage of the temporary economic 
difficulties of some countries, have gone out of their way to 
pursue "money diplomacy" in an attempt to create "two Chinas" or 
"one <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, one <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>". 
  This indecent trick, he noted, goes entirely against the 
fundamental interest of the Chinese nation and is bound to meet 
the opposition of the people on both sides of the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> straits. 
  "The scheme of the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> authorities is doomed to failure," 
he said.

  [Text] The highlight of <TIME>this morning</TIME> is the resumption of 
the consultations between the government and the labor unions. 
The meeting was convened to present the government's responses 
to workers' demands contained in the memorandum submitted to the 
prime minister by the labor unions on 1 <DATE>May</DATE>. Here is Braimah 
Ouedraogo with a report. 
  [<PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON>] A pay rise is out of the question. According to 
the explanations of the budget minister, an increase of 40 to <PERCENT>50 
percent</PERCENT> will result in a budget deficit of 93 billion and 97 
billion respectively. Therefore, there are no funds to finance 
such a pay rise. Fuel prices cannot also be reduced since they 
are no longer standardized. 
  The commerce, industry, and mines minister, who was present, 
talked about the establishment of a market street which would 
enable small traders to obtain cheap stalls. He also talked 
about the <ORGANIZATION>National Grains Office</ORGANIZATION> [OFNACER] and the Faso <PERSON>Yaar</PERSON> 
[state-owned marketing organization]. OFNACER has already been 
liquidated and the minister assured consumers in high-risk areas 
that cereal shortages could be covered by SONAGES [expansion 
unknown]. However, the Faso <PERSON>Yaar</PERSON> could not be rehabilitated 
despite the unions' demands. This is a sector that the state 
has transferred to the private sector in order to make it more 
efficient. The state is reported to have lost more than <MONEY>6 
billion CFA francs</MONEY> in organizations such the Faso <PERSON>Yaar</PERSON>. 
  Finally, concerning pharmaceuticals, the health minister 
outlined a number of measures taken to protect people's pockets. 
These include negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>French Pharmaceutical 
Producers Union</ORGANIZATION> for the latter to reduce wholesale prices. With 
the <MONEY>2 billion</MONEY> granted by <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> as post-devaluation subsidy for 
pharmaceutical imports, there are plans for price cuts of 20 to 
<PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> in the next few days. The health minister promised 
to reduce the number of pharmaceutical importers, which should 
lead to a considerable reduction in retail prices for the people.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 15</DATE> (AFP) -- Authorities in <LOCATION>Burkina 
Faso</LOCATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [15 <DATE>June</DATE>] that an attack by "Tuareg rebels" 
had been carried out on its territory, the first time such an 
incident has been officially acknowledged. 
  Interior Ministry Secretary General <PERSON>Pascal Benon</PERSON> said the 
group, probably from <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, opened fire on a coachload of 
passengers on <DATE>June 9</DATE> near <LOCATION>Djibo</LOCATION>, 190 kilometres (120 miles) 
north of <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> and injured three of them. The group also 
intercepted an official car, <PERSON>Benon</PERSON> said. 
  Several other clashes have been reported since <DATE>last 
December</DATE>. 
  The Tuareg rebellion has been raging in neighbouring <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION> 
and 
<LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> since the early <DATE>1990s</DATE>, leading some 7,000 people to seek 
refuge in <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION>. 
  Military reinforcements were sent to the area at the start 
of 
the week. <PERSON>Benon</PERSON> said the situation was "very tense" and 
stressed that there was a danger local people might decide to 
"settle their scores with the Tuaregs for themselves." 
  The refugees have gradually been relocated in a camp run by 
the <ORGANIZATION>UN High Commissioner</ORGANIZATION> for Refugees at the village of Ferrelio 
to the north of Djibo. 
  The authorities in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> want the <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION> to move the 
camp away from the border. However, the <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION> wants <PERSON>Burkina 
Faso</PERSON>, one of the poorest countries in the world, to pay the 
costs, estimated at <MONEY>184 million CFA Francs</MONEY> (330,000 dollars). 
  The country's 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) frontier with <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION> 
and the 500-kilometre (300-mile) one with <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> are considered 
practically uncontrollable by the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION>.

   The government said <DATE>Monday</DATE> it
foiled an attempted coup against the 2-year-old government of
President <PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON>, but denied reports that it executed
seven of those arrested.
   Justice Minister <PERSON>Antoine Komi Sambo</PERSON> told a news conference
``foreign mercenaries'' were among those arrested, but he refused

   He said those arrested would be brought before the courts of
this landlocked West African former French colony, once known as
<ORGANIZATION>Upper Volta</ORGANIZATION>.
   Burkina Faso, with a population of more than 8.5 million, gained
independence in <DATE>1960</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Burkinabe League of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION> issued a
statement protesting the arrests and what it called repression by
the country's ``military dictatorship.''
   ``As of <DATE>Dec. 25</DATE>, more than 50 people have been arrested, and
their number is likely to double in the days to come, according to
disquieting information coming from <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION>,'' it said.
   Earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the French news agency Agence France-Presse
quoted what it called well-informed sources in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> as
saying seven people were executed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>,
and about 30 others, mostly soldiers, were arrested.
   Compaore took power <DATE>Oct. 15, 1987</DATE>, in a military coup that left
President <PERSON>Thomas Sankara</PERSON> among those slain. Officials reported
another aborted coup last <DATE>September</DATE> and said four alleged plotters
were executed summarily, including the men who were No. 2 and No. 3
in <LOCATION>Compaore</LOCATION>'s government.
   The justice minister did not disclose on <DATE>Monday</DATE> when any of the
latest events took place, nor did he disclose any details of the
coup attempt.
   The <ORGANIZATION>League of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based group of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>
exiles, said it had no further specifics on the attempt.

  [Excerpt] Negotiations among Nigerois resumed this 
afternoon in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. The Coordination of Armed Resistance 
-- which includes all the Tuareg movements -- and a <ORGANIZATION>Niger 
Government</ORGANIZATION> delegation were received in turn by President 
<PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> in the <TIME>early evening</TIME>. The first group to arrive in the 
country was the eight-member Tuareg delegation and were the 
first to be received by President <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON>. The half-hour 
audience granted to each group enabled them to remove the final 
obstacles and pave the way for the beginning of a new round of 
talks at the same table scheduled for 15 <DATE>February</DATE>. There was 
much optimism at the end of the meeting. The <ORGANIZATION>Niger Government</ORGANIZATION>'s 
position was put forward by the <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> foreign minister. 
Abdourahamane Hama, who is leading the government delegation, is 
interviewed by <PERSON>Yannick-Laurent Bayala</PERSON>. He thinks that 
everything is ready for the resumption of talks with the Tuareg 
rebels. 
  [Begin recording] [Hama] This is indeed a great moment for 
Nigerois. We finally have this opportunity here in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> 
to discuss a problem which is very vital to our country's future. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] Can the meeting effectively begin on 15 <DATE>February</DATE>? 
  [Hama] We think that as far as the <ORGANIZATION>Niger Government</ORGANIZATION> is 
concerned there is no reason why the meeting should not begin. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] How can you be sure of that? 
  [Hama] I think that for now, we will not discuss the problem 
in detail for now. Negotiations need to be prepared. The fact 
that we will be meeting to see how we will proceed in the coming 
months and weeks to solve the problem is already a big step. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Niger Government</ORGANIZATION> is prepared to find a solution to the 
problem; President <PERSON>Mahamane Ousmane</PERSON> said so when he took office 
and he reiterated that at the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>. I think the fact 
that such an important government delegation, including at least 
five or six ministers, and high-ranking members of <ORGANIZATION>Air</ORGANIZATION> and 
Azaouak are here in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> is an important sign of our 
goodwill. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] President <PERSON>Mahamane</PERSON> has met Tuareg traditional 
rulers. Does it mean that the different sides have finally got 
to the point where they have set aside their differences in 
spite of the recent violence? Several people have recently 
died from that. 
  [Hama] I think that contacts and dialogue between the two 
sides were never broken off. Today, we are simply formalizing 
that dialogue to solve the problem in concrete terms. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] The Tuareg delegation leader, <PERSON>Mano Dayak</PERSON>, speaks of 
the magnitude of the problem and reaffirms his delegation's 
willingness to find a negotiated solution. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Dayak</ORGANIZATION>] Our problem is a regional problem and it should be 
seen in that light. We are pleased about efforts being made by 
<ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> to find a solution to the problem as soon as 
possible. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] <PERSON>Mr. Mano Dayak</PERSON>, several opportunities have been 
missed. Will this one be grasped? 
  [Dayak] There have certainly been several missed 
opportunities in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> indeed but that was not the 
resistance's fault: We were the ones who suggested that the 
first meeting should be held in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. There were 
definitely problems which have made it impossible for us to meet 
here up until now. We are here now and that is the main thing. 
We can now say that things are really going to get under way. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] There has been fresh violence lately in <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> and 
the government has blamed it on the Tuareg resistance. Do you 
deny responsibility? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Dayak</ORGANIZATION>] The truce ended at the beginning of <DATE>June</DATE>. We are, 
therefore, unfortunately in a war situation. We are sorry about 
that, but we hope that there will be a solution and we are ready 
for that. I think if there is a conflict or if tension resumes 
in the subregion, no one can be blamed or criticized for that. 
We would like to put an end to that situation. We are calling 
on the <ORGANIZATION>Niger Government</ORGANIZATION> to embark on frank and sincere dialogue 
as soon as possible to end these kinds of actions. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] <PERSON>Mano Dayak</PERSON>, people are very much in favor of 
Algerian and French representatives taking part in the 
<LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> negotiations. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Dayak</ORGANIZATION>] The Algerian Government has always been involved in 
various negotiations and discussions. <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> is part of the 
subregion and wants to find a solution to the problem. Right 
from the beginning it has endeavored -- just as <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> is 
doing now -- to find a solution. It will be involved in ongoing 
negotiations as one of the observer countries. 
  [<LOCATION>Bayala</LOCATION>] Just like <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Dayak</ORGANIZATION>] Yes, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> will be present at the negotiation as a 
mediator. We did not come to <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> for the negotiations 
proper. That will take some time. It is a technical meeting to 
determine which countries will be mediating, what the future 
political negotiations will be, and where they will be held. 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> will be certainly involved in the 
negotiations. The coordination's demands will be contained in a 
document which we will publish in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. This is very 
important for us because our problem is an African one. We 
would therefore like to find a solution within and African 
context and <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> is an ideal place for that. We will be 
demanding a minimum of rights for our people who have always 
been marginalized in <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>. They should now be entitled to the 
same rights as other <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> communities. That is what we are 
calling for now, otherwise there will unfortunately be no peace. 
We are calling for regional autonomy for the whole community 
politically and economically. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<HEAD>Four Coup Plotters Executed in Burkina Faso</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four men were executed after security
agents uncovered at the last minute a plot to overthrow President
<PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso News Agency</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Two of the four were in the top echelon of the government, it
reported.
   The agency said agents thwarted the plotters' attempt to arrest
<PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> upon his return from a trip to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> late <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Reached by telex from <LOCATION>Abidjan</LOCATION>, the agency quoted government
spokesman <PERSON>Clement Ouedraogo</PERSON> as saying the coup leaders planned to
seize the airport and if they met resistance, to shoot down
<PERSON>Compaore</PERSON>'s plane when it approached.
   Ouedraogo spoke at a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>,
capital of the impoverished Sahelian nation. The agency said <PERSON>Burkina
Faso</PERSON> was calm, and that no fighting has taken place.
   <PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON> said Maj. <PERSON>Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani</PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON>Henri
Zongo</PERSON>, effectively the No. 2 and No. 3 men in <LOCATION>Compaore</LOCATION>'s Popular
Front military government, were executed along with two other
military plotters, not identified.
   The agency quoted <PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON> as saying Capt. <PERSON>Gilbert Diendere</PERSON>, in
charge of presidential security, discovered the scheme just before
<PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> returned.
   The executions mark the final breakup of a clique of young
officers who came to power with Capt. <PERSON>Thomas Sankara</PERSON> in <DATE>Aug. 4,
1983</DATE>. Zongo and <PERSON>Lingani</PERSON>, like <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> close friends of <LOCATION>Sankara</LOCATION>,
supported <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> in his overthrow and killing of <LOCATION>Sankara</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct.
15, 1987</DATE>.
   First word of the coup attempt came in a communique read on the
government-controlled radio. It said, ``Our people and revolution,
and its militants at all levels, have just escaped, on the <TIME>night</TIME> of
<DATE>Sept. 18, 1989</DATE>, a cowardly plot fomented by military and fascist
elements led by some ambitious and anti-revolutionary people who are
at the very top of the political leadership.''
   It specifically named <PERSON>Lingani</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zongo</PERSON> and said their objectives
``were to dissolve the Popular Front and all the political
organizations and to restore fascist authority.''
   Burkina Faso, victim of recurring droughts in the <DATE>past two
decades</DATE>, has experienced six military coups since independence from
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>. It is listed by the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> as one of the world's
poorest nations with personal income averaging <MONEY>$190</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The West African nation has a population of about 6 million and
covers 105,870 square miles. More than <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> Burkinabe have left
their country to seek work in <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION>.

  [Text] Head of Government <PERSON>Roch Marc Christian Kabore</PERSON> on 9 
<DATE>April</DATE> publicly announced the counter proposals made by the labor 
unions in response to the government's 5 <DATE>April</DATE> proposals. The 
issue that has set a lot of tongues wagging is certainly that of 
salary increase, heightened by rumors of a hypothetical 
15-percent increase said to have been authorized by the <ORGANIZATION>World 
Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>. This has once again sparked off the debate 
over whether or not to believe the government, which has been 
telling the whole world that budgetary constraints resulting 
from the structural adjustment program do not enable it to 
significantly increase salaries. Prime Minister <PERSON>Kabore</PERSON> refutes 
these rumors and also gives some facts on the sales tax the 
government is levying on fuel. 
  [Begin Kabore recording] We have been hearing here and there 
that the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> have authorized the government 
to increase salaries by <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> and that it is refusing to do 
so, in the hope that by bullying workers it could get them to 
accept its proposals. I would like to dispel any doubts on the 
matter, which I believe was reported by JEUNE AFRIQUE news 
magazine which I would say is not a negotiator between these 
institutions and our country. I would also like to reaffirm 
that at no time was <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> authorized, under the current 
program, to effect a 15-percent salary increase. It is 
therefore important for us to dispel such doubts since the 
rumors being circulated could cause some confusion among workers 
and Burkinabe in general. We need to remove all such doubts on 
the matter. 
  The other problem is that when people look at the price 
structure they accuse the government of levying too many taxes, 
especially in regard to fuel and a certain number of items. I 
would simply like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that 
the basic revenue -- the 6 billion we have been talking about -- 
constitutes earnings generated from taxes levied on various 
products. Thus, logically speaking, if we (?invest) 126 
billion, in light of the taxes we are collecting today, it is 
obvious that if we reduce the value of these taxes, we would 
actually be reducing the state's revenue and it would therefore 
be unreasonable to demand salary increases. [end recording]

  [Text] A press statement was issued today in <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Bamako</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Niamey</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, following the visit of 
Presidents <PERSON>Blaise Campaore</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Alpha Oumar Konare</PERSON> 
of <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mahamane Ousmane</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Great Jamahiriyah</LOCATION>. 
Here follows the text of the statement: 
  In the framework of the fraternal relations linking the 
Great 
Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah [RSPLJ] with <PERSON>Burkina 
Faso</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Niger</ORGANIZATION>, and the Republic of <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, and 
proceeding from the principles and objectives of the <ORGANIZATION>OAU</ORGANIZATION>, and in 
eagerness to strengthen the relations of brotherhood and good 
neighborliness between their countries, Presidents <PERSON>Blaise 
Campaore</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mahamane Ousmane</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha 
Oumar Konare of Mali</ORGANIZATION> paid a business and fraternal visit to the 
<DATE>RSPLJ from 15 to 18 June</DATE>. 
  Brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great 
al-Fatih revolution, had metings with the guest presidents, and 
intensive talks were held between them on relations between 
their countries in the political and economic spheress, and on 
regional, African, and international issues of common interest. 
The leaders expressed satisfaction at the tangible development 
of relations and cooperation between them, and they stressed the 
importance of relations between their countries in the 
political, economic, and security-related domains, and the 
founding of the appropriate organs toward this end. 
  The leaders expressed their great concern over the situation 
in <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION>. They condemn the massacres being repeatedly 
perpetrated against civilians in <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION>. In this respect, they 
stressed the importance of an immediate cease-fire between the 
parties to the conflict, and the need to find a radical solution 
that would bring security and stability to <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION>. 
  With the aim of bolstering collective relations between 
their 
states, the leaders underscored the importance of activating the 
group of states bordering the <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION>, and of promoting 
cooperation between them in order to secure stability and 
security, and to resolve the problems in the region, which would 
become an element toward a linkage and not separation between 
the north and south of the <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION>, and in order to secure 
collective cooperation between them in harmony with the 
historic, social, and cultural ties between their peoples. 
  The leaders reviewed the efforts being made to carry out the 
national charter in the Republic of <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, and the talks underway 
in order to put an end to the armed rebellion in northern <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>. 
They stressed the importance of finding a final solution to 
these questions out of their commitment to preserving security 
throughout the region. Therefore, the leaders agreed that a 
meeting be held by the foreign ministers of the concerned states 
in the <LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION> in order to prepare for the convening of 
a summit in the RSPLJ. Toward this end, the foreign ministers 
have been assigned the task of intensifying contacts and 
meetings and exchanging information. 
  The leaders also reiterated their solidarity and that of 
their peoples with the people of the RSPLJ in facing up to the 
measures imposed on the Arab Libyan people. They expressed 
their support for the Arab, African, and international efforts 
being made in order to find a just, honest, and rapid solution 
so as to put an end to these measures, which affect all the 
peoples of the region. 
  At the conclusion of the visit, the presidents expressed 
their thanks and gratitude to brother leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution, and 
the Arab Libyan people, for the warm welcome and hospitality 
offered to them. 
  Signed in <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION> on 9 <LOCATION>Muharram</LOCATION>, corresponding to 18 <DATE>June 
1994</DATE>.

FT  22 APR 94 / Pledge over female mutilation: World Bank and IMF win
commitment by Burkina Faso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In an unusual broadening of their role into social and cultural issues, the
<ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> have won a commitment from the
government of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> to take steps to combat female genital
mutilation.
The commitment is included in <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION>'s policy framework paper, a set
of medium-term economic policy priorities negotiated with the international
financial institutions as the basis for receiving assistance loans.
The practice of female genital mutilation, sometimes referred to as female
circumcision, is widespread in many countries of <LOCATION>sub-Saharan Africa</LOCATION>. Besides
ritually reinforcing the subordination of women, the mutilation brings
severe risks of infection and starkly increases health risks in later life.
World Health Organisation officials estimate that genital mutilation doubles
the risk of death at childbirth and increases the risk of still-birth by
three or four times.
Besides the WHO, donor countries such as the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> have sought to
discourage the practice. The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> last
month agreed to a special investigation into violence against women, but
referred only obliquely to genital mutilation as 'the harmful effects of
certain traditional or cultural practices.'
Burkina Faso is in the middle of a radical economic adjustment programme
begun in <DATE>1991</DATE> but intensified this year by the 50 per cent devaluation of
the <ORGANIZATION>CFA</ORGANIZATION> franc agreed by members of the currency zone in <DATE>January</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> last month agreed to lend the Burkina Faso government Dollars 25m
(Pounds 17m) from its enhanced structural adjustment facility, which
provides subsidised loans for very poor countries.
The adjustment programme contains a number of measures designed to alleviate
the impact of the devaluation on some of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>'s most vulnerable
population groups. They included steps to spread price increases for
essential consumer goods such as kerosene and generic drugs over a six- to
12-month period, and an expansion of primary health and basic education
services.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, 17 <DATE>March</DATE> (PANA) -- The resignation of 
the Burkinabe prime minister, <PERSON>Youssouf Ouedraogo</PERSON>, was caused by 
the failure of negotiations with workers following the 
devaluation of the <ORGANIZATION>CFA</ORGANIZATION> franc in <DATE>January</DATE>, observers said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 
[17 March] in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>. They point out that even if he was 
supported by President <PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON>, he was not able to meet 
the demands of the trade unions. 
  The workers were demanding better living conditions, a 
substantial salary increase and maintaining prices at a 
reasonable level. In spite of the signing on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> of a 
joint communique between the government and the unions which 
increased salaries, the trade unions are still threatening to 
strike because they consider the salary increases insufficient. 
Some of the trade union leaders who signed the accord later 
rejected it saying that concessions made by the government were 
not enough. 
  <PERSON>Youssouf Ouedraogo</PERSON>, who resigned on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, is 
portrayed in his country as a brilliant technocrat, with a solid 
academic, administrative and political experience in <LOCATION>Burkina 
Faso</LOCATION>. Nominated prime minister on 16 <DATE>June 1992</DATE>, <PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON>, an 
economist, has been a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Sciences 
Institute of the University of Ouagadougou</ORGANIZATION>. A member of the 
People's Assembly (ADP- <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>) since the last general 
elections of <DATE>1992</DATE>, <PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON> was planning and popular 
development minister (<DATE>September 1984-August 1987</DATE>), cooperation 
and planning minister (<DATE>November 1987-April 1989</DATE>) and president 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Economic and Social Council</ORGANIZATION> (<DATE>April 1989-May 1992</DATE>). 
  During the general convention of the <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for 
Popular 
Democracy Labour Movement</ORGANIZATION> (ODP/MT), which has majority in 
<LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> with 79 seats <PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON> who was not an active 
political leader, was elected senior vice president of the 
party, on 19 <DATE>April 1993</DATE>. His nomination as prime minister 
raised many controversies in the ODP/MT. He reshuffled his 
government two times during his two year term. The first was on 
3 <DATE>September 1993</DATE> and the second on 19 <DATE>January 1994</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON> of Burkina
Faso outlined his government's new program <DATE>Friday</DATE> and made it clear
that he will give business and foreign interests a warmer welcome
than his predecessor did.
   In a radio broadcast monitored in <LOCATION>Abidjan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> said that
with <PERSON>Burkina Faso</PERSON>'s ``limited resources, the state alone cannot
pretend to do anything.''
   Compaore led the <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> coup in which President <PERSON>Thomas Sankara</PERSON>
was killed. It was the fifth coup in the poor West African nation
of 7.5 million since <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> _ formerly Upper Volta _ won
independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>. Both men were army captains and
<PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> was a close aide of <ORGANIZATION>Sankara's</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sankara had antagonized business people and Western governments
and creditors with his policies and statements attacking Western
imperialism.
   <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> his government will work with national,
foreign and private sectors, an apparent reference to his efforts
to improve government relations with national trade unions,
commercial interests and foreign neigbors.
   The new program, published later <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the official daily
Sidwaya newspaper, pledged to continue some economic reforms begun
under <PERSON>Sankara</PERSON>.
   The program called for a ``reinforcement of industrial
production and the rehabilitation of factories that are underused
or currently dormant.''
   The plan pledged to ``enlarge and reinforce democracy.'' Its
most striking change was abolition of <ORGANIZATION>Sankara</ORGANIZATION>'s feared
<ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Defense Committees</ORGANIZATION> in favor of smaller organizations
with a social and cultural focus. The organizations would be
separate groups of rural peasants, blue collar workers, youth,
civil servants, women and the elderly.
   Compaore avoided offending elements sympathetic to <PERSON>Sankara</PERSON>.
Without directly naming <PERSON>Sankara</PERSON>, he noted his speech borrowed ideas
from the political program <PERSON>Sankara</PERSON> laid out in a <DATE>1983</DATE> speech made
shortly after taking power.
   Compaore's foreign relations program was more moderate than the

   Compaore also pledged to continue the government crackdown on
corruption and laziness begun when <PERSON>Sankara</PERSON> took power in <DATE>1983</DATE>.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every <DATE>Friday</DATE> at dawn, a crowd gathers outside a dilapidated palace here in 
<LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION>'s capital to attend a ritual faithfully repeated for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony involves traditional chiefs bearing the title of "Ministers," a 
lavishly-bedecked stallion and a mighty monarch called the <PERSON>Mogho Naba</PERSON>, or 
emperor of the Mossi tribe. 
</P>
<P>
His great influence over local chieftains has survived French colonial rule and 
even the revolution initiated since <DATE>1983</DATE> by left-wing soldiers in this West 
African state. 
</P>
<P>
The Mossi, <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>'s majority tribe, built one of the oldest and most 
prestigious kingdoms of <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION>, dating back to the <ORGANIZATION>12th Century</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The ritual derives from an old legend that each week the emperor asks for a 
horse to be prepared to fetch his favorite wife who has gone up-country to 
visit her father. 
</P>
<P>
The brief ceremony, which allows a rare sight of the <ORGANIZATION>Mogho Naba</ORGANIZATION>, flanked by 
pages and young girls, ends when the saddled horse is taken back inside the 
walled compound, banned to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Nobles wearing richly embroidered caps, court drummers and minstrels seated in 
the dust at a respectful distance from the scarlet-robed <PERSON>Mogho Naba</PERSON> burst into 
applause when two shots are fired from a musket. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor, revered as "the Rising Sun" by the Mossi people, is assisted by a 
court made up of <PERSON>Naba</PERSON> (chiefs, in the More language). They include the <PERSON>Gouaga 
Naba</PERSON>, head of the imperial infantry, and the <PERSON>Kamsogho Naba</PERSON>, the chief eunuch in 
charge of the harem. 
</P>
<P>
So-called ministers in flowing robes -- traders, dentists or teachers in 
private life -- arrive at the <DATE>Friday</DATE> ceremony in battered cars, on mopeds or 
even bicycles to pay allegiance to the <PERSON>Mogho Naba</PERSON>, a burly man in his early 30s 
and the 37th emperor of the Mossi. 
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a semi-god by his people, he cannot be addressed directly and 
speaks through the <PERSON>Widi Naba</PERSON> (literally the commander of the imperial cavalry) 
and his de facto prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Mossi warriors fought French army columns with spears and poisoned arrows until 
the then-Mogho <PERSON>Naba</PERSON> fled into exile into neighboring <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION> in <DATE>1897</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But his successors retained considerable influence over peasants, who make up 
<PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the chieftaincy and the government of independent <ORGANIZATION>Burkina 
Faso</ORGANIZATION>, formerly <LOCATION>Upper Volta</LOCATION>, deteriorated sharply after radical president <PERSON>Thomas 
Sankara</PERSON> came to power in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to break the powers of elders and chiefs, regarded by him as feudal 
lords keeping the peasants in slavery. He antagonized them by giving extensive 
power to grass-roots militia. 
</P>
<P>
The government also stopped paying part of the <PERSON>Mogho Naba</PERSON>'s expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Sankara was slain in <DATE>October, 1987</DATE>, by fellow officers. "The late president 
humiliated the <PERSON>Mogho Naba</PERSON> and local chiefs by denying them all consideration. 
Today, his successors are trying with some success to win back their hearts," 
an Ouagadougou-based diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Sankara</PERSON> waged an unnecessary battle against the traditional chiefs. One cannot 
make a revolution against them in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>," President <PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON> 
acknowledged in a recent interview.

  [Text] The preparations for negotiations are currently in 
place at <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, where delegations of the <ORGANIZATION>Niger Government</ORGANIZATION> 
and the Tuareg opposition have arrived for a technical meeting 
to fix a timetable for negotiations to end the Tuareg conflict 
in <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>. The dispute has been going on for nearly three years 
now. Yesterday evening, the head of state received the two 
delegations separately. Each audience lasted about one hour. 
Today, the Burkinabe envoys are pursuing their discussions with 
the two delegations in order to establish a working program 
likely to bring everyone around the same table. Radio Burkina 
contacted the leaders of the two delegations who showed optimism 
about the effective takeoff of these trilateral consultations. 
  Kriska, of the <ORGANIZATION>Coordination of Armed Resistance</ORGANIZATION>, which 
includes all the Tuareg movements, says this slowdown is caused 
by technical problems. A few modifications need to be made, 
however that these are not necessarily preconditions. As for 
the head of the government delegation, <PERSON>Abdourahamane Hama</PERSON>, who 
is <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>'s foreign affairs and cooperation minister, the 
consultations remain informal because this enables them to 
proceed prudently. Both claim that a joint meeting is probable 
either this evening or tomorrow morning.

<FÊP=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There have been some political upheavals in <LOCATION>Burkina 
Faso</LOCATION>. The country's leader, Captain <PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON>, has 
dissolved the government and the prime minister, <PERSON>Youssouf 
Ouedraogo</PERSON>, has resigned. The prime minister has been on the job 
since <DATE>June 1992</DATE>, but it seems he might have been giving jobs to 
people that ruling party militants did not approve of. On the 
line to <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dan Isaacs</PERSON> asked our correspondent, <PERSON>Pierre 
Kazoni</PERSON>, if any reasons have been given for the prime minister's 
resignation: 
  [Begin recording] [Kazoni] Well, no official reasons have 
been given, but according to the general public it is said that 
the pressure put on him to resign came from the militants of the 
majority party, the ODP-MT [Organization for Popular 
Democracy-Labor Movement], which is also President <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON>'s 
party. He is also accused of not being [word indistinct] with 
conviction, and that he does not appoint the militants of the 
ODP to top positions. Well, these are the unofficial reasons, 
according to the people here, that have motivated his 
resignation. 
  [<PERSON>Isaacs</PERSON>] So is it simply that the prime minister has been 
appointing ministers who are not from the majority party, the 
ODP- MT, he has been giving posts to other people? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Kazoni</ORGANIZATION>] Yes. I think the ODP-MT, which is the majority 
party, they want everything for themselves. It was said clearly 
during the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>'s session 
here that the majority in the government should rule and those 
who are not in the government should oppose. This was said 
clearly by a member of parliament who is a militant of the 
ODP-MT. But this is not the vision that <PERSON>Youssouf Ouedraogo</PERSON> has. 
He is a technocrat and he believes in the right man on the 
right job. 
  [<PERSON>Isaacs</PERSON>] From what you are saying the prime minister, <PERSON>Mr. 
Ouedraogo</PERSON>, sounds less like a technocrat and more like somebody 
who really is his own man and wanted good men in good positions. 
Was he a popular prime minister? 
  [Kazoni] You may say that he was popular in a sense, in a 
sense that he achieved something during his during his term of 
office, and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> have openly declared 
their satisfaction with the way <PERSON>Mr. Ouedraogo</PERSON> handles the <ORGANIZATION>SAP</ORGANIZATION>, 
the Structural Adjustment Program. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Isaacs</ORGANIZATION>] So will the new government, when it has been 
announced, be totally dominated by dominated by the majority 
party, the ODP-MT? Is that what we can look forward to now? 
  [Kazoni] Very much, because since it is the outcry of the 
majority. I think <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> may probably listen to them. But it 
does not really rule out completely that <PERSON>Compaore</PERSON> will put in 
somebody who is not probably a member of the majority party. 
This is possible. We can always expect something like that.

  [Text] The brother leader of the revolution [Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] hosted a dinner banquet last night in 
honor of Presidents <PERSON>Blaise Campaore</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>Alpha Oumar Konare</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Mali</ORGANIZATION>, and 
<PERSON>Mahamane Ousmane</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Republic of Niger</ORGANIZATION>, and the 
delegations accompanying them. The banquet was also attended by 
the secretary and members of the secretariat of the <ORGANIZATION>General 
People's Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the secretary and members of the <ORGANIZATION>General 
People's Committee</ORGANIZATION>, in addition to the heads of the diplomatic 
missions accredited to the <PERSON>Great Jamahiriyah</PERSON> and a number of 
army officers. 
  The brother leader of the revolution delivered a speech at 
the banquet and began by welcoming the leaders of these Islamic 
African states, <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>. The leader said 
that the Libyan people welcome and appreciate the solidarity of 
their African brethren and this solidarity reinforces the 
position of the Libyan people in confronting the conspiracy led 
by the three colonial western states. 
  The leader added: The triumph of the will of the peoples of 
<LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Niger</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> strengthens freedom and democracy. 
He also warned that the colonial western states are still 
involved in creating problems and hardship for those countries 
where the nationalist movements were victorious. He pointed out 
that it has become clear that the colonial western states which 
were accusing <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> of being behind the destabilization of the 
African continent were in fact themselves working hard to 
destabilize the situation in the African continent and prevent 
the latter from building itself. 
  The leader further said: The peoples of the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION>, 
whom 
the colonial western states are trying to force to surrender, 
have decided to resist and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> must understand this. He 
added: The West is now using the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, after it tore 
up its Charter and trampled on its laws, as a neocolonialist 
means in the same way it used the <ORGANIZATION>League of Nations</ORGANIZATION> in the past 
to impose its mandate on the peoples of the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The brother leader warned: This trend which the western 
states are entrenching is a dangerous trend for the peoples of 
the world, will turn the world into a jungle, and will be 
responsible for its collapse.

  [Text] The second extraordinary session of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Assembly</ORGANIZATION> which started on 1 <DATE>March</DATE> adopted six draft bills 
relating to the <DATE>1994</DATE> budget bill. <PERSON>Amadou Diakite</PERSON> has more 
details: 
  [Diakite] The first draft bill provides for the removal of 
crisis tax on rice and sugar. The measure is designed to 
mitigate the effects of the devaluation on consumers. The 
second bill institutes a Single Tax on Petroleum Products [TUPP] 
and modifies the classification of import duty rates. The TUPP 
will enable the public treasury to (?collect) all taxes on 
petroleum products. The third bill takes into account the needs 
and concerns of consumers with regard to (?increases in the 
prices) of strategic products such as kerosene, heavy-duty fuel, 
and [word indistinct]. 
  The fourth bill deals with the import duties on drugs with 
the view to stabilizing the price of pharmaceuticals at an 
acceptable level for consumers. The fifth law provides for the 
removal of taxes and import duties on (?specific) essential 
drugs. The last bill supplements the law on value-added taxes 
on water and electricity. The bill is designed to reduce fiscal 
burden on the households by removing the value-added tax on 
water and electricity bills. 
  Deliberations resume at the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> tomorrow 
morning at 0900. The assemblymen will essentially examine the 
amended <DATE>1994</DATE> budget bill.

  [Text] Malian President <PERSON>Alpha Oumar Konare</PERSON> is among the 
African heads of state and prime ministers participating today 
in the extraordinary summit on the <ORGANIZATION>CFA</ORGANIZATION> franc. The summit is 
aimed at adopting a common position on the eventual devaluation 
of the <ORGANIZATION>CFA</ORGANIZATION> franc. The presence in <LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> Director General 
<PERSON>Michel Camdessus</PERSON> and French Cooperation Minister <PERSON>Michel Roussin</PERSON> 
reinforces the idea that devaluation has become inevitable. 
Here is the position of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> as given by President 
<PERSON>Blaise Compaore</PERSON>, who made a stopover yesterday at <LOCATION>Bamako</LOCATION> airport 
on his way to the Senegalese capital. He was answering 
questions from our special correspondents. 
  [Begin recording] [<PERSON>Compaore</PERSON>] As far as <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> is 
concerned, we intend to share our position with the other heads 
of state, for it is obvious that monetary manipulation may also 
be an economic measure. For our states, we will always have to 
raise the same issues of debt, the purchasing power of workers 
--the hardworking masses of our countries -- and certainly the 
solidarity mechanisms which will shore up our union after such a 
measure. This means that with the other heads of state we will 
come up with a common position on the issue. 
  I think there is concern in all our countries. We do not 
have a final position. This depends on the advantages we might 
obtain from this measure and also on what international 
organizations and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, our main partner, will tell us. 
  [Reporter] Is the fight against devaluation lost in advance? 
Can the franc zone countries put up solid arguments to the 
proponents of devaluation? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Compaore</ORGANIZATION>] I think the problem is not at that level. What 
advantages do we have <DATE>today</DATE> with regard to the current economic 
situation? There is economic stagnation in all our countries. 
There is no investment and there is flight of the little capital 
that remains. We have a rather unpleasant situation. This 
means that what we are seeking today is not either devaluation 
or no devaluation. I think we have gone beyond this stage. Our 
concern today is whether devaluation will improve our economic 
situation. 
  In the event of devaluation, what are the relief measures to 
be taken? What will be the internal measures and what measures 
can we expect from the financial institutions and from our main 
partner, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and the international community in order to 
improve our economies? The debate is not exactly whether we 
should devalue or not, but if we have to devalue today in the 
interests of our economies, what are the relief measures that we 
have to take with our partners so that this devaluation will not 
be a disaster for our economies? 
  [Reporter] It must be noted that 10 out of the 14 heads of 
state in the franc zone will take part in the <LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION> summit. 
Cote d'Ivoire, <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Togo</LOCATION> will be represented by their 
prime ministers, while <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> will be represented by its 
finance minister. The extraordinary summit on the <ORGANIZATION>CFA</ORGANIZATION> franc has 
overshadowed somehow the second major subject to be discussed in 
<LOCATION>Dakar</LOCATION> -- the situation of <ORGANIZATION>Air Afrique</ORGANIZATION>. The company is in very 
poor shape and the heads of state need to adopt a rehabilitation 
plan. They will also decide on the admission of <LOCATION>Guinea Bissau</LOCATION> as 
the 12th member and on the renewal of the term of office of <ORGANIZATION>Air 
Afrique</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, <PERSON>Yves Roland Billecart</PERSON>. [end

coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Burkina Faso </H5>
  At a national blood transfusion seminar which ended 
yesterday 
in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jean Gabriel Ouango</PERSON>, the permanent secretary of 
the <ORGANIZATION>National AIDS Control Committee</ORGANIZATION>, discussed the current 
national AIDS situation. <LOCATION>Ouango</LOCATION> stated that between 7 and <PERCENT>8 
percent</PERCENT> of the population is seropositive, representing about 
450,000 persons. He said that in <LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION> alone there are 
about 5,000 persons testing seropositive, and added that very 
soon an anonymous AIDS screening center would become 
operational. (<ORGANIZATION>Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du Burkina 
Faso</ORGANIZATION> in French 1300 GMT 25 Nov 93) 
<H5>  <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION> </H5>
  The minister of health, <PERSON>Commodore Obimpeh</PERSON>, announced that 
422 
cases of <ORGANIZATION>Buruli Ulcer Disease</ORGANIZATION> has been reported from five 
regions in the country. This was disclosed to parliament on 24 
<DATE>November</DATE> while he was brieing the house on the spread of the 
disease. He stated that, although the causative agent of the 
disease is known, the exact mode of transmssion is not known. 
He said that disease tracking efforts would be intensified to 
minimize the number of cases. (<ORGANIZATION>Accra Ghana Broadcasting 
Corporation Radio Network</ORGANIZATION> in English 0600 GMT 25 Nov 93) 
<H5>  <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> </H5>
  The <ORGANIZATION>UNICEF</ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr.</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Kulio Waki</ORGANIZATION>), 
declared that Nigerian salt is sufficiently iodized. He made 
this remark in <LOCATION>Abuja</LOCATION> at the opening session of a two-day 
workshop on the eradication of iodine deficiency disorder. 
However, <PERSON>Mr. (Waki</PERSON>) said that <LOCATION>Oyo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ondo</LOCATION>, Edo, <LOCATION>Enugu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Benue</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Cross River</LOCATION>, and Plateau states were still risking iodine 
deficiency. He urged health workers and coordinators in the 
program in those states to carry out the distribution of iodine 
capsules effectively, so as to eliminate the dangers the disease 
poses to the population. The <LOCATION>Abuja</LOCATION> workshop is aimed at 
eradicating mental and physical deformities, as well as 
disabilities that affect human beings due to a lack of iodine in 
their bodies. (<ORGANIZATION>Lagos Radio Nigeria Network</ORGANIZATION> in English 1500 GMT 
18 Nov 93) 
<H5>  <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> </H5>
  Jean-Baptiste Nubahumpatse reports that Burundian refugees 
in 
southern <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bugesera</LOCATION> still face untold suffering. 
Dysentery rages, while food and the infrastructures needed to 
meet their basic wants are lacking. Here is his report: 
[<ORGANIZATION>Nubahumpatse</ORGANIZATION>] About 20 people die every day in the 
Burundian refugee camps. That is at least what transpires from 
testimonies from charitable relief organizations operating in 
the region such as the <ORGANIZATION>Belgian Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and French Medecins 
Sans Frontieres who particularly deal with health problems. The 
Burundian refugees are thus hard hit by dysentery, diarrhea, 
measles, and other diseases. The grave overpopulation in the 
camps, which has caused unbearable congestion, remains the 
greatest handicap to the smooth running of relief operations. 
The <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION>, in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Works and Social 
Affairs</ORGANIZATION> as well as local authorities, are currently at work to 
try and solve the problem. In addition, particularly due to 
this overpopulation in the camps, Burundian refugees rightly or 
wrongly complain of a lack of adequate food rations. That is 
the reason why some of them take risks by venturing across the 
border to <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> to try and get extra food. They are welcomed 
by deadly bullets fired by permanently vigilant Burundian 
soldiers, irrefutable proof of the continuing killings deep 
inside <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION>. (<ORGANIZATION>Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la 
Republique Rwandaise</ORGANIZATION> in French <DATE>0430 GMT 19 Nov 93</DATE>) 
<H5>  <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> </H5>
  There has been an outbreak of dysentery in <LOCATION>Kisoro District</LOCATION> 
in 
which 12 people are recorded dead. Seven out of the 12 dead 
died at Mutolere and <LOCATION>Kisoro</LOCATION> Hospitals while five died at their 
homes. The scourge started in (<LOCATION>Murora</LOCATION>) sub-county and later 
spread to some other parts and has now covered almost half the 
district, the most hit areas being those along the Uganda-Rwanda 
border. Other affected areas include (Ruaramba), (Chihe), 
(Gisorora) and <LOCATION>Muganza</LOCATION>, being parishes which harbor the influx 
of refugees fleeing the war. (<ORGANIZATION>Kampala Radio Uganda Network</ORGANIZATION> in 
English <DATE>0400 GMT 24 Nov 93</DATE>) 
<H5>  <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> </H5>
  There has been an outbreak of dysentery at <LOCATION>Lodja</LOCATION> lately, 
spreading to <LOCATION>Lomela</LOCATION> and other areas. About 80 deaths have been 
reported. The worst-hit areas include Djinga and Gombela. The 
government has appealed for urgent assistance from international 
aid agencies (<ORGANIZATION>Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network</ORGANIZATION> in French

  [Text] The second national conference on the economy ended 
<TIME>this morning</TIME>. The 2,000 participants deliberated for two days 
on the consequences of the devaluation and development 
strategies for our economy within a new context. Braimah 
Ouedraogo reports on some of the proposals made by participants: 
  [<PERSON>Ouedraogo</PERSON>] We begin by pointing out that the conclusions 
reached at the end of the deliberations were merely proposals. 
Concerning our membership in the franc zone, it was recommended 
that greater thought should be given to the advantages and 
disadvantages of belonging to such a common monetary outfit. In 
the field of industry, a sector in difficulty and whose 
operators were present throughout the deliberations, the setting 
up of an enterprise promotion fund with special attention to 
women chief executives of enterprises was proposed, as was the 
amendment of the investment code and tax system, and the 
creation of industrial zones with special status. 
  To better sustain agriculture and stockbreeding, a sector 
which benefits greatly from the devaluation, proposals were made 
to create an outfit for the export of livestock and meat, the 
production and export of meat, bring the cost of production of 
rice under control by reducing the cost of inputs. 
  The social sector was not forgotten: It was proposed that 
traditional medicine and drugs should be integrated into the 
health delivery system in order to reduce the adverse effects of 
devaluation on a sector severely hit by poor economic times. To 
better fight against unemployment, it was proposed that 
apprenticeship should be developed for dropout youth, the 
creation of a national council for vocational training. To make 
the transport sector more dynamic, it was recommended that a 
general conference on land transportation should be convened, 
the revision of land transportation agreements signed with 
coastal countries. 
  Finally, the <ORGANIZATION>Economic and Social Council</ORGANIZATION> was charged with 
monitoring and implementing these proposals so that they become 
actins and not simply words.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister <PERSON>Roch Marc Christian Kabore</PERSON> today 
gave an answer to labor unions' counterproposals. The 
government said that it was unable to meet the demands made by 
the unions. Here with the details is Newton Ahmed Barry: 
  [<PERSON>Barry</PERSON>] The demands made by the labor unions in response to 
the 5 <DATE>April</DATE> government responses are threefold: 
  The first group, including 13 labor unions, reduced their 
demands. Regarding salary increases, Group-13 is proposing a <PERCENT>15 
percent</PERCENT> increase instead of the previously demanded <PERCENT>40-50 
percent</PERCENT>. Regarding the price of rice and fuel, this group is 
asking for a 10-percent reduction. Group-13 supports the 
exemption of the value added tax on water and electricity 
consumption -- up to 50 cubic meters for water and 150 kw for 
electricity -- as proposed by the government, but expressed 
concern with the increase in the price of a cubic meter of 
water. Therefore, the group still demands that FASOYA 
[expansion unknown] be reactivated and that the crisis facing 
small-scale businessmen be solved. Group-6, which is led by the 
TGCB [expansion unknown] maintains its demands in their entirety 
-- a <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> increase in salaries, the reestablishment of 
pre-CFA devaluation prices for rice, fuel, gas, and drugs. 
  The only labor union that did not answer the government's 
call for counterproposals was the <ORGANIZATION>CSP</ORGANIZATION> [expansion unknown]. The 
prime minister stated that he was safisfied with the labor 
unions quick answer to the proposals, but regretted that because 
of budgetary constraints, the government was unable to meet any 
of the demands. The dialogue has not been disrupted, other 
avenues are still open, and the government will hold 
consultations with social partners over the coming days.

<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> praised the
Christian heritage of this African nation today as he began an
eight-day tour of the impoverished Sahel region, his sixth
pilgrimage to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   The pope flew from <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> in a special <ORGANIZATION>Alitalia Airbus</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Amilcar
Cabral</PERSON> international airport on the 10-island archipelago off
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s northwest coast. After two days in the former Portuguese
colony, he heads to <LOCATION>Guinea Bissau</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Chad</LOCATION>.
   In brief remarks in Portuguese, the pope referred to the
predominantly Roman Catholic islands as a country of ``ancient
Christianity at the gates of continental <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'' and wished
``grace, salvation and peace'' on <PERSON>Cape Verdians</PERSON> and the many who
emigrated abroad.
   After greetings from several thousand well-wishers, the pope
transferred to a smaller plane for a 40-minute flight to <LOCATION>Praia</LOCATION> for
the official welcoming ceremony.
   Islanders were out all day sweeping the sand and dust from the
streets blown by strong winds gusting across the archipelago.
   The trip is the 45th foreign voyage of the pope's 11-year
pontificate.
   The countries in the sub-Saharan semi-arid region stretching
across western and central <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> are among the world's poorest,
with millions of people living on the edge of starvation.
   The pope is expected to renew an appeal he made 10 years ago for
international aid to help save sub-Saharan <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> from its chronic
problems of poverty, hunger, disease and encroaching deserts.
   ``This is the poorest part of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the pope will discuss
the realities of these countries,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Joaquin
Navarro</PERSON>.
   The visit comes at a time when African government and church
leaders are concerned that Western aid and development funds will
be redirected from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to the new democrtic movements in <LOCATION>Eastern
Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``The interest of the Western world is focused on the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, and
there is a risk of forgetting to save one part of humanity that
would fall back into misery,'' <PERSON>Cardinal Paul Zoungrana</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina
Faso</ORGANIZATION> said in an interview with the Italian Catholic magazine 30
Giorni (30 Days).
   ``This is not the moment to abandon <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,'' he said. ``The
pope can use his moral strength and attract the attention of the
whole world.''
   Noting that the Polish-born pope himself comes from <LOCATION>Eastern
Europe</LOCATION>, the cardinal said, ``If a new problem arises, you can't
forget the old ones. And if it's a pope from the East who reminds
us, the world will take note.''
   In a special supplement on the papal trip, the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano decried the world's ``indifference'' towards
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s problems.
   ``While the eyes of the world are still fixed on the
extraordinary events of <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, the heart of the church now
looks elsewhere ... to the vast territory of suffering that is
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said.
   A centerpiece of the pope's trip will be a ceremony <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Ouagadougou</LOCATION>, capital of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, marking the 10th anniversary
of <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON>'s appeal for the Sahel in which he declared: ``I can
not remain silent while my brothers and sisters are in danger.''
   The appeal led to the creation in <DATE>1984</DATE> of the <ORGANIZATION>John Paul II
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> for the Sahel, funded primarily by contributions from
Catholics in <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and sponsoring agricultural and
development projects in the region.
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON>, who is scheduled to make another trip to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> later
this year, is particularly interested in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> because of the
rapid growth of Catholicism on the continent. The African church
counts more than 75 million followers <DATE>today</DATE>, or about <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of
the total population, compared to <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> at the turn of the
century.
   About <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION>'s population of 360,000 is Roman
Catholic, the highest percentage in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. However, Catholics are
a small minority in the other countries on the tour, ranging from
less than <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> in <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION> to <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> in <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION>.
   While <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION> is the most prosperous of the five nations,
more than 400,000 islanders _ greater than the current population _
have emigrated in recent decades to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in
search of jobs and a better life.

   The justice minister has confirmed
reports that army troops hunting for dissidents killed civilians,
but said the killing was in self-defense and denied it was
indiscriminate.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
in which it ``noted with concern credible reports of civilian
casualties in the fighting in <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION>.''
   ``We deplore actions, whether by government troops or
insurgents, which lead to such casualties,'' the statement said,
adding the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> had been in contact with governments in
the region.
   At a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION>'s Justice Minister <PERSON>Jenkins
Scott</PERSON> denied soldiers indiscriminately killed civilians while
hunting for dissidents who crossed into the <LOCATION>Nimba</LOCATION> region from
neighboring <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Upon the arrival, the army was attacked by people in civilian
clothes, so what did you expect them to do?'' he said.
   ``For instance, if a mother has a baby in her arms and has a gun
in her hand and is approaching you, will you say you should take
the baby and put it down before attacking?'' he added.
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said the rebel <ORGANIZATION>National Patriotic Front</ORGANIZATION>, led by former
Liberian civil servant <PERSON>Charles Taylor</PERSON>, was responsible for the
deaths.
   ``Blame <PERSON>Charles Taylor</PERSON> and his cohorts,'' he said.
   The government says <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> sent about 100 rebels into the <LOCATION>Nimba</LOCATION>
area on <DATE>Dec. 24</DATE> in an effort to overthrow President <PERSON>Samuel K. Doe</PERSON>,
who came to power in a violent <DATE>1980</DATE> coup.
   <PERSON>Doe</PERSON> said the rebels killed more than 200 civilians in the next
two weeks before his forces brought the situation under control.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Africa Watch</ORGANIZATION>, a human rights group, said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that Liberian soldiers killed at least 200 civilians after
the attempted coup. <ORGANIZATION>Africa Watch</ORGANIZATION> is a division of the private Human
Rights Watch that monitors abuses around the world.
   Liberians who fled to <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION> to escape the fighting also
accused <PERSON>Doe</PERSON>'s troops of gunning down civilians. As many as 10,000
Liberians reportedly have sought refuge in <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION> since the
fighting began.
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said two paramilitary officers were killed during the
Nimba invasion and that 16 border officials were missing or dead.
   Doe has accused <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION> of harboring Liberian dissidents and
claimed <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>'s band was trained in <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   In support of his charge, the government <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> televised
statements from two men it described as captured rebels.
   The men, identified as <PERSON>Harrison Diakpo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alfred Suomie</PERSON>, both
of the <LOCATION>Nimba</LOCATION> area, said they first met some of <ORGANIZATION>Taylor</ORGANIZATION>'s dissidents
in <LOCATION>Burkina Faso</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Diakpo said he was living in <LOCATION>Ivory Coast</LOCATION>
when his brother-in-law, whom he did not identify, urged Diakpo to
join him for business reasons in the capital, where they were given
bus tickets to <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>'s capital.
   From <ORGANIZATION>Burkina Faso</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Diakpo</PERSON> said they were taken to a camp near
<LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, where Libyan authorities gave them sophisticated
military training.
   He said they also received training at a farm in <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION>
owned by President <PERSON>Felix Houphouet-Boigny</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION> government has denied supporting coup attempts
against <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> told Roman
Catholics today to resist abortion and contraception as they try to
improve living conditions in this impoverished West African country.
   Celebrating Mass outside the capital at a national pilgrimage
site, the pope said the church and its members should work to build
up the country ``on the basis of respect for the human person and
the family.
   ``Human life is inviolable, the right to life should be defended
ceaselessly,'' <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> said.
   He said life should be protected ``from conception until natural
death'' and that couples should live ``a responsible fatherhood and
motherhood.''
   He said couples must resist ``invasion of methods which go
against the dignity of the woman and do not honor the man. I appeal
to all lay people to fight for the sanctification of the family.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> rejects artificial birth control and
the church here has resisted government birth control plans.
   The pope arrived here from <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION> on the fourth leg of an
eight-day tour of five African nations. About <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Burkina
Faso</ORGANIZATION>'s 8.5 million people are Roman Catholics, more than a third
are Moslems and most of the rest are animist.
   On his way from the airport to the Mass site, the pope's
motorcade passed tens of thousands of people gathered by the
roadside in front of thatched huts and concrete hovels. A steady
wind from the <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION> desert blew sand and dust.
   The country has been blighted by drought and expanding desert
and the average per capita income is around <MONEY>$200</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> was greeted upon arrival from <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION> by President <PERSON>Blaise
Compaore</PERSON>, who took power in a <DATE>1987</DATE> coup in which his predecessor,
<PERSON>Thomas Sankara</PERSON>, was killed.
   Africa is Catholicism's fastest growing church, with more 75
million adherents. The <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> expects to count 100 million African
faithful by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   However, Islam is a major challenger for converts, and the
Catholic church is increasingly worried by the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in some areas of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>, the pope celebrated a Mass attended by 15,000
Christians and 10,000 Moslems.
   ``I rejoice that a climate of understanding reigns between the
Moslem and Catholic communities in <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>,'' the pope said in his
homily during the Mass at <LOCATION>Bamako</LOCATION>'s soccer stadium. ``Dialogue
between Moslems and Christians is more necessary than ever.''
   As the pope toured the stadium in an open Mercedes, both Moslems
and Catholics stood, waved and cheered.
   About <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>'s 8 million people are Catholics, while
Moslems account for <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>. Most of the rest are animists.
   ``I hope that the dialogue between Moslems and Catholics
improves even more and favors constructive cooperation,'' <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON>
said.
   Earlier in the day, the pope spoke of the church's concern over
intolerance toward Catholics in some other countries in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>
without naming any individual nations.
   He also urged Catholics to recognize and respect ``the authentic
religious values'' of Moslems.
   ``Dialogue with them is not always easy or desired by everyone,
and it is sometimes difficult to find a common language or
representatives to talk to each other,'' he said in a speech to
<LOCATION>Mali</LOCATION>'s bishops.
