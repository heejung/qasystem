An animal with eyes on stalks and lots of legs will terrify people even if
humans are thousands of times bigger and heavier, but such is our
anthropomorphism that a much bigger animal will cause cooings of delight if
it simply does something supposedly characteristic of humans. Hence the
appeal of the meerkat, which looks like a cross between a dog and a monkey
and stands on its hind legs to watch for predators. '<ORGANIZATION>Meerkats United</ORGANIZATION>' is
repeated today in <PERSON>David Attenborough</PERSON>'s Wildlife 100 collection (7.00 BBC1).
In today's The <ORGANIZATION>Great Picture Trail National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Neil MacGregor</PERSON>
talks about <PERSON>Velasquez</PERSON>'s 'Old Woman Cooking Eggs' and <PERSON>Manet</PERSON>'s 'Bar At <ORGANIZATION>The
Folies Bergere</ORGANIZATION>' which, for some reason, always seems to be chosen, as here,
for any collection of reproductions destined for the walls of schools (7.35
BBC2). BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment screens the programme about
the illegal export of religious icons from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> which was postponed last
week (7.45). 40 Minutes considers the life of comedian <PERSON>Ernie Wise</PERSON> without
his teammate, the late <PERSON>Eric Morecambe</PERSON> (9.50 BBC2).

OH MY! 25 YEARS OF LIONS, TIGERS AND BEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
As any entertainer knows, the trick is to grab the audience before the first 
commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
The formula has always worked well for <PERSON>Jeanne Collier</PERSON>, a 25-year veteran docent 
at the <LOCATION>Greater Los Angeles</LOCATION> Zoo who was honored last month for completing her 
12,000th volunteer hour. 
</P>
<P>
Collier coordinates the zoo's speaker's bureau from her <ORGANIZATION>Eagle Rock</ORGANIZATION> home. But 
for her, the fun begins when she laces up her tennis shoes, straightens her 
safari shirt, and prepares to shepherd a group of kids on a tour of the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying an oddity-crammed handbag of fake fur ("Real people wear fake fur," 
she said jauntily), <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> is a blend of storyteller, jester, teacher and mom 
to the thousands of people she has guided past the preening flamingos and 
around the omnipresent squawking peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
Her tour group one recent morning consisted of a chatty bunch of 4th, 5th and 
6th graders from the talented and gifted program at <LOCATION>Inglewood</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kelso 
Elementary School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Even before they set out for the woolly monkey island, <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> had won their 
hearts, and more importantly, their attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't know if you've ever seen a drunk elephant before . . . " she said, 
her eyebrows raised and her delivery sounding like a cross between <PERSON>Johnny 
Carson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Wizard</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
She went on to explain that elephants aren't given alcohol at the zoo, but in 
the wild they eat fermented marula fruit and whole herds get tipsy on them. To 
the delight of her listeners, she pulled a dried marula fruit out of her 
handbag. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed in her stories, such as how the zookeepers collect saliva samples 
from female rhinoceroses for pregnancy tests, are important messages, such as 
how poachers have pushed the animals close to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're giving tours, if you start to lose them, you change the pace," she 
said during an interview. "You either get humorous, get gory, get surprising . 
. . or you talk about courtship!" 
</P>
<P>
For her straggling band of elementary school students, <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> used the zoo's 
colony of woolly monkeys as a springboard to talk about the disappearance of 
the tropical rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"We care about the rain forests because we love the animals and they're in our 
hearts," she said. Besides, she tells the youngsters, when the rain forests are 
gone, so is chocolate, because the cacao seeds that make real chocolate are 
grown only there. "And how would we live without chocolate?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't," replied <PERSON>Antoinette Marble</PERSON>, 11, sharing a somber look with the 
"60-something" <PERSON>Collier</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
After so many years at the zoo, <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> knows the turf like a second home and 
its residents like old friends. She fondly greeted <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON>, a gorilla who blows 
kisses, and noted that <PERSON>Zombo</PERSON>, the dominant silverback male, could be pounding 
on his chest just to show off. 
</P>
<P>
At the anteater exhibit, she got groans from the <PERSON>Kelso</PERSON> students with a pun 
about all the "anti-bodies" that are given the animals to keep them healthy in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, as she chatted and clowned, <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> sought to educate. The smell 
emanating from the gorillas is the male gorilla's sweat, she said, and not what 
an 11-year-old delicately referred to as "bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
The meerkats, prairie dog-like rodents, are not only sociable, she said, but 
smart. "Find the lookout," she said, and the children were quick to spot a lone 
rodent atop a rock, scanning the sky for hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Why are the female peacocks so dully marked, when their mates are so 
resplendent? "Because the girl doesn't have to attract the guy?" asked 
11-year-old <PERSON>Nicholas Rice</PERSON>. "That's part of it," <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> replied. She also told 
the children to think about camouflage, and how it would protect "somebody 
sitting on a nest, trying to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Collier's enthusiasm has never dimmed, she said, because she loves the zoo, she 
loves children, and she loves animals. 
</P>
<P>
Her love of the zoo may have something to do with its location, she said. She 
and her husband, <PERSON>Harold</PERSON>, courted in <LOCATION>Griffith Park</LOCATION> before their wedding 50 years 
ago this month. Twenty-six years later, when the zoo opened at its present site 
in <DATE>1966</DATE>, she gave her first tour. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the children, junior high students are <ORGANIZATION>Collier</ORGANIZATION>'s favorites. 
"They are kind of incorrigible, and pretend they're not interested in anything 
you've got to say. I take that as a challenge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Collier</PERSON>'s love of animals is one born of close observation and a delight in the 
surprises the animal kingdom offers. A favorite memory is the day she watched a 
mother siamang gibbon make her body into a hammock underneath her baby in order 
to protect the youngster as it practiced crawling upside-down on the wire 
ceiling of the cage. 
</P>
<P>
To her, the quiet scene was as entertaining as watching the saliva collection 
at the rhinoceros enclosure. This was done, by the way, with a basket of apples 
to make the mother rhino drool, while a keeper collects a sample with a 
long-handled cup. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> doesn't like to watch at the zoo is the clock, which 
inevitably steals time she wishes she could spend showing children the 
two-headed snake, toucans and other exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
Limping slightly, but outpacing her brood of the day, <PERSON>Collier</PERSON> breathlessly 
dashed to a cage housing four red-faced uakari monkeys from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>. 
These, she explained, are so rare they are only found in this zoo and in the 
endangered rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're late," she said apologetically, "but this may be the only chance 
you'll ever get to see a uakari, and I couldn't let you miss them." 
</P>
<P>
The tour was over, with little fanfare, at the <TIME>11:30 a.m.</TIME> bird show, where 
<PERSON>Collier</PERSON> caught her breath and giggled at the crow that untied the keeper's 
shoelace in a gag she's seen dozens of times. 
</P>
<P>
"I never get tired of this," she said. "I really got a kick out of these kids 
today."

COACHELLA VALLEY'S LIVING DESERT SERVES AS OASIS OF PRESERVATION FOR MANY 
SPECIES

In proposing desert nature reserves, we should think of small ones as well as 
large ones. Small reserves to protect a particular landmark or other natural 
feature can be very satisfying. But large ones are most to be sought, for 
desert connotes vastness, great sweeps of land untouched by the often grimy 
hand of man, who is given to taking over the land and cluttering it with his 
"developments" of roads, subdivisions, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>E. Jaeger</PERSON>, "The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Deserts," <DATE>1933</DATE> 
</P>
<P>
On your last visit to <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION>, did you see more shops than 
succulents, more condos than cacti? Are you looking for an escape from Fairway 
Living and <ORGANIZATION>Rodeo Drive East</ORGANIZATION>? 
</P>
<P>
Try the Living Desert, an oasis within the oasis. Here's your chance to see 
<LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> wildlife, not to be confused with the <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> wild life 
that's enjoyed by the thousands of college students who party hearty during 
<DATE>spring</DATE> break. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in <LOCATION>Coachella Valley</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION>, just around the corner from golf 
courses and neatly manicured subdivisions, the 1,200-acre Living Desert reserve 
provides visitors with a superb introduction to desert plant life, land forms 
and wildlife. It's a combination botanical garden hiking area and an accredited 
zoo. The nonprofit facility is dedicated to conservation, education and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve's botanical gardens represent major desert regions, including 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s Mojave, <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s Sonoran and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Chihuahua</LOCATION>. Among the 
assortment of about 1,000 species of plants found here are smoke trees and 
saguaros, palo verde and palms, brittle bush and barrel cactus. The reserve 
maintains a well-stocked nursery, where visitors may purchase many native 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife-watchers will enjoy observing animals rarely glimpsed in the wild. 
Among the species housed here are coyotes in their burrows and bighorn sheep 
perched on the rocky peaks of their enclosure. The walk-through aviary allows 
up-close views of a number of desert birds, and a pond includes water-loving 
species, including turtles, tortoises and the rare desert pupfish. 
</P>
<P>
Other exotic species here are the endangered slender-horn gazelle and the 
Arabian oryx, often referred to as "the unicorn of the desert." 
</P>
<P>
The Living Desert is currently abuzz with the news that a breeding pair of 
zebras was recently acquired and will soon be housed at the facility. Plans are 
in the works for a 26,000-square-foot exhibit called <ORGANIZATION>Eagle Canyon</ORGANIZATION>, which will 
spotlight threatened and endangered species, including the magnificent golden 
<ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION>. Officials expect it to be completed by <DATE>1992</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve's animal adoptions program allows individuals or groups, such as 
school classrooms, to donate funds for the care and feeding of species ranging 
from beetles to bighorns. Stumped by what to get <PERSON>Uncle Harry</PERSON> for his next 
birthday? Why not a year's care of a kit fox or screech owl? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educational Programs 
</P>
<P>
Children especially delight in the educational programs offered in the 
Discovery Room, where they participate in a variety of hands-on activities. 
Each year, the slide shows, guided tours, lectures and presentations provide a 
comprehensive introduction to desert wonders to more than 10,000 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the grounds of the reserve and the trails that lead away from the 
buildings that best capture the heart of the Living Desert. Here the reserve 
becomes what the great desert naturalist <PERSON>Edmund Jaeger</PERSON> envisioned when he wrote 
of the necessity for preserving representative sections of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Six miles of self-guided trails lead past about 60 interpretive stops. A 
brittle bush-dotted flood plain and a desert wash with its moisture-loving 
vegetation of smoke trees, desert willows and palo verde are among the desert 
ecosystems that can be explored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Indians 
</P>
<P>
Many of the plants on display were of great use to the original inhabitants of 
the <LOCATION>Coachella Valley</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Cahuilla Indians</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the walk through the Living Desert uses a nature trail named 
for <PERSON>Jaeger</PERSON>. Leaving the developed desert behind, a path heads up an alluvial 
fan, past sand dunes and onto a plain that true desert rats call a bajada. Here 
you'll find a quail guzzler, which stores rainwater to aid <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s state 
bird during the hot <DATE>summer</DATE> months. Trails also lead up toward the south slope 
of <ORGANIZATION>Eisenhower Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, the 1,952-foot bald peak named for the former president 
who was a part-time <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> resident. 
</P>
<P>
On the south slope of Ike's peak is a picnic area and a plaque describing the 
region's date industry. The slope of <ORGANIZATION>Eisenhower Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, or any quiet place in 
the reserve, is a good spot to contemplate the <LOCATION>Coachella Valley</LOCATION>, the future of 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s arid lands, the necessity of preserving our dry and empty places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calendar of Events 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its exhibits and educational programs, the Living Desert 
maintains a full calendar of events, including art exhibits and field trips. 
Newly reopened after its annual summer closure, the Living Desert promises 
visitors a full day of activities focused on the intriguing world of the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Special activities are also planned. On <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE>, there will be the 10th annual 
Concert on the <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION>, a fund-raising program featuring the <ORGANIZATION>Nelson Riddle 
Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>, conducted by <PERSON>Chris Riddle</PERSON>. On Thanksgiving weekend, a special 
program titled "Masters in Glass" will feature glass-blowing demonstrations and 
the sale of fine glassware. 
</P>
<P>
The Living Desert is at 47000 <LOCATION>Portola Ave.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION> 92260; phone (619) 
346-5694. The reserve is open daily, <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>; admission for adults, 
<MONEY>$5</MONEY>; children 6-15, <MONEY>$2</MONEY>; 5 and under, free. Seniors 62 and older pay <MONEY>$4.50</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Directions: From Highway 111 in <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION>, turn south on <LOCATION>Portola Avenue</LOCATION> and 
drive 1 1/2 miles south to the park.

MORNING BRIEFING: BLUE DEVILS JUST LOOKED LIKE THE DEVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the <ORGANIZATION>Central Connecticut State Blue Devils</ORGANIZATION> lost to <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>last 
Saturday</DATE>, they looked horrible. 
</P>
<P>
They looked so bad, in fact, that Coach <PERSON>Mike Brown</PERSON> said the team plans to file 
a civil lawsuit for breach of promise against <ORGANIZATION>Russell Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Alabama-based 
sportswear company. He said <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> made an oral commitment last <DATE>summer</DATE> to 
deliver <ORGANIZATION>Central Connecticut State</ORGANIZATION>'s game uniforms before the <DATE>1990</DATE> season began. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't arrive, and the team wore practice uniforms in its first two games, 
including a 135-92 loss to <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION>'s on regional television. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>: "It is just not right. We are trying to build a credible program, 
and I am ripped that we come to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and play on TV and we look like a 
bunch of ragamuffins." 
</P>
<P>
Add ragamuffins: The Blue Devils don't know how much longer their thrift-shop 
look will last, because when <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> called to say the outfits would be late, 
the company set no new delivery date. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>: "The kids came to me and asked what kind of recourse they had 
against the company. <PERSON>Dennis Murphy</PERSON>, our captain, had the idea for the lawsuit 
and the kids are serious about it. This is not just a lark, this is for real." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which two teams played the only doubleheader in <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> history? 
</P>
<P>
A little too gamy: <PERSON>Steve Hellyer</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>University of Oregon</ORGANIZATION>'s sports information 
director, was in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> last week to prepare for his football team's visit to 
the Freedom Bowl, where it plays <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Dec. 29</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
While dining at the restaurant where the <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> team dinner will be held, 
<PERSON>Hellyer</PERSON> made one request: "Would you please remove 'Grilled Duck' from the 
menu?" 
</P>
<P>
Dialing for Dawgs: Former <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> linebacker <PERSON>Marcus Cotton</PERSON>, recently waived by the 
<LOCATION>Atlanta Falcons</LOCATION> and picked up by the <LOCATION>Cleveland Browns</LOCATION>, told <PERSON>Ed Meyer</PERSON> of the 
<LOCATION>Akron</LOCATION> Beacon-Journal why he has two phones in his Mercedes 750 SL. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cotton: "I'm a businessman as well as a football player. One's a business 
phone. One's a pleasure phone." 
</P>
<P>
Noting Cotton was fined 11 times in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> wrote: "The Browns were able 
to acquire Cotton . . . because, according to the word from <ORGANIZATION>Falcon</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Jerry 
Glanville</PERSON>, the bill on the pleasure phone was too high." 
</P>
<P>
Aptly named: From <PERSON>Phil Jackman</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Evening Sun: "<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> vs. 
<LOCATION>Louisiana Tech</LOCATION> in the Poulan-Weed Eater Independence Bowl <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>, come on! It 
extends the season a month, falls during exams when the school is making large 
noises about academic upgrading and further reduces the players to simple 
chattels to be used for the purpose of making a few bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Add <PERSON>Jackman</PERSON>: "Meanwhile, a team like <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> goes from a 1-10 season to 7-4, 
seemingly is deserving of a reward (no one plays the game for the game itself 
these days) and is blanked. Obviously, there are not enough bowls with 'just<DATE>' 
19</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
Bite, ball, bite!: South African golfer <PERSON>Butch Kruger</PERSON> had a good round going in 
the central <ORGANIZATION>Orange Free State</ORGANIZATION> trials, until a mongoose-like animal grabbed his 
ball with its mouth and dropped down its hole. 
</P>
<P>
Kruger wrote on his card: "Meerkat." 
</P>
<P>
Ben de Wet, assistant curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Bloemfontein Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, erased all doubt when he 
told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION>: "A meerkat could pick up a golf ball with its teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The <ORGANIZATION>Green Bay Packers</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</LOCATION> played two 
exhibition games on <DATE>Aug. 25, 1939</DATE>. The first game ended in a 7-7 tie, and the 
Packers won the nightcap, 17-0.

FORREST GUMP (12) <PERSON>Robert Zemeckis</PERSON>
THE LION KING (U) <PERSON>Roger Allers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rob Minkoff
MINA TANNENBAUM</PERSON> (12) <PERSON>Martine Dugowson</PERSON>
FUNNY MAN (18) <ORGANIZATION>Simon Sprackling
Early</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Forrest Gump</LOCATION>, before its hero has grown into <PERSON>Tom Hanks</PERSON>, he is
chased down a country road by school bullies. The braces on his legs - the
boy is ill-developed physically as well as mentally - suddenly fly apart and
free him to run like a sprinter.
For <ORGANIZATION>Forrest Gump</ORGANIZATION> read <ORGANIZATION>Forrest Gump</ORGANIZATION>. This 2 1/2 -hour comedy/fable/history
lesson must once have seemed the most handicapped project on the Hollywood
lot: an epic hobble across post-war <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> with a holy fool for hero and a
road paved, or potholed, with 40 years of national good intentions and
national seizures (<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, Watergate). Our Forrest grows up into an
<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> Candide: a man around whom great events happen but who remains
blithely unscathed and unimpressed by them all.
Would such a movie play in <LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION>? Even the original novel by <ORGANIZATION>Winston Groom</ORGANIZATION>
only sold 30,000 copies in hardback.
Commercially it has run like the wind: Dollars 270m at the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> box office to
date - it may topple <LOCATION>Jurassic Park</LOCATION> as the highest-earning film in history -
and an entire nation besotted with Gump wit and wisdom. Like its
innocent-messianic hero, who becomes an athlete and spends much of the movie
jogging across the land as a torchbearer-without-torch for the human spirit,
<ORGANIZATION>Forrest Gump</ORGANIZATION> the film has thrown aside its leg-braces and left footprints
all over <LOCATION>Clinton-era America</LOCATION>.
Indeed Gump may be <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, we (and others) opine. One of several
ingenious trick-optical scenes has the backwoods boy shaking hands with <ORGANIZATION>JFK</ORGANIZATION>
himself. And surely that was a favourite scene from the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> movie
scrapbook too.
But like the man in the <ORGANIZATION>White House Forrest Gump</ORGANIZATION> spends a deal of time
trying to be all things to all folk. Self-ingratiatingly, and for this
viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical
with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy. When Forrest
overnights at the <ORGANIZATION>Watergate Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, after a chat with
<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> (more state-of-the-art opticals), we chortle approvingly as he becomes
the first man to blow the whistle on the 'plumbers'.
But only minutes before that we are watching him in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> behaving like
<PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> in <LOCATION>The Green Berets</LOCATION>. As he runs back and forth through a
napalm-blazing jungle, finally saving unit leader <PERSON>Gary Sinise</PERSON>, a nightmare
war is turned into an arch cameo of Boy's Own heroism. Sinise will adorn the
rest of the movie as a double amputee, providing a support paradigm -
<LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Forrest</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Lear</LOCATION> - of grace under pressure in millennial
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
But is it grace or just glamourised gormlessness? 'Stupid is as stupid does'
is one wisdom intoned by <PERSON>Hanks</PERSON>'s dogged <PERSON>Southerner</PERSON> - his face puckered in
sage earnestness, his vowels a lugubrious, elastic twang - as he proves that
an IQ of 75 does not disqualify you as the moral hero of a nation.
Accident is destiny, destiny accident: that is the other saw that keeps
buzzing. From the opening credits sequence, in which a feather drifts from
the sky down to <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION>'s shoe as he sits on a park bench hijacking
strangers with his life story (a blend of <ORGANIZATION>EL Wisty</ORGANIZATION> and the Ancient Mariner),
director <PERSON>Robert 'Roger Rabbit</PERSON>' <PERSON>Zemeckis</PERSON> and screenwriter <PERSON>Eric Roth</PERSON> pile on
the haphazard while steering Forrest unerringly towards fulfilment. He gets
to love a woman (<PERSON>Robin Wright</PERSON>), an ex-flower child whom he saves from the
hell of <DATE>1960s</DATE> liberalism. He fathers his own child. He grows rich from the
shrimping business.
He is, we begin to realise, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> herself: that dear, untutored land that
redeems itself by its innocence even when it creates tragedy by its
ignorance. This rose-tinted mirror held up to the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> says, 'If
we have never truly grown up - never do grow up - nothing can truly be our
fault.' If sentimentality were a crime, <ORGANIZATION>Forrest Gump</ORGANIZATION> would be put away for
life. As it is, it will probably be with us for life: the ultimate feel-good
film in an age when no one any longer has the courage to feel bad.
Moviegoing in late-summer <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has been a dangerous activity. Turn away
from the idiot savant on the park bench and you will walk straight into the
jaws of The Lion King (Dollars 250m and climbing).
But this option is more fun. Disney's new animation feature is its first
ever based on an original screenplay and has a real freshness of setting and
vision. The African wilderness shimmers across the wide screen - do not wait
for the video - as the orphaned lion prince <PERSON>Simba</PERSON> grows up to dethrone his
wicked uncle Scar (voiced by <PERSON>Jeremy Irons</PERSON>) who had his regal father run over
in a wildebeest stampede.
We are all run over by this wildebeest stampede. From where I sat it started
in the north-west speaker, surged down the side aisle, roared over the
Empire screen towards <LOCATION>Leicester Square</LOCATION>, then rumbled out in the south-west
speaker. Spectacle matches sound: thousands of dust-raising shapes shaking
the desert as the camerawork soars and curvettes overhead.
The sequence lasts 2 1/2 minutes and took two years to create. <PERSON>Jeremy
Irons</PERSON>'s voice for Scar probably took two hours and is just as splendid: a
wicked <PERSON>George Sanders</PERSON> purr sliding up and down the scale of sarcasm like a
cat on a polished bannister.
The film loses its magic towards the end, with a gaudy, hurried showdown. We
miss the burnished charm with which the film sauntered round its early
scenes. Here - and in the middle section where a hip meerkat and doleful
wart-hog keep Simba company in the paradise valley of his exile - The Lion
King matches the comical and painterly bravura of the great Disney cartoons.
Is there such a thing a feel-bad film today? <PERSON>Mina Tannenbaum</PERSON> ought to
qualify, but by some proprietary charm formula fails to do so.
Mina (<PERSON>Romane Bohringer</PERSON>) is a plain, introverted Jewish girl, tormented by
not having her best friend <PERSON>Ethel</PERSON>'s vibrant social graces. Ethel (<PERSON>Elsa
Zylberstein</PERSON>), also Jewish, is tormented because she does not have painter
<PERSON>Mina</PERSON>'s depth and artistic talent.
Stir in two passive-aggressive Jewish mothers - adding gall to a stew
steeped in wormwood - and you have this drama of interconnecting female
lives, bubbling and spitting across two caustically observed decades.
Screenwriter <PERSON>Veronique Heuchenne</PERSON> and director <PERSON>Martine Dugowson</PERSON> make
sardonically merry with the fashions of the <DATE>1970s</DATE>: floor-sweeping trouser
bottoms and hats like floppy stovepipes. Then they make menacing with the
greedy <DATE>1980s</DATE>, when ambition and love rivalry pulls the girlfriends apart.
We could cry 'Woman's picture' and complain that emotion swamps action and
that the men are pawns in a parable of sisterhood. But after the runaway
patriarchalism of Forrest Gump and The Lion King - where woman's sole
function is to be mettle-polisher to the dominant male - <PERSON>Mina Tannenbaum</PERSON> is
a welcome reminder that half the planet has its own mind and will and hand
on destiny's tiller.
Funny Man, a British horror comedy from first-time writer-director <PERSON>Simon
Sprackling</PERSON>, is the week's booby prize. If you ever win a round of poker from
<PERSON>Christopher Lee</PERSON>, make sure you do not accept his forfeit of an ancestral
home. It contains a homicidal 'joker' (<PERSON>Tim James</PERSON>, putty-faced up to resemble
a Jimmy Savile from hell) whose delight is picturesquely to murder you and
your friends.
Sliced heads; pierced eyeballs; electrocution; burning. All the fun of the
auto-da-fe. And between murders the film returns to its normal idling state:
a benighted, terminal catatonia. Wait for the video. And then keep waiting.

<HEAD>Bears, Monkeys, Snakes _ and Handlers _ Protest Ban on Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of growling bears and chattering
monkeys were paraded by Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON>'s home on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to protest a government ban on animal street shows.
   Snakes in their baskets were taken on the two-mile march that
caused traffic jams and even some panic, forcing police to
accompany the men and boys who earn their livings performing with
animals and reptiles.
   Police halted the procession a half-mile from <ORGANIZATION>Singh</ORGANIZATION>'s house, a
customary security precaution during the capital's frequent
protests over political and social issues.
   A man dressed as a monkey jumped from tree branch to tree branch
en route and pretended to snatch food from roadside vendors.
Children on their way home from school looked bewildered. Some
clapped, while others peeped from behind trees.
   ``Bread is more important than environment,'' read a placard
hung around the neck of a 12-year-old bear paraded in the midday
103-degree heat.
   ``At least 1 million Indians earn their bread by holding
roadside shows with bears, monkeys, goats, snakes and mongooses,''
said the protest's spokesman and organizer, <PERSON>Dhirendra Pratap</PERSON>.
   ``And you want to stop it. If you do it, they will all die of
hunger,'' he said, referring to both the handlers and their animals.
   On <DATE>May 1</DATE>, Minister of State for Environment, <PERSON>Maneka Gandhi</PERSON>,
ordered police to enforce a decade-old law that bans animal shows.
<PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON> said many of the animals, especially the bears, die of
mistreatment and heat. The bears are naturally found in the much
cooler Himalayan foothills.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON>, an animal lover, ordered all such animals picked up
and kept in zoos until they can be freed in the forests.
   Officials from her ministry visited several homes of handlers to
try to persuade them to part with their animals but were chased
away, <PERSON>Pratap</PERSON> said.
   In a test case, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s best-known performing bear, <LOCATION>Munna</LOCATION>, was
taken by police and brought to the city zoo. Munna earned fame
during the <DATE>1985</DATE> Festival of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. The bear was kidnapped
in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> by an animal activist group and later found in a forest.
   ``At least two dozen policemen came to my house and asked me to
bring Munna to the police station where I was forced to put him in
a cage under threat,'' said <PERSON>Nasir Khan Kalandar</PERSON>, the bear's owner.
   ``Today's march is also to seek freedom for Munna,'' the
75-year-old man said, wiping tears from his eyes.
   Kalandar said <PERSON>Munna</PERSON> did not eat for six days in the zoo. ``He
ate only when my wife visited him the other day.''
   Environment Ministry officials said the decision to take the
bears and other animals stemmed from a desire to prevent cruelty.
   ``The poor things go through a terrible period of so-called
training, and our minister decided to put a stop on that,'' said
one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There are no official statistics on how many bears, monkeys,
snakes and mongooses are in the custody of performers nationwide.
   ``The figure will run into thousands for the animals and tens of
thousands for the snakes,'' said <PERSON>Pratap</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, 250 bears, 2,000 monkeys, 10,000 snakes and 1,000
mongooses are used for entertainment shows, he said.
   ``These animals are like our sons,'' said <PERSON>Hasan Din</PERSON>, a
performer. ``My family is totally dependent on <PERSON>Moti Bhalu</PERSON>,'' he
said pointing to a 10-year-old sloth bear.
   Pratap asked: ``If <PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON> can keep 15 dogs at her home, why
can't these people keep the animals?''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON> runs a hospital and sanctuary for animals on the
outskirts of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, and her own lawn is usually crowded with
abandoned dogs and orphaned puppies.

<HEAD>New American Zoos: Cooped-Up Humans View Free-Roaming Beasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American zoos increasingly are becoming a place
where cooped-up humans view free-roaming beasts, and many
institutions are uniting to save endangered species and return them
to the wilderness.
   ``Animals aren't in cages any more. They're in spacious
enclosures, in a much more aesthetically pleasing environment,''
said <PERSON>Charles H. Hoessle</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Zoo</ORGANIZATION>. ``Modern
exhibits are being designed to cater to their behavioral needs.''
   The trend is evident at the new <LOCATION>Central Park Zoo</LOCATION>, where
wilderness has been duplicated in the heart of the city. The
revamped facility opens to the public on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Robert Wagner</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of
Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums, which grants accreditation, said
the new Central Park Zoo ``clearly depicts the latest state of the
art.''
   Experts at the zoo let the animals tell them what changes to
make. For example, sea lions from the <LOCATION>New York Aquarium</LOCATION> were
invited to work the kinks out of the new pool. And other zoos are
finding ways to keep their animals entertained.
   ``It's quite common in ape exhibits to put sunflower seeds on
the floor so animals have something to do to keep them occupied, or
artificial termite mounds with honey or mustard,'' said <PERSON>Marvin
Jones</PERSON>, registrar of the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>. ``It's a way of easing their
boredom.''
   Busch Gardens in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, was a trend-setter in <DATE>1965</DATE>,
enclosing visitors on a monorail while the gazelles and zebras
frolicked unfettered on 60 acres. In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, drive-through
parks proliferated.
   Since then, realistic settings have multiplied. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, the zoo
association's 132 members spent nearly <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> building or
renovating exhibits, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said. ``American zoos are in their
heyday,'' he said.
   ``The public has changed, due to television primarily. People
are able to see how animals live in the wild'' and expect no less
from zoos, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said.
   The Bronx Zoo's <LOCATION>Jungle World</LOCATION>, a 37,000-square-foot, indoor
microcosm opened in <DATE>1985</DATE>, boasts five waterfalls, a cloud machine,
100 species of tropical plants and 780 animals, including
endangered <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> mynah birds.
   In <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, school children and scholars can study ecology and
endangered species next <DATE>spring</DATE> while viewing one-celled animals and
a ``living model'' of a <LOCATION>Missouri Ozarks</LOCATION> stream at the zoo's new <MONEY>$16
million</MONEY>, 55,000-square-foot educational complex.
   Visitors in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> perch on a wooden observation platform, a la
safari, to experience the world's only naturalistic, multifamily
gorilla complex. The zoo was renovated after it lost accreditation
amid grisly stories of animal abuse.
   ``Where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage, fresh,
bubbling water and open sky, it makes us feel a whole lot better _
and as far as I know, the animals like it better,'' said <PERSON>Gerald S.
Lentz</PERSON>, zoological manager of <ORGANIZATION>Busch Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, which boasts 21 Asian
elephants and other endangered species among its 3,300 mammals,
birds and reptiles.
   Such amenities are necessary: zoos must breed more endangered
species _ while at the same time captivating public sentiment for
that cause.
   While animals aren't fooled by fake jungles or fields, the
wildlife settings ``help provide the visitor with a sense of
appreciation for the conservation of wild places,'' <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said.
   ``Zoos are becoming a last resort for vanishing species.
Municipal peoples, who are furthest from wildlife but who support
zoos, are ultimately beginning to play an ever larger role in
helping to sustain wildlife,'' said <PERSON>Dr. William Conway</PERSON>, director of
the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The new role of zoos is coming about because there are too
damn many people,'' <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> said. ``Within the next 20 or 30 years,
we will lose, at the very least, <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the remaining plant
and animal species on earth.''
   Zoos are not only focusing their efforts on breeding endangered
species, such as <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> condor program, but are
also educating the public about them.
   ``We don't give a darn if people know that Asian elephants have
the bigger ears and African elephants the smaller ears,'' <PERSON>Conway</PERSON>
said. ``But if they like elephants, they may reflect upon the
meaning of elephants the next time they tickle the ivory keys on
their piano that resulted in some elephant's death.''
   Zoo association members share endangered animals and
technologies. There are special breeding facilities operated in
Front Royal, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION>National Zoological Park</ORGANIZATION>; on <LOCATION>St.
Catherines Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Park</ORGANIZATION>, and the
Zoological Park of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> society's <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Conservation International</ORGANIZATION> sponsors scientists in 35 countries.
   There also is a zoo movement in reverse. In <DATE>November</DATE>, zoo
association members shipped endangered mynah birds back to <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION>,
where agricultural development had gobbled their native rain
forests. Early reports are that the program is a success, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>
said.
   Similar successes have occurred with the return of black buck
antelopes to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>; tamarin monkeys to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, and Arabian
oryxes, another type of antelope, to <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION>, he said.
   ``There is no substitute for nature,'' <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> said. ``We seek,
instead, to be a salesman for nature.''

<P>
A DEFORMITY IN A GIRAFFE'S NECK HAS BECOME A LEADING ATTRACTION AT THE SANTA 
BARBARA ZOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard the one about the giraffe with a sore throat? Try the one about 
the giraffe with a kink in her neck. 
</P>
<P>
It's no joke to the people at the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara Zoo</LOCATION>. They're baffled by the 
very noticeable zigzag halfway up the neck of the 4-year-old female giraffe. 
</P>
<P>
It's so striking that the gangly animal has become one of the newer attractions 
at the zoo. A sign at the giraffe enclosure even points out the bizarre 
deformity and assures observers the animal is in no pain and that zoo 
veterinarians are monitoring her. 
</P>
<P>
"Our veterinarian contacted other giraffe keepers and no one had heard of 
anything like it," said <PERSON>Nancy Hollenbeck</PERSON>, assistant director of the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
To find out conclusively what is wrong would require that the giraffe be 
anesthetized and X-rayed, she said. That poses a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> risk of death, and 
zoo officials decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
"She walks normally, she eats normally, and she shows no sign of pain," said 
<PERSON>Hollenbeck</PERSON>. The current theory is that it's a muscle contraction that grew 
progressively worse until last <DATE>summer</DATE> and now seems to have stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The giraffe's crooked neck isn't the only new oddity for visitors at the zoo. A 
pair of tapirs recently arrived from <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> to take up residence at 
the zoo. The giant hog-like animals with their long flexible snouts wallow in 
muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
They're far from cute, but the male and female are starting to show an interest 
in each other, and that's good news to zoo officials. The tapirs, relatives of 
the rhinoceros, are an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
There's always something new to see at the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara Zoo</LOCATION> no matter how many 
times you've been there. Because it's a small, compact zoo, it's an easy place 
to take children. The entire 81-acre grounds can be covered in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Located on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, the <LOCATION>Santa Ynez Mountains</LOCATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Clark Bird Refuge</ORGANIZATION>, it's more than a zoo. The garden-like grounds make it a 
horticultural paradise, especially with the addition of a new cactus garden. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's small, the zoo is home to more than 150 kinds of animals -- rare 
animals like the lesser panda, the black and white ruffed lemur, and the golden 
lion tamarin. 
</P>
<P>
It has the usual sampling of elephants, lions, sea lions, monkeys, snakes, and 
a large collection of birds including the rare <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> mynah and a flock of 
flamingos. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest exhibits is the nocturnal hall, a dark setting for the 
animals of the night who sleep during the day. Special lighting reverses night 
and day for the animals and makes it possible to see the night monkey and 
<PERSON>Geoffroy</PERSON>'s cat as they skitter around glassed-in enclosures that look like 
their natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The spookiest exhibit in the nocturnal hall is the re-creation of an old mine 
shaft that is home to a swarm of bats that cling to the beams and flutter 
around as the sounds of the night are piped in. 
</P>
<P>
For children, there's a lot to do at the zoo. A miniature train takes riders on 
a one-mile spin around the zoo grounds. A playground comes in handy when the 
kids need a break from the animals. Or, the children can buy crackers in the 
gift shop and feed the goats in the farmyard exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN: The <LOCATION>Santa Barbara Zoo</LOCATION> is open daily from <TIME>10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TIME>, and 
from <DATE>June 11 through Sept. 3</DATE> (Labor Day) from <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m</TIME>. The elephant 
training demonstrations are usually at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> and the sea lions are generally 
fed at <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> Admission is <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$2</MONEY> for senior citizens and children 2 
to 12 years, and free for those under 2 years. For more information call 
962-5339.

SANTA ANA ZOO MOUNTS A SWEET SAFARI

<TEXT>
<P>
Cookies and critters are among children's favorite things, and on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 
<DATE>Sept. 22</DATE>, little ones can get a bellyful of both at the <LOCATION>Santa Ana Zoo</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cookie 
Safari</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, young adventurers will be given a "passport" to visit the 13 
"cookie stations" scattered throughout the zoo grounds. At each, children can 
sample goodies from cookie giants such as <ORGANIZATION>Pepperidge Farms</ORGANIZATION>, Sunshine and 
<ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>. After adding a stamp to their passports, they will wind past some of 
the zoo's 350 exhibited animals to the next outpost. With a full passport (and 
a fuller tummy), children will return to the zoo gift shop and receive a prize. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Jacqueline Beurskens</PERSON>, program director of the Friends of the <LOCATION>Santa 
Ana Zoo</LOCATION>, the facility's support group, this fourth annual event serves as both 
a fund-raiser and a "friend-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
"The zoo is 38 years old, yet a lot of people in this area don't know we're 
here," <PERSON>Beurskens</PERSON> said. "So we came up with a family event that would be fun for 
everyone and help raise community awareness." Last year's <ORGANIZATION>Cookie Safari</ORGANIZATION> 
attracted about 3,000 visitors and raised <MONEY>$19,000</MONEY> for the zoo's general fund, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only one-third of the zoo's 20-acre site is dedicated to animal 
exhibits, but plans are in the works for a large-scale expansion and 
improvements. One of the items on the drawing board is <LOCATION>Monkey Island</LOCATION>, an 
open-air display featuring colobus monkeys and tiny duiker antelope. The zoo's 
collection now features 16 species of monkeys, as well as mountain lions, 
birds, reptiles and a small children's area with barnyard animals. Larger, more 
exotic animals will be added when space and funding allows. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, organizers also plan to do away with the outdated 
enclosures which house many of the animals. "Whenever possible, we're trying to 
get our animals out of cages and into more natural settings" similar to those 
at the much-larger <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Beurskens</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
At the <DATE>Sept. 22</DATE> event, a handful of furry and feathered folk will be brought 
out of their cages for a little kid-to-critter contact. Zoo personnel will 
answer questions and supervise handling of the animals. Also scheduled are 
animal shows, face painting, a kiddie train and carousel and entertainment by 
clowns and jugglers. The zoo's playground will also be open throughout the day. 
Food and drink will be sold, and <PERSON>Rico Garcia</PERSON> and the Local Boys will play Latin 
jazz from <TIME>11 a.m. to 3 p.m.</TIME>

HOW TO ADOPT AN ANIMAL AT THE SANTA ANA ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Always wanted a swamp wallaby? Would you love to have a white-handed gibbon to 
call your very own? You can, through the Something Wild animal adoption program 
sponsored by the Friends of the <LOCATION>Santa Ana Zoo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old program allows people to choose an animal on exhibit at the zoo 
to adopt. Even the animals that roam the grounds, such as peafowls, and the 
pond animals -- Japanese koi and western pond turtles -- are available for 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 75 animals at the zoo, according to <PERSON>Pat Taylor</PERSON>, executive 
director of the Friends of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana Zoo</ORGANIZATION> (a nonprofit agency that creates 
awareness of and raises funds for the zoo). 
</P>
<P>
The animals are divided into native land categories, as well as aviary, 
barnyard and education animals. They range from the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> king snake to 
the Toco toucan, from the red-backed squirrel monkey to the African-crested 
porcupine. 
</P>
<P>
The adoptions are tax deductible, <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said, adding that many people choose 
to give the adoption as a gift.

<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, oh best beloved, there was a summer school for all the wild 
animals of the field and forest, veldt and savanna, water hole and river 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The school was at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> east of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, where 250 
animal species, 47 of them endangered, roam over 700 spacious acres in the dry, 
sunny <LOCATION>San Pasqual Valley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <DATE>summer</DATE> school was for the birds -- and for the tigers, gorillas, 
wildebeests, rhinos and, yes, even for weak and puny man cubs. And for their 
parents, too. But at this school, the animals were the teachers and the 
students were the humans. 
</P>
<P>
The school was such a success and the humans learned so quickly that the 
animals got together and voted to continue the program. (Let the record show 
that the giraffes had to be bribed with carrots and that <PERSON>Gainda</PERSON>, the Indian 
rhinoceros, demanded more quality petting time.) 
</P>
<P>
So once again this <DATE>summer</DATE>, from now through <DATE>August</DATE>, the Wild Animal Park is 
offering one-, two-, three- and five-morning classes for youngsters from Grade 
1 through high school. The emphasis is on hands-on learning. Students join 
teachers, staff biologists and keepers to pet, feed, count, look at, listen to 
and -- most important -- learn about the creatures whose world we share. 
</P>
<P>
And for adults? They haven't been forgotten. From now through <DATE>September</DATE>, animal 
admirers and wildlife photographers ages 12 and up can sign up for special 
family and photo caravan safaris into the huge exhibits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These open-air, bumpy expeditions, with 10 guests and two guides standing in 
the back of a truck, spend a couple of hours driving on the dirt roads through 
four of the park's five major habitats, the East and South African, and the 
<LOCATION>Asian Plains</LOCATION> and Asian Waterhole, about 320 acres in all. The guides stop the 
truck at various places to talk about the different animals and hand out 
carrots and apples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Taste of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"The caravans are a little taste of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Larry Killmar</PERSON>, curator of 
mammals. "They're not so rugged or stressful as a safari in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, but they 
get the people down close." 
</P>
<P>
Right! One minute you're adjusting your sunglasses, the next you're looking up 
to see three tons of beady-eyed rhino barreling up to the truck. Then he -- or 
she -- stops and thrusts that huge wrinkled face and rubbery lips right next to 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to shriek or faint. Yech -- kissed by a rhino! Instead, hand over 
an apple and grab your camera. This is a rare chance to shoot wildlife photos 
from a distance of six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your telephoto lens too, to snap candids of this year's crop of shy 
babies. Says <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON>, who has been with the park since it opened in <DATE>1972</DATE>: 
"<DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>August</DATE> is the heavy calving season. We can have as many as eight 
births in a day -- they happen right out there in the exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
If feeding fruit to rhinos seems unnatural when the park's goal is to create an 
authentic living setting for the animals, you are right. And when excessive 
contact with humans does interfere with the animals' social group behavior, 
park biologists eschew it. 
</P>
<P>
But, <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON> says, offering treats to unpredictable and easily spooked Indian 
rhinos is the safest way to manage these 6,000-pound creatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiarity Breeds Friendship 
</P>
<P>
"From day one we get the rhino calves used to touching by the keepers," <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON> 
says. "If you give them apples and carrots and goodies, they'll do anything for 
you. This allows us to move them around -- even crate them -- without using any 
tranquilizers." 
</P>
<P>
Each caravan has its own surprises. On a recent outing, Wild Animal Park 
spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> spotted a newly laid ostrich egg lying on the muddy river 
bank. The eggs are a favorite target for hawks, so he stopped to collect it. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors handed it around and agreed it felt large, heavy and very hard. 
Just the right size for an omelet, someone commented. "Do you know how to cook 
an ostrich egg?" Hanscom asked. "You put the egg and a rock in a pot of boiling 
water. When the rock's done, so is the egg." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters coming to the park from the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> area usually are dropped off 
by their parents or ride the bus from <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, but residents of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
probably will find that the park is too far for a daily drive. 
</P>
<P>
A solution is to enroll the child in a one-day class (held each <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME>) and combine it with an all-day family visit to the park. Human cubs, 
grades one through six, join a "Wild Walkabout," visiting koalas and kangaroos 
and all the other strange fauna and flora from the Down Under continent, while 
students in grades seven to 12 enroll in the class called "Close Enough to 
Touch," similar to the photo caravans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Budding Zoologists 
</P>
<P>
The older students actually accompany the keepers into the exhibits, through 
double-chain-link gates to help feed and count the zebras and gazelles and feel 
the giraffe's warm breath when it bends down for a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
If a budding zoologist begs for a three-day class, consider a mini-vacation for 
the family at one of the golf and leisure resorts east of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> or motel 
accommodations in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Start a day at the Wild Animal Park with a ride on the <PERSON>Wgasa Bush</PERSON> Line 
monorail. The monorail runs around the hills above the major habitats and 
provides an overview of the 2,500 animals that live behind special fencing 
called "inrigging." 
</P>
<P>
The fencing isn't all that tall, but it has a tremendous overhang at the top. 
As our monorail tour guide <PERSON>Becky Boomer</PERSON> announced: "The animals get up next to 
the fence and look up. When they see something over their heads, they think 
they can't jump out." 
</P>
<P>
On the ride, keep an eye out for a family of wild golden eagles circling 
overhead. The eagles are a few of the wild birds that have taken up residence 
in the surrounding hilltops and are getting fat on the gophers and mice that 
help themselves to animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
"We call them locals," <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> says, explaining that the Wild Animal Park 
spends between <MONEY>$41,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$46,000</MONEY> monthly on animal food. The grocery bill 
would be higher, but the park actually grows some of its own browse food, such 
as eucalyptus, on the park's 1,800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
After the ride, visitors walk around the 1 1/4-mile <ORGANIZATION>Kilimanjaro Trail</ORGANIZATION> for a 
closer look into the special, smaller exhibits: the <LOCATION>Sumatran</LOCATION> tiger's woody 
hollow, the elephant enclosure, the lowland gorilla's lair and the cheetah's 
grassy plain. The animals are fascinating to watch, but their presence points 
to the Wild Animal Park's real purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Coloration 
</P>
<P>
The park's protective coloration -- the <LOCATION>Nairobi Village</LOCATION>'s thatched snack bar, 
outdoor cafe, T-shirt shop, souvenir store, live animal shows, the petting 
kraal -- is designed like a theme park to attract humans. But, <ORGANIZATION>Hanscom</ORGANIZATION> says, 
the park's real purpose is 'to breed endangered species, and to study breeding 
problems of animals in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says, researchers discovered that flamingos wouldn't lay 
fertilized eggs unless there were at least 100 birds in the flock. "It's the 
number that seems to click the hormones and make them go," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Southern White Rhino . . . for years, the two in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo 
just ignored each other. Then they brought 20 females out here to the animal 
park and moved the male out here to retire, but all he needed was space and a 
harem. In 11 years, he sired 65 calves." 
</P>
<P>
However, numbers aren't always a determining factor. There are cheetahs in the 
wilds, but genetic studies reveal that they're very inbred, probably because 
they live in isolated family groups. As a result, many females are sterile or 
there's a high infant mortality. So the park is breeding cheetahs with better 
genes, then making them available to other zoos. 
</P>
<P>
The park's <DATE>summer</DATE> programs are scheduled almost every day of the week. Photo 
caravans run on <DATE>Wednesday, Thursday</DATE>, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE> afternoons from <DATE>May 
through September</DATE>. Groups of 10 booking together can go any day. Each caravan 
is 1 3/4 hours long; tickets are <MONEY>$50</MONEY> for adults 16 and older and <MONEY>$35</MONEY> for 
children 12-15 with an adult. Children under 12 are not permitted on this 
caravan. The East African and the Asian Plains caravan leaves at <TIME>2:30 p.m</TIME>. The 
caravan to the South African habitat and the Asian Waterhole leaves at <TIME>4:30 
p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
You can take both tours for a full 3 1/2-hour safari; <MONEY>$75</MONEY> for adults and <MONEY>$50</MONEY> 
for children. Because <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> members get a big discount 
on all special tours, it may be possible to save money by joining the zoo at 
the time you enroll. The photo caravans always are sold out and must be booked 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Caravans are similar to photo caravans but emphasize learning about 
and visiting family groups of animals rather than photography. They run <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
evenings from 5:30 to <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> Tickets are <MONEY>$55</MONEY> for one adult with one child, and 
<MONEY>$80</MONEY> for one adult with two children. Children must be 8 or older and be with an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day <DATE>summer</DATE> school runs <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE> from 9 to <TIME>11:30 a.m.</TIME>, 
with a separate class for each grade level from 1 to 9. The three-day 
summer-school program runs <DATE>Monday, Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>1 
p.m</TIME>. The fee is <MONEY>$50</MONEY> and five different classes serve different grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day program runs each <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> and costs <MONEY>$22</MONEY> 
to <MONEY>$35</MONEY>. Different classes are designed for three age groups. 
</P>
<P>
The "Keeper Connection" is a two-session career exploration class for 
10th-to-12th graders who are considering animal-related careers. The fee is 
<MONEY>$50</MONEY>; the first session in <DATE>August</DATE> is on the 11th, and participants have a choice 
for the second second sesssion of any day between <DATE>Aug. 14</DATE> and 18. 
</P>
<P>
You can enroll by telephone and pay by credit card. Call the <ORGANIZATION>Summer School 
Hotline</ORGANIZATION> at (619) 740-9383, or the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> at (619) 236-0163. You also can 
write to the <ORGANIZATION>Summer School</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 551, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
92112-0551, but expect a several-week processing delay. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Park hours are <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> through <DATE>Sept. 4</DATE> (Labor Day), and <TIME>9 
a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> after. The park is 30 miles north of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on Interstate 15, 
then east on Highway 78. From <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> take Interstate 5 south to <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>, 
then <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 78 east to the park. A ticket package (entrance, monorail ride, 
animal shows and exhibits) is <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$6.20</MONEY> for ages 3-15, ages 2 
and under free. Stroller and wheelchair rentals are available. No pets, please; 
the wild animals frown on it.

<HEAD>A Very Social Animal is Missing - or Worse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifth <PERSON>Avenue Phyllis</PERSON>, known as Fifth Avenue <PERSON>Phil</PERSON>
until the birth of her three babies, is the only groundhog ever to
move voluntarily into the Central Park Zoo. But now this very
social animal is missing - or worse.
   The outgoing woodchuck, who scampers up to people outside her
hole under the Children's Zoo and begs for Italian ice, hot dogs
and pretzels, has been gone almost two months. Some of her friends
are sure she was killed by a car.
   ``We're still holding out hope,'' zookeeper <PERSON>Herb Clement</PERSON> said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``She's been gone before. She's not your everyday
groundhog.''
   The plump brown beast first made the pages of <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when she dug a hole near a driveway at the Children's Zoo
and set up housekeeping.
   Clement called it ``a case of reverse adoption,'' and, ignorant
of the groundhog's sex, dubbed her Fifth Avenue <PERSON>Phil</PERSON>.
   The groundhog may have been attracted by a crab apple tree that
dropped its fruit on the driveway, and by the grass and weeds in
front of the zoo entrance. But far better eating, the beast soon
realized, was hers for the asking.
   ``Groundhogs can get used to people after awhile, but she really
stepped forward,'' <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> recalled. ``She'd walk out among the
crowds and literally join them for lunch.''
   But it wasn't just the food; this groundhog was truly
gregarious.
   ``She would walk right up to you, rise up on her hind legs, and
rest her paws on your leg,'' said <PERSON>Virginia Ferguson</PERSON>, a neighborhood
resident.
   ``She was a New Yorker first,'' <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> agreed, ``and a
groundhog second. She wasn't even afraid of dogs.''
   A woman known to zoo regulars as the Groundhog Lady taught
<PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON> to come out of her burrow on cue and perform tricks. She
would sit on the woman's lap and hold a banana as the woman peeled
it; she would beg on her hind legs for bits of cookie.
   Phyllis delighted her admirers with a litter of three pups, then
chilled them by the ruthlessness with which all groundhogs root
their brood out of the hole.
   Phyllis again made the <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, when <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> wrote a
letter to the editor citing ``the remarkable groundhog <PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON>'' as
an example of ``<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s native wildlife.''
   The woodchuck, he explained, had gone far beyond her species'
traditional claim to fame - the prediction of winter's length - and
became ``the only groundhog to have voluntarily taken up residence
in a zoo.''
   Phyllis became a bigger attraction than most of the animals who
joined the zoo involuntarily. ``People come by to look for her, and
if she isn't around, they want to know why,'' <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> said.
``They're quite insistent.''
   Whenever there was a parade on Fifth Avenue, <PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON> would walk
along the wall between the avenue and the park, looking for
leftovers.
   But the groundhog disappeared at the end of <DATE>July</DATE>, and on <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>
<PERSON>Virginia Ferguson</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Donald</PERSON>, was jogging in the park when
he saw the body of a groundhog in the road. It had been run over;
it was, he believed, <PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Ferguson</PERSON> wrote this announcement and posted it near the
gate:
   ``To those watching for her
   She is gone
   She was killed by a car
   We all miss her.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Ferguson</PERSON> also spent <MONEY>$75</MONEY> on a 5-by-7-foot black and silver
plaque that will be placed this week on a wall near the groundhog's
old hole.
   It reads: ``In affectionate tribute to a remarkably friendly and
tame groundhog. The original Fifth Avenue <PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON>.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>David Shepherdson</PERSON>'s job is to take the boredom out
of life for the animals at the <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION>, putting something more
into their day than sleeping, eating and watching humans.
   He has piped gibbon music into the the gibbon cage.
   For the mongooses, he has provided pieces of hollow wood filled
with crickets for the animals to try to catch. ``Cricket
dispensers,'' he calls them.
   He plans a light-and-sound show for the orangutans.
   The lanky 28-year-old Englishman, whose doctoral thesis had him
tracking wild badgers by radio at night, became behavioral
enrichment officer six months ago at the <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION>, the first
British zoo to have one.
   Believing a little work for the animals is healthy, too,
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> is making some species work for their dinners.
   ``Zoos should show the animal as it behaves in the wild,'' he
said. ``For example, in the wild, most species spend more than <PERCENT>50
percent</PERCENT> of their time foraging for food. ... In the zoo, they get
fed once a day.
   ``You have a choice _ either change the environment, or you
don't keep the animals properly.''
   <PERSON>Trevor Paul</PERSON>, director of research at the <ORGANIZATION>Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare</ORGANIZATION>, the independent body co-sponsoring
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON>'s post, says the project also works well for people who
visit the zoo.
   ``There isn't a great deal of point in them seeing an animal
sitting in a corner behind bars,'' he said.
   He and <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> say that while zoos in many countries are
making cages more natural, few have spent much time studying animal
behavior in relation to their habitats.
   The 161-year-old <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo's gibbon monkeys never did much
loafing in their tree-lined outdoor enclosure, but with the change
in their zoo habitat they've become much more feisty.
   Gibbons usually have one mate for life and assert their
territory by singing. <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo's pair weren't as musical as they
should have been until <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> hung stereo speakers near their
cage and played taped gibbon duets twice a day.
   Thinking they have neighbors, the gibbons now sing, too.
   Shepherdson is also working on a computer keyboard to produce
sounds, food or even slide shows when orangutans operate it.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> said an electronic organ failed to excite the apes, ``so
we'll try to get a keyboard which does more things than produce
sound.''
   Simple toys, often involving food, are best for most animals,
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> said.
   He had praise for <PERSON>Hal Markowitz</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> behavioral enrichment
pioneer who installed a machine to toss meatballs into a serval's
cage, but added that he believes more naturalistic tools should be
explored.
   Recently <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> equipped the ring-tailed lemurs' cage with
poles that sway like the trees in the primates' native <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> said one of the best ways to simulate natural behavior ``is
to make an animal work for its food (and) spend normal amounts of
time foraging.''
   In the kinkajous' cage, carrots, bananas and apples hang from
the ceiling, some tantalizingly out of reach for the weasel-like
creatures.
   Before getting the snacks, the female paced for hours _ one of
the first signs of boredom, said <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON>, watching as she
pursued a banana just beyond nose-reach.
   ``Even tortoises pace, I'm told,'' <PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON> added. ``It's not
a lack of space, it's what you have in that space that's
important.''
   After a cage is outfitted, zoo workers watch the animals for
hours to see how they respond.
   ``In every case so far, there's been a beneficial effect,'' said
<PERSON>Shepherdson</PERSON>. ``If every zoo in the country did these things, it
would be a great step forward in animal welfare.''

customers who, for benign and not so benign reasons, go for exotic
animals, even on a dinner plate. The trend bothers the increasingly
active animal rights groups and others who are disposed to raise
moral as well as ecological issues.

Friends of the <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> Zoo tossed a party last week in the courtyard outside 
Prego restaurant in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, drawing about 100 guests at <MONEY>$40</MONEY> each for no-host 
cocktails and a buffet of Italian specialties. The benefit raised <MONEY>$5,500</MONEY> toward 
the construction of <LOCATION>Monkey Island</LOCATION> -- an 18,000-square-foot, cageless habitat to 
be built next year. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is to be the first of 50 major projects planned for the zoo, said 
<LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Daniel H. Young</PERSON>, who sipped red wine and pressed the flesh of 
his constituents. Young said the zoo board has a master plan that calls for 
approximately <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> in construction and renovations at the city-owned 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate private funding for <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of that," said <PERSON>Young</PERSON>, "so we're probably 
talking about a 10-year plan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Monkey Business 
</P>
<P>
H Iko</ORGANIZATION> -- a 5-year-old squirrel monkey on a leash. The handlers (from <LOCATION>Pacific 
Animal Productions</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>) gave each guest a sunflower seed to feed shy 
Iko, who reached into strangers' hands for the treat, then scampered back up to 
perch on familiar shoulders.

Animal Attractions 
</P>
<P>
Also there were Cleo the constrictor, <PERSON>Marcy</PERSON> the opossum, Pedro the parrot, Iggy 
the iguana, Barney the barn owl and a pygmy hedgehog named Spot. "These animals 
are really used to all the attention," said zoo volunteer <PERSON>Elta Chapman</PERSON>, who, 
with staffer <PERSON>Karen Cress Cribbs</PERSON>, brought the animals out of their cages one at 
a time and held them. "This is like our little movable petting zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Zoo board members <PERSON>Judy Fluor-Runels</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bradd Linn</PERSON> stroked <PERSON>Marcy</PERSON>'s shaggy fur 
as Fluor-Runels asked about possum diet, sleep habits and behavior. "So will 
she have babies or no?" Fluor-Runels asked in conclusion. (No, <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said.) 
</P>
<P>
Checking out Barney the owl, <PERSON>Karen Amies</PERSON> joked about the thick feathers in the 
center of his face. "How would you like to get up in the morning and brush your 
nose?" she asked her husband, <LOCATION>Grif</LOCATION>. (Not much, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Marilyn Sion</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Sharon Ballidis</ORGANIZATION> reached out and touched Cleo the constrictor, 
and <ORGANIZATION>Sion</ORGANIZATION> talked about her two grown daughters' having done volunteer work at 
the zoo when they were teens. "They were always very animal-oriented," <PERSON>Sion</PERSON> 
said. "It was a great experience for them. They learned how important the 
hands-on part of the job was -- and they loved taking the animals out of their 
cages and communicating with them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buffet 
</P>
<P>
Iko settled for sunflower seeds, but the guests dug into a spread that included 
radicchio salad, prosciutto pizza, garlic rosemary bread, grilled shrimp with 
feta in a vinaigrette sauce, grilled eggplant and pasta in vodka cream sauce. 
For dessert: espresso-soaked ladyfingers, Mascarpone cheese, rum and cocoa.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Mobile Guide:
   London Zoo Is Closing Down?

   London -- When the British find that they have no further
use for one of their institutions, their first thought is
often to send it to America, as they did with the Queen Mary.
In the case of London Zoo, however, this solution does not
appear to be available. The Central Park Zoo, for example,
has problems of its own, as do many zoos that are dependent
on municipal funding.
   Still, London Zoo is special. In the first place, there is
its literary celebrity, as in Hilaire Belloc's "Jim, Who Ran
Away From His Nurse, &amp; Was Eaten by a Lion" (moral: "always
keep a-hold of Nurse/For fear of finding something worse"),
which is set at London Zoo, as is the late Sir Angus Wilson's
"The Old Men at the Zoo," in which the animals in Regent's
Park even survive a nuclear war. And there is "A Man in the
Zoo" by Bloomsbury Group member David ("Bunny") Garnett, in
which a spurned lover offers himself to the zoo, and is
accepted, for exhibition as a specimen of Homo sapiens.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the second place, <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION> is architecturally
significant. It is chock full of protected, "listed"
buildings. When I visited the zoo recently, the koala bears
who now inhabit <ORGANIZATION>Bertold Lubertkin</ORGANIZATION>'s listed <ORGANIZATION>Gorilla House</ORGANIZATION>
(<DATE>1933</DATE>) were as somnolent as ever, and the penguins in the
same architect's listed abstract sculptural Penguin Pool
(<DATE>1934</DATE>) seemed to be suffering as much as the visitors from
the unseasonable <DATE>June</DATE> chill. The birds in <PERSON>Lord Snowdon</PERSON>'s
as-yet-unlisted aviary were almost grounded by the cold, and
the elephants were huddled for warmth in Sir <PERSON>Hugh Casson</PERSON>'s
modern and still-unlisted <ORGANIZATION>Elephant House</ORGANIZATION>. I couldn't see what
was going on in <PERSON>Decimus Burton</PERSON>'s listed Giraffe and <ORGANIZATION>Hippo
House</ORGANIZATION> (1836), and the monkeys and apes were sheltering from
the weather in their houses opposite his listed II Clock
Tower (1830).
   Finally, some of the animals in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo are unusual.
When I visited, <LOCATION>Chia Chia</LOCATION> the giant panda was in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>,
where it was hoped he could be persuaded to father a new
entry in the international giant panda stud book, which is
overseen by <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Zoo's <PERSON>Jo Gipps</PERSON>. He also looks after the
breeding records of the golden lion tamarin (a small South
American squirrel monkey) and those of Sumatran tigers. His
two pairs of young Asian lions are particularly important, in
view of the recent discovery that the captive population of
Asian lions in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is made up not of purebreds, but of
animals that have at some point acquired an admixture of
African-lion bloodlines.
   Not counting insects, there are 8,000 animals at the
"mother of zoos" (it opened in <DATE>1826</DATE>) that will have to be
rehoused or disposed of if it closes, as is now threatened,
in <DATE>September 1992</DATE>. There is obviously an element of
brinkmanship in the posture of the new director general,
<PERSON>David Jones</PERSON>, and the zoo's treasurer, <LOCATION>Lord Peyton</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Yeovil</LOCATION>.
The zoo is losing approximately <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> a year, has cash
reserves of only <MONEY>$8.25 million</MONEY>, and doesn't seem able to
attract the 1.4 million visitors it needs every year to stay
in the black. In <DATE>1988</DATE> the government gave it a
once-and-for-all grant of <MONEY>$16.5 million</MONEY>, and <PERSON>Michael
Heseltine</PERSON>, the minister for the environment, and his junior
minister, <PERSON>David Trippier</PERSON>, are standing pat.
   In this zoo poker game <PERSON>Mr. Trippier</PERSON> is now claiming that
his ministry is reflecting the most up-to-date thinking about
zoos -- that such urban institutions are unsuitable, even
immoral, from a conservation point of view. His critics say
it is hypocritical of the government to latch onto the
prejudices of animal-rights activists. Lord <PERSON>Peyton</PERSON>,
meanwhile, has called the ministry's bluff by hinting that it
will be the Department of the Environment's fault if the
animals have to be put down.
   The British, as is well-known, are wacko about animals.
Old ladies really do leave their fortunes to cat and dog
homes. The government has to call a general election within
the next year, and as the Tory newspaper the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>
said in a recent editorial, "The zoo's directors know that no
government facing an election in the next few months could
face doing so against a background of mass executions of
animals taking place a few miles north of Westminster."
Perhaps it is malicious to suggest that this was the reason
that the deadline for closing the zoo was just moved ahead to
<DATE>1992</DATE>.
   Of course, the zoo may not close at all, if sufficient
funds can be raised. But it is perhaps not too early to think
about what the worst case would entail. <PERSON>Auberon Waugh</PERSON>, in his
column in the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> (the Conservatives are much
more exercised about the issue than is the <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>), has
made two modest proposals. As nobody would actually want to
buy a bunch of gorillas, kangaroos and alligators, why not
make the zoo into a temporary game park? Encourage Japanese
and American businessmen to stalk and shoot whatever animals
they choose, photograph them with their trophies, then take
the game away and "give it to the poor to eat." The rarest
species, "strange birds, as well as flying foxes, koalas and
centipedes," should be kept for a great <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> gastronomic
festival, "where Britons can taste delicacies from all over
the world, which they might otherwise miss from their life's
experience."

FT  22 AUG 92 / Travel: Life and death in an ocean of emptiness - With the
lions of Ngorongoro, in Tanzania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON tip-toe, and with a smiling frown on her broad fawn face, the lioness
danced playfully away from the white-tailed mongoose. This valiant animal,
little bigger than a cat and with a white plume of a tail, repeatedly leaped
at the lioness's chin, snickering with anger as he did so.
The lioness stepped aside. As the mongoose made to run off, his tail like a
beacon in the flat grey light of morning, she flicked out a dinner-plate paw
and swept his feet from under him. The mongoose lay winded for a moment.
As he got up, a second lioness came to tease him further. Like domestic cats
with a shrew, they had no intention of eating their captive, merely of
having a good time.
But this was a terminal mongoose. His chattering so excited one lioness that
she playfully picked him up and tossed him a few feet through the air. He
was dead before he hit the ground.
These were just three of the 100 or so lions which are packed into the
Ngorongoro Crater in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, for they live there at the very high density
of about one to the square mile. As a result, they are remarkably easy to
see but, like lions everywhere, they spend most of their time doing very
little.
To watch interesting lion activity you have to be out early or stay late,
which was possible when I was there (late <DATE>March</DATE>), when camping on the crater
floor was officially forbidden. That white-tailed mongoose met his end at
6.30am only 500 yards from our camp just a few days before the ban was
announced. From now on, you will have to rise very much earlier in order to
tackle the tortuous and hour-long descent to the crater floor to be in time
to catch some of this action.
By way of compensation, the Tanzanian government has allowed the
construction of a fourth lodge on the crater rim and a fifth is to follow,
offering between 200 and 400 more bed spaces. To avoid saturation of the
crater floor, access will be rationed by permit with the intention of
encouraging more people to explore the rest of the 3,200-square-mile
Ngorongoro conservation area which lies between the crater and <LOCATION>Serengeti</LOCATION>
national park.
It is an ocean of short grass plains, apparently endless, gently rolling - a
daunting space. Occasionally there is an island, a rounded granite hillock
exfoliating like an old, tired onion with a growth of whistling thorns and
characteristic umbrella acacias to give shade. These are havens for
predators which occasionally sally forth like pirates to make a raid on
passing prey.
In contrast to the crater, which has permanent water and a mosaic of
habitats and thus contains remarkable concentrations of mammals and birds,
the conservation area appears to be empty. But this is a trick of the
landscape, for its vastness, stretching in every direction, is deceptive,
giving the illusion of a much reduced quantity of game.
In fact, these plains were full of life during my visit, which took place
when the rains were imminent. The herbivores had given birth and the place
was bouncing with wildebeest calves, young <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>'s gazelles, zebra colts
and a host of other species.
Then strings of wildebeest set off to follow the rain. Files of animals
perhaps two or three miles in length came over the far horizon as a tiny
cloud of dust and after 20 minutes or so were barely distinguishable with
binoculars. At that distance they looked almost like North American plains
bison in a western.
Shortly, though, they were passing close at hand, walking, trotting,
cantering, walking again - cow, calf, cow, calf, making that strange
bleating sound and carving yet another groove across the plain. Crossing
these paths is like driving over the lines in a railway marshalling yard.
Gibbs Farm Safaris is run by <PERSON>Nigel Perks</PERSON>, a tall, broad Kiwi fed a love for
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> on a childhood diet of <PERSON>David Attenborough</PERSON>'s Zoo Quest programmes.
From our camp moored against a large rock (you have to link your camp to
something out there - simply to plonk a tent down on the open plain would be
terrifying), we set out every day without coming across another vehicle.
<PERSON>Nigel</PERSON> had an uncanny knack of foretelling what we would see and, with an
excellent eye for wildlife, ensured that the list included both serval and
African wild cat.
On the last day we were to have the privilege of joining a group visiting
Olduvai gorge, which also lies within the richly-endowed conservation area,
in the company of <PERSON>Mary Leakey</PERSON>. Looking round a kopje on the way we found a
dozing cheetah. With time to spare we sat and watched.
The cat lay warming on the rocks and gradually came to life. Cheetahs hunt
by sight, generally in the mornings, so we waited a little longer. Soon it
bounded nonchalantly from the rocks and strode casually on to the grass.
Here it stood for a while and then sat like a large china spotted cat. In
the distance were a group of gambolling, grazing <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>'s gazelles, too
far to stalk.
The cheetah flopped on the grass and stared glassily towards the horizon. A
faint hint of grey dust suggested approaching wildebeest.
The tension in the Land Rover was palpable. Wildebeest after wildebeest went
by. Perhaps we had mistaken the cheetah's intentions. But suddenly it was
flying; there was dust, panic, confusion, running hooves, a walking cheetah
 -it had missed.
Like cars on a packed motorway, wildebeest on the move speed up, slow down,
run, walk, trot, stop, canter, all for no apparent reason. The ones towards
the back had no idea why those further up were making haste and no inkling
that the cheetah was back in doormat mode.
This time there were no mistakes. We saw a spotted buff explosion, a pall of
dust and the waving chestnut legs of a wildebeest calf as the life was
suffocated out of it. We never did get to Olduvai.
<PERSON>Michael Woods</PERSON>' safari to the Ngorongoro conservation area in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> with
<PERSON>Gibb</PERSON>'s Farm Safaris was arranged by <ORGANIZATION>Art Of Travel of 268 Lavender Hill</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW11 1LJ, tel: 071-738-2038. <ORGANIZATION>Gibb's Farm Safaris</ORGANIZATION> is based at <ORGANIZATION>Gibb</ORGANIZATION>'s
Farm, a lodge between <LOCATION>Lake Manyara</LOCATION> national park and the crater which is
linked to <ORGANIZATION>Ndutu</ORGANIZATION>, a second lodge on the edge of the short grass plains.

<TEXT>     It's Oxton Kennels and Exotics Wild Things, where there are enough animals
to stock a small zoo -- including a 500-pound lion, a 600-pound tiger, a
250-pound black bear, a baboon, monkeys, birds of prey, snakes and alligators.
There's also <PERSON>Clyde</PERSON>, a 7-foot dromedary camel.;    The kennel is owned by
<PERSON>Charlie Sammut</PERSON>, who grew up in Salinas loving animals. With the help of
<PERSON>Christy Ingram</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sammut</PERSON> trains wild animals for work in motion pictures,
television programs, ads and photo sessions.;    So far, the biggest star is
Josef the lion. He has just returned from making a video with <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON>,
stars as the new MGM lion, and is on a television commercial for <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
and in the <ORGANIZATION>Dreyfus</ORGANIZATION> brochures.;     But he is not the only star. <PERSON>Brandi</PERSON>, the
2-year-old black bear, has appeared in a commercial for <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> cars and was
the poster bear for the recent nature movie "The Bear." Puff, <ORGANIZATION>Oxton</ORGANIZATION>'s
six-foot-long monitor lizard, had a cameo role in the movie "Bird on a Wire.";
   <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON>, 33, has worked as <ORGANIZATION>Oxton</ORGANIZATION>'s trainer for about four years and knows
the animals by name and personality.;    A lion who loves people;    <PERSON>Josef</PERSON> the
lion "loves people," <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> says. "If he can't get up and greet someone new,
he gets real bored.";    <PERSON>Brandi</PERSON> the bear is "extremely intelligent" and can
learn tricks in just a few minutes.;    But Tug, the Bengal/Siberian tiger, is
a flop.;    "He didn't turn out right," <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> says. "He has mental problems.
He gets grumpy and he can't think.";    <ORGANIZATION>Oxton</ORGANIZATION> uses Tug only for still
photography, and only under close supervision.;    As a child, <PERSON>Sammut</PERSON>'s pet
collection consisted of "pythons, birds and boas" until he went to college and
ended up with a cougar "nobody wanted." Gradually <PERSON>Sammut</PERSON>'s love for animals
led to the menagerie that is Oxton Kennels.;    "It's just an exotic pet
collection that got out of hand," says <PERSON>Sammut</PERSON>, 30.;    Intuition, respect;   
<PERSON>Ingram</PERSON>, who has been a trainer for about 10 years, has an intuition -- and
respect -- for the creatures she handles.;    "The thing about working with
the animals is that you have to get into their brains," <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> says. "When you
have a lion or a tiger, full-grown, on a lead, you've got something that can
kill at the end of that leash.;    "When you're walking them, you have to
watch ahead of them and always think ahead of them so if something happens --
like a small animal coming out of the bushes -- you can see it before they do
and react to it.";    All the Oxton animals were born in captivity, many in
breeding programs such as the one at <ORGANIZATION>West Coast Gamepark</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>. Oxton
tries to obtain animals as babies because they are easier to train.;    Close
attention;  <PERSON>Sammut</PERSON> stresses that these animals are not pets, and require
constant attention.;    "We're with them all day, every day, and without that
attention they would turn wild," he says.;    Once at <LOCATION>Oxton</LOCATION>, the young animals
receive lots of handling -- by as many different people as possible. Ingram
runs a volunteer program for interested adults, and those who stick with the
job through unpleasant tasks such as cage-cleaning end up taking the babies
out for what their trainer describes as "quality time.";    "You can't just
take an animal out of its cage and strictly work it and put it back," <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON>
says. "You've got to sit with it and take it out for about an hour.";   
Training with wheelbarrows;    That's why Kali, a new tiger cub, might go out
to lunch with <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sammut</PERSON>, travel in cars, and ride in a wheelbarrow to
get used to motion.;    Then the training begins in earnest.;    <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> first
teaches the animals to come to the sound of a buzzer so they can always be
tracked down while wandering around on a film set. Food is the reward, and
Oxton animals go through plenty of it -- 30 pounds of meat a day for the
carnivores alone.;    Next, the animals learn to go to a designated spot --
called a "mark" in movie lingo -- so they won't have to be led in front of
cameras. The rest of the training depends on the animal and the particular
movie or film, but <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> generally teaches each animal to do certain
"natural" behaviors on cue. A bear, for example, might be taught to rear on
its hind legs or put its paws around a tree.;    <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> says there are times
when even the animals she hand- rears challenge her -- just as they would
challenge their dominant leader in the wild. When that happens, <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> says,
she stands her ground, even when the animal is twice her size.;    "You just
get bigger and louder than they are," she says. "It's all psychological. A lot
of (trainers) are into physical power and they use it too much to discipline.;
   "Never let an animal know how strong you really are."; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED;  Oxton, which will take some animals to classrooms, offers private
one-hour tours of the kennels for <MONEY>$5</MONEY> per person. Appointments are necessary.

   What you want to see in <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' zoo drama
``Peaceable Kingdom'' is a lot more of the animals and a lot less of
the people.
   <PERSON>Lindsay Wagner</PERSON> (``Bionic Woman'') plays <PERSON>Rebecca Cafferty</PERSON>, the new
director of a large metropolitan zoo who is struggling to meet the
conflicting demands of research science, animal welfare and city
budgets.
   But <PERSON>Rebecca</PERSON> is resourceful. To extract quick disaster assistance
money from a balking bureaucrat, she whips a tiny monkey out of her
purse at lunch.
   But animal rights activists shouldn't worry. This series would
make anybody like animals more than the people.
   Another veteran of bad network televsion, <PERSON>Tom Wopat</PERSON> (``Dukes of
Hazzard''), plays <PERSON>Rebecca</PERSON>'s brother, conveniently the curator of
mammals at the zoo. Wopat, a country-western singer, croons to the
lions. Luckily, they don't attack.
   Rebecca also has three children, 16, 12 and 6, who are variously
delighted and chagrined at living on the zoo grounds. ``Face it,
Mom, it's a zoo around here,'' notes one after a visiting seal
breaks a vase.
   Opening <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> lineup, ``Peaceable Kingdom'' is a
candidate for first show to be canceled. It might have had a better
shot with less <PERSON>Wopat</PERSON> and more wombat.
   As <PERSON>Rebecca</PERSON> says in a moment of profound wisdom: ``The lion is
dead. Don't take it out on the gorillas.''

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Photography: The Snooze That's Fit to Print </HL>
<AUTHOR> Pam Lambert </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ted Spagna</PERSON>'s been known to sleep on the job. 
But, in his case, snoozing sometimes is the job. 
During the past dozen years the Boston-based photographer has made a name for himself in both the science and art worlds with his portraits of people and animals -- sleeping. 

   Newborn infants and nonagenarians, polar bears and pygmy hippos, have all come under the scrutiny of <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON>'s time-lapse camera. 
Now many of his most recent nightlong sleep studies, of zoo animals, can be seen alongside his pioneering human portraits in "Peaceable Kingdom," an exhibit at <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cooper Union</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Shooting slumberers wasn't always Spagna's dream job. 
The <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, native, who turns 45 next month, first earned an undergraduate architecture degree, then drifted into film. 
All the while he was taking pictures. 
Lots of them. 
"I bring my camera to clubs, to the doctor, on dates," <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> says. 
"It's like my journal." 

   At a <DATE>1975</DATE> auction <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> got the deal of a lifetime on equipment that converted his Zeiss-Ikon into an automatic camera. 
Eager to try out his new toys, that very night he set up the apparatus at the foot of his bed. 
Once he saw the results, he was hooked. 

   The pictures revealed what the photographer describes as "another self within me that I didn't know." 
Spagna the people-watcher was fascinated by this hidden interior landscape he'd glimpsed, Spagna the artist by the challenge the serial images presented to the traditional notion of portraiture. 
Within a month he'd moved the camera over the bed -- what he calls a "God's-eye-view" -- and was shooting all-night sleep portraits, a photo each 15 minutes, of everyone he could sweet-talk. 

   He soon discovered there was more to his pictures than met the eye. 
Harvard neurophysiologist <PERSON>Allan Hobson</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON>, then teaching at the school's <ORGANIZATION>Carpenter Center</ORGANIZATION> for the Visual Arts, that his photos documented the 90-minute human sleep/dream cycle he was studying. 

   The pair subsequently collaborated on an award-winning exhibition, "Dreamstage." 
The <DATE>1977</DATE> show incorporated <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON>'s then-groundbreaking photographs, scientific demonstrations on sleep behavior and its connection to brain activity, even an actual human sleeper. 

   Although people were the focus of these early photos, animals wormed their way into the picture -- all the cats and dogs snuggling with their owners. 
Often the pets -- with shorter sleep cycles and thus more movement -- stole the show, like the <LOCATION>West Highland</LOCATION> terrier in a series on display here, "That white dog can move." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON>, whose favorite spot as a child had been the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION>, decided to do some animal sleep studies. 
It took him five years to raise the funds. 
But, other hurdles remained. 
The first time he tried his strobe lighting on an elephant, the beast was so spooked it developed diarrhea. 
Another problem was that some animals didn't seem to want their pictures taken. 
<PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON> rates as a pussycat compared with a group of chimps <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> tried to photograph. 
First they outfoxed him by smashing bananas into the lens. 
Then they unscrewed the camera mounting. 
Still, they didn't go quite as far as one Himalayan bear -- it ate the camera. 

   After modifying the computer controlling the camera to interface with special light meters, <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> became capable of shooting by moonlight. 
Not only did this technique let sleeping elephants lie, as the "Peaceable Kingdom" exhibit demonstrates, it resulted in some very striking images. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> offers a fresh perspective on his animal subjects. 
Part of this is because they're not in the alert poses we're used to. 
And part is due to the unusual overhead camera angle, which gives even the familiar a surreal spin. 
In one photo <PERSON>Sasha</PERSON>, a Siberian tiger, looks a lot like a furry orange-and-black caterpillar. 
In another some flamingos, standing on an algae-green floor, resemble a school of goldfish. 
And in a spectacular 3-by-7-foot glossy, an arctic-white polar bear seems to float on a vast turquoise sea. 

   At times the viewer becomes voyeur. 
Watching a sleeping woman cradle her bare breast, we're acutely aware that we're observing people stripped of their social masks, in very private moments. 
The juxtaposition of the human and animal portraits underlines the kinship across the kingdom; the biggest difference seems to be the elaborate sleep environments the humans have constructed for themselves. 

   Of course to zoologists there are added layers of meaning in <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON>'s animal studies. 
For instance, curators at the <LOCATION>Miami Metrozoo</LOCATION> found evidence that stress was a factor in some of their gorillas' inability to father young. 
They also discovered the reason flamingo eggs weren't incubating properly -- every night the birds were frightened from their nests by a raccoon. 

   After all these years of sleep studies, <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> still isn't tired of the subject. 
While the "Peaceable Kingdom" photos travel, he's juggling enough projects to keep him awake at night. (After the show here, which closes today, some of the animal pictures will be at <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s Camerawork <DATE>Oct. 20-Nov</DATE>. 20. 
Exhibits of both human and animal portraits are planned for <LOCATION>Worcester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, this <DATE>winter</DATE>, and other sites are being discussed.) 

   <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> is finalizing arrangements to photograph animals at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lion Country Safari</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Busch Gardens</PERSON> -- from a blimp. 
He's working on a children's book. 
He's editing a film. 
He's shooting commissioned sleep portraits to help finance the current projects, and the many more he hopes to do -- like photographing the slumbers of whales, sleepwalkers, schizophrenics, even shuttle astronauts. 

   "We don't just go to sleep, we're moving in rhythmic, almost melodic ways," <PERSON>Mr. Spagna</PERSON> says. 
"I think it would be wonderful if people could become aware of the richness of the night."

<TEXT>
   Foster father <PERSON>Viv Wilson</PERSON> is fond of
his orphans even if they do growl and grunt, snarl and snap, hiss
and hoot.
   One even bit off a finger.
   The 58-year-old former game ranger's charges are lions, hyenas,
baboons, crocodiles, snakes and hundreds of birds common to the
African bush.
   ``It's not a zoo, and it's not for financial gain,'' said
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, a native South African who set up the home in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   ``It's simply a private sanctuary for orphaned, abandoned,
confiscated or injured wild animals that, reared in captivity,
can't safely be returned to the wilds.''
   Chipangali Wildlife Orphanage realizes a dream <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> had
nurtured since working as a game ranger for the British colonial
government in <LOCATION>Northern Rhodesia</LOCATION>, now <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>.
   The body of a newborn kudu calf, clubbed to death by a native
hunter who also shot its mother, begot <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s ambition.
   He and the hunter met in the brush-studded Chipangali region of
eastern <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, heavily infested by trypanosomiasis - a disease
borne by tsetse files that can be fatal to man and beast.
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> recalled asking the hunter why he killed the calf. The
hunter replied he was only doing his job, killing animals of some
species as part of the government's anti-tsetse fly operation.
   ``I knew he was right,'' said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>. ``But I also thought
something was awfully wrong.''
   When <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> achieved independence in <DATE>1964</DATE>, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> moved to
<LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>, now <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, where he was offered a good job in its game
department.
   Nine years later, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> founded <LOCATION>Chipangali</LOCATION>, 15 mies south of
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s second city of <LOCATION>Bulawayo</LOCATION>, with savings and sponsorships.
   For <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, his wife <PERSON>Paddy</PERSON> and their two sons, home was a small
thatched roof house and work was tending a few animals in a cluster
of pens.
   This was the beginning of the seven-year war waged by guerrillas
against white supremacy. It ended in <DATE>1980</DATE> with independence under
President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>.
   ``We weren't touched by the war, and if guerrillas were roaming
around here, I never saw them,'' said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>. ``But we did get
quite a few soldiers popping in to drop off pets, mainly monkeys,
they'd tired of.''
   People continue to deliver animals to <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s care. Today,
<PERSON>Chipangali</PERSON> is a honeycomb of more than 70 large enclosures and
aviaries for ``The Orphans of the Wild,'' the title of a book by
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> published in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   A labyrinth of pebbled paths bordered by gardens of native
trees, plants and cactuses lead visitors to <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>'s waifs.
   ``We've strived to make the setting as naturally African as we
can, both for the animals and for people who come to see them,''
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   His family still lives beneath the thatch-roofed house flanked
by enclosures for lions, leopards and monkeys.
   About 20,000 people stroll around <LOCATION>Chipangali</LOCATION>'s 10 acres each
year, a third of them schoolchildren who are allowed to visit free
of charge. Adults pay the equivalent of <MONEY>$2</MONEY>.
   ``We encourage the kids,'' said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, who serves as manager
for a trust fund set up to bankroll the orphanage. ``Africans
brought up in the rural areas fully understand wildlife because
it's all around them. ... But millions of Africans born in cities
and towns have never seen a lion, a leopard or a snake.''
   Urban children, he said, ``have lost contact with nature. Here,
we take them back to the wild.''
   The <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> needed monthly for <ORGANIZATION>Chipangali</ORGANIZATION>'s upkeep comes from
gate receipts, sales of a wildlife calendar, the orphanage's
restaurant and fund-raising events such as horseracing.
   Scores of sponsors, many of them foreigners, adopt animals and
send checks as foster parents.
   ``We still battle,'' said <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, who launched Chipangali on
<MONEY>$400</MONEY> a month. ``We can never close, so we must cut our cloth to
suit our income.''
   <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, who as a game ranger survived charges by rhinoceros and
bites from poisonous snakes, has had few problems from his
creatures.
   A lion chomped off one of his fingers, a visiting schoolboy was
slightly injured by a leopard and some of his 40 employees have
been bitten by monkeys.
   Besides running the orphanage, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> has authored three
wildlife books, helped produce a 25-episode program for television
and written some 60 research papers on African snakes, animals and
birds.
   He was commissioned by the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION>International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> to study ways to
prevent the extinction of the jentink's duiker antelope of <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION>,
and won the <DATE>1987</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Rolex Spirit of Enterprise</ORGANIZATION> award for his work
there.
   In <DATE>June</DATE>, he was among 500 people worldwide honored by the <ORGANIZATION>United
Nations</ORGANIZATION> for environmental achievements.
   Wilson left <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> in <DATE>March</DATE> just before the outbreak of civil
war. He fears the few surviving duiker were destroyed in the
conflict.
   ``That's my next concern,' ' he said. ``As soon as things are
settled down I'll go back to see for myself.''

ZOO UP TREE AS SUN BEARS PLAY HOUDINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 73 years, the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> has had a lot to brag about. Its proudest 
moments, however, would not fall under the title "The Great Escape." 
</P>
<P>
There was the rare, 600-pound African antelope that thundered across a golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
There was the jaguar that skittered between a keeper's legs and caromed toward 
the exit, its claws clicking on the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the orangutan that left for a stroll, only to surrender -- to 
everyone's goggle-eyed amazement -- to a keeper's outstretched palm. 
</P>
<P>
Those were one-shot escapades, easily squelched. Now, however, a pair of 
Malaysian sun bears at the zoo appear to be out to break all records, and to 
possess the savvy of <LOCATION>Houdini</LOCATION> when it comes to escaping. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Sept. 23</DATE>, the 100-pound <PERSON>Ringo</PERSON> climbed over a wall and 
ended up on the patio of <ORGANIZATION>Sun Bear Forest</ORGANIZATION>. Onlookers apparently thought it was 
part of a show and made an attempt to cozy up to <PERSON>Ringo</PERSON>, who was just trying to 
act naturally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third Sun Bear Escape 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ringo</PERSON>'s was the third escape by a sun bear since the animals' new <MONEY>$3.5-million</MONEY> 
exhibit opened in <DATE>June</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Muffin, <PERSON>Ringo</PERSON>'s female playmate, escaped the two other times. 
</P>
<P>
The bears' antics have zoo officials worried, so much so that a guard has been 
posted at the exhibit during visiting hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time these bears get out it's a problem -- and a potential grave hazard 
-- for zoo visitors," zoo spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Jouett</PERSON> said with furrowed brow. "We 
can't seem to convince the public that, although small, these animals are not 
Yogi Bear or Winnie the Pooh. Sun bears have the ability to do a lot of damage 
to human beings. 
</P>
<P>
"They have big claws for digging and teeth that could easily deliver a big 
bite. We face the dual hazard of a person or a bear getting hurt, and then the 
very real possibility of incurring a major lawsuit. So, yes, we're worried." 
</P>
<P>
Escapes notwithstanding, the bears have managed to do considerable damage to 
the exhibit, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, which has the theme of "native habitat." What 
zookeepers hadn't counted on was that the cute little bears would gnaw down 
every tree in sight, along with plants and grassy slopes, and destroy a <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> 
fiberglass "tree" with an automatic honey dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo resisted using electrical wiring, but, as it turns out, the 
bears' claws do not conduct electricity, which keepers didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
He said the bears are "intelligent, curious" animals with "a ferocious climbing 
instinct." 
</P>
<P>
They're just more intelligent, more curious and better at climbing than anyone 
at the zoo thought they could be. 
</P>
<P>
Sun bears weigh 60 to 150 pounds, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, and the eight on exhibit in the 
1 1/2-acre Sun Bear Forest average about 100 pounds. The bears bear a vague 
resemblance to large dogs, especially those of the hound variety, the kind 
former President <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> might have picked up by the ears. 
</P>
<P>
So far -- and <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the zoo is "incredibly fortunate" to be noting this 
-- the escapes have not resulted in injuries to the bears or the passers-by who 
find them so irresistibly cuddly and charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Sept. 23</DATE>, however, <PERSON>Ringo</PERSON> had to be felled by a tranquilizer gun, which 
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said poses problems, the likes of which the zoo hopes not to encounter 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know quite what dosage to give the animal because every animal is 
different. An animal gets out, its adrenaline is racing, and that affects the 
dosage you select. The instinct of such an animal would be fight or flight once 
it escapes. Luckily, <PERSON>Ringo</PERSON> chose flight. Otherwise, some people could have been 
hurt -- seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers have installed sheet metal behind a row of bars in the area where 
each escape took place. They're hoping the metal will prevent claws from 
wrapping around the bars to gain traction. The "visitor assistance officer" is 
now on duty during zoo hours to make sure no further escapes occur or to 
minimize damage if any do. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said the conventional way of housing bears is in a "sunken grotto." The 
zoo had hoped to alter that by having onlookers gaze up at the bears, rather 
than down -- "not quite so condescending," he said -- and offering a kind of 
minimum-security setting to such creatures of the wild. 
</P>

But the strength and boldness of sun bears, particularly those on view in <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION>, have baffled and awed the experts. And now, <PERSON>Jouett</PERSON> said, the zoo may be 
inclined to "rethink" the nature of <ORGANIZATION>Sun Bear Forest</ORGANIZATION>.

"It's like if you designed a human exhibit," he said. "You or I wouldn't be 
able to get out -- but (Olympic athlete) <PERSON>Carl Lewis</PERSON> might. He'd probably just 
jump over. Much to our chagrin, that's exactly what <PERSON>Ringo</PERSON> and Muffin keep 
doing."

DESIGNING A ZOO THAT MEETS NEEDS OF ANIMALS, CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL KORNMAN, Kornman is a free-lance writer who lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keeping tarantulas cool was not something architects <PERSON>John Grist</PERSON> and Ara 
Zenobians had ever had to plan for in their work on <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> hotels, shopping 
centers and upscale homes. 
</P>
<P>
But they were hired to be flexible, think simple and work fast on what would be 
the most primitive-looking project in their portfolio -- the new <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
children's zoo, which opens <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stretch in one sense," <PERSON>Grist</PERSON> said recently as workers prepared 
<LOCATION>Adventure Island</LOCATION> for the arrival of its first tenants. "We had to do a lot of 
research, but architects being the egotists that they are, think they can do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$8.3-million</MONEY> job was complicated by the fact that the zoo's future 
occupants couldn't help the architects with the design. So the architects had 
to poll the zoo's in-house experts before they could sit down at the drawing 
board. 
</P>
<P>
And this was to be a zoo that doesn't look like a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
It had to incorporate an aviary, tide pool, petting zoo, an animal nursery 
built hacienda style, high-tech interactive devices, an outdoor theater for 
animal performances, a cave built into a mountain, a fast-food restaurant and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be built across four distinct biomes, or habitats, (mountain, 
meadow, desert, shoreline) that seem to flow from one to the other in a 
2.5-acre corner of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Zoo</LOCATION>, which is located in <LOCATION>Griffith Park</LOCATION> near 
the interchange of the <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION> (5) and Ventura (134) freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The architects had to find ways to accommodate features they had never used in 
their previous work: A wired-for-sound mountain lion hopscotch game -- with 
squares having real paw prints cast in bronze -- on a busy pathway and a scary 
(but not too scary) vampire bat imaging device inside the cave that seems to 
move the bats from one stalactite to another, within reach of young visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Every phase of the project, from planning to completion, was monitored by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, which raised the budget from donations. The 
largest gift, <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY>, was provided by the <ORGANIZATION>Weingart Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Architect <PERSON>Riener Nielsen</PERSON>, who usually designs hotels and upscale homes, had no 
zoo experience when he was hired by <LOCATION>GLAZA</LOCATION> as project manager, to serve as both 
buffer and trouble-shooter on the project. Getting it off the ground was the 
hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ground Broken in <DATE>July</DATE> 
</P>
<P>
"For this project," <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON> said, "there's no comparison to cost relationships 
like there would be for a hotel or an office building, where you would have 
dollars per square foot. We needed to get subcontractors on board early to 
define it and verify the pricing." 
</P>
<P>
Ground breaking was last <DATE>July</DATE>, after the deteriorating original children's zoo, 
built in <DATE>1963</DATE>, was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest in the zoo's history, was nearly a full-time challenge 
for the architects. 
</P>
<P>
"There were weeks Ara lived over there," <PERSON>Grist</PERSON> said. "There were phone calls by 
the hour every day." 
</P>
<P>
Although the project was a melding of complex relationships, <PERSON>Zenobians</PERSON> said he 
tried to keep all structures generically Southwestern and simple, with few 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe a building should be complicated to be nice," he said. "I 
believe in simplicity very much. I go to basic design that can be appreciated 
by all people." 
</P>
<P>
The need to put safety first for human visitors and animal occupants required 
extensive reworking of some of the plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scaled for Youngsters 
</P>
<P>
Adjustments were made in "window coverings" for outdoor habitats to restrain 
the animals comfortably and keep visitors at a safe distance, but close enough 
to enable even toddlers to see the creatures up close. 
</P>
<P>
Step-ups were added in front of exhibits to give smaller children a better 
view, and some facade work was designed especially to bring adult-scale 
buildings down to a comfortable level for young visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But there was the occasional gentle conflict between builder and zookeeper. 
</P>
<P>
The fencing at the petting zoo, or hacienda, looks like wood but is made from 
textured concrete. Zoo Director <PERSON>Warren Thomas</PERSON> was concerned that the animals 
would chew on the concrete posts and hurt themselves, but a decision was 
reached to go with concrete anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Grist thought air-conditioning the tarantulas seemed ridiculous. "They seem to 
do very well in the desert without it," he said. But <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> explained that life 
in captivity is stressful to spiders and that air conditioning is essential to 
their survival. 
</P>
<P>
Fancy technology is scattered throughout the zoo to make each visit an 
interactive adventure. It was created by ex-Disney wizards who formed their own 
Burbank-based company, <ORGANIZATION>Art &amp; Technology</ORGANIZATION>, which uses contemporary technology 
to design and build educational devices for zoos and amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stimulate Senses 
</P>
<P>
Adventure Island's 20-plus interactive devices are intended to amuse both 
children and adults and stimulate a variety of senses, said <ORGANIZATION>Art &amp; 
Technology</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Joe Garlington</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
One device inside the cave will let visitors see a lifelike <PERSON>Betty White</PERSON> -- the 
actress and animal lover -- in three dimensions and in miniature, explain how 
and why skunks stink. 
</P>
<P>
In the <ORGANIZATION>Little House</ORGANIZATION> Under the Prairie, also inside the cave, children will see 
a cross section of a prairie dog burrow outfitted with three-dimensional models 
defining each prairie dog "room." 
</P>
<P>
Art <ORGANIZATION>&amp; Technology</ORGANIZATION> also created a series of "photo spots," humorous, colorful 
bas-reliefs that will allow children to pose in life-size fantasies scattered 
throughout <LOCATION>Adventure Island</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At one, a giant vulture bears down on a rock slab. When a child has his picture 
taken, he'll look like he's being attacked by the bird. Another provides a 
photo opportunity with a snake and a third will give children a chance to 
"hang" like a bat. You turn the snapshot upside down for this one. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the white stucco hacienda-style petting zoo, nursery and 
Southwestern-flavored Greek theater, Grist and Zenobians also drew the plans 
for the earthquake-safe concrete bunker that is the firm foundation for the 
mountain/cave at the entrance to <LOCATION>Adventure Island</LOCATION>, located past the gift shop 
in the regular zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The cement-and-steel structure, fine-tuned by structural engineer <ORGANIZATION>Grossman 
&amp; Speer</ORGANIZATION>, not only came up to city code, but it's so solid, <PERSON>Grist</PERSON> said, that 
"when the bomb comes, where you want to be is in that cave. The footings are 
higher than me, and I'm 5-foot-8. It's built like Ft. Knox." 
</P>
<P>
The rugged-looking mountain with a wet and dry cave inside it was crafted with 
dental tools, spray-painted and fitted inside with a dripping slime wall by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Larson Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a Tucson-based design and construction firm that builds grottoes 
for millionaires in the <LOCATION>South of France</LOCATION>, waterfalls in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, water hazards for 
golf courses and naturalistic habitats for zoos. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape of <LOCATION>Adventure Island</LOCATION> was designed to enhance the various habitats 
and make the zoo animals feel at home, but also to conserve water and guarantee 
low maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Plants and trees selected for the site had to be nontoxic to children and zoo 
animals, and had to blend in with the overall architectural design. 
</P>
<P>
The job was done for <MONEY>$120,000</MONEY> by <PERSON>Jon David Cicchetti</PERSON> Landscape Architect of 
<LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, which specializes in using native and ornamental plants 
"to create (a) natural environment, whatever it happened to be." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to have these zones -- mountain, desert, meadow -- but at the 
same time have the zones come off as a total landscape," <PERSON>Cicchetti</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the complexity of this project and the push to finish it by <DATE>spring</DATE>, 
Grist and <PERSON>Zenobians</PERSON> said building Adventure Island was very enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it was a very successful collaboration or it would not have come 
together as quickly or as cleanly as it did," <PERSON>Grist</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to do another zoo."

<HEAD>Common Cat Gives Birth To Rare Breed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A common domestic cat served as a surrogate
mother to give birth to a wildcat in a technique that researchers
say can help save endangered species.
   The embryo of an endangered Indian desert cat was implanted into
the house cat by in vitro fertilization, <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> Zoo officials
said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. The offspring was born <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE>.
   ``There are millions of domestic cats, and so few of these exotic
cats,'' said <PERSON>Betsy Dresser</PERSON>, research director at the zoo's <ORGANIZATION>Center
for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife</ORGANIZATION>.
   Zoo officials said they believed it was the first time a common
domestic cat was used as the surrogate mother.
   The <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> veterinary school has implanted embryos
from the endangered <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> panther in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> mountain lions, and in
vitro fertilization involving a leopard cat has been used at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   The <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> center has made breakthroughs during the past few
years with its work in embryo transplants from one species to
another. Researchers successfully have frozen embryos, thawed them
and transplanted them into other animals.
   The aim is to develop the technology and techniques for
transplanting embryos from endangered species into more common
animals, thus increasing the chances of the species' survival.
   The center has successfully transplanted the embryos of an exotic
species to a common one with different types of antelope and cows.
   <PERSON>Ms. Dresser</PERSON>'s work was praised by an official at the <LOCATION>San Diego
Zoo</LOCATION>, which also has been researching how to help reproduction of
endangered animal species.
   ``We salute this type of work because there are so many species
in dire straits today. Any method devoted to the enhancement of
production of endangered species, our organization whole-heartedly
supports,'' said <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo Wild
Animal Park</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Dresser</PERSON> said the center has been studying cats for several
years to learn more about their reproduction for such a transfer.
Eggs and sperm were gathered from desert cats, the eggs were
fertilized in a glass dish, and the embryos were implanted in the
domestic cat. Two embryos survived, but one of the kittens was born
dead.
   The desert cat is a close relative to the domestic cat, with
similar size and appearance.
   The mother is treating the kitten like a regular offspring, but
the kitten won't take on characteristics of the mother.
   ``She thinks she had the ugliest kid on the block,'' <ORGANIZATION>Dresser</ORGANIZATION>
joked. ``Every time you pick up the desert cat and put it back, she
gives it a bath.''
   The researchers decided to use two closely related types of cat
for the first transfer. They are not sure which other cat species
are close enough to permit such transfers.
   ``We don't know in the relationships how far away you can go,''
<PERSON>Ms. Dresser</PERSON> said.
   The next round of work at the center will involve transfers of
jungle cat and golden cat embryos. The work also will help them
understand the similiarities and differences between cat species.
   ``This is a new way to allow us to look at the physiological
side,'' <PERSON>Ms. Dresser</PERSON> said.

ZOO VOLUNTEERS BEGAN THE TRADITION 14 YEARS AGO. THIS YEAR 7,000 PEOPLE 
SERENADED THE ANIMALS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. <PERSON>Dolittle</PERSON> would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
"Deck the hall with boughs of holly," sang 9-year-old <PERSON>Christopher Jett</PERSON>, huddled 
around the sea lion pool at the Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. "Fa la la la 
la, la la la la." 
</P>
<P>
It's a precious Christmas image: Cherub-faced youngsters strolling down 
snow-covered streets, serenading families that flock to their doorsteps bearing 
warm cider and cookies. Try that in most big cities today and you're liable to 
get mugged or chased down the block by the neighborhood watch. 
</P>
<P>
Here in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, however, the great yuletide custom lives on, albeit with a 
twist. Carolers don't sing to people anymore. They sing to animals. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, a few Sundays before <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, throngs of Chicagoans gather to 
warble a message of Peace on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Good Will Toward Mammals</ORGANIZATION> to the lions, 
gazelles, elephants, giraffes, hedgehogs, armadillos, iguanas, turtles, 
turtledoves, partridges and all the other species on display at the 35-acre 
urban animal park just north of <LOCATION>The Loop</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not supposed to anthropomorphize, but I think they love it," insisted 
<PERSON>Carol Leifer</PERSON>, a zoo spokesperson. " . . . I have seen spectacled bears swaying 
to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Little <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> had no idea that "anthropomorphize" meant to attribute human 
characteristics to animals. He just knew that singing to animals in a cage was 
a lot more fun than doing it at home. "I tried singing to my cat but he 
scratched me," <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
Caroling to the animals began here 14 years ago when a handful of volunteer zoo 
workers did it on a lark. Over the years, the popularity has mushroomed to the 
point where it has probably become the city's most widely attended Christmas 
event. More than 7,000 people took part this year. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, everyone assembled first around the outdoor sea lion 
pool where <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>, sometimes known as <PERSON>Ron Solomon</PERSON> (remember, it's a tradition 
with a twist), arrived toting his satchel full of mackerel and herring. He 
tossed the fish into the pool, where Junior, the 800-pound major-domo of the 
water, and the rest of his pals merrily munched away to the strains of "O Come 
All Ye Faithful." 
</P>
<P>
From there, the choristers broke up according to animal preference. Some headed 
over to the lion house, some to the children's zoo, some to the large mammal 
area, and, yes, some to the reptile exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand snakes," admitted <PERSON>Eryl Morgan</PERSON>, nervously turning her back to a 
reticulated python as she belted out a verse of "Jolly Old St. Nicholas." "But 
I can't see any of them with all these people in here. Besides, I'm not really 
singing to them. I'm singing to a plate of glass." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan might not have been crooning to the snakes, but the snakes might have 
been thinking otherwise. <PERSON>Clarence Wright</PERSON>, the curator of the reptile house, 
said snakes have ultra sensitive lower jaws and scales and probably pick up 
vibrations from the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't bother them, but they're just aware of it more (than normal 
crowd noise)," he explained. "They're probably moving around a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Experts are unsure how much other animals appreciate the musical interlude. "It 
certainly doesn't distress them," said <PERSON>Steve Thompson</PERSON>, the zoo's director of 
conservation of science. "Either they see it as 'just those silly humans again' 
or they may actually enjoy it. It's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Some carolers swear that when they start singing en masse, lions roar back, sea 
lions bark and even snakes flick their tongues in time to the music. 
</P>
<P>
While the motivation behind such actions is open to debate, senior lion keeper 
Art <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said he has noticed that big cats seem to enjoy classical music and 
jazz. Once, he said, the lions started "roaring like crazy" when a brass 
ensemble played outside their cages. 
</P>

As for Christmas carols, <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said the cats could probably take them or 
leave them. When the singing began, leopards, jaguars and other cats did begin 
pacing back and forth anxiously. But <PERSON>Maraldi</PERSON> said such nervous behavior 
probably had less to do with the sound than the sight of hundreds of sumptuous 
looking youngsters massed tantalizingly just a few feet away.

"They react to the little size of the children," he explained. "The children 
are just the right size to eat."

<LEADPARA>  SEVENTY-FIVE years ago, the San Diego Zoo collected animals the way the
Salvation Army collected junk.;    Sailors, passing through town, donated
bears after their cuddly mascots outgrew their ships. An alligator, which had
terrorized neighbors, was lassoed and dragged to the zoo. Rattlesnakes,
unearthed by construction workers, were regularly dropped off. Most of the
zoo's original residents had been abandoned after the city hosted the
1915-1916 Panama California International Exposition.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those modest early days are being remembered and celebrated at the zoo,
which is observing its 75th anniversary with special events and new exhibits
throughout the year.;    The first of these, <LOCATION>Gorilla Tropics</LOCATION>, opened this
<DATE>weekend</DATE>. It's a 2.5-acre African rain forest habitat for six gorillas and more
than 200 birds.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> is among the best known and most
respected in the world. Living amid its lush canyons, mesas and gardens are
more than 3,500 animals and 7,000 plant species.;    Birthday animals; The zoo
houses some of the rarest species on earth. Many animals living there are
found nowhere else in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It also boasts the largest collection
of Chinese animals outside <LOCATION>China.</LOCATION>;    The zoo is welcoming even more rare
animals throughout the year as birthday presents fly in from the international
zoo community. In <DATE>January</DATE>, the zoo, which has more koalas than any zoo outside
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, got four more from an Australian wildlife preserve. The zoo threw a
party for the huggable koalas, which are by far the zoo's favorite
attraction.;    "This is truly an exciting time for the zoo," said <PERSON>James
Dolan</PERSON>, the director of animal collections. "Some of the animals being sent to
us for our 75th birthday are so rare they are not exhibited in the <LOCATION>Western
Hemisphere</LOCATION>.";    Making their first North American appearance are Siberian
weasels from the <LOCATION>Leningrad Zoo</LOCATION>, Corsac foxes from the <LOCATION>Moscow Zoo</LOCATION>, and from
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> some shaggy-haired mountain dwellers called Mishmi takins. A takin
looks like a cross between a mountain goat and a moose.;    Not all the
animals on display will have a pulse.;    Memorial <DATE>Day weekend</DATE>, <DATE>May 25-27</DATE>, a
builder from <ORGANIZATION>LEGO Co.</ORGANIZATION> will use its famous building blocks to erect an
8-foot-tall gorilla. The ape will stick around for a month.;    Meanwhile,
animal-shaped plants have sprouted recently throughout the zoo's 100 acres.
Hoping to become one of the premier spots for topiaries, the zoo's
horticulturists have been sculpting leafy flamingos, gorillas, koalas,
giraffes and other creatures.;    During its anniversary, the zoo will
continue to look less and less like a zoo. Since the mid-1980s, the zoo has
undergone major renovations to make it look wild enough to please tigers,
bears, alligators and the rest of the menagerie. The master plan directs that
the zoo be divided into areas where birds, mammals, reptiles and plants from
the same climatic zones live together. The old notion of grouping only the
same species together is considered passe.;    Three such realistic exhibits
have been completed so far. The zoo has recreated two rain forests and an
African kopje (pronounced COPY), an outcropping of volcanic rock that juts up
from the plains. The creation of a tundra, a grasslands, a desert, a savanna
and other climatic zones are planned into the <DATE>21st century</DATE> as funds permit.;  
 Simulated rain forest; Visitors will be able to see the <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Gorilla
Tropics</ORGANIZATION> exhibit from a suspension that spans a waterfall. The apes will roam
past pools and waterfalls through a forest of fig and sausage trees,
wildflowers and African grasses. There will be outcroppings and fallen trees
for gorillas to climb on.;    Many of the birds that will fly through gorilla
country are rarely seen in zoos. The flock includes snowy-headed robinchats,
African pygmy geese, blue-naped mousebirds and emerald starlings.;    In case
the gorillas or their visitors aren't convinced they're in a jungle, the
sounds of an African rain forest will play through hidden speakers.;    Zoo
officials hope the gorillas behave better than the sun bears did <DATE>two years ago</DATE>
when they were moved into their multimillion-dollar rain forest. The bears,
which formed bear pyramids to scale the walls and escape, quickly trashed the
place. They destroyed the sod, stripped the trees of their bark and even
ripped apart an artificial tree that contained a honey feeder in it.;    For
visitors who want to get close enough to pet the animals, there is always the
Children's Zoo. In the kiddie corral, goats, sheep and two homely pot-bellied
pig brothers named <PERSON>Huey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Duey</PERSON> tolerate rambunctious toddlers.;    Why are
the animals so mellow?;    "It's their job," said one zoo keeper watching her
flock. "They really have a pretty easy life. Not much is expected of them.";  
 Zoo officials hope that <DATE>1991</DATE> -- with all the extra festivities -- will be one
of their biggest years ever for attendance. They aren't sure, however, if the
turmoil in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, which has been discouraging people from traveling
long distances, will result in bigger or smaller crowds.;    "It could go
either way," said <PERSON>Georgeanne Irvine</PERSON>, a zoo spokeswoman. "I personally think
people will need a little relief and will come to the zoo to escape.";     IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED; The zoo's actual birthday is <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>. Throughout <DATE>October</DATE>,
children under 15 years will be admitted free. And on <DATE>Oct. 7</DATE>, no one will be
charged.;    Regular admission is <MONEY>$10.75</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for children 3 to 15
and free for those 2 and under. The zoo, in the city's famous <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, is
open daily from <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  ANIMAL; ARTS; BOOK; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  NOTHING has brought out the worst and the best of the human animal more than
our meetings with the other species on this planet. There is a unique power in
the human-animal meeting, whether it is as individuals or as separate races,
stranded together on the globe. For some of us, specific animals have the
power of totems -- metaphors for our own dreams and the virtues for which we
strive. So many books about animals never transcend the level of "Our Friend
the Squirrel" to reach that of our personal experience. Books that do need be
neither flashy nor expensive, although some of the best are both.;   A new
book that is both expensive and beautiful is Great Cats: Majestic Creatures of
the Wild,  edited by John Seidensticker and Susan Lumpkin (Rodale, 240 pp.,
$40). Anyone interested in felines will find something of interest in this
large-format encyclopedia. "Great Cats" contains a number of essays on
specific species, ranging from the more exotic such as snow leopards and
ocelots to pumas, lions and jaguars, as well as essays on behavior, domestic
cats and the place of cats in zoos. The writing varies from exciting to arid;
the many photographs, drawings and charts are a delight.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Alan Rabinowitz</PERSON> is a research zoologist specializing in wild cats. His
second book, Chasing the <ORGANIZATION>Dragon</ORGANIZATION>'s Tail: The Struggle to Save <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s Wild
Cats  (<ORGANIZATION>Doubleday</ORGANIZATION>, 242 pp., <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>), is a detailed account of the two years he
spent in a Thai forest at the request of that country's government. <PERSON>Rabinowitz</PERSON>
was invited to study the wildlife there, especially its leopards and tigers.; 
 He found himself in a long, hard and so far unsuccessful fight to save the
animals and their place, a fight he found particularly ironic in a Buddhist
country. The author's first book, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>: One Man's Battle to Establish the
World's <ORGANIZATION>First Jaguar Preserve</ORGANIZATION>, about his earlier effort in <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>, is now
available in paperback (Anchor Books, 370 pp., <MONEY>$12</MONEY>).;   Saving the elephant;  
Just in time for the holidays, two books on the perennial favorite, the
African elephant, have appeared. The books have similar formats, and both also
have introductions by <PERSON>Richard Leakey</PERSON>. The African Elephant: Twilight in <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION>
by <PERSON>Roger L. DiSilvestro</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Wiley</ORGANIZATION>, 206 pp., <MONEY>$34.95</MONEY>) is the weaker of the two. The
elephant as a subject is so large and complex that anything short of a genuine
textbook will be limited. But <PERSON>DiSilvestro</PERSON> errs on the side of simplicity; the
reader hungers for more.;   Elephants: The Deciding Decade, a book of essays
edited by <PERSON>Ronald Orenstein</PERSON>, with many fine photographs by <PERSON>Brian Beck</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Sierra
Club</ORGANIZATION>, 160 pp., <MONEY>$35</MONEY>), partly solves this problem by its different authorial
voices and points of view, focusing more on specific aspects of the elephant
than an overview. The reader is forewarned: It is impossible to read about the
elephant without feeling. A sense of outrage, as well as beauty, is intrinsic
to both these books.;   There are a lot of good coral reef books available,
but if you're a reef fan like me, you can't have too many. An ecosystem as
gorgeous, complicated and alien as the coral reef can always yield a new view.
If you didn't know already that coral is an animal, along with anemones, sea
fans and sponges, it's time to find out how wide are the limits of zoology.;  
Reef: A Safari Through the Coral World  by <PERSON>Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Sierra
Club</ORGANIZATION>, 200 pp., <MONEY>$25</MONEY>) is an excellent introduction. Stafford-Deitsch also writes
with enough scientific concision to satisfy the reef veteran. For a book this
large and well-produced, the price is surprisingly low.;   While crocodilians
don't lend themselves to a certain warm, domestic coziness, alligators and
crocodiles have always held a special totemic magic. Eyelids of Morning: The
Mingled Destinies of Crocodiles and Men by <PERSON>Alistair Graham</PERSON> with photographs by
<PERSON>Peter Beard</PERSON> (Chronicle Books, 260 pp., <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY> paperback) is a general
exposition on the reasons for that magic.;   <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> focuses on the
relationship of Africans to the crocodile, but also shows many cultural
artifacts, such as cartoons and advertisements, from around the world. Graham
tells a few harrowing tales of man-eating, with equally harrowing stories of
the destruction by man of a fabulous beast.;    A Social History of the
American Alligator by <PERSON>Vaughn L. Glascow</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>St. Martin's</ORGANIZATION>, 260 pp., <MONEY>$29.95</MONEY>) covers
much of the same ground as <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>'s book, focused exclusively on the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. This is a sociocultural history of mixed success: It covers the
familiar journey from prey to endangered species, but with the inevitable
shallowness of such a broad canvas. Much less flashy, but ultimately more
meaningful, is Gator! An Eye-Opening Adventure (Ten Speed Press, 80 pp., <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>
paperback). Author <PERSON>Lawrence T. Mahoney</PERSON> dedicates his book to the Lizard King
-- <PERSON>Jim Morrison</PERSON> -- and the general weirdness of this book does <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> honor.
Mahoney and photographer <PERSON>Richard Benson</PERSON> tell the story of the nights of
<DATE>September 1988</DATE>, when the state of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> opened a month-long nocturnal
alligator season, the first since <DATE>1961</DATE>. A bizarre True Story at a great
price.;   One book deliberately ignoring the more sexy of our favorite animals
is Here Today: Portraits of Our Vanishing Species by <PERSON>Susan Middleton</PERSON> and <PERSON>David
Liitschwager</PERSON> with a foreword by <PERSON>Wendell Berry</PERSON> (Chronicle Books, 143 pp.,
<MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>). The two photographer-authors focused on those species that live, or
are trying to live, in our own habitats, such as the salt marsh harvest mouse,
the Shasta crayfish and 34 other animals and plants quickly disappearing from
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. A representative of each species is pictured both in
black-and-white and color plates, using photographic techniques that
essentially eliminate background; each tuft of fur, every stamen and feather
appear in sharp and splendid relief.;   An ecological vision;   <PERSON>James Balog</PERSON>
remains the most original and powerful wildlife photographer working. Balog
has more than technique and field experience; he has an artistic vision of an
animal's ecology. In his <DATE>1990</DATE> book  Survivors: A <ORGANIZATION>New Vision of Endangered
Wildlife</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Harry N. Abrams</PERSON>, 144 pp., <MONEY>$49.50</MONEY>), <PERSON>Balog</PERSON> used techniques developed
in fashion photography to represent the "new landscape" in which wild animals
find themselves. "I have created images of animals in exile from a lost <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION>,
adrift in the ether of a planet now made alien to them." And so he has, in a
vision radical and disturbing. Balog shows us a gray wolf where it stands on
its hind legs, alone in a cinder-block room, howling; he gives us the mute
orangutan, against a white wall, its arms spread and palms open in offering.
Each of the 84 color plates, each with an anecdotal explanation, is startling,
strange and unforgettable.;   Finally, a classic of wildlife writing and
photography has been reissued in a lovely edition. <PERSON>Peter Beard</PERSON>'s The End of
the Game: The Last Word From Paradise  (Chronicle Books, 224 pp., <MONEY>$22.95</MONEY>
paperback) focuses not only on the elephants of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, but its other life:
giraffes, rhinos, <LOCATION>Masai</LOCATION>, railroads, invaders. To Beard, the game was both the
quarry and the act of hunting it, and he watched both of them come to an end
in his lifetime. His silvery and sepia photographs are awful and sublime. The
real elephants' graveyard is here: not the enormous field of white bone, but
the graphic series of aerial shots of one butchered carcass after the other. A
sorrow and a triumph.  </TEXT>

FT  02 APR 94 / Travel: Survival is a dogfight for the wild bunch - Wild
dogs in Africa may become rarer than the rhino. Michael J Woods tracked them
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a dull pock, like the sound of a tennis ball bouncing lightly on
grass, as the compressed air-gun expelled its tranquilliser dart. The
African wild dog sprang to its feet as if it had been stung. With a yelp it
dashed off, a red woollen tassel dangling from the syringe in its shoulder.
'It won't go far,' said Dr <PERSON>Gus Mills</PERSON>, and we sat in his truck for the 10
minutes needed for the drug to work. It took a little time to find the
sleeping dog in the thick bush, as its black, white and tan blotched coat
blended remarkably well with the broken shadows cast on the grey dusty soil.
Once located, though, a radio collar was swiftly fitted, a sample of blood
taken and the antidote injected. In less than a minute the dog was on its
feet and had gone to join the rest of Mbyamiti pack, which now had two dogs
carrying radio transmitters.
<PERSON>Gus Mills</PERSON> is a scientist who works in <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> national park, a long
rectangular area about the size of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> on the eastern boundary of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>. He has been researching African wild dogs, also known as <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION>
hunting dogs, for some years. His subjects are rangy animals with noticeably
large rounded ears, three-coloured coats and a height of a little over 2ft.
They are efficient hunters, running as a pack and killing at dawn and dusk
if they can, and lying-up in shade during the heat of the day. Only for the
short breeding period are they tied to a den; for the rest of the year they
are nomadic and appear to need a large territory to survive.
There are only about 360 wild dogs in <LOCATION>Kruger</LOCATION>; the lion and hyena populations
both top 2,000 for the same area. All is not well with wild dogs. They have
become very scarce in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> - rarer, some say, than the rhino, which makes
them <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s most threatened large carnivore.
Historically, their undeservedly bad reputation has led to persecution by
farmers. Until 20 years ago, they were even shot in some national parks.
There are still farmers who will not tolerate dogs and consider them vermin,
so that packs straying from conservation areas are at risk.
Only big stretches of protected wilderness will suffice to provide wild dogs
with enough space to survive. The national parks in the north of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and in the south of <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> fulfil these requirements, and
contain reasonable numbers of dogs. But these very extensive areas are
largely unpenetrated by roads and, for the discerning visitor, for whom a
glimpse of a dog is more exciting than any of the big five (lion, leopard,
elephant, rhino, buffalo), spotting one is extremely difficult.
Things seem to be slightly easier in <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON>. Finding them by radio is the
only way that researchers such as <PERSON>Gus Mills</PERSON> can ensure that packs are
monitored on a regular basis, and dogs are often seen by visitors to the
park. In fact, <PERSON>Gus</PERSON> was able to use tourist sightings of wild dogs to obtain
a measure of the number of animals in the park.
By offering a free film for every usable photograph of a dog, he soon had
pictures of almost every animal. The dog population in <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> is one of the
densest so far recorded in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and the extensive network of roads is
frequently used by packs on the move.
'Morning and evening are the best times to look for dogs,' Gus told me.
'That is when they hunt, for they rest in the heat of the day and then their
low profile and disruptive coloration make them almost impossible to spot.'
<PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> has much to offer in addition to wild dogs. I came across lions and
elephants in abundance along with rhino and giraffes. Many of the smaller
animals, so often missed elsewhere, are visible here, too. I found a dwarf
mongoose den by the roadside and was able to watch the lightning activities
of its delightful inhabitants as they foraged through the undergrowth and
then rocketed across open areas for fear of raptors.
On two occasions I had to wait for leopard tortoises to cross the track and
once swerved to avoid a chameleon, bright green against the khaki sand,
rocking its way so very slowly over the ruts.
But it was wild dogs I wanted to see, and the more I questioned <PERSON>Gus Mills</PERSON>,
the more mysteries I encountered. Packs, for instance, fluctuate markedly in
size, and <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Skukuza</LOCATION> pack, which numbered 40 dogs in <DATE>1989</DATE>, now
consists of just three males.
Dogs disappear in large numbers for no apparent reason, and bodies are
rarely found. This was the reason for putting a collar on a second animal of
the Mbyamiti pack, as an insurance against the death or disappearance of the
dog already collared.
In <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON>, a wild dog's expectation of life is unusually short - rarely
beyond four years (a hyena's is about 15). Gus has heard several accounts of
lions killing both adults and pups, and would like to investigate more fully
the role lions play in the lives of dogs.
Fortunately, international awareness is growing. The <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> wild dog study
is funded by the <ORGANIZATION>National Parks Board</ORGANIZATION> and the independent <PERSON>Stuart Bromfield</PERSON>
Wild Dog Fund of the <ORGANIZATION>Endangered Wildlife Trust</ORGANIZATION>. This trust also finances
other wild dog projects in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, along with the newly-established
Licaone Fund in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>International Union</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Conservation of Nature</ORGANIZATION> has
published an action plan for African wild dogs, so there is considerable
hope for the future.
I spent a week in <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON>, and it wasn't until my last day that I found dogs
for myself. The sun was sinking and, briefly, painting the bush a golden
green. The insects were tuning up for their evening chorus and the cacophony
of guinea fowl was at its loudest. There was a sudden snort from an impala
ram in the undergrowth beside the vehicle and he quickly made himself
scarce.
Then I was aware that, coming towards me along the road ahead, were a dozen
lean dark silhouettes with familiar big round ears. The long legs carrying
those lithe bodies touched the ground so lightly that the animals almost
seemed to float along in a distance-devouring trot. I stopped quickly and
the grinning dogs went by. The sun lit them for a second, then they wheeled
and melted into the trees - a moment of pure magic.
<PERSON>Michael Woods</PERSON> was a guest of the <ORGANIZATION>South African Tourism Board</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> tel:
081-944-8080) and <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> national park.
He flew from <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION>KLM</ORGANIZATION> and then caught its long-haul
flight to <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>KLM</ORGANIZATION> runs a similar service from 16 UK regional
airports, thus avoiding the often time-consuming journey to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and the
two-hour check-in.

   Not all the animals running loose in <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION> are dogs, cats or freewheeling cab drivers. It IS a jungle out
there.
   ``I don't expect to see a zebra, but then again this is <LOCATION>Fun City</LOCATION>
so you'll never know,'' said <PERSON>George S. Watford</PERSON>, head of rescue
services for the <ORGANIZATION>American Society</ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
   In 28 years with the humane society, <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION> has seen
alligators, baboons, bears, barn owls, caimans, chimpanzees and
eagles. Foxes, horses, lambs, lions, mandrills and monitor lizards.
Parrots, peregrine falcons, pigs, raccoons, sea turtles and sheep.
Swans, tarantulas and tigers.
   They all make their way to special <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION> preserves such as the
room marked ``EXOTIC ANIMALS'' at the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> shelter. There, in
the din of baying dogs and mewling cats, one can occasionally hear
a hiss, screech or roar more common to the wilds of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> or
deepest <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   Last year, officials say, the organization captured 5,304 exotic
animals _ a category that includes everything but dogs and cats.
But it takes something special to turn the head of an <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION> veteran.
   ``People consider bats exotic,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>. ``We don't. We
get a lot of them flying through <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.''
   The <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> shelter had three quail in its exotic ward one
recent day; they had been seized from a pet store because selling
the birds is illegal. Two weeks earlier, the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> shelter
confiscated a ram from a Moslem family planning to slaughter it for
a feast.
   In <DATE>December</DATE>, a South American cargo ship 400 miles offshore
radioed that an osprey had crash-landed on its deck. Once the
vessel was in the harbor, a shelter worker was dispatched in a
motor launch to retrieve the fish-eating hawk, now on the
endangered species list.
   In the Greatest Hits category, nothing tops the Burmese python
that police discovered protecting a <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> drug dealer's apartment.
   ``I've never seen anything that large, anything that weighed
more than me in the snake area. And I weigh 200 pounds,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>. The python was estimated to weigh 300 to 350 pounds. It
measured 16 feet long and at least 30 inches around at the head. In
the exotic animal room, the snake stood straight up on its tail and
sniffed the ceiling.
   Police told <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION> the diet of the ``guard snake'' had been
full-grown rabbits, six at a time.
   ``If it got around your neck, God knows what would happen,'' he
said. ``It was certainly capable of swallowing a 12-year-old kid
whole.''
   Watford does not always know how the animals come to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
``How does a sea turtle end up in a bathroom in upper <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>?''
he said with a shrug. But he does know how they come to the
attention of the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION>.
   They run amok.
   Take snakes. ``(Owners) wake up one morning and it's not where
it's supposed to be. It's not in the glass aquarium. Maybe the
neighbor finds it in her bathtub. Or under her bed. Or in her bed.
That creates the kind of environment that is quite frightening.''
   Sometimes, the animals are involved in crimes. <PERSON>Richard A. Orzo</PERSON>,
a 32-year veteran of the rescue service, remembers a monkey trained
to perform specialized burglaries. The owner would cut circular
holes in the windows of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> liquor stores and send the monkey
in for cocktails.
   Sometimes, the animals kill. Two years ago, a <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> woman was
found dead in her home near aquariums full of venom-spitting cobras.
   ``They're fascinating. They're beautiful,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>.
``People fall in love with snakes, even the most venomous type. ..
. Just a nick and it could kill you.''
   Often, it is not humans but the animals who are imperiled.
Scores of barnyard animals have been confiscated before they could
be sacrificed in religious ceremonies.
   ``We take a dim view of the killing of any animal,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Watford</ORGANIZATION>.
   Once captured, the animals are given to zoos, sent to animal
farms or, when possible, released into the wild. They are not
returned to their owners; keeping exotic animals is against <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION> health codes.
   The owners, who sometimes have invested thousands of dollars, do
not always relinquish the beasts gracefully.
   Police took custody of an ocelot after the forest cat ripped
open both arms of its mistress, a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> woman. Her arms were placed
in casts, and her cat was placed with the <ORGANIZATION>ASPCA</ORGANIZATION>.
   When she came to visit, shelter workers left her briefly alone
with her pet and she was next seen trying to spirit the ocelot out
the door, cradling it in her casts.

<HEAD>Toledo Lines Up For Glimpse Of Giant Pandas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people caught a long-awaited
glimpse of two giant pandas that went on display at the <LOCATION>Toledo Zoo</LOCATION>
over the objections of a conservation group that wants the
endangered animals returned to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   The exhibit, which began <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after nine months of planning,
marks the first time the Chinese have permitted two pandas to be
exhibited together at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> zoo. The animals are on loan to the
zoo until <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>.
   Le Le and <PERSON>Nan Nan</PERSON> made their debut before an invitation-only
crowd of about 250. Later, the zoo opened its gates to hundreds who
had waited in line since dawn.
   About 5,000 people visited the zoo on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, zoo spokeswoman
<PERSON>Betsy Clark</PERSON> said. The zoo has between 2,000 and 3,000 visitors on
an average weekday. Up to 1 million are expected to see the pandas
by the time the display ends.
   ``They're so cute,'' said <PERSON>Lorraine Grove</PERSON>, 18, of Port <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>.
``I waited on line for three hours, but it was definitely worth
it.''
   The international World Wildlife Fund contends the exhibit could
endanger the pandas and had gone to court to prevent the animals
from going on display.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the wildlife fund asked a federal court <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
to shut down the exhibit, charging it represents commercial use of
the pandas in violation of the Endangered Species Act and an
international wildlife convention.
   The group asked for an expedited hearing, which is expected to
be set after the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> files its response
within five days.
   ``It is the first short-term panda exhibit in which both animals
are of prime breeding age and were taken from a captive breeding
and research facility,'' said <PERSON>Kenneth Cook</PERSON>, spokesman for the
wildlife fund.
   ``It is no exaggeration to say that among zoo professionals and
conservationists, these might be considered to be among two of the
most valuable animals on the planet.''
   The zoo has spent nearly <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> in preparing to exhibit the
pandas, including <MONEY>$1.9 million</MONEY> for their quarters. <PERSON>Edwin Bergsmark</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Toledo Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, said the exhibit is
aimed primarily at children.
   ``They are, perhaps, the last generation that will be able to
enjoy seeing the giant pandas if the immense conservation efforts
being employed by the Chinese do not receive unified support from
the conservation world,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Viki Billis</PERSON> and her 21-month-old son, <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON>, were among the
first in line.
   ``This is very exciting for <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>. We needed this. Every mother
and father should take time out and bring their children to the
zoo,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Billis</PERSON> said.

FT  02 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Profits from preservation - As
many US zoos are privatised, they are beginning to undergo an ecological
awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanging in the personnel offices of the <PERSON>Franklin Park Zoo</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> is a
poster which reads: 'Extinction is forever.' At the hot dog stand, a message
has been taped to the napkin dispenser: 'Please conserve. Save a tree.' At
the African tropical rain forest exhibit, an entire wall is devoted to
explaining the ecological dangers facing rain forests in the world.
Welcome to the modern zoo, a hotbed of environmental activism.
Zoos and aquariums have come a long way since the dark days of cramped cages
and disregard for animals in the wild. While the image emanating from
<LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> is still negative - the popular children's film Free Willy, about
a whale, caused an international furore last year when its decrepit
real-life living conditions in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> were discovered - most US zoos
and aquariums today are highly sensitive to environmental concerns.
Zoos in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are now seeking to redefine their ecological role in the face
of increasing fund shortages. Since many US zoos and aquariums have been
privatised, they are more dependent on their own revenue streams, and are
under pressure to set priorities. The challenge will be to continue
environmental programmes in a cost-effective way.
'Increased co-operation between international zoos will become more
important in the face of severe fund shortages,' says <PERSON>Michael Wallace</PERSON>,
curator of conservation at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Zoo</LOCATION>. Animal conservation will
continue to be one of the mainstays of zoos' ecological efforts.
'Zoos went through an awakening on animal conservation,' says <PERSON>John Linehan</PERSON>,
general curator for the Franklin Park Zoo. 'In the past, we'd be happy if
the animals had a few babies now and then, to attract the public, but that
was the extent of our breeding efforts. Then we started noticing that
animals were getting harder to find and more expensive. We realised this
great resource we had, and that we could become a major player in animal
conservation.'
A number of species exist only in captivity, and zoos and aquaria breed
these species to prevent extinction. Reintroduction of the animals into the
wild is the ultimate goal in many cases, and some zoos have chalked up
stunning successes in this area.
The Arabian oryx, a large antelope, for example, was extinct in the wild
until zoos began to reintroduce the animal in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and <DATE>1980s</DATE>. Today,
several hundred roam the deserts of <LOCATION>Oman</LOCATION>. Similarly, the black-footed ferret
was successfully reintroduced in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Sumatra</LOCATION> tiger in
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>.
There are numerous pitfalls to reintroduction, however. The programmes are
extremely expensive to administer, so the number of targeted species must be
limited. Moreover, many involved in the industry complain that zoos and
aquariums are too often the last-ditch effort.
'Reintroduction from zoo populations is usually a last resort, an
after-thought,' says <PERSON>Michael Hutchins</PERSON>, director of conservation and science
at the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums. 'Releasing
animals back into the wild would be more effective - and less expensive - if
we did it before numbers dwindled to a dangerous level. It's a lot easier to
boost the numbers of existing populations than to create a population from
scratch.'
Zoos hope to correct this problem by becoming increasingly involved in 'in
situ' conservation - that is, conservation in the wild.
Involving local people is the key to an effective reintroduction programme,
say conservationists. Poverty-stricken people understandably see
conservation as a luxury, and will often not hesitate to hunt endangered
species, or log forest areas necessary for the species' survival. Along the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, for instance, locals have been employed as guards
and monitors for the golden-eyed tamarin. 'The people who are dependent on
this animal's survival to make a living become staunch protectionists,' says
<PERSON>Benjamin Beck</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION>.
Zoos and aquariums also see education as a priority in their preservation
efforts. According to <LOCATION>AAZPA</LOCATION>, whose members had a budget of Dollars 825m
(Pounds 557m) last year, 105m people visited a zoo or aquarium in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
<DATE>last year</DATE>. 'That gives us a tremendous potential to reach the public,' says
<PERSON>Hutchins</PERSON>. As an added advantage, educational programmes are relatively
inexpensive to administer.
In addition, aquariums are especially good at incorporating animals into
their entertainment mix. Marine animal 'acts' often include environmental
messages. A sea lion at the <ORGANIZATION>New England Aquarium</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, makes a show
of tossing rubbish into the appropriate recycling containers.
While conservation efforts and education will continue, ecological
fund-raising at many zoos is likely to be curtailed over the next few years.
With limited resources, zoos say they cannot afford to raise money for
causes other than their own. So benefits for other wildlife organisations
are likely to be phased out. Research is also controversial, with many
institutions believing funds are too short to stretch themselves far in that
area.
Indeed, the availability of funds over the next few years will help
determine the number of environmental projects zoos and aquariums involve
themselves in. Environmentalism is important, say zoo officials and
managers, but they cannot afford to lose sight of their main function, which
is to provide entertainment.
'If people don't have fun, they will stop coming,' says <PERSON>Ronald Tilson</PERSON>,
director of conservation at the <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, 'and that will be the end of
our ecological involvement. While we're worrying about environmental issues
we have to make sure that our visitors are having a good time with the
animals. In the end, that may be the most important message of all.'

<HEAD>Trade in Endangered Species Up in Holiday Season, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal traders make about <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> a year
from crocodiles, parrots, chimpanzees and other endangered
wildlife, and many of the animals suffocate or starve during
shipment, a wildlife enforcement official said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the <DATE>summer</DATE>
and Christmas holiday seasons because customs officials often are
overloaded and the shipments slip past them, <PERSON>Jean-Patrick Le Duc</PERSON>
told a news conference.
   Le Duc is an enforcement official for the <ORGANIZATION>Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Flora</PERSON>,
which aims to prevent international trade from threatening species
with extinction.
   The convention, in force since <DATE>1975</DATE>, has been ratified by 95
countries, including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, most Latin American
countries except <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and many Asian, African and European
nations.
   Signatories are supposed to enforce bans on commercial trade in
an agreed list of endangered species and to regulate trade in
others that might become endangered.
   Endangered species on the list include all apes, the giant
panda, many South American monkeys, the Asian elephant, all
rhinoceroses, many birds of prey and parrots, all sea turtles, some
crocodiles and great whales. No permits are issued for
international trade in these species except under unusual
circumstances.
   Le <PERSON>Duc</PERSON> said many people think live animals make good Christmas
presents. In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, for example, parrots and reptiles including
baby crocodiles are increasingly popular pets.
   He said total trade, legal and illegal, in wildlife amounts to
<MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> annually. He estimated that illegal trade is about <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> of the total.
   The hotspots of illicit wildlife trade are <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, although ``<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> is doing more
than any other developing country'' to try to control it, Le <PERSON>Duc</PERSON>
said.
   But he said a trader could buy a gray parrot in <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION> for about
<MONEY>$10</MONEY> and resell it for about <MONEY>$600</MONEY> in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
   A statement from the convention's headquarters in <LOCATION>Lausanne</LOCATION>
listed 10 examples of illicit trade that have been thwarted in the
past 10 weeks.
   In one case, ``a notorious convicted animal trader'' sent crates
with live animals from <LOCATION>Equatorial Guinea</LOCATION> destined for <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> via
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, it said.
   ``At <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> airport, customs agents stopped the shipment. In the
crates they found five chimpanzees (two dead), 12 crocodiles (three
dead) nine Mandrill monkeys (one dead), 11 Agama lizards (nine
dead), seven tortoises, 17 Saimiri monkeys (two dead) and 31 gray
parrots,'' the statement said. ``The surviving animals were given
to the <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> Zoo.''
   In two other cases, 8,000 baby crocodiles were shipped from
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, it said. One shipment of 2,000 was discovered
because of the stench of about 1,500 that had died.
   The statement said a female Asian elephant recently arrived in
the Dutch port of <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> ``hidden in a large
crate.'' Her skin had dried up during the one-month journey and she
was ``in a pitiful state,'' it said. The elephant survived and is
at the <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> Zoo.

MOVING DAY ARRIVES FOR COLLEGE ANIMALS;

EDUCATION: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S NEW TRAINING FACILITY RECEIVES THE FIRST OF 200 
INHABITANTS. IT WILL BECOME THE COUNTY'S FIRST PUBLIC ZOO.

<P>
With a horde of photographers snapping their every move, <PERSON>Rosie</PERSON> and Fernando 
settled into their half-finished <MONEY>$2-million</MONEY> home <DATE>Friday</DATE>, high on a windy 
hilltop overlooking <LOCATION>Moorpark</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie the baboon and <PERSON>Fernando Llama</PERSON> -- a llama, of course -- became the first 
animals to move into <ORGANIZATION>Moorpark College</ORGANIZATION>'s new training zoo for the school's 
Exotic Animal Training and Management Program. 
</P>
<P>
When the long-awaited facility opens to the public, possibly in <DATE>September</DATE>, it 
will become <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION>'s first public zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"This facility will be different from any other zoo, in that we train animals," 
said program director <PERSON>Gary Wilson</PERSON>, unveiling the new zoo. "It will emphasize 
teaching people about the importance of animals, how they live in the wild and 
why we should be concerned about them." 
</P>
<P>
So far, college officials have spent <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> to erect cages and fences to hold 
the program's nearly 200 animals in the new zoo, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said. The facility, 
with a sweeping mountain view, sits on a hill overlooking the original one-acre 
compound, which has housed the college's program since it was founded in <DATE>1974</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
When the new facility is completed, it will encompass about eight acres and 
include a 400-seat amphitheater, a replica of a tropical rain forest in a 
converted greenhouse, a reptile house, a children's exhibit and a gift shop and 
concession stand, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The college has been seeking money to build a large facility ever since 
<LOCATION>Moorpark</LOCATION> officials first raised the idea of a zoo on the campus in <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
College district officials subsequently approved the plan in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The college has raised an additional <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in contributions to continue work 
on the zoo but needs <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> more to complete it, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Moorpark College Foundation</ORGANIZATION> is overseeing the fund raising for the new 
facility, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lawrence Lloyd</PERSON>, vice president for administrative services, said the college is 
counting on grants, private donations and other sources of money to get the zoo 
ready for the public by this <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Moorpark College</ORGANIZATION> is the only school in the nation to offer a scholastic program 
in zoo keeping and animal training, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Community College</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Gainseville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, has a zoo-keeping program but does not offer animal 
training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 students are enrolled in the program, which teaches them to become 
animal trainers and zookeepers. This year's class of 21 students will graduate 
next week. Previous graduates have landed jobs in the motion picture industry 
as well as in zoos and other animal facilities worldwide, including the <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> 
Zoo and <ORGANIZATION>Universal Studios</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, said Bill (<PERSON>Briz</PERSON>) <PERSON>Brisby</PERSON>, who founded the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with one wolf on a chain," <PERSON>Brisby</PERSON> said of the program's beginnings 
in <DATE>1974</DATE>. At its peak, the program had as many as 800 animals tended by student 
zookeepers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About six years ago, college officials reduced the number of animals by about a 
third after the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> found that some animals lacked adequate shelter, 
<PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, the facility has had "a virtually spotless record." 
</P>
<P>
"We are a place where distressed animals are taken in when we can handle the 
situation," <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> said. "We have a very good reputation with people who care 
about animals." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, college officials will begin transferring other animals to the new 
cages. On <DATE>May 14</DATE>, two lions and two tigers will move to their new home. The 
transfer of all the animals, including a gazelle, a water buffalo, a sea lion 
and exotic birds and reptiles, will be completed by early <DATE>June</DATE>, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the zoo opens, the school needs to receive accreditation from the 
<ORGANIZATION>American Assn. of Zoological Parks</ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums. The facility also must be 
approved by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> 
and Game. 
</P>
<P>
When it finally opens to the public, however, the zoo will still serve mainly 
as a teaching tool, <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary purpose is not the building of the zoo," <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> said. "It's the 
expanding of the educational facility for a program that's been in place since 
<DATE>1974</DATE>."

A TRIP TO THE zoo is a favorite outing, but weekends often bring capacity 
crowds. Parents who have elbowed their way in for a glimpse of the chimps once 
too often will probably like to know that there are several <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> 
colleges where animals are regularly on view -- usually without the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Because <ORGANIZATION>Moorpark College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Moorpark</LOCATION> offers courses for would-be zookeepers and 
animal trainers, the college keeps more than 350 exotic animals on campus. 
Although the stalls are not open to the public, people are welcome to observe 
the animals from a walk that encircles the compound. Animals in residence 
include tigers, lions, wolves, coyotes, water buffalo and ocelots. There is 
also a petting zoo with goats, sheep, rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as a 
weekly animal show at the wildlife theater. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Cal Poly Pomona</LOCATION> maintains barns that house sheep, pigs and cattle, as well as 
the stables of its renowned Kellogg Arabian horses -- all of which can be 
visited. During the school year there is also a monthly horse show at the 
state-of-the-art Arabian Horse Center, a tradition that dates back 63 years to 
founder and breakfast cereal magnate <PERSON>W. K. Kellogg</PERSON>. The show includes jumping, 
vaulting (gymnastics on horseback), trick horses and costumed riders. 
</P>
<P>
Time was when most youngsters either lived on a farm or knew someone who did. 
Today's urban and suburban kids can get a idea of agricultural life from a 
visit to the <ORGANIZATION>Pierce College Farm</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Woodland Hills</LOCATION>. This working farm is home 
to chickens, horses, sheep, pigs and cattle. Because these are farm animals, 
not pets, children are able to observe but not touch the animals. The walking 
tour of the farm lasts about 2 hours (no strollers; backpacks OK). The <ORGANIZATION>Pierce 
College Farm</ORGANIZATION> is also the site of an annual rodeo each <DATE>May</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
 The <ORGANIZATION>Moorpark College Exotic Animal Compound</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Moorpark</LOCATION>: Weekly animal show on 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME>; admission is <MONEY>$2</MONEY> adults, <MONEY>$1</MONEY> for children. The petting zoo is 
open from 10 a.m to <TIME>2:30 p.m.</TIME> daily; admission <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>. No reservations 
needed, but larger groups can make arrangements for special shows. 
</P>
<P>
 <LOCATION>Cal Poly Pomona</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION>: The barns and stables are open from <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>4 
p.m.</TIME> daily; no charge. Families can tour the barns unescorted; larger groups 
must make an appointment for a guided tour. Horse shows are held <DATE>October</DATE> to 
<DATE>June</DATE> on the <DATE>first Sunday</DATE> of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 <ORGANIZATION>Pierce College Farm</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Woodland Hills</LOCATION>: Public tours each at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> on 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>; tours are <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> per person. Reservations required. No tours in 
<DATE>August</DATE>. School groups can tour <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> during the 
school year.

<HEAD>Trade in Endangered Species Up in Holiday Season, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal trade in endangered or protected wildlife
such as crocodiles, parrots and chimpanzees represents an estimated
<MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> annually, an official responsible for enforcing an
international treaty protecting such species said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the <DATE>summer</DATE>

   Speaking of turtles, there is something slower: The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of the Interior</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Four years ago, three environmental groups asked the <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION>'s Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> to list <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> desert tortoises (land turtles) as endangered. 
This week, the tortoises finally made the list. 

   But it may be a little late: "Off-the-road vehicles, illegal collecting, suburban development and now a new respiratory disease have already ravaged the species," says <PERSON>James Middaugh</PERSON>, press director of the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION>, one of the three groups. 

   "I've got to admit we dragged our heels," says <PERSON>Craig Rieben</PERSON>, the service's information officer. 
"Two of our geographical regions just couldn't agree on what to do." 

   Turtles may be cold-blooded, but they bring out tender feelings in warm-hearted people. 
When 87-year-old <PERSON>Beatie Vickers</PERSON> entered a nursing home in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, she insisted that <PERSON>Joey</PERSON> the turtle, whom she found in her garden decades ago, move in with her. 
"We've put it in a child's playpen in the garden, where <PERSON>Beatie</PERSON> goes all the time," says <PERSON>Ann Derry</PERSON>, who runs the home. 
"After all, she's known <PERSON>Joey</PERSON> since she was six years old." 

   As pets, turtles are appreciated by people with imagination. 
<PERSON>Marlyn Goldenberg</PERSON>, of the <LOCATION>California Turtle</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tortoise Club</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> chapter, likes turtles because they "project love but don't overdo it." 
She adds: "Just because they don't wag their tails like dogs doesn't mean they're not affectionate. 
I tell my two turtles, 'Have a nice day,' when I go to work." 

   Turtles have been residents of the earth since Triassic times, 200 million years ago. 
But today, the order Testudinata is in danger. 
"Human beings may do them in before any of their natural enemies," says <PERSON>Glenn Stewart</PERSON>, a professor of zoology at <ORGANIZATION>California State Polytechnic University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
"We'd better be careful," he adds. 

   Maybe if people knew more about turtles, and how strongly some people take to them, the turtle would be treated with more respect. 
Two years ago <PERSON>Eric Platt</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, won a <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> court judgment against a landscaper <PERSON>Mr. Platt</PERSON> says killed the year-old, four-pound tortoise he had imported from <LOCATION>Aldabra Island</LOCATION>, off the coast of east <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
"It's a rare animal and I was devastated when it was killed," says <PERSON>Mr. Platt</PERSON>. 
"It was run over by a lawn mower only eight days after I got it." 

   The landscaper didn't appear for a small-claims court hearing and <PERSON>Mr. Platt</PERSON> was awarded the turtle's cost by default. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Platt</PERSON> never received compensation for his loss. 
The landscaper has disappeared, and there's a warrant out for his arrest, says <PERSON>Mr. Platt</PERSON>. 
"Since then, I've gotten two turtles and they never leave my sight," says <PERSON>Mr. Platt</PERSON>, who runs an auto-tire repair shop. 

   Turtles aren't born to run, but some can go pretty fast. 
Al, a 325-pound African Aldabra at the <LOCATION>El Paso Zoo</LOCATION>, once whizzed around the zoo like a kid on a skateboard. 
That's because Al was attached to a skateboard. 

   After his forepaw was injured a few years ago, zoo employees devised the arrangement for Al. 
"He was then able to beat any hare at the zoo," says <PERSON>Robin Dalton</PERSON>, zoo curator. 

   In <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Harlan Hansen</PERSON>, a retired electronics engineer, owns a turtle named Speedy that occasionally runs away from home to zip along a nearby freeway. 
"Boy, can that turtle travel," says <PERSON>Mr. Hansen</PERSON>. 
"They're supposed to be slow but this guy, even though he is 75 years old, has long legs." 

   At <ORGANIZATION>Brennan's Bar</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Marina Del Rey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, some turtles who have been racing over the <DATE>past 14 years</DATE> are far from slow. 
One recently flashed across the six-foot racetrack in 1.2 seconds. 
<PERSON>James Duffer</PERSON>, who runs the races wearing a velvet green tuxedo, does concede, however, that the slowest race took more than 25 minutes, or more than four minutes per foot. 
"Slow but sure won that race," he says. 

   But not everyone admires thoroughbred turtle racing. 
Two years ago the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Society</ORGANIZATION> for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sued the Goal Post Restaurant in <LOCATION>Fanwood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, alleging that the bar abused both turtles and goldfish by racing them. 

   A trial judge fined the racing promoters <MONEY>$50</MONEY> plus court costs for being cruel to the fish, which were taken out of a bowl by hand, and placed in a rain-gutter starting gate. 
"If we'd only moved it with a net rather than our hand, we wouldn't have been accused of cruelty to the fish," says <PERSON>Gary Ferruggia</PERSON>, owner of Goal Post. 
But the judge permitted the turtle races to continue. 

   <PERSON>Harry Cohen</PERSON>, who races turtles at the Goal Post on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> nights down a six-lane, 16-foot track to the strains of "Rocky," says he has shelled out thousands of dollars in court costs for defending himself against animal-rights groups. 
"Racing reptiles, ducks, hamsters, gerbils, baby alligators, bullfrogs and even lobsters -- backwards -- is my thing," says <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON>. 
Last year he spent a night in jail for "civil abuse of a turtle" he had been racing. 

   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, last year, radio station WCXR-FM decided to replace two live turtles with mechanical look-alikes after getting complaints about an upcoming turtle race the station was sponsoring. 

   The station had planned to use the race to promote a concert by a <DATE>1960s</DATE> rock group called the Turtles (hit song: "Happy Together"). 
"But we decided that using live turtles wasn't worth the aggravation," says <PERSON>Mark Lapidus</PERSON>, the station's promotion manager. 
"Some protesters complained that we were disturbing the psyche and consciousness of the animals." 

   Turtles face even bigger dangers than racing. 
In the western <ORGANIZATION>Mojave Desert</ORGANIZATION>, they now are used as target practice by civilians and their habitat was once a bombing range for the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>. 
"If we killed any tortoises, we weren't aware of it and didn't purposely do it," says a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>George Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
For almost two decades, bombers from the base dropped practice or small-explosive bombs on a nearby area where the tortoises live. 

   "We stopped in <DATE>1982</DATE> because the area is too close to a busy highway to <PERSON>Reno</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>," says the spokesman. 
He says the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> had assured the base that a lot of tortoises didn't live there. 

   <PERSON>Kristin Berry</PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION>, says that in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Fremont Valley</LOCATION>, less than 70 of 200 tortoises seen in <DATE>1981</DATE> in a sample mile-square area are still alive. 
"Many were shot, some had their backs pounded in or were run over by off-the-road vehicles," she says. 
"In other areas of the desert, the turtles are being taken for food or as pets." 

   For as long as turtles have been around, their main defense has been their shells, which haven't always made them as impervious to attack as turtle lovers would like. 
Because all turtles are ectothermic -- their blood takes on the temperature of their surroundings -- they must bask in the sun, on rocks or on high ground. 

   For this reason, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> desert turtles are easy prey for ravens, which divebomb them and break open their shells. 
The ravens had become such a threat that the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> planned to poison them. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Humane Society of America</ORGANIZATION> got a court ban against it last month in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 

   "Whatever the government does in regard to protecting endangered animals, it hears about it," says <PERSON>Thomas Wilson</PERSON>, information officer for the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Interior</ORGANIZATION>. 
When the <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION> protected the spotted owl, the lumber industry complained it was putting thousands of people out of work because of a ban on cutting down the trees in which the owls nested. 
The shrimp industry is currently complaining about a requirement that shrimpers fit their nets with devices that permit sea turtles to escape because the industry says it's losing too much shrimp. 

   "Now that we're protecting the desert tortoise, wait and see all the people who'll complain about it," says <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Steve Robinson</PERSON>, acting director of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Services</ORGANIZATION>, says cattle ranchers are angry because protecting the tortoise could hinder the ranchers' grazing rights on federal lands.

   <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON> found it's a jungle out there.
   Zoo <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>'s famous gorilla saw something <DATE>Friday</DATE> he hasn't seen
since he was captured in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 27 years ago: green grass beneath
his feet and open sky above his head.
   As reporters and photographers watched from behind trees and
across a protective moat, the 30-year-old lowland gorilla stepped
hesitantly into his new outdoor quarters, a <MONEY>$4.5 million</MONEY> simulated
rain forest where he will live near 13 other gorillas and a host of
other apes.
   Skeptical of those watching him, he spent almost an hour
stepping back and forth from his enclosed shelter before he seemed
secure enough to run atop his hill, scamper for food and begin
ripping down tree limbs.
   ``I think he has responded well. He came through. He seems to be
enjoying his environment,'' beaming Zoo <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Director <PERSON>Terry
Maple</PERSON> said.
   Last month, <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON> was moved from his tile-walled,
steel-barred cage _ his home since he arrived at the zoo in <DATE>1961</DATE> _
into the new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter.
   After five weeks to grow accustomed to the enclosure, with his
keeper of 14 years often sleeping nearby to keep him company, he
was allowed to roam free. Zoo officials don't know if he can
remember being outdoors.
   In a physical last month, <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> weighed in at 460 pounds, about
60 pounds overweight, but not too bad after 25 years in a cage,
<ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION> said.
   For now, <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> will live in an area of his own, adjacent to
three ``families'' of gorillas on loan from <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Yerkes Primate Research Center</ORGANIZATION>. They're all separated to prevent
fights. Zoo officials hope that within a year, he can be introduced
to another gorilla _ probably a female, with whom they hope he'll
breed.
   The new exhibit, according to <LOCATION>Zoo Atlanta</LOCATION> officials, is the most
advanced gorilla habitat at any zoo. Named the <ORGANIZATION>Ford African Rain
Forest</ORGANIZATION> and built with <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> from the automaker, it's the
latest stage in a <MONEY>$26 million</MONEY> renovation at the 99-year-old zoo.
   The exhibit will open to the public <DATE>June 11</DATE>.
   Just <DATE>four years ago</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Humane Society</ORGANIZATION> named the zoo one
of the nation's worst. The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> slapped
sanctions on the zoo for poor record-keeping on animal care. The
deaths of star animals made national headlines and political
turmoil gripped the city-owned attraction.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Maple</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> animal behavior specialist who
helped turn around the <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> zoo, was named director, and
operations were handed to a non-profit agency. Maple took to
calling Zoo <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> ``the world's next great zoo,'' and proceeded
to convert the old facility into a modern, natural animal habitat.
   ``It's a great day for Zoo <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Maple</PERSON> said.``As of this
moment we have arrived as a big-league zoo.
   Plans call for a complete renovation by <DATE>1991</DATE>, with animals
roaming in natural habitats rather than cages.
   As for <PERSON>Willie B.</PERSON>, <DATE>Friday</DATE> was not his first time in the
limelight. In <DATE>1981</DATE> an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> TV station handed him a suitcase to
recreate a popular luggage commercial which showed an ape bashing _
but not breaking _ the product.
   Willie ripped the leather cover off the suitcase, ripped the two
sides apart from the hinges, filled one half with water and drank
from it.

   ``Extinction is Forever'' is the
motto at naturalist <PERSON>Gerald Durrell</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jersey Wildlife Preservation
Trust</ORGANIZATION>. Its symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird of
<LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> that became extinct in the <DATE>1690s</DATE>.
   It's goal is to keep more of the world's animals from becoming
extinct.
   The zoo boasts the world's most comprehensive collection of
endangered species. It protects animals by breeding them in
captivity and returning their offspring to the wild.
   On 25 beautifully landscaped acres of <LOCATION>Jersey</LOCATION>, the main island of
the English Channel archipelago, the zoo tries to recreate natural
settings for its charges.
   The trust also trains interns from all over the world to promote
animal survival in their own countries.
   ``We are not trying to maintain a living museum,'' said <PERSON>Anthony
Allchurch</PERSON>, the zoo's general administrator. ``We have a job to do.
If it happens that the public is interested in what we're doing,
that's great.''
   Founded in <DATE>1959</DATE>, the zoo started out as a place where <PERSON>Durrell</PERSON>
kept the animals he collected during his expeditions. Four years
later, he formed the trust as a registered charity.
   ``The release of animals back into their natural habitat is the
ultimate goal for each of the species that we so carefully
nurture,'' <PERSON>Durrell</PERSON> has said.
   The white-bearded, 64-year-old Briton lives in <LOCATION>Les Augres Manor</LOCATION>
on the zoo grounds with his American wife Lee but was traveling and
unavailable to talk about his project with a visiting reporter.
   His books have been published in 26 languages. The best known is
``My Family and Other Animals,'' about his childhood on the Greek
island of <LOCATION>Corfu</LOCATION>. He also has produced numerous television
documentaries about animals. He is the younger brother of the famed
novelist <PERSON>Lawrence Durrell</PERSON>, author of the ``<LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> Quartet'' and
other works.
   The zoo concentrates on six major geographical areas: northern
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>, southeastern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Mascarene Islands</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>.
   It works closely with governments, wildlife groups, and other
zoos, including the National Zoo in <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION>
   ``If we didn't work with government support and blessing, we
wouldn't achieve half of what we do,'' <PERSON>Allchurch</PERSON> said.
   The first animals that the zoo returned to a natural habitat were
14 pink pigeons that were placed in a botanical garden in the
<LOCATION>Mascarene</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Three years later, the zoo placed pink pigeons in an area of
native forest that hadn't been inhabited by these birds for 10
years. To date, 19 have been returned to the wilderness, and,
significantly, two have been born there.
   ``We don't befriend, socialize, train or handle animals, to
enhance their chance of surviving the wild, if they ever get
there,'' <PERSON>Allchurch</PERSON> said.
   The zoo also sent Jamaican hutias, large brown rodents, back to
their island and is returning kestrels to <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION>.
   ``A lot of rare animals are dull and brown. But two dull brown
parents with a baby are very exciting,'' <PERSON>Allchurch</PERSON> said.
   The zoo also has been a partner in programs to return golden lion
tamarins to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> starlings to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and thick-billed
parrots to <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1978</DATE>, the trust established its training program, which has
educated some 250 trainees from more than 40 countries. Many already
have had veterinary training, and they spend two to four months at
the zoo.
   ``You learn a lot. It's a great place here,'' said <PERSON>Susana
Ringenbach</PERSON>, a 27-year-old trainee from <LOCATION>Tlalpan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. `You can
learn to educate the children not to go out and hunt.''
   She said she was inspired by <PERSON>Durrell</PERSON>'s books and is particularly
interested in helping jaguars and spider monkeys.
   The trust has annual income of <MONEY>$2.2 million</MONEY>, <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of it
from entrance fees. About 340,000 people visited the zoo <DATE>last year</DATE>.
   The remainder of the financing comes from private donations.
Along with its sister trusts in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, it has
20,000 members.

   New York -- Judy, a Baringo giraffe at Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo, has twisted her ankle. Over at the St. Louis Zoo, a
King penguin is limping from a torn toenail. An elephant at
Washington's National Zoo is down in the mouth with an
impacted tooth. And at the San Diego Zoo, a Gila monster is
feeling as hideous as it looks, thanks to a nasty mouth
infection.
   Zoo animals, like the people who come to gawk at them, get
sick once in a while. The difference is that their doctors
never charge them and sometimes they even make house calls.

<TEXT>
   "I would say our health plan is as good as Blue Cross,"
said <PERSON>Dr. Robert A. Cook</PERSON>, chief veterinarian for the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Zoo</ORGANIZATION>, the
Central Park Zoo and the <LOCATION>New York Aquarium</LOCATION>. "Dental's
included . . . there's no deductible."
   Dr. <ORGANIZATION>Cook's Animal Health Center</ORGANIZATION>, a handsome two-story
building on the grounds of the <LOCATION>Bronx Zoo</LOCATION>, is one of the
biggest zoo hospitals in the country. The health center
oversees the well-being of the society's more than 9,000
animals. If a recent visit is any indication, members of this
zoological health plan receive better medical care than most
of their <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> neighbors -- the human ones, that is.
   It starts with a no-holds-barred checkup for every
newcomer. A recent morning found <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> busy arranging for
the arrival of a group of tamarin monkeys from another zoo,
which would stay at the clinic for a month-long quarantine
period.
   "They'll undergo TB tests, chest X-rays,
electrocardiogram, <ORGANIZATION>CBC</ORGANIZATION> {complete blood count}, a biochemical
profile, a viral screen, a physical exam-plus dental work, if
they need it," said <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>, an easy-going fellow with a
cage-side manner soothing to tamarins and tapirs alike.
   His day had started, like most, with the <TIME>7:30 a.m.</TIME> rounds
accompanied by the center's two other veterinary clinicians.
Apart from the quarantined animals -- a group of deer, some
caged sugar gliders (marsupials from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>) and a <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>
rat bound for the zoo's <ORGANIZATION>Mouse House</ORGANIZATION> -- the clinic's patients
that day included a diabetic monkey, an orphaned baby black
buck (the spiral-horned Indian antelope), a
bedraggled-looking <PERSON>Shama</PERSON> thrush suffering from feather loss,
and <PERSON>Whoopi</PERSON>, an ailing penguin from the <LOCATION>New York Aquarium</LOCATION>.
   "She had lost a lot of weight and wasn't keeping food down
-- she has a fungal infection," said <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>. "She's been on
experimental treatment for about two months."
   Grabbing a walkie-talkie, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> set out on a quick tour
of the wards -- a series of indoor/outdoor cages, clean
despite the healthy zoo stench. Whoopi was poking around her
outdoor enclosure as a veterinary technician tried to
interest her in a fish.
   "I just repeated an endoscopy -- a flexible fiberoptic
examination of the stomach -- on her yesterday," said <PERSON>Dr.
Cook</PERSON>.
   And how exactly does one go about examining the stomach of
a penguin? In the clinic's large surgery, which boasts an
operating table, electrocardiograph unit and ultrasound
machine, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> showed off his tool of choice.
   "This is used for looking at the colon of humans. We use
it for looking at the stomachs of animals," he said. "Most of
our equipment comes from ordinary hospitals."
   The king-sized operating table with hydraulic lifts is
another matter. The veterinary team uses it for working on
hefty patients such as a gorilla or zebra. Anything bigger --
a camel, for instance -- can simply be laid out on the
surgery floor. And for operating on newborn birds and other
diminutive patients, veterinarians rely on microscopes and
microsurgical tools.
   Keeping animals anesthetized during surgery requires even
more specialized equipment. A four-foot-long endotracheal
tube is used on giraffes' throats, and gas masks of all
shapes and sizes line one wall, including a test-tube-sized
mask used on snakes and small birds. To put a sea lion under,
<PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>'s team fashioned a gas mask from a plastic
disinfectant jug.
   The biggest challenge zoo vets may face is getting the
invalid to the hospital. When it comes to dealing with a
stubborn patient -- a Siberian tiger, say -- the clinic
boasts a veritable arsenal of scoped rifles, blowpipes and
pole syringes -- all of which can be used to anesthetize
animals from a safe distance. In the clinic's pharmacy, <PERSON>Dr.
Cook</PERSON> pulled out a paper target.
   "Every once in a while I practice on the rifle range," he
said. "You have to be pretty good."
   The knocked-out animals are then carried over to the
clinic on stretchers or boards, where vets take advantage of
the animal's anesthetized state to do a full physical
checkup, do a little root canal, even clean their teeth.
   Not that every animal makes it to the clinic. Say you've
got a sick elephant. "We'd go to the elephant," <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>
said, showing off a full array of portable hospital equipment
-- including an X-ray machine.
   He also goes to the whales. On a recent weekday, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>
made his house calls at the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Aquarium -- which he or
a colleague will visit twice a week, along with the <ORGANIZATION>Central
Park Zoo</ORGANIZATION>. First on the list was <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION>, a 1,500-pound walrus
with an eye infection. <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION> are old
acquaintances: He had guided her through a painful tusk
infection requiring four operations in one year.
   Now, a tuskless <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION> bounded up out of her pool to greet
her trainer, <PERSON>Martha Saif</PERSON>, a lanky blonde in T-shirt and
shorts who came with bucket of fish and a bottle of eyedrops.
<PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON> had been administering the drops several times a day
on the instructions of <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> and a veterinary
ophthalmologist.
   "She's come a long way as far as that eye goes," <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>
said, as <ORGANIZATION>Nuka</ORGANIZATION> snuffled up squid after patiently enduring a
quick examination.
   Since most of the sea mammals at the aquarium are trained,
these examinations are relatively painless for doctor and
patient alike. It would be hard to imagine a better patient
than <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>, a beluga whale with a scraped eye, who
obediently pulled up at poolside and lifted her head over the
edge on <PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON>'s instruction.
   "She's much improved -- the area of redness has cleared up
quite a bit," <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> said, as <PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON> put in the whale's
eye ointment. After receiving several fish as a reward,
<PERSON>Marina</PERSON> placidly presented her tail for <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> to take a
blood sample.
   "That's terrific, <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Ms. Saif</PERSON>, sounding a lot
like the parent of a child getting its finger pricked, as <PERSON>Dr.
Cook</PERSON> carefully inserted a butterfly needle.
   A dolphin with some minor scrapes on its tail and a seal
with a cut snout rounded out <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON>'s visit. Occasionally,
he'll even work on fish. "I did multiple surgery on a lung
fish with cancer," he said modestly.
   But veterinary skill and dedication notwithstanding, zoo
patients do eventually go the way of all flesh. While showing
a visitor out of the <ORGANIZATION>Animal Health Center</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> paused to
ask a technician to turn on a fan.
   "A geriatric antelope passed away in the night," he
explained, as a sickly odor spread down the corridor from the
necropsy room, where pathologists conduct a full autopsy on
every deceased animal.
   The departed are gone but not forgotten. Zoo pathologists
see to it, by preserving a piece of all the animal's organs
in a large jar for future research. A back room in the clinic
is a veritable library of animal organs, with jars going back
as far as 20 years. In a bizarre twist, death has made
neighbors of "<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s Hartebeest, 5-691," "Hispaniolan Boa,
<DATE>'87</DATE>" and "Sea Lion, 10-10-90" -- all of which are grouped on
neighboring shelves, a stone's throw from the bottled
reproductive tract of a wisent (the nearly extinct European
bison).
   So after spending a 12-hour day in such exotic company --
living and dead -- what kind of pet does <PERSON>Dr. Cook</PERSON> go home to?
A tame lion cub, perhaps, or a lama tethered in his backyard?
   "A parrot," he said. "My wife's allergic to cats and
dogs."

FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology: Tamarins return to the jungle - A Brazilian
experiment to save an endangered species from extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a lush patch of Brazilian rainforest a group of golden lion tamarins
discover the joys of swinging between trees. Brought up in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>
zoo and recently introduced to the wild, they form part of one of the
world's most successful experiments in saving a species from extinction.
The project brings together first and third world nations, private and
public sectors, environmentalists and farmers, as well as several scientific
disciplines. Its techniques are now being copied worldwide.
Only 450 of the monkeys survive in the wild. Throughout this century many
have been captured to keep as domestic pets by people attracted by their
exotic beauty and flaming golden fur. Moreover, their natural habitat has
almost disappeared.
The animal has been rescued through the combined forces of <PERSON>Aldemar Coimbra</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s first primate specialist, and <PERSON>Devra Kleiman</PERSON>, a director of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
Coimbra realised the danger in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> when there were around 600 left. He
was unable to raise much interest until <DATE>1972</DATE> when <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON> held a conference
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on Saving the <LOCATION>Golden Lion Tamarin</LOCATION>. Experts from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> discussed how tamarins could be reproduced in captivity and then
reintroduced to their native habitat.
Breeding tamarins in zoos proved so successful that there are now more in
captivity than in the wild. 'When I started there were just 72 animals in 16
zoos. Now we have more than 550 in 130 zoos and a third of them are on
contraceptives because they are growing so quickly that we cannot find zoos
for them,' says <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON>.
In <DATE>1983</DATE> the team of Brazilian and American scientists began the more
difficult process of reintroducing those born in captivity into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
rainforest in the Poco das Antas biological reserve south of Rio. So far 69
have been reintroduced with a 70 per cent survival rate and a further 60 are
to be reintroduced this year.
<PERSON>Denise Rambaldi</PERSON>, who heads the field programme, says that the animals
generally adapt quickly. 'Initially they do not know how to defend
themselves against predators and they fall over a lot because they're used
to stronger branches in their cages. But after the third tumble they usually
learn.'
According to <LOCATION>Rambaldi</LOCATION>, the main indicator of the project's success is the
ability of the reintroduced animals to breed among themselves and with their
wild cousins. Of 33 surviving offspring at least 10 are the result of
crossing wild and reintroduced tamarins, adding variety to the gene pool.
Family histories are kept on all former captive and wild tamarins to avoid
inbreeding.
'There is no doubt that the ability of once-captive tamarins to bear
offspring sometimes by mating with wild tamarins and their gradual ability
to feed themselves in the wild proves that reintroducing them into their old
habitat has been a success,' says <PERSON>Coimbra</PERSON>.
The project is special for several reasons, says <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON>. Reintroducing
captive-born animals is a pioneering method of preserving species, and the
preservation of tropical forests is a developing science. It brings together
130 zoos, <ORGANIZATION>IBAMA</ORGANIZATION> (the Brazilian state environment agency), the World Wildlife
Fund and the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Primate Centre</ORGANIZATION>.
The success of the project is far from guaranteed. 'We're fighting against
time. In less than 20 years tamarins could be extinct in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and thus
worldwide', warns <PERSON>Coimbra</PERSON>.
The main problem is lack of forested land. The reserve is only 5,500
hectares, of which 60 per cent is covered by forest. Each group of five or
six monkeys requires 40 hectares of forest and <PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON> estimates that 20,000
hectares are needed to keep the 2,000 tamarins necessary for the breed's
sustainable survival. 'The larger aim of the project is to regenerate the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> forest for tamarins and other endangered species,' she adds.
Consequently, the project's organisers are trying to involve private
business, aiming to raise Dollars 250,000 a year to buy remaining
forestland. So far they have persuaded 11 farmers to dedicate their
remaining forest to protection for the monkeys.
Another problem is a wave of tamarin robberies to sell on <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s black
market. At least 10 have been stolen in the <DATE>last year</DATE> and a publicity
programme has been launched to raise local consciousness.
'When we have the international community supporting the feeding and
maintenance of these animals outside <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, sending them to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and then
hearing they have been stolen it does not look good for <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>,' warns
<PERSON>Kleiman</PERSON>.
One answer has been to hand every tamarin back in a special ceremony to the
Brazilian government to create more local responsibility. But <PERSON>Mr Jairo
Costa</PERSON>, President of the <ORGANIZATION>Brazilian Foundation for Conservation</ORGANIZATION> which helps
fund the project, believes a tougher crackdown on the trade is necessary.
'Catching an animal is regarded as a source of wealth. It is hard to
persuade someone with hunger in his stomach that for the sake of ecology he
should remain hungry.'

<TEXT>
   The new Central Park Zoo opened <DATE>Monday</DATE> amid much
fanfare, with a collection of penguins, polar bears, piranhas and
their pals entertaining huge crowds in their recently renovated <MONEY>$30
million</MONEY> home.
   A four-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of
the opening as <LOCATION>New Yorkers</LOCATION> waited for their first look at rarities
such as the <PERSON>Golfodulcean Dart</PERSON> poison frog, the tufted puffin or the
plumbeous water redstart (that's a bird, folks).
   ``These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who
have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON>Patricia Benitez</PERSON>, one
of the first visitors to the Tropic Zone _ one of the zoo's three
new natural habitats.
   Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the <ORGANIZATION>Polar
Circle</ORGANIZATION> hosts polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the <ORGANIZATION>Temperate
Territory</ORGANIZATION> is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea lions. In
all, 13,701 visitors toured the three areas on its first day, the
<ORGANIZATION>Parks Department</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``When Mayor <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> appointed me five years ago, I promised to be
a man for all species,'' said Parks Commissioner <PERSON>Henry Stern</PERSON>, who
introduced the 450 animals from more than 100 species.
   Mayor <PERSON>Edward I. Koch</PERSON> then cut the ribbon to officially open the
new facility before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named
<ORGANIZATION>Finn</ORGANIZATION>.
   Finn, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the
middle of the park, waved to <PERSON>Koch</PERSON>, waved to the visitors, caught
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request.
   The renovation of the zoo was supposed to cost <MONEY>$28 million</MONEY>, but
came in at about <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, partly because work took several
months longer than anticipated, <PERSON>Stern</PERSON> said. Construction on the new
zoo began in <DATE>April 1985</DATE>.
   ``The other zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said <PERSON>Stern</PERSON>,
referring to the facility shut down in the <DATE>winter of 1983</DATE>. ``So
we've built a humane zoo, a zoo for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>.''
   There was one other new feature: Visitors, who once toured for
free, now pay <MONEY>$1</MONEY>; senior citizens pay <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>, while kids come
through for a quarter.

<HEAD>Boston Rock-Climbers Hit The Heights At New Gorilla Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Climbers who set out to scale the cliffs at a new
gorilla exhibit in the <LOCATION>Franklin Park Zoo</LOCATION> were trying to prove it
couldn't be done.
   But they did it, despite a lack of places to grip and a tough
overhang.
   Officials at the <MONEY>$26 million</MONEY> African tropical forest exhibit said
they wanted to establish that the zoo's gorillas would be unable to
reach the peak of the cliffs and thereby gain access to the public
area of the innovative animal display.
   ``The gorilla has shorter legs and longer arms and he's much
stronger,'' said project manager <PERSON>Walter Kilroy</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan
District Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which operates the zoo.
   ``This is a fairly strong test of the rocks,'' he added,
``because gorillas can't really problem-solve the way humans can.''
   Climber <PERSON>Richard Doucette</PERSON> said he had had a tough time reaching
the exhibit summit. ``The rocks lack features (places to grip) and
the overhang is what kills you,'' he said.
   Zoo officials said some niches would be filled in to prevent
climbers _ human and primate _ from gaining a grip.
   The exhibit, scheduled to open in <DATE>September 1989</DATE>, was designed to
portray animals in their environment rather than in cages, Executive
Director <PERSON>Mark Goldstein</PERSON> said.
   ``You and I grew up with zoos where the elephants were in one
cage and the lions were in the next cage. We learned about animals
in these cubby holes,'' he said. ``But instead of this being a
species building or a Noah's Ark, you will be experiencing a piece
of an African forest.''
   In addition to gorillas, the state-funded complex includes plenty
of tropical vegetation, streams and waterfalls, 25 species of birds,
fish, leopards, insects, crocodiles and antelope.

<HEADLINE>  IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR L.A. ZOO INHABITANTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A new program at the zoo is designed to keep the captive animals more
active and improve their quality of life. Not only are the toys and treats
entertaining, they also prompt the animals to natural behaviors such as
foraging and hunting, researchers say.;    "We try to come up with imaginative
ways to feed the animals so that they're not bored," said <PERSON>Marjorie Fuchs</PERSON>, a
volunteer at the zoo. "What we're doing is keeping them busy foraging like
they do in the wild, rather than having them sit down to dinner like they
usually do at the zoo.";    <PERSON>Thaya duBois</PERSON>, the zoo's assistant director of
research, said the necessity for safety, good hygiene and animal health have
often resulted in barren exhibits and nutritious but unexciting diets.;    The
zoo's behavior-enrichment program provides the animals with toys, games and
snacks that usually keep them busy at least throughout the <TIME>morning and early
afternoon</TIME> hours. The project is headed by duBois, who is helped by animal
keepers, gardeners and about a dozen volunteers -- including professional toy
designers.;    "Part of the challenge is thinking of things to keep them busy
all day long," <PERSON>duBois</PERSON> said. "It's hard -- really hard.";    Tree stumps and
logs in some of the bear exhibits have been riddled with holes and are stuffed
with honey, applesauce and raisins.;    It keeps even the sloth bears from
becoming slothful. Using their snouts as vacuum cleaners, they noisily slurp
up the snacks.;    The bears and orangutans play with "boomer balls," hard
plastic spheres about the size of a volleyball filled with nuts and raisins
that rattle around inside and sometimes fall out to be eagerly eaten.;    The
monkeys got swing sets made of chain and logs, while the larger primates play
with bamboo rattles filled with tasty morsels that spill out at random
intervals.;    Drills -- short-tailed and bright-cheeked monkeys -- scavenge
though big piles of wood chips searching for mealworms, one of their favorite
meals.;    "The idea is to keep them busy and stimulated, not just feed them
as many goodies and treats as we can," <PERSON>duBois</PERSON> said.;    She said that most of
the toys and games are food-oriented because animals spend most of their time
in the wild foraging and searching for food.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>New Central Park Zoo Opens Amid Fishfare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Looking for lions and tigers and other big
animals? Not in the new Central Park Zoo.
   The zoo, which officially opened amid much fanfare <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
instead has a more eclectic offering: the <PERSON>Golfodulcean Dart</PERSON> poison
frog, the tufted puffin, the plumbeous water redstart (that's a
bird, folks).
   ``It doesn't seem like a zoo to me. It doesn't have any
elephants or any giraffes,'' complained <PERSON>Daniella Alonzo</PERSON>, 10, one of
the first visitors to the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> renovation, who nevertheless
said the zoo was ``nice.''
   There are 450 animals from more than 100 species. Unlike the old
zoo, the new zoo has no large animals because of space.
   ``This is a mini-zoo, to show things likely to arouse people's
interest and a sense of caring,'' said <PERSON>Dr. William G. Conway</PERSON>,
general director of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION>, which runs the
zoo for the city <ORGANIZATION>Parks Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   A 4-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of
the opening as the new attractions, housed in three different
``habitats,'' drew 13,701 first-day visitors. Most didn't share
<PERSON>Daniella</PERSON>'s disappointment.
   ``These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who
have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON>Patricia Benitez</PERSON>, who
toured the <ORGANIZATION>Tropic Zone</ORGANIZATION> habitat with classmates from her <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>
day camp.
   Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the <ORGANIZATION>Polar
Circle</ORGANIZATION> is home to polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the
<ORGANIZATION>Temperate Territory</ORGANIZATION> is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea
lions.
   Mayor <PERSON>Edward I. Koch</PERSON> cut the ribbon to officially open the new
zoo before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named <ORGANIZATION>Finn</ORGANIZATION>.
   Finn, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the
middle of the park, waved to <PERSON>Koch</PERSON>, waved to the visitors, caught
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request.
   The renovation was supposed to cost <MONEY>$28 million</MONEY>, but came in at
about <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, partly because work took several months longer
than anticipated, <ORGANIZATION>Parks Commissioner Henry Stern</ORGANIZATION> said. Construction
began in <DATE>April 1985</DATE>.
   The commissioner was enthusiastic over the results. ``The other
zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said <PERSON>Stern</PERSON>, referring to
the zoo that was shut down in the <DATE>winter of 1983</DATE>. ``So we've built
a humane zoo, a zoo for the <DATE>1990s</DATE>.''
   There was one other new feature: visitors, who once toured for
free, now pay <MONEY>$1</MONEY>; senior citizens pay <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY>, while kids come
through for a quarter.
   ``When I learned they were charging, I insisted the zoo has got
to cost less than an ice cream cone. If you can find an ice cream
cone for less, I'd like to see it,'' said <PERSON>Stern</PERSON>. ``Times have
changed.''

THE PETTER PRINCIPLE;

<P>
MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN FIND ANIMALS A SOURCE OF LOVE AND THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a classroom at <ORGANIZATION>Camarillo State Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, an 11-year-old boy with sad, dark 
eyes sat in a corner, quietly petting his friend Echo, a golden retriever. 
</P>
<P>
"Echo takes away my sad feelings," said the boy, who is confined to a ward for 
mentally ill children. "And I've learned that animals have more feelings than I 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and psychologists at the hospital, which has about 1,200 
developmentally disabled and mentally ill patients, say they are using animals 
more and more in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no structured pet therapy program at <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, the idea of 
allowing patients time to cuddle animals is quickly catching on. About half a 
dozen teachers and psychologists bring their pets to work every day, a practice 
encouraged by hospital officials. A few other employees have adopted cats that 
have wandered onto the spacious grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something they can cuddle and love," said <PERSON>Dee Press</PERSON>, a special education 
teacher who owns Echo. "A lot of the kids we have here have been abused 
mentally and physically. An animal is non-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Employees stay close by when patients are with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very careful not to leave them alone. Some of the patients would kill 
the animals," said <PERSON>Jerry Scheurn</PERSON>, coordinator of volunteer services at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But no abuse has occurred yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who teaches children ages 8 through 13, said she is delighted with how 
her students react to her dog. She has been bringing Echo since the 7-year-old 
retriever was a puppy, she said, and she is always impressed with her students' 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had kids who don't talk very much," Press said. "But sometimes when the 
kids are sad they will ask to spend a little time with Echo." 
</P>
<P>
One time a young boy was visibly upset when he came to class but he refused to 
discuss his troubles. When Press allowed the child to pet Echo, the boy started 
to hug the dog and cry. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why don't you tell Echo what's wrong?' " Press said. The boy quietly 
explained that he was afraid his mother would forget to visit him at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo hospital is not alone in using animals during psychiatric treatment. 
It is becoming a common practice in hospitals throughout the state, and 
<ORGANIZATION>Huntington Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> even has a team of trained therapy 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood therapist <PERSON>Janet Ruckert</PERSON> describes "petcology" the value of using pets 
to help people overcome their anxieties -- in her book titled, "The Four-Footed 
Therapist." 
</P>
<P>
According to <LOCATION>Ruckert</LOCATION>, animals are natural therapists. By being warm and 
sympathetic listeners, they allow a patient to express deep emotions and needs. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> hospital has a petting zoo with a goat and rabbits, but the 
children visit them sporadically. Therapists say patients relate better to cats 
and dogs because they usually are more affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Connie Westphal</PERSON>, a special education teacher at the hospital, said her students 
get upset if she doesn't bring her dog <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON>, a dachshund, to class. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know where he is," <PERSON>Westphal</PERSON> said. "They seemed to have bonded 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
A white and gray cat, often found under a tree outside the children's ward, 
constantly receives attention. 
</P>
<P>
"She does stuff that's neat," said a blond 11-year-old boy, scratching the cat 
behind the ears. "She rolls around in the grass and she catches mice. But the 
kids like her because she respects us. That's important."
