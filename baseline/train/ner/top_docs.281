   Former Democratic vice presidential nominee
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> says both Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> and Republican
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> did well in <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s debate, but <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s success
came ``probably because I taught him how to do it.''

said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant
until a woman is elected to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I have a place in history,'' she said <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> before a
speech at <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION>. ``And I'll have that place in history
until a woman runs and wins. Then I'll fade into the woodwork.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> congresswoman, was the running
mate chosen by Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>,
making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice
president by a major political party.
   The <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic ticket suffered one of the worst defeats
ever in a presidential race.

<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  As a woman and a journalist, I was offended by the Los Angeles Times story
"Ferraro in the running again," in the Nov. 20 Mercury News.;   Why did Josh
Getlin feel it pertinent to his story to include evidence of Ferraro's
appearance in his lead? Why do I need to know that her face is "more deeply
lined" or that her hair, once "frosted blond," has now "gone gray"?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GERALDINE FERRARO LOOKS QUALIFIED BY ANY MEASURE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Letters Page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This is classic evidence of the societal prejudice against older women, if
not women in general. Appearance over substance. Aging men are
"distinguished," while older women get "dumpy" or "matronly.";   Our
male-dominated society has it all figured out: Men always improve -- they get
wiser; women always decay, losing their appearances and thus their value.;  
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> deserves better, especially in light of the fact she fights these
stereotypes for a living and furthered the women's movement immeasurably when
she became the first woman vice presidential candidate in <DATE>1984.</DATE>;   Now she is
striving to wrest the power from the sexist legislators who apparently feel
comfortable allowing a lying, sexual vigilante to sit on the highest court in
America.;   Getlin should have recognized that <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s substance is all that
matters and besides, she still looks damn good to <LOCATION>me.</LOCATION>;   But then, if we use
his logic, maybe <PERSON>Getlin</PERSON> is just too adorable (i.e., lacks the gray matter) to
get the big picture.;   -- <PERSON>Brooke Shelby Biggs</PERSON>;   Executive Editor;   Spartan
Daily, SJSU; <PERSON>Josh Getlin</PERSON>'s characterization of <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> is another
example of media sexism.;   Why is it that a woman's appearance always
requires comment. I don't see journalists describing male political candidates
as having "blond hair gone gray" and having "more deeply lined" faces. I would
think that journalists today would have greater professionalism.;   --
<PERSON>Margaret Flores</PERSON>;   <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Josh Golin</PERSON> states that "On a hot <DATE>summer night
seven years ago</DATE>, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> became the first woman in history to be nominated for
the vice presidency.";   That statement is not correct. Not only was <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>
not the first woman to run for the vice presidency, she wasn't even the third
or fourth. Many third parties have nominated women for vice president and
president. Nor was she the first woman to receive an electoral college vote.
That piece of history belongs to <ORGANIZATION>Tonia Nathan</ORGANIZATION>. She received an electoral
college vote in <DATE>1972</DATE>. She ran on the Libertarian Party ticket.;   If you're
interested in new ideas, such as running a woman for president or vice
president, you can be sure <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s third parties will be the first to try
it. Next year if you want to vote for a woman for the vice presidential spot,
one option will be <PERSON>Dr. Nancy Lord</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Libertarian Party</ORGANIZATION>'s nominee. I doubt
you'll have that option on the Demo-Republican ticket.;   -- <PERSON>Mark Hinkle</PERSON>;

<LEADPARA>  THE FROSTED blond hair has gone to gray, her face is more deeply lined and
there's a subtle barrier, a distance, between Geraldine Ferraro and the
well-wishers who crowd around her these days.;   But when it comes to letting
the old boys have it, especially the Republicans who tormented Ferraro during
her 1984 run for the vice presidency, the homemaker from Queens who made
history is remarkably unchanged.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FERRARO IN THE RUNNING AGAIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Lemme tell ya, there's a vicious rumor about me going around," she tells a
group of business and professional women on a blustery morning. "They say I
have my eyes on <PERSON>Sen. Al D'Amato</PERSON>'s seat.";   Pause.;   "I don't have my eyes on
his seat. It's his job that I want.";   The cheering crowd in a hotel banquet
room rises to its feet, and <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> is rolling once again. A hero and role
model to many women present, she's attempting a political comeback from the
ashes of her disastrous national campaign. And nobody is counting her out.;  
On a hot <DATE>summer night seven years ago</DATE>, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> became the first woman in
history to be nominated for the vice presidency. Based largely on that
memorable event, she continues to enjoy a political celebrity few can match.
Although the <ORGANIZATION>New York Senate</ORGANIZATION> election is almost a year away, her battle to
unseat <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON>, a two-term <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> incumbent, is drawing enthusiastic crowds.;  
So far, however, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> has been preaching to the choir. The people begging
for autographs these days don't seem too concerned about questions of ethical
impropriety that dogged her vice presidential campaign, even though they are
likely to be raised in <DATE>1992</DATE>. She has yet to face an ugly crowd -- the kind
that derided her support for abortion rights and insulted members of her
family.;   Those scars have not yet healed, and the <DATE>1991</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Ferraro</ORGANIZATION> is a warier
political creature. She is less trusting of the press this time around and can
be impatient with slow questioners at political events. Determined to protect
her privacy, she has nonetheless put herself under the microscope again.;   
AT SOME point, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> agrees, she will have to face the past: old questions
about her husband's real estate deals, whispered allegations of his mob ties,
her son's conviction for attempted sale of cocaine and charges that she
mishandled her finances as a three-term congresswoman. But for now, there is
no mistaking the excitement and feeling of rebirth surrounding her senatorial
race, especially when she speaks to women's groups.;   "I was thinking about
the unemployment bill that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> vetoed (this <DATE>summer</DATE>)," <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> told
the <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> crowd. "And then I realized, he probably thinks that if <PERSON>Clarence
Thomas</PERSON> can get a job, anybody can get a job.";   The audience applauds,
cheering her digs at the all-white, all-male <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> that
debated <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' nomination for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>. But the biggest
applause comes for a line she uses in every speech.;   "Women in this country
have a feeling they've been had," she said. "And I'll be damned if I'm going
to let the '90s go down as the decade in which the Soviets won their rights
and American women lost theirs.";   "You have to understand, this woman
changed my life," said <PERSON>Virginia Hundt</PERSON>, a businesswoman who is running for a
local office next year and who has been waiting 30 minutes to have her picture
taken with Ferraro.;   "She showed women that they could make a difference on
the national political level, and she's a tremendous inspiration to us all."; 
 Others are more skeptical. Across the room, <PERSON>Mary Carswell</PERSON>, a deputy airport
manager, agrees that <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> is a historic figure and not just another
political big shot. Still, <PERSON>Carswell</PERSON> wonders why the candidate would again put
herself through the torture of public examination: "I wouldn't change places
with her for the world. Who needs the punishment? Why do it again?";   Indeed,
some critics dismiss <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s campaign as an exercise in nostalgia,
predicting that she cannot win a hotly contested Democratic primary next year
against three other candidates. The formidable field includes <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
Attorney General <PERSON>Robert Abrams</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON>Elizabeth Holzman</PERSON>
and Rep. <PERSON>Robert Mrazek</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>;   But a recent <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo News</ORGANIZATION> poll had good news
for <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>. Taken after the <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> hearings, it showed her leading Abrams <PERCENT>40
percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT>, with <PERSON>Holzman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrazek</PERSON> far behind.;    YET EVEN if she
wins the primary, critics say, <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> could make mincemeat of her. They
believe <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, weighted by her own baggage, is the only Democratic candidate
who could not credibly attack D'Amato for political corruption.;   The senator
has been stung by charges of malfeasance over the allocation of federal
housing funds in his district and is plummeting in the polls. Although he was
exonerated by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> is believed vulnerable in
<DATE>1992</DATE>, especially to a squeaky-clean candidate.;   "The point is, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s
vulnerable too," said a veteran Republican campaign consultant who asked not
to be identified. "Voters will remember her problems, and if they don't
remember, they'll certainly be reminded.";   If she is bothered by the
conventional wisdom, however, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> doesn't show it. Do the fellas want to
play rough? She'll play rough.;   "I won't let anyone get away with attacking
me," she said, settling in for a long drive from <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> to her next
political event, in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> "If somebody hits me, my response (in a TV
spot) will be in the can. I don't run away from a fight. I'm a fighter."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Ferraro Says Women's Equality Depends On More Female Officeholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, whose vice presidential
nomination marked a peak for the women's equality movement, said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> that women must translate their increasing power at the
ballot box to campaigns for elective office.
   ``If you don't run, you can't win,'' <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said. ``And
just as important, every time a woman runs, women win.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> addressed some 1,500 women attending a symposium on
women and the Constitution convened by former first ladies <PERSON>Rosalynn
Carter</PERSON> and Lady Bird <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
   She said there are more female officeholders than ever, but the
numbers are not representative of the population.
   ``Women are, by any measure, grossly underrepresented in
elective office,'' <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said. ``I would say shockingly
underrepresented; however, nobody is shocked. That's simply how it
is.''
   Coretta <PERSON>Scott King</PERSON>, wife of slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin
Luther King Jr.</PERSON>, echoed <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> in urging women, particularly
black women, to seek office.
   ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and
compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle
to raise families in a sexist society,'' <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said on the
closing day of the two-day symposium.
   ``Let me put it this way _ if the women of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> don't lead
the struggle against poverty, racism and militarism, then we must
ask, who will?'' she said.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>National Women's Political Caucus</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>1987</DATE>
women held <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> of the higher statewide elective offices in
the country. At the same time, there are only 23 women serving in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> _ and only one black woman _ two female governors and two
women in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>, a former congresswoman from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, said many of
those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or
leadership, which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman
as a presidential candidate.
   However, more women will become interested in politics and the
numbers elected will increase, she said. <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said her <DATE>1984</DATE>
campaign with Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>
inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the
candidacy inspired them to go to law school, medical school, or run
for office.
   ``Every time a woman runs for any elective office, it's like
throwing a stone in a lake,'' she said. ``The ripple effect is felt
far beyond the immediate point of impact.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> compared the challenge facing women in the workplace
and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights
struggle led by her late husband. She said women can learn much
from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights.
   ``The movement showed millions of Americans that you can, indeed
you must, defy authority when that authority is in the wrong,''
<PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said.
   Women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent
years, <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said, pointing to the <DATE>1986</DATE> mid-term elections
that brought a Democratic majority to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. She said nine
Democrats won by getting less than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the male vote, and
more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the female vote.
   ``Women voted more strongly Democratic, and on key issues like
peace, disarmament, social welfare and the environment, differently
from men,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said that after she was nominated for vice president
during the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>,
the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that
equality, and a female president, are coming.
   ``She will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of
qualities the American people look for in a president, and then it
will be time. And tears will be cried like you wouldn't believe,''
she said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's an Expert on Running Against Women; Ferraro
Disagrees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that he's an
expert when it comes to running a political campaign against women,
but at least one female politician took exception to the contention.
   ``I don't know how he'd call himself an expert,'' former Rep.
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> said from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. ``Only in politics does one
little meeting an expert make.''
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> was <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate in
the <DATE>1984</DATE> race against incumbent President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and Vice President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s comments at a news conference were prompted by a question
about the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> gubernatorial race that may pit Democrat <PERSON>Ann
Richards</PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION>Republican Clayton Williams</ORGANIZATION>.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
<PERSON>Richards</PERSON> than Attorney General <PERSON>Jim Mattox</PERSON>. Richards, the state
treasurer, and <PERSON>Mattox</PERSON> will battle for the Democratic nomination in
an <DATE>April 10</DATE> run-off election.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said he had some opinions about running against women,
calling himself ``an expert in the field'' because of his contest
against <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>.
   But <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s memory of the race is flawed, and that
the only time they went head-to-head was in one televised debate.
   ``We did not run against each other. It was <PERSON>Fritz Mondale</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> who were running against each other,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said.
``If we were both running against each other, if we were both at
the top of the ticket, then I think his comment about being an
expert would be valid.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was asked if he had any advice for <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   Ferraro, meanwhile, said <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> didn't need any advice from
her.
   ``Ann has run against men before. I'm sure she's not
uncomfortable with it,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said, suggesting <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>' problem
may be a common male ailment.
   ``The only way I can see it, being uncomfortable, is when you
lose to a man it's humiliating enough,'' she said. ``But if you're
a macho guy and you lose to a woman, it has to be devastating.''

<HEAD>Experts Say Top of Ticket, Not Running Mates, Sways Voters' Choice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats who hope <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> will
help the ticket win his home state of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and perhaps the
presidential election could do well to regard the fate of <PERSON>Henry
Gassaway Davis</PERSON>.
   In case anyone doesn't remember, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> was Democrat <PERSON>Alton B.
Parker</PERSON>'s running mate when <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> ran for president against
<ORGANIZATION>Republican Teddy Roosevelt</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1904</DATE>.
   The voters chose between <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>, and their choice
was Roosevelt by a 3-2 margin.
   Experts concede that the vice presidential debate in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> between <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and Republican <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> may
make a difference, but they say the voters' final decision will
come down to a choice between the top of the tickets, Democrat
<PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   ``Unless <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> is absolutely destroyed in the debate with
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, I don't think it will hurt <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>,'' said <PERSON>Leo Ribuffo</PERSON>, a
specialist in political history at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``People will be looking for <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> to blow it,'' said <PERSON>Samuel H.
Kernell</PERSON>, professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. ``If he can get through the debate in a
competent fashion where he looks unexceptional, it will be a real
success for him.''
   <PERSON>Eddie Mahe Jr.</PERSON>, a Republican political consultant, said, ``I
think it is reasonable to suggest that <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> would have won
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Quayle</ORGANIZATION>'s home state) without <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>, and with <PERSON>Mr.
Bentsen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mike Dukakis</PERSON> is still not going to carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. So you
wash that out.''
   ``I think the odds are that <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> will have little or no effect
on the ultimate choice,'' said <PERSON>Thomas Mann</PERSON>, program director for
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution here.
   <PERSON>Elspeth Rostow</PERSON>, a political scholar at the <ORGANIZATION>Lyndon B. Johnson
School of Public Affairs</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, said
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> ``doesn't seem to have too much effect on
the voters, at least so far.''
   ``I don't think, if indeed <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was disposed to choose <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> to
appeal to women, that so far it has had that effect,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rostow</PERSON>
said.
   ``I think the conventional wisdom that the selection of a
running mate is rarely decisive one way or another is absolutely
true,'' said <PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON>.
   A survey conducted this year by the <ORGANIZATION>Hearst Corp.</ORGANIZATION> supports this
view.
   Eighteen percent of the 1,001 voters surveyed said they had
changed their minds about a presidential candidate at one time or
another because of their opinion of his running mate. Of those, <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> said they voted against that ticket.
   Political experts agree that if a running mate has any effect,
he is more likely to hurt than help.
   Examples cited include President <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s selection of <PERSON>Sen. Robert
Dole</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, who was criticized for his slashing debating style
in <DATE>1976</DATE>, and <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, who
suffered from examination of her family's finances in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   ``Clearly in my opinion <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> in <DATE>1976</DATE> in that debate (with
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>'s running mate) cost <PERSON>Jerry Ford</PERSON> votes,'' <PERSON>Mahe</PERSON>
said. ``Clearly in <DATE>1984</DATE> in my opinion, <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> cost
<PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> votes probably.''
   In <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s unsuccessful campaign of <DATE>1960</DATE>, some thought
that Republican vice presidential candidate <ORGANIZATION>Henry Cabot Lodge</ORGANIZATION> hurt
the ticket's chances by pledging that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> would appoint a black
to the Cabinet _ a statement <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> disavowed.
   Lodge, a former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, also was
criticized for taking naps and not campaigning hard enough. ``Some
have thought that if he had used his prestige from the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> more
effectively, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> might have edged out <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rostow</PERSON> said.
   There are exceptions to the rule that running mates don't help
much, the experts said.
   While there is disagreement over whether Lodge hurt <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in
<DATE>1960</DATE>, almost everybody agrees that <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> helped Kennedy
by enabling him to carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   ``I don't think <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> would have won without <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>,''
<PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON> said.
   Also, <PERSON>Ribuffo</PERSON> said, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> may have helped <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> win election
in <DATE>1976</DATE> by imparting legitimacy to the former <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> governor in
the eyes of skeptical liberals.
   Then there was the running mate that Republicans chose in <DATE>1900</DATE>
to help the colorless <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON> win a second term against
the dynamic Democrat, <PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON>. The ticket of
<ORGANIZATION>McKinley</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> became known as ``the kangaroo ticket
because it had a kick in the tail,'' <PERSON>Ms. Rostow</PERSON> said.
   There haven't been many tickets in any other year, including
<DATE>1988</DATE>, with that much of a kick in the tail, the experts agree.

<HEAD>Reagan on Woman President: `I Welcome It.'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
inevitably will have a woman president, and ``I welcome it.''
   But during a question-and-answer session with a group of school
children in the <ORGANIZATION>State Dining Room of the White House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> also
said he thought a woman would likely get to the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> only by
serving first as vice president.
   Asked whether there would ever be a woman chief executive, he
replied, ``I don't know. Believe, I'm certainly not against it. ...''
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, and she's done a remarkable job for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> for an official visit and
state dinner at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the <ORGANIZATION>Western
Alliance</ORGANIZATION> during his nearly eight years in office.
   As for a women president, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said the idea would take ``a
little getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in <DATE>1984</DATE>, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was referring to then-Rep. <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by then-Vice
President <PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON>.
   Reagan swept to a 49-state landslide over the ticket, with the
Mondale-Ferraro team carrying only <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Reagan's appearance before students from five Washington-area
junior and senior high schools was the first of four such talks the
president plans to give before leaving office on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>.
   Before taking questions from the pupils, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> told his audience
that he would look to young people to carry forth the message of the
American revolution to the rest of the world. But as the world goes
through rapid technological and social change, he said, ``the
permanent truths which give meaning to our lives don't change.''

   A potential juror in the cocaine trial of
<PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON> said she thought the press picked on his family
during the <DATE>1984</DATE> vice presidential candidacy of his mother,
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   The woman was one of 15 candidates selected after painstaking
questioning of 25 people during jury selection, which resumed <TIME>this
morning</TIME> for a third day.
   Opening arguments were expected later today or <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Twelve
jurors and two alternates are needed for the trial.
   <ORGANIZATION>Addison County State</ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> said the selection of
a jury was slowed by the publicity given the case and the fact
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> is so well-known.
   ``Selecting a jury is probably the most important part of the
case,'' he said. <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said if even one juror bore a grudge, it
could influence the jury's verdict.
   Most of those questioned said they had read newspaper accounts
of the case since <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, 24, was charged in <DATE>1986</DATE> with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent.
   One potential juror said <DATE>today</DATE> that he would discount anything
he read in the newspapers though because of a basic distrust of the
press. ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just
because they have been charged,'' said <PERSON>Donald Cioffi</PERSON>.
   Only one person has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s mother could affect his view of the case.
   Jury pool member <PERSON>Joanne Cillo</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that she felt that
press treatment of <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> during the <DATE>1984</DATE> campaign carried over to
<PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
<PERSON>Cillo</PERSON> said when asked if she was pleased with how <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> has been
treated.
   She said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she
is chosen to hear the case. ``The press is not trying this case,''
she said. ``The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   ``I don't believe it's up to me to make restitution for what the
press may or may not have done,'' she added.
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, then a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION>, pleaded innocent
to the charge. He has been accompanied to court each day by his
mother and father, <PERSON>John Zaccaro Sr</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers, taking
notes intently, but stopping when <PERSON>Cillo</PERSON> spoke about her family. At
that point she rested her head in her hand and looked down.
   She later declined to comment on the case, telling one reporter,
``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not answering
anything for anybody.''
   The start of <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s trial came two years after her son was
arrested outside the <LOCATION>Middlebury</LOCATION> restaurant where he worked.
   Six reporters were allowed to watch the questioning, which was
briefly interrupted <DATE>Monday</DATE> when <PERSON>Judge Francis McCaffrey</PERSON> imposed and
then lifted a gag order on reporters covering jury selection.
   Defense lawyers sought the gag order for fear too many reporters
could intimidate potential jurors. But <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON> lifted it
following a challenge from reporters and an agreement to limit
their number in the courtroom.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the courts. Zaccaro's
attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed
unsuccessfully that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was singled out for prosecution because
of his mother.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> refused to dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Ferraro Considering Political Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, the first woman to win a
slot on a major party's presidential ticket, says she's considering
a political comeback.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s running mate on the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic
ticket, is weighing a challenge to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato</PERSON>.
   The former three-term congresswoman says she isn't worried that
a political campaign would resurrect hurtful stories about her or
her family.
   ``I don't think there's very much that the people of this state
or this nation don't know about me or about my family,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>
said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> was hounded by questions about her family's finances
during the <DATE>1984</DATE> campaign. She later complained that her political
fame hurt her family and led to harsher court treatment of her
husband and son.
   Her husband, <PERSON>John Zaccaro</PERSON>, pleaded guilty in <DATE>1985</DATE> to a
misdemeanor charge in a real estate deal. Her son, <PERSON>John Zaccaro
Jr.</PERSON>, later was convicted of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine while
at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>.
   ``I would love to back in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, I would love to be part of
the decision-making process with reference to what's going on in
this country,'' said <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, 54, who lives in the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>
borough of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>.
   A race against Rep. <PERSON>Thomas Manton</PERSON>, who holds <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s former
seat, is out of the question, she said.
   ``I endorsed him and he is a Democrat who represents my district
very, very well.''
   D'Amato's second term ends in <DATE>1992</DATE>. Recent polls show his
popularity is slipping, primarily because of reports that he used
his influence to steer money from the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Housing and
Urban Development</ORGANIZATION> to friends nd political supporters.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to
decide whether it should launch a full-scale investigation of
D'Amato.
   Ferraro flirted with the idea of taking on D'Amato in <DATE>1986</DATE>, but
pulled back, citing personal reasons.
   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said she ruled out that <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race because
she feared the power of Attorney General <PERSON>Edwin Meese III</PERSON>. The
<ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> was investigating complaints that she had failed
to fully disclose her husband's finances while she was in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``That investigation continued well past the campaign, nursed by
people within the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>, and I found out later that <PERSON>Ed
Meese</PERSON> had personal interest in it and was tying it to my political
decisions,'' she said.
   ``I did not doubt for one minute that he would use it
politically against me.''
   The 22-month investigation ended with the department deciding
there was no basis for a criminal or civil action.

<HEAD>NOW to Call for Jackson or `Non-White' Woman as Democratic No. 2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> plans
to urge likely Democratic nominee <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> to select rival
<PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> or a ``non-white'' woman as his running mate, the
group's president said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Molly Yard</PERSON> said it would take the selection of <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, who is
very sensitive to women's issues, or ``a woman from <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s
constituency'' to smooth relations between the women's movement and
the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The whole stance of the party since <DATE>1984</DATE> has been to blame us
for the defeat of <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>,'' she said.
   NOW, the nation's largest women's rights organization, has been
a major influence in Democratic politics and was a factor in the
selection of <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> as <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s running mate in
the <DATE>1984</DATE> presidential race. The ticket later was defeated by the
largest margin in the history of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presidential races.
   <PERSON>Ms. Yard</PERSON> said the group plans to introduce a resolution calling
on <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> to heed their advice on the vice presidential choice.
The NOW president did not provide a date for the resolution, but
the group is holding its national conference in <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> this week.
   Dukakis is currently considering potential running mates.
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, runner-up to the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor in the delegate
race, has said he has earned the right to be offered the No. 2
spot, but <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> has not made any commitment.
   Yard also charged that Democratic leaders have tried to keep NOW
out of the <DATE>1988</DATE> election.
   ``They say they don't want the party captive to special
interests,'' she said. ``I don't know how they can call the
nation's largest group of voters a special interest.''
   There are 10 million more women registered to vote than men, she
said.
   The NOW president also said the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> could lose the
women's vote and the <DATE>1988</DATE> presidential election if it doesn't pay
more attention to women's issues.
   Yard warned that millions of women would vote Republican if the
<ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> is perceived as caring more than the Democrats about women.
   ``Even though their platform is a disaster, they'll get votes
because they're seriously considering a woman as a vice
presidential candidate,'' <PERSON>Yard</PERSON> said of the Republicans.
   ``Everything depends on who you showcase at the convention,''
she said.
   <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON>, the former transportation secretary, is
considered a candidate for the No. 2 spot on the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> ticket that
will be headed by all-but-certain nominee <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   Selection of <PERSON>Mrs. Dole</PERSON> as a running mate could hand <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> the
presidency, <PERSON>Yard</PERSON> said. <PERSON>Mrs. Dole</PERSON> is the wife of <PERSON>Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole</PERSON> who battled <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> presidential
nomination.
   NOW calculates that <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>'s apparent early lead over <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
could disappear if he loses a significant portion of the women's
vote. National polls indicate <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is running significantly behind
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> among women while running about even among men.
   ``It's not the time for the Democrats to send signals that they
will in any way deny the importance of women's issues,'' she said.

   <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, who four years ago became
the first woman on a major party's national ticket, said <DATE>today</DATE> she
was ``delighted'' with <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>' plans to name <PERSON>Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> as his Democratic running mate.
   She said that had there been enough women in political office to

   ``But because we don't have a woman in that spot, I am not

   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>, part of the losing Democratic ticket with <PERSON>Walter

with a Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> it's going to make a difference

   ``I'm delighted. I think it's an indication that Governor
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> intends to run a strong national campaign. I think he's
going to go down <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and seriously battle the Republicans for
those votes that should be ours based upon the conditions facing

   Earlier, <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Today</DATE> that there were not enough
women in positions from which national offices are traditionally
chosen _ the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and statehouses _ to provide
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> with a good choice. She said no women currently in elected
office meet <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' need of a candidate strong on foreign policy
experience who will also give him geographic balance.
   She said <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> ``does not have those credentials that,
politically, <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> needs in his vice president.''
   ``Had I not been a woman _ and I'm the first one to say it _ I
probably would not have been chosen,'' she told the newspaper. ``In
<DATE>1984</DATE> ... it was time to remove this final barrier from women's
achieving political power.''
   She said her candidacy in <DATE>1984</DATE> and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s campaigns are
expanding participation in the political process.
   ``Between <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s campaign this year and <DATE>1984</DATE>, we as a nation
said, `Enough already, we're going to let everybody have a chance
to participate.' That's a big thing nobody can take away,'' she
said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>, 52, said she also has no bitterness over a national
profile that brought harsh scrutiny of her family and criminal
investigations of her husband. Her son was convicted of a drug
charge this year.
   ``<DATE>1984</DATE> was an incredible opportunity for me. That doesn't lead
one to be bitter. I genuinely feel my husband and son were singled
out. That doesn't make us bitter,'' she said. ``I'm not going to
let that happen to me.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> was nominated <DATE>Monday</DATE> to run
for a third term, but some at the state Democratic convention
wondered if he'd serve out the term if re-elected or take a run at
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   With the convention band breaking into ``I Love <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,'' the
57-year-old governor was nominated by acclamation.
   Cuomo, considered a potential <DATE>1992</DATE> Democratic presidential
candidate was scheduled to address the delegates <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Last week, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Republicans chose <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> economist and
businessman <PERSON>Pierre Rinfret</PERSON>, a political unknown, to challenge <PERSON>Cuomo</PERSON>.
   Making appearances at the convention were <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>David
Dinkins</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan</PERSON> and former vice presidential
candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, who spoke out for abortion rights.
   The former <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> congresswoman who ran on the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic
presidential ticket with <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> is considering a <DATE>1992</DATE> run
for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat currently held by Republican <PERSON>Alfonse
D'Amato</PERSON>.
   Another speaker was actor <PERSON>Christopher Reeve</PERSON>, who pressed for
greater efforts to clean up the environment.
   Most speakers stressed the party's goal of claiming majority
control of the Republican-dominated state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   Delegates nominated Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Stan Lundine</PERSON> to run again with
<PERSON>Cuomo</PERSON>. If re-elected, it would be <PERSON>Lundine</PERSON>'s second term as
lieutenant governor.
   The governor, refusing to rule out a possible bid for the
presidency in <DATE>1992</DATE>, announced his re-election plans <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. He
considered a presidential campaign in <DATE>1988</DATE>, but ultimately bowed out.
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said Democrats nationwide favor <PERSON>Cuomo</PERSON>.
   ``They believe that he can be the person who can carry the
Democrats to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>,'' she said of party followers
she's met across the country.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON> has been a model
probationer and should be released early from probation on a
cocaine-selling conviction, his lawyer argued today.
   The son of <DATE>1984</DATE> vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>
was convicted two years ago of selling one-quarter gram of cocaine
for <MONEY>$25</MONEY> to an undercover officer while a student at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury
College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Zaccaro's attorney, <PERSON>Charles Tetzlaff</PERSON> argued that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> should
be released from probation early because he is beginning his first
semester as a law student at <ORGANIZATION>Catholic University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, and would have to return monthly to <LOCATION>New York state</LOCATION>, which is
supervising his probation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> won't accept any probation cases unless
there is less than a year in the term.
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> has been serving a sentence of one to five years on
probation. But <PERSON>Tetzlaff</PERSON> said that under <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state regulations,
<PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> would be eligible for release from probation in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   Addison County States Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> argued that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>
should be supervised for at least another semester because he was
arrested while in a college atmosphere and now he is back in that
atmosphere.
   Vermont District <PERSON>Judge Francis McCaffery</PERSON> made no immediate
decision on the request to dismiss <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> from probation.
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> served three months of his sentence under house arrest
at a <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> luxury apartment whose amenities were ridiculed by
some who argued the former congresswoman's son received special
treatment from the courts.

<HEAD>Prospects Of Female Running Mate For Dukakis Appear Dim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> begins the process of
selecting a Democratic vice presidential nominee, the surest bet in
politics is that his choice will be a man.
   Not even the women who worked so hard four years ago to get
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> on the Democratic ticket expect <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> to follow
<PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON>'s history-making example.
   ``It certainly isn't the top-of-line discussion it was in
<DATE>1984</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>Joanne Howes</PERSON>, a political consultant and director of
the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION>Women's Vote Project</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Is that a priority in his campaign this year, or in the
party?'' said <PERSON>Irene Natividad</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Women's
Political Caucus</ORGANIZATION>. ``It doesn't seem like it.''
   So when <PERSON>Paul Brountas</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> lawyer who is heading the
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> search for a running mate came to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to talk vice
presidential politics, the big names on his calling list were all
male, names like <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sam Nunn</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>.
   He did pay a call on <PERSON>Sen. Barbara Mikulski</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>. But now
in her second year as a senator, she is on no one's list of vice
presidential prospects.
   Missing from <PERSON>Brountas</PERSON>' list was Rep. <PERSON>Pat Schroeder</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>,
who came close to running for president and is the most credible
vice presidential prospect among Democratic women.
   Three women often are mentioned as potential running mates for
Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> _ former <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth
Dole</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sen. Nancy Kassebaum</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and former <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Ambassador
<PERSON>Jeane Kirkpatrick</PERSON>. This is the party that turned its back on the
Equal Rights Amendment and demands that its national candidates
take strong stands against abortion.
   Analysts talk of a ``gender gap'' that favors Democrats, the
fact that a far higher percentage of women than men support
Democratic candidates.
   Yet, this election year, the likely women vice presidential
candidates are Republicans, not Democrats.
   ``I think the major reason is obvious,'' said <PERSON>Celinda Lake</PERSON>, a
senior associated with <ORGANIZATION>The Analysis Group</ORGANIZATION>, a Democratic polling
organization. ``There are lots of ways in which the Democrats are
turning away from the '84 experience.
   ``And one of the ways, which I think is incorrect, is they think
they would not benefit from nominating a woman as the vice
president.''
   The ``'84 experience,'' of course, was the fact the
<ORGANIZATION>Mondale-Ferraro</ORGANIZATION> ticket was beaten in 49 of 50 states as President
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> received an estimated <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of the women's vote.
   ``I also think,'' said <PERSON>Lake</PERSON> ``there is somewhat of a shortage of
women who are both ready and willing. ... Because the Democrats
have been out of office for eight years, we don't have the women in
the administrative pipeline.''
   That view was echoed by others, including <PERSON>Joanne Symons</PERSON>, a
political consultant who worked on Rep. <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>'s
presidential campaign.
   ``There are not enough (Democratic) women in the pool,'' she
said, because a Republican president has been filling Cabinet
positions the <DATE>past seven and a half years</DATE>.
   Lake also cited an ambition factor.
   She listed Gov. <PERSON>Madeleine Kunin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, along with <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Mikulski</PERSON> as Democratic women who have the stature to be vice
presidential candidates and said, ``I don't think they want it.
They want to be No. 1, not No. 2.''
   <PERSON>Howes</PERSON> said, ``The real goal is to be prepared in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> for a
woman to be ready to be president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and to run
for president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and to win.''

<TEXT>
EVERYONE knows that <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> politics can be among the roughest and meanest
in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. But even by <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> standards the four-way <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senate</ORGANIZATION>
primary race - culminating in today's vote - will go down as one of the most
vitriolic campaigns in many years.
The winner of this melee will challenge <PERSON>Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato</PERSON>, a
right-wing politician from suburban <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>, who has thus far tramped
about the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> citing the fact that he has been rebuked rather than censured
by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ethics committee as proof that he has been exonerated of past
influence-peddling charges.
<PERSON>Mr D'Amato</PERSON> is considered vulnerable this year, not least because of his
chequered record. But the Democrats have engaged in so much mud-slinging
that there is unlikely to be much high ground left to be gained by his
opponent.
Although her substantial early lead has nearly evaporated, the front-runner
among the Democrats is 56-year-old Ms <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, the former
congresswomen from the <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> who in the <DATE>1984</DATE> presidential election served
as <PERSON>Mr Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s controversial running mate.
Ms <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s troubles first began during the <DATE>1984</DATE> campaign when allegations
were made about the legality of her husband's business dealings. He pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanour after the campaign.
An unabashed supporter of capital punishment, <PERSON>Ms Ferraro</PERSON> styles herself as a
no-nonsense feminist with a working-class background.
It is the negative campaigning of her rivals that has raised the possibility
that she may not make it after all. Advertisments by rivals have accused <PERSON>Ms
Ferraro</PERSON>'s landlord husband of ties to the <LOCATION>Mafia</LOCATION> and have repeatedly alleged
he rented a house to a child pornographer.
Ms <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s keenest challenger, <ORGANIZATION>New York State</ORGANIZATION> attorney-general <PERSON>Mr Robert
Abrams</PERSON>, has not been hesitant to make use of the controversy. Neither has Ms
<PERSON>Elizabeth Holtzman</PERSON>, a former congresswomen and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s current
comptroller.
Oddly enough the only candidate who has not attacked <PERSON>Ms Ferraro</PERSON> over ethics
is the normally demagogic Rev <PERSON>Al Sharpton</PERSON>. He arrived at a televised debate
last week with a symbolic bucket of mud for his colleagues. The debate among
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democratic primary candidates became so heated that the moderator
kept intervening to say: 'Ladies, ladies, ladies, <PERSON>Ms Holtzman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ms Ferraro</PERSON>. .
.'
Issues have thus taken a back seat to insults, which means that even if Ms
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> does win today, she is unlikely to be the unblemished sort of
challenger who can make much of the various investigations of <PERSON>Mr D'Amato</PERSON>.
The seediness of this year's <ORGANIZATION>New York Senate</ORGANIZATION> race looks set to continue.
<PERSON>Jurek Martin</PERSON> adds from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>; Another race of interest concerns
Congressman <PERSON>Stephen Solarz</PERSON>, the Democratic foreign policy expert.
His old safe <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> has been redrawn  -
with the purpose of promoting Hispanic representation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> - and he
may be vulnerable to the challenge of Ms <PERSON>Elizabeth Colon</PERSON>, an advocate of
Puerto Rican interests.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Woman President `Inevitable'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> told a group of schoolchildren
that he believes it's ``inevitable'' that a woman will one day be
president, most likely after first serving as vice president.
   The president's comments came during a question-and-answer
session with junior and senior high school students from four
Washington-area schools.
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, and she's done a remarkable job for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> for an official visit and
state dinner at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the <ORGANIZATION>Western
Alliance</ORGANIZATION> during his nearly eight years in office.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said the idea of a woman president would take ``a little
getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in <DATE>1984</DATE>, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was referring to then-Rep. <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by former Vice
President <PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON>.

<HL> Remembrances of Things Past: Never Say Unelectable </HL>
<AUTHOR> Vermont Royster </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   As I wandered around the floor of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic convention, the recurring question seemed to be whether a woman could ever be elected president, or even vice president, that office only a heart's beat from the presidency. 

   This year I was a stay-at-home, but judging from the TV coverage the question was whether a black could so aspire. 
Frequently, the question was put bluntly. 
Was the fact that the Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> is black what barred him as Gov. <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>'s running mate? 

   In neither case were the questions really answered. 
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> was nominated for vice president in <DATE>1984</DATE> but the ticket led by <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> was defeated. 
<PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>'s presence on that ticket may have had something to do with it, not just because she was a woman but because of some cloudy matters surrounding her conduct as a congresswoman and her husband's legal problems. 
Besides, that year the Democrats were up against <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, then at the height of his political popularity; any Democratic ticket would have lost. 

   As for <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>, there were reasons other than race why he was passed over. 
For one, <PERSON>Mr. Dukakis</PERSON> needed a candidate from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> -- no Democrat has won the presidency without the Lone Star State -- and <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bensten</PERSON> has once before defeated Vice President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and is a proven vote-getter in that state. 

   Moreover, as Mayor <PERSON>Andrew Young</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, himself a black, pointed out, <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON> for all his charisma has never held a public office or even run for one before. 
<PERSON>Mr. Young</PERSON> thought that a lacuna in the <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> record. 

   Anyway, the question of a future woman or black as a viable candidate for national office remains moot and will be debatable endlessly. 
For the moment, white males still hold their historical monopoly on both the presidency and vice presidency. 

   I have no crystal ball, but as a senior citizen -- a very senior citizen -- I have a long memory. 
And I remember when other political figures were supposedly unelectable to our highest offices for reasons unrelated to either their sex or their race. 

   From almost the founding of the Republic it was believed that no Roman Catholic could be elected in this basically Protestant country. 
That conventional wisdom seemed borne out by the defeat of <PERSON>Al Smith</PERSON>, the Democratic candidate in <DATE>1928</DATE>. 
Gov. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> won only 87 electoral votes against <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON>, and his Catholicism certainly played a part in this. 
There was much dirty propaganda that if Gov. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> were elected, the pope would sit at his right hand in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Al Smith</PERSON> was also defeated because he was a premature "wet," favoring the repeal of the Prohibition amendment, and mainly because his opponent was the highly respected <PERSON>Mr. Hoover</PERSON>. 
Because of the Depression that followed, many have forgotten that in <DATE>1928</DATE> <PERSON>Mr. Hoover</PERSON> was one of our most highly regarded public figures and had been so for 20 years, since his masterly handling of the world relief problem after World War I. 

   <DATE>Thirty years later</DATE>, <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON>, a devoted <PERSON>Roman Catholic</PERSON>, was elected president with a large share of the votes of the majority Protestants. 
So much for that "conventional wisdom." 

   For a hundred years after our Civil War there was another bit of conventional wisdom: that no Southerner could be elected president. 
True, <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, but he won his political fame as governor of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, so he hardly counted as a Southerner in political terms. 

   But then came <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>, a Southerner born and bred, who used the governorship of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> as his springboard to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. 
He didn't win by much, but he won with a lot of Yankee votes. 
Once more the conventional wisdom got its comeuppance. 

   So I shouldn't be surprised when the day comes that we have a woman or a black (or both) on a winning national ticket. 
Indeed, it may come in the time of many now living and will not seem any more of a "big deal" than having a Southerner or a Catholic in high office. 

   But when that day does come I don't think either will be in the mold of <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON>. 
We have long grown accustomed to senators and even governors who are women, and there are many blacks today not only in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> but as mayors of some of our biggest cities, including <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. 

   These people haven't won their offices by being stridently "feminists" or narrowly black spokesmen. 
They won by exhibiting the same broad regard for their whole constituency as have successful white, male politicians and by a regard for the interests of a broad spectrum of voters. 
They have also learned, often the hard way, how to deal with the problems of government that confront every political leader. 
Neither <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON> fit that mold. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> had an appealing personality but she floundered when discussing the issues, foreign and domestic, of her time. 
<PERSON>Mr. Jackson</PERSON> is, without doubt, charismatic in person and a stem-winding orator. 
But if that was all that was required we would have had <PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON> for president in <DATE>1896</DATE> or <DATE>1900</DATE>, when both times he raised the Democratic delegates to a high pitch of enthusiasm. 

   <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> did much the same at this year's convention with a moving sermon, just as he had often done on the campaign trail. 
But a sermon it was, long on idealism and short on ways and means to achieve any of his desires. 
You could applaud the rhetoric but not the political program because you couldn't find one. 

   The future presidential nominee of a woman or a black will seem little different from past or present ones except for their sex or the color of their skin. 
Like their white, male predecessors they will have a record in public service to be examined by the electorate. 
They will doubtless be middle-aged and, whatever their origins, they will share the manner and values of the middle class that embraces the great majority of our voters. 

   When such a candidate, female or black, will make it to the White House I have no idea. 
All I can say is that a remembrance of things past convinces me never to say never in American politics.

<HEAD>Women Can Ensure Constitution's `Equality' At Ballot Box, Group
Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 1,500 women who spent two days discussing
how they could secure the Constitution's ``blessings of liberty''
were urged to become more active in politics and to run for
elective office.
   It was no accident that the event was sandwiched between <DATE>last
week</DATE>'s <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> presidential caucuses and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>
primary, said <PERSON>Linda Kurtz Hallenborg</PERSON>, a member of the symposium's
executive committee.
   ``This is a way to highlight the fact that we need to get more
women involved in politics,'' she said in an interview <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``We
need to make it clear to the presidential candidates that we make
up <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT> of the electorate, and women's issues need to be
taken seriously.''
   Those attending the symposium included <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</ORGANIZATION>; <DATE>1984</DATE> vice presidential candidate
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>; <PERSON>Coretta Scott King</PERSON>, widow of slain civil rights
leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON>; syndicated newspaper columnist <PERSON>Erma
Bombeck</PERSON>; and former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> congresswoman <PERSON>Bella Abzug</PERSON>.
   The two-day symposium on ``Women and the Constitution'' at the
<ORGANIZATION>Carter Presidential Center</ORGANIZATION> was convened by former first ladies
<PERSON>Rosalynn Carter</PERSON> and Lady Bird <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
   In speeches and seminars, women who attended the event that
ended <DATE>Friday</DATE> heard that political power could be their best hope to
achieve equality in other fields besides politics.
   They also heard that the Constitution, as originally drawn up
200 years ago, deserved criticism as unfair to women and minorities.
   ``Our criticism of the unamended Constitution is not intended to
be divisive,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>. ``Some people apparently feel that
blacks and women should join in an uncritical celebration of a
document that protected the slave trade and denied women their
democratic rights.''
   Sixty-eight years after the ratification of the <DATE>19th</DATE> Amendment,
which guaranteed women the right to vote, women make up just <PERCENT>14
percent</PERCENT> of the higher statewide political officeholders around the
country, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Women's Political Caucus</ORGANIZATION>.
   There are 23 women in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House</ORGANIZATION> and two in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Two
women are governors of states.
   Both <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> urged women to run for office and
continue working in other campaigns. <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> described a
``ripple effect'' that she discovered when her <DATE>1984</DATE> campaign
generated thousands of letters from women whom her candidacy had
inspired.
   ``It's the young woman writing after the election, `I've decided
to go to medical school because of you,''' <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said. ``It's
the 7-year-old writing from her school in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, `Someday I'm
going to run for president.'
   ``If you don't run, you can't win.''
   While <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> spoke of a future in which women will share
equally in the political landscape, <PERSON>Ms. Hallenborg</PERSON> said the present
administration _ and a return to traditionalism by some women _ has
slowed down the women's movement.
   ``I think the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> presidency has been extremely detrimental
to the progress we have made,'' she said. ``Every president up to
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> made progress in bringing women into power.''
   The <DATE>1988</DATE> elections represent an opportunity for women to
reassert themselves at the ballot box, and the outcome could
determine whether eight years of Republican conservatism has
splintered the women's equality movement for good, <PERSON>Ms. Hallenborg</PERSON>
said.
   ``This is a clarion call that women need to rise up and be
counted in the political process,'' she said.

<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of former vice presidential
candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> was sentenced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to four months
in jail for selling <MONEY>$25</MONEY> worth of cocaine to an undercover police
officer.
   <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON>, 24, also was ordered to pay a <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> fine and
perform 300 hours of community service.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said, noting that other defendants in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>
drug cases have received lighter penalties. She said the conviction
would be appealled.
   During his sentencing hearing, <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> told <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> District
<PERSON>Judge Francis McCaffrey</PERSON> in a shaky voice that he has sworn off
drugs.
   ``I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he said.
   Zaccaro's attorney, <PERSON>Charles Tetzlaff</PERSON>, asked <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON> to accept
a probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence,
probation and community service.
   But <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON> told <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, ``I can't in good conscience
sentence you without any time to serve.'' Zaccaro faced a maximum
of five years in prison and a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine.
   <ORGANIZATION>Addison County State</ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> said he was pleased
with the sentence. He denied treating the case differently.
   ``This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said. ``I felt that it was important for
the court to say it doesn't matter who you are. If you commit a
drug offense in the state of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, you'll be treated with great
severity.''
   McCaffrey suggested the jail time be served through the
<ORGANIZATION>Chittenden Community Correctional Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Burlington</LOCATION> so that
<PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> could participate in a special corrections program that
allows him to be kept under house arrest.
   <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> would have to be accepted into the program.
   During the sentencing, <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> stood stoically beside his
father, <PERSON>John Zaccaro</PERSON>, and his mother, who was <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s
running mate on the Democratic ticket in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was arrested in <DATE>February 1986</DATE> and convicted by a
<ORGANIZATION>District Court</ORGANIZATION> jury <DATE>last April</DATE>. He was arrested after selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to undercover agent <PERSON>Laura Manning</PERSON> while
he was attending <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION>, about 30 miles north of
<LOCATION>Rutland</LOCATION>.
   Manning testified that she went to <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s off-campus home,
where <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath
the living room sofa. <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was arrested that night outside the
restaurant where he worked.
   Tetzlaff argued that police used <PERSON>Manning</PERSON> as bait to snare him
during a college party weekend. The prosecution denied the charge.
   At the sentencing hearing, a tearful <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> had asked <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON>
not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of
selling <MONEY>$25</MONEY> worth of cocaine. She also said <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s arrest and
conviction have taken a heavy toll on her family and son.
   ``He doesn't go to church with us,'' she said. ``He doesn't want
to be seen with us. It's not because he's ashamed of us. It's
because he's ashamed of what he's done.''
   Also testifying at the sentencing hearing was the Rev. <PERSON>Bruce
Ritter</PERSON>, the founder of a <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> shelter for runaways called
<ORGANIZATION>Covenant House</ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> works as a volunteer.
   <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> said <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> has learned his lesson.
   ``You can't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,'' he
said. ``Probably the most important things we learn are from our
mistakes. John has learned them.''
   McCaffrey also received 30 letters written on behalf of <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>,
including one from his mother and one from <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>.
   ``I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and
strong way around our nation,'' <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> wrote.

   <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> is ``more a plus than he is
a minus'' on women's issues, but his stance on <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> aid and
defense spending could alienate women voters in <DATE>November</DATE>, women's
groups said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> senator, Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>' running mate
choice, offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to
Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, especially if <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> picks a female running
mate, said <PERSON>Molly Yard</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for
Women</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If you're a Democrat it's very worrisome,'' she said.
   Polls have shown that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is troubled by a ``gender gap'' that
has many women leaning toward the Democratic candidate in the
presidential race. But the choice of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> doesn't solidify the
women's vote in the Democratic column, the groups said.
   NOW and the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION>National Women</ORGANIZATION>'s Political Caucus rated
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s record as generally good, based on his support during the
100th <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> of civil rights legislation, Medicaid funding for
abortion in the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION> and his opposition to the
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> nomination of <PERSON>Robert Bork</PERSON>. <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> has also supported
the Equal Rights Amendment.
   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' said <PERSON>Ms.
Yard</PERSON>. ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he
is very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money
spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the
voters want change.''
   Women are more strongly opposed to defense spending and to
<ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> aid, she said, because they ``want this world to turn into a
world of negotiation and stop this nonsense about fighting.''
   <PERSON>Irene Natividad</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Women's Political
Caucus</ORGANIZATION>, said women's groups had not expected this year that
Democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``the
sense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done a
women on the ticket.''
   <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, who was <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s running mate on the
losing Democratic ticket in <DATE>1984</DATE>, said she was ``delighted'' by the
choice of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>.
   She said she was not disappointed a man had been chosen, since
there were not enough women in national political office to provide
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> with a good choice for a female running mate.
   ``If we had a woman in that <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat or in the statehouse
that had the credentials that Senator <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> has, I, of course,
would be disappointed. But because we don't have a woman in that
spot, I am not,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Pat Schroeder</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Colo.</LOCATION>, who explored the possibility of
running for president in <DATE>1988</DATE>, said that problems with the economy
are more likely to make women vote Democratic and that <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, as
head of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>, offered strong credentials on
that issue.
   ``All the gender gap polling is showing that women are truly
understanding what's wrong with the economy because they're the
ones out there trying to juggle two jobs. They're going to be very
pleased with <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>,'' she said.
   ``The real gender gap is generated from women struggling to meet
the family budget every month. Somehow I don't think they're going
to see <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> as identifying with that problem,'' she said.

Ends With an Acquittal</HL>

<TEXT>
   A state jury here acquitted the husband of <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> of extortion charges. 

   <PERSON>John A. Zaccaro</PERSON>, a 54-year-old <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate broker, was on trial in his home borough of <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> on charges that he conspired with the borough's then-president in <DATE>1981</DATE> to solicit a bribe, never paid, from a local cable television concern that was seeking a franchise. 
The innocent verdict, which came after the jury deliberated six hours, wasn't a surprise, because the district attorney's key witness from the cable company had unexpectedly denied <PERSON>Mr. Zaccaro</PERSON> tried to extort money. 

   The former borough president who allegedly conspired with <PERSON>Mr. Zaccaro</PERSON>, <PERSON>Donald Manes</PERSON>, last year committed suicide as he was being drawn into the city's then-emerging corruption scandal. 

   The allegations against <PERSON>Mr. Zaccaro</PERSON> hadn't yet been made when his wife, herself a former <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> prosecutor, was making her vice presidential bid. 
<PERSON>Mr. Zaccaro</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Robert G. Morvillo</PERSON>, borrowed her former running mate's line "Where's the beef?" -- itself borrowed from a <LOCATION>Wendy</LOCATION>'s hamburger ad -- in criticizing the state's case. 

   Standing with his family outside court yesterday, <PERSON>Mr. Zaccaro</PERSON> told a group of reporters that "I'm glad it's over." 
<PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> added that she might return to politics.

<HEAD>Mrs. King Criticizes Original Constitution, Says More Hurdles to
Cross</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two hundred years after a group of men gathered
to write the Constitution, women and minorities are closing in on
equal status but still have many hurdles to cross, <PERSON>Coretta Scott
King</PERSON> told a national symposium.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON>, wife of slain civil rights leader <PERSON>Martin Luther King
Jr.</PERSON>, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that criticism of the Constitution as it was
adopted in <DATE>1787</DATE> is justified.
   Her speech came in the closing day of a symposium on women and
the Constitution convened by former first ladies <PERSON>Rosalynn Carter</PERSON>
and Lady Bird <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>. About 1,500 women from all 50 states and 10
foreign countries attended.
   ``Some people apparently feel that blacks and women should join
in an uncritical celebration of a document that protected the slave
trade and denied women their democratic rights,'' <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said.
``We still have a way to go before we can say that the Constitution
is working for all Americans.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> echoed another speaker at the symposium, <DATE>1984</DATE> vice
presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, in calling for more
political activism on the part of women.
   ``If <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, we
will need many more women of all races holding elective office,''
<PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said. ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for
nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered
in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society.''
   ``We just might save this nation from its pending apointment
with Armageddon,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said the civil rights struggles of the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE>
laid the groundwork for the women's rights movements of the years
that followed. She said the kind of organized, non-violent dissent
championed by her late husband is still an effective form of
protest.
   ``The (civil rights) movement showed millions of Americans that
you can, indeed you must, defy authority when that authority is in
the wrong,'' <PERSON>Mrs. King</PERSON> said.
   Earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said that while no women are among
the candidates for president in either party, women have reached
higher levels in the campaign organizations than ever before.
   ``The women who hold positions of responsibility in presidential
campaigns, whether or not their candidate is ultimately successful,
will forge contacts and gain credibility that will endure beyond
this election cycle,'' she said.
   ``Many of them will be back, with higher ambitions and sharper
skills, in <DATE>1992</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>, whose presence on the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic ticket with
<PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> was a high point for the women's movement, said the
women in some of the <DATE>1988</DATE> campaigns will go on to be advisers to
the next president.
   ``And that's important, too,'' she said. ``The current
administration has widely been regarded as hostile to women's
issues. That is in part because this president's inner circle of
advisers ... have except for his wife been men.''

With 99 per cent of precincts having reported, <PERSON>Mr Abrams</PERSON> had 410,402 votes
(37 per cent), while <PERSON>Ms Ferraro</PERSON> had 399,410 votes (36 per cent). Two other
candidates split the rest.
Ms <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, although clearly disheartened after she had spent <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY> on the contest, argued that she might yet win when absentee votes
were counted.
The Democratic victor will run against Senator <PERSON>Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato</PERSON>, a
right-wing Republican who has himself been the target of ethics probes and
has been rebuked by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr Abrams</PERSON>, a liberal, has
argued that he is better placed than <PERSON>Ms Ferraro</PERSON> to challenge the senator
over ethics.
In a primary for a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> seat in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, Democrats
elected the late <PERSON>Mr Ted Weiss</PERSON>, although the liberal incumbent had died on
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. Now Democratic party leaders will select a candidate to contest the
<DATE>November</DATE> election.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Continues In Zaccaro Trial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 8 grafs with questioning today, picks up 5th graf,
`Zaccaro, 24 ....'</NOTE>

   More potential jurors were questioned today
in the cocaine trial of <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON>, with attorneys asking
panelists about the defendant's mother, former vice presidential
candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   Questioning resumed after a judge lifted a gag order <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
restricted media coverage of jury selection. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded when all sides agreed to permit a
pool of six reporters.
   All three panelists questioned <TIME>this morning</TIME> said they had read
newspaper accounts of the case since <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was charged in <DATE>1986</DATE>
with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police
agent. <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION>.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s family while the former congresswoman was
the Democratic nominee in <DATE>1984</DATE>, and she thought the attacks had
carried over to the son after his arrest.
   However, the unidentified woman said her views would not
interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Zaccaro faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted.
   The long-delayed trial began <DATE>Monday</DATE>. Questioning of potential
panelists centered on their political beliefs and their views on
the impact of drugs on society.
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, 24, was accompanied in court by his parents, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>
and <PERSON>John Zaccaro Sr</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Judge Francis McCaffery</PERSON> imposed the gag order at the request of
defense attorneys, who were concerned that too many reporters in
the room could intimidate potential jurors. But he lifted it after
a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among
lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings.
   <PERSON>Robert Hemley</PERSON>, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   Lawyers on <DATE>Monday</DATE> completed initial questioning of at least
seven potential jurors of a pool of more than 20. More than 150
people could be interviewed.
   Several in the jury pool expressed strong feelings about the
role of drugs in society. One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd
probably be the one going to jail if I catch someone selling drugs
to my kid.''
   None of those questioned said <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s place on the <DATE>1984</DATE>
Democratic Party ticket would affect their judgment of her son.
   The trial comes more than two years after <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was arrested
outside the <LOCATION>Middlebury</LOCATION> restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> sold cocaine to
undercover agent <PERSON>Laura Manning</PERSON> after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> refused to dismiss the case.

Before he first debated <PERSON>Susan Molinari</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON>Bob Gigante</PERSON> received 
this warning from campaign consultants: "Whatever you do, don't make her cry." 
</P>
<P>
Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember <DATE>1984</DATE>? I can't forget it!" <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said recently of the presidential 
campaign in which Democrat <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> ran against him for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The subject arose after <PERSON>Clayton Williams</PERSON>, the Republican nominee for governor 
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, said he'd rather have state Atty. Gen. <PERSON>Jim Mattox</PERSON> as his opponent 
than <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>, the state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman," <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was quoted as 
saying before <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> captured the Democratic nomination in the runoff 
election against <PERSON>Mattox</PERSON> last week. 
</P>
<P>
The political landscape is strewn with faux pas committed by men -- mostly 
older men. 
</P>
<P>
"The men are nervous," said <PERSON>Celinda Lake</PERSON>, a pollster for the Democrats. "Women 
running is just plain different, and men sense it." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> got himself in trouble in <DATE>1984</DATE> by saying, after debating <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, that he 
had "kicked a little ass." Later, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> agriculture commissioner <PERSON>Jim Buck 
Ross</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> if she could bake blueberry muffins. "Yes. Can you?" she 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Men told women in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> that they shouldn't be running 
for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> because they had young children. One of the candidates, <PERSON>Sen. 
Gordon Humphrey</PERSON> (R-N.H.) later apologized and said his statement had been "just 
plain stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to be a little bit 
more chivalric, if that's the right word," said Atty. Gen. <PERSON>John K. Van de Kamp</PERSON>, 
who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> against 
<PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp promised not to punch his opponent in the nose, but he has taken a 
few verbal swings at her. One of his ads ends with: "<PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> -- if she 
couldn't manage a city, how could she manage <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>?" 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Martha Layne Collins</PERSON>, on the other hand, was elected governor of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>1983</DATE> "in part because her opponents never could figure out how to run against 
her. They never did point out anything wrong with her," said Democratic 
pollster <PERSON>Harrison Hickman</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like a candidate and 
talks like a candidate, you treat it like a candidate," added <PERSON>Hickman</PERSON>, whose 
clients include Van de Kamp and <PERSON>Sen. Paul Simon</PERSON> (D-Ill.), who is trying to fend 
off a <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> challenge from Rep. <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Women such as <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, who have hired two of the hardest-hitting 
media consultants in the business, are making it easier for male opponents to 
attack them by proving that they can be as aggressive as the next guy. 
</P>
<P>
They also are coming up with some deft responses to gender-related gaffes, such 
as <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s comeback to <PERSON>Ross</PERSON>'s blueberry-muffin question. Richards came up 
with a good one-liner after <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, a self-styled symbol of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> machismo -- 
confessed that he wouldn't relish running against her. "Even cowboys get the 
blues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, 58, has been blue indeed since he was heard comparing the bad weather 
at his ranch to a rape situation. "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy 
it," he said. The remark last month stirred up a furor, and <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> eventually 
apologized "from the bottom of my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Stone attributed <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>' attitude to his age and upbringing. "His lexicon 
hasn't caught up with the times yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But while men of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>' age may not be used to competing with women, many 
younger candidates such as <LOCATION>Gigante</LOCATION>, 41, consider it perfectly normal. Gigante, 
a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Democrat with four children and a working wife, was surprised by his 
coaches' advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would she cry?" Gigante asked. "She's a mature woman. She's held office. 
She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on an issue, just like I wasn't 
going to cry if she attacked me." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Molinari</PERSON> did not cry. She won the election and is serving as a congresswoman 
from <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mondale Urges Dukakis To Use Different Strategy Than His For
Picking Veep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON> says the interviews he held
four years ago with prospective running mates proved a ``damaged
strategy'' and he thinks <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> ought to find a different
way of selecting the Democratic vice presidential nominee this year.
   Four years ago, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> interviewed a succession of candidates
before he chose <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, then a congresswoman from <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, as the first woman on a major party's national ticket. One by
one, the vice presidential hopefuls visited <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> at his home in
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>.
   In retrospect, ``I don't think it built confidence,'' <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>
said of the process. The <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic presidential nominee's
comments came in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> law
office on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``I don't think the way that process played out reassured
Americans,'' he said. ``It's a damaged strategy even though it was
not a bad idea.''
   He suggested that <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> ``pursue a different way of looking at
vice presidential candidates.''
   Asked if he thought <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, who now appears likely to lock up
the Democratic presidential nomination before the <DATE>July</DATE> convention,
should choose a Southerner for his running mate, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> said, ``I
wouldn't say he has to. But what I can't figure out is how you get
the numbers if you don't run strong in the South.''
   <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> was optimistic about the Democrats' chances of winning a
presidential election for only the second time in the last six.
   ``We've got a shot at this deal,'' he said.
   Republican Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> ``is a troubled
candidate,'' he said. ``I think he gets off in an uncertain way. I
think there are going to be vulnerabilities on both sides. But
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> looks strong as a person and I don't think <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> does.''
   <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> said there is a need to ``constantly reassure Americans
that you possess that special presidential strength of character
and independence and resolve to serve the public interest.''
   In recent campaign appearances, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> often has seemed to be
campaigning against <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>, under whom <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> served as vice
president.
   ``I believe that's a sign of weakness,'' said <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>. ``Here's
a guy who ought to be filling in the blanks where people are
worried about him, which is character and vision and direction and
presidential status.
   ``Instead, he's out there hacking around against a president
who's been out of office for eight years.''
   <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> also suggested that <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> avoid following his example
of declaring that if elected president he would raise taxes to
reduce the federal deficit.
   ``I think it's too bad ...that we can't talk about our real
problems,'' he said, but ``I think the verdict is in on that.''

<HEAD>History of Vice Presidential Choices Looks to Shape Party Picks in
'88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> isn't likely to forget that night
in <DATE>July 1980</DATE>, when his hopes of being the Republican vice
presidential nominee were dashed and then suddenly restored. It was
a night certain to have a profound impact on how <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> goes about
filling the No. 2 spot on the <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> ticket.
   <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> was only an observer of the long process that
led <PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON> to the historic decision to fill out the <DATE>1984</DATE>
Democratic ticket with a woman. But the impression that process
created and the impact of disclosures about the dealings of
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>'s husband are equally certain to affect how
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> chooses a running mate.
   The selection of a running mate is often described as the most
important decision a presidential nominee makes.
   And <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> has followed tradition by declaring that his choice
will be dictated by the need to have someone qualified to serve as
president if ``heaven forbid'' something should happen to him.
   Thirteen vice presidents eventually moved to the top office _
eight of them upon the death of the president. Four others were
later elected president, though only one, <PERSON>Martin Van Buren</PERSON>, was
elected while serving as vice president. One vice president, <PERSON>Gerald
R. Ford</PERSON>, gained the presidency when the incumbent, <PERSON>Richard M.
Nixon</PERSON>, was forced to resign.
   Despite the fact that nearly one-third of presidents first
served as vice president, the No. 2 spot on the ticket historically
has gone to someone chosen at the last possible moment for reasons
based far more on politics than qualifications.
   According to <PERSON>Robert F. Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> was
an accidental choice to be <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s running mate in <DATE>1960</DATE>.
   The new book, ``<PERSON>Robert Kennedy</PERSON>, His Own Words,'' quotes <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>
as saying that when his brother offered the vice presidential
nomination to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> ``he never dreamt there was a chance in the
world he would accept it.''
   After <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> accepted the offer, <PERSON>Robert Kennedy</PERSON> quoted his
brother as asking, ``Now what do we do?''
   The brothers tried to convince <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> that putting him on the
ticket would provoke a liberal revolt on the convention floor. But
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said he was willing to risk such a fight.
   As it turned out, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s presence on the ticket was a
critical factor in helping <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> carry Southern states,
particularly <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, in his narrow victory over <LOCATION>Nixon</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON> was little known outside his home state of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>
when he was tapped by <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> in <DATE>1944</DATE>.
   Roosevelt cared little about the vice presidential nominee as he
prepared to run for a fourth term although he decided well in
advance of the Democratic convention to dump <PERSON>Henry A. Wallace</PERSON>, who
had served four years as vice president and wanted another four.
But Southerners opposed <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON> and he was not well-liked in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   With World War II moving to a close, <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> was looking ahead
to the possibility of <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> fights over peace treaties and
establishment of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>. Truman was popular with his
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> colleagues.
   In his memoirs, <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> recalled that when he arrived in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>
for the convention he brushed aside suggestions that he seek the
vice presidency.
   But <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>'s old friend from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robert Hannegan</PERSON>, was
Democratic Party chairman, and he was lobbying to get the senator
on the ticket.
   Truman resisted when party leaders asked him to allow his name
to be put forth to the convention as vice president.
   Then came a telephone call from <LOCATION>Roosevelt</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Hannegan</PERSON> held the
phone away from his ear and <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> could hear the president say,
``Bob, have you got that fellow lined up yet?''
   ``No, he's the contrariest <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> mule I've ever dealt with,''
replied <PERSON>Hannegan</PERSON>.
   ``Well you tell him if he wants to break up the Democratic Party
in the middle of a war, that's his responsibility,'' said
<PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON>, who then hung up.
   ``I'll have to say yes,'' <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> told <PERSON>Hannegan</PERSON>.
   Eighty-three days after taking office as vice president, <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>
succeeded to the presidency.
   Ford was the first vice president to attain that office under
the more deliberative process of the 25th Amendment. Then, after he
succeeded <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> named Gov. <PERSON>Nelson A. Rockefeller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
as his vice president. Rockefeller won out over a little-known
Texan named <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>1976</DATE>, <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> settled on <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Mondale</PERSON> after a
process in which prospective choices trooped to <LOCATION>Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, to be
interviewed by <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>.
   Eight years later, <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> used a similar process. The people
who traveled to <LOCATION>North Oaks</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>, included three women, a black, a
Hispanic, and a white Southern senator.
   When <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, a congresswoman from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, was selected,
feminists were ecstatic. But the benefits <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> reaped from the
bold choice of a woman quickly faded when the following weeks
brought headlines with accounts of her husband's business dealings.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was caught in one of the strangest sequences ever at a
nominating convention.
   The scene was <ORGANIZATION>Joe Louis Arena</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> on the <TIME>night</TIME> of <DATE>July
16</DATE>. For days Republicans had talked of a ``dream ticket'' made up
of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. The former president would technically be vice
president but would actually assume far greater responsibilities,
becoming in effect a co-president.
   As the convention got under way that <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was
waiting to deliver a unity speech before the balloting to nominate
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   He recalled waiting in the wings ``when a backstage worker came
by, patted me on the back, and said, `I'm sorry, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>, really
sorry. I was pulling for you.'
   ```Sorry about what?' I asked, as we shook hands.
   ```You mean you haven't heard? It's all over. <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s picked
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> as his running mate.'''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was described as furious as he left the hall, angry that
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> people had not told him of the decision to choose
someone else.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> option was looking less attractive. Among
considerations that disturbed <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> advisers was the fact that
during the campaign, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> would be addressed as ``<PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>,''
while <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> would be referred to as ``governor.''
   Then <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> appeared on television being interviewed by <PERSON>Walter
Cronkite</PERSON>. He said that he would not go to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> as ``a
figurehead vice president.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was stunned to see the former president talking on
national television about their private discussions. The
impossibility of the projected arrangement was growing clearer.
   A call went out to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   ``It came out of the clear blue sky,'' he said. The ticket was
forged.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments Scheduled In Drug Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANICA KIRKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With jury selection almost completed,
opening arguments were scheduled <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the cocaine trial of
<PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr</PERSON>.
   After three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors,
prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the
12 people who will decide whether <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> is guilty of illegally
selling a regulated drug.
   The state maintains that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, then a student at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury
College</ORGANIZATION>, sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police
officer two years ago.
   The two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors,
trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given
the case and from the fact that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, now 24, is the son of
former vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> could affect his view of the case.
   Many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had
read, because of a distrust of the press.
   ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because
they have been charged,'' said <PERSON>Donald Cioffi</PERSON> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Warren Taylor</PERSON> of <PERSON>Chittenden</PERSON> said he was ``not a firm believer in
what the media prints.''
   Another potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s family while she was a candidate in <DATE>1984</DATE>,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> after his
arrest.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON>John Zaccaro Sr.</PERSON>, have been present for
the three days of questioning in the cramped chambers of the
presiding judge.
   Police said they began their investigation of <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> after
hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling the
cocaine to an undercover police officer.
   Defense lawyer <PERSON>Charles Tetzlaff</PERSON> has asked potential jurors if
they would be willing to find someone innocent based on a technical
defect in the state's case. The defense is expected to try to prove
that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was entrapped by the police, and that the police
singled him out because of his famous mother.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Elaborate on Advice for Running Against Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said today he's got some
opinions about running against women candidates, but he won't say
what they are.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> called himself an ``expert in the field,'' referring to his
<DATE>1984</DATE> vice presidential race against then Rep. <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   He was asked at a news conference if he had any advice for
<PERSON>Clayton Williams</PERSON>, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
whose opponent will be decided in a runoff between Democratic state
Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> and Attorney Gen. <PERSON>Jim Mattox</PERSON>.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
a woman.
   As for presidential advice, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> retorted:
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' because it could end up ``complicating
his life,'' he said.
   ``Remember <DATE>1984</DATE>. I can't forget it.''
   Williams, he said, is, ``entitled to his opinion. Maybe he's
drawing on my experience.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had a hard time competing with the wave of positive feeling
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s candidacy initially generated among women.
   When at last he felt he had made a strong showing against her in
a televised debate, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> stated he had ``kicked a little ass'' with
his performance.

   A judge bowed to objections from news
organizations and lifted an order barring reporting on jury
selection <DATE>Monday</DATE> at the cocaine-sale trial of <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON>, son
of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   The 24-year-old <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> is charged with selling a quarter gram
of the drug to an undercover officer two years ago while a senior
at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION>. The offense carries a penalty of up to five
years in prison and a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine.
   Zaccaro on <DATE>Monday</DATE> entered the courtroom separately from his
parents, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Zaccaro Sr.</PERSON>, as the long-delayed trial
began. But they sat immediately behind their son.
   In questioning of at least seven potential jurors <DATE>Monday</DATE>, none
said <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s candidacy would have any affect on how they would
judge her son.
   Several panelists expressed strong sentiments about drugs. One
juror, who was dismissed, said, ``I'd probably be the one going to
jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   <PERSON>Judge Francis McCaffrey</PERSON>, after a meeting with attorneys, had
imposed an gag order and said only six reporters could attend jury
selection. He said that he expects the process to last three days
and that any information published could prejudice the jury pool.
   ``It is important that we get an impartial jury. That is where
you persons have become an issue,'' <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON> told the 11 reporters
in the courtroom. ``Clearly, segregated voir dire is appropriate in
this case.''
   However, after an afternoon hearing on a challenge from several
news organizations, <PERSON>McCaffery</PERSON> lifted the order. But he said only
six reporters would be allowed in the room during the proceedings
and they would have to share their information.
   <PERSON>Robert Hemley</PERSON>, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, had told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   ``The issue, then, is, what is happening in the voir dire
process that is different or more damaging (than previous pre-trial
publicity)?'' <PERSON>Hemley</PERSON> said.
   Zaccaro's lawyers, <PERSON>Charles Tetzlaff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas Sherrer</PERSON>, had
requested the order and <ORGANIZATION>Addison County State</ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON>
did not object. <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said he also was concerned about the jury
pool, noting that the case has received widespread publicity
because of <ORGANIZATION>Ferraro</ORGANIZATION>'s prominence.
   Zaccaro is charged with sale of a regulated drug for allegedly
selling cocaine to undercover agent <PERSON>Laura Manning</PERSON> after she came to
his off-campus apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   Zaccaro also had been charged with possession of cocaine with
intent to sell, based on evidence police had found in <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s
car, including eight grams of cocaine and documents described as
records of drug transactions.
   But the charge was dismissed because of problems with the search
warrant and the lack of other evidence to prove the charge.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was singled out for prosecution
because of his famous mother, who ran on the Democratic ticket in
<DATE>1984</DATE> with <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Tetzlaff</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sherrer</PERSON> were unsuccessful in having the case thrown
out altogether. The <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> refused to dismiss the
charges.

<HL> Media Got Singed for Overcooking in Quayle Roast </HL>
<AUTHOR> S. Robert Lichter </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<G> EXE CNG </G>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Lesley Stahl</PERSON> called him "the vice presidential pick that ate the Republican convention." 
By week's end, however, it was the media that stood accused of a feeding frenzy that featured <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> under glass. 
Have the media treated <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> unfairly? 
If so, why are the Republicans leading in the polls for the first time this <DATE>summer</DATE>? 
The answers involve not just the media but the way they interact with both the candidates and the public in presidential elections. 

   <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> actually received good early notices, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Media and Public Affairs</ORGANIZATION>' analysis of election news. 
During the networks' Republican convention coverage from <DATE>Aug. 16 through Aug. 18</DATE>, most comments about him were positive and even reporters displayed more skepticism than outright criticism. 
This reflects the peculiar status of party conventions as prime-time media events scripted by political consultants rather than network producers. 
Everywhere the cameras turned, they found another delegate waiting to praise the new running mate. 

   The regular evening news was where the coverage got rough. 
During the 12 days after his nomination, the three major networks ran 93 stories on <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON>. 
That was more stories than any presidential candidate but <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> attracted throughout the entire primary season. 
And without sound bites from those friendly convention delegates, <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON>'s coverage took a sharp downturn. 
Questions about his military service record popped up in 50 stories. 
His privileged family background came up in 19 stories, and his relationship to lobbyist <PERSON>Paula Parkinson</PERSON> was the focus of 13 reports. 

   On <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>, Democratic pollster <PERSON>Peter Hart</PERSON> called <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> "a politically mildewed candidate" whose "odor" is "never going to be erased." 
NBC's <PERSON>Dennis Murphy</PERSON> claimed he would be a "hard sell" to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murphy</PERSON> interviewed one vet who called <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> service "no different than going to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>." 
And <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON>Jacqueline Adams</PERSON> termed <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> "a not-ready-for-prime-time player" whose "pro-defense rhetoric was almost comical." 

   Overall, only one in three evaluations of <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> by reporters and other nonpartisan sources were positive (neutral comments are excluded in the sample). 
That's worse press than any presidential candidate received during the primary race, with the exception of <PERSON>Gary Hart</PERSON>'s abysmal 4-to-1 negative ratio. 
By contrast, <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s primary coverage was about evenly divided between positive and negative, <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>'s was nearly 3 to 2 positive, and <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>'s was 3 to 1 positive. 

   Perhaps the most appropriate comparison, however, is to the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic vice-presidential nominee. 
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> was also assailed by charges of scandal or impropriety, and she complained bitterly about her media coverage. 
Yet a study by political scientist <PERSON>Michael Robinson</PERSON>, a self-described liberal Democrat, found that <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> had the most positive "spin" of any candidate on TV news that fall. 
Moreover, questions about her finances and credentials together generated only nine stories on the <TIME>evening</TIME> news. 
<PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>'s foibles were easily eclipsed by TV's attention to <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s blunders that year, from his braggadocio that he "kicked a little ass" to his fumbling attempts to define "shame." 

   Even if <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>'s media treatment was milder than <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON>'s, the outcome may be instructive for the <DATE>1988</DATE> race. 
Strong majorities of the public eventually approved of the way she handled questions about her finances, and the controversy apparently didn't affect the election. 
Most people vote for the presidential candidate, not the running mate. 
What did hurt the Democrats was the 2-to-1 majority of those who thought <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> chose <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> because of pressure from women's groups. 
The vice-presidential choice is important mainly as an indicator of the values and judgment of the presidential nominee. 

   Ironically, that's how the <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> episode redounded to <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s benefit. 
The controversy allowed <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> to reinforce his powerful acceptance speech with an object lesson in leadership. 
He was on-screen every night defending his running mate in a manner that displayed the decisive, steadfast, take-charge image his advisers have long hoped for. 

   Even in an age of image-making, of course, reality still counts in politics. 
If the "draft-dodger" label had stuck, <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> might well have taken <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> down with him. 
Instead <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON> ended up looking unfairly maligned by the media attack pack, and <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> dominated the public agenda with a successful defense of both his subordinate and his own judgment. 
The payoff was the biggest post-convention "bump" in the polls since <DATE>1972</DATE>. 
No wonder <PERSON>Pat Buchanan</PERSON> was moved to say, "Thank you Dan Rather." 

   The Democrats still have plenty of time to rebound from the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>August</DATE> surprise. 
The real victim of the <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> hunt was the media. 
The latest "Times Mirror" polls show that majorities of the public think the story was overplayed and unfair to <PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON>. 
More significantly, the proportion of those who see a Democratic bias in the news has more than doubled since <DATE>May</DATE> (from <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>), and the proportion of those who believe news organizations "get the facts straight" has dropped from <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT>. 

   As <PERSON>Dan Rather</PERSON> learned in his set-to with <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> in <DATE>January</DATE>, attack journalism is not without risk. 
When the press takes on the role of political opposition, the electorate may reject the messenger as well as the message. 
That's why two weeks of roasting <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> left the Republicans fat and happy but gave the networks indigestion.

   <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> didn't choose his vice
presidential running mate until almost the last minute, <PERSON>Jimmy
Carter</PERSON> conducted a long, boring search, and <PERSON>Adlai Stevenson</PERSON>
declined to choose at all. They all did it their way and so did
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s decision to keep everybody guessing _ until <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME> _ was the No. 2 topic at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National
Convention</ORGANIZATION>, which had little else to talk about. No. 1, of course,
was the choice itself.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> brought all that speculation to an abrupt end <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME> with his announcement that he had selected <PERSON>Sen. Dan
Quayle</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> as his running mate.
   In holding his cards close to his vest, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was only doing unto
others what <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> did to him. All evening, on <DATE>Wednesday of 1980</DATE>
Republican Convention week in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, it looked as if former
President <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> would be <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s choice for vice president.
The way <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> saw it, if they won they would have sort of a shared
presidency.
   But at <TIME>11:15 p.m. Reagan</TIME> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> agreed not to be a team and
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> received a telephone call. As <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recalls in his
autobiography, the conversation went like this:
   ``Hello, <PERSON>George</PERSON>, this is <PERSON>Ron Reagan</PERSON>. I'd like to go over to the
convention and announce that you're my choice for vice president if
that's all right with you.''
   ``I'd be honored, Governor.''
   ``George is there anything at all ... about the platform or
anything else, anything that might make you uncomfortable down the
road.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> could think of nothing. A few minutes after <TIME>midnight</TIME>,
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> made an unusual trip to convention hall to announced his
choice, a dramatic end to a dramatic night of speculation and rumor.
   Despite the long list of vice presidential hopefuls that came to
be interviewed in <LOCATION>Plains</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> didn't announce his
choice of <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> until <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the day the vice
presidential nomination went before the delegates.
   The fact that both tickets with last minute running mate choices
won probably hadn't escaped <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. The fact that <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>
picked <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> in advance in <DATE>1984</DATE> _ and they lost the
election _ might also have made an impression.
   The choice of a running mate is probably the most important
early decision a presidential candidate makes. Thirteen vice
presidents have become president, eight on the death of a president.
   In <DATE>1956</DATE>, Democratic nominee <PERSON>Adlai Stevenson</PERSON> startled the
convention in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> by leaving the choice of his running mate to
the delegates. As a result, votes were distributed among 13
candidates after the first ballot.
   <PERSON>Sen. Estes Kefauver</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> had 483{ votes, followed by
<PERSON>Sen. John F. Kennedy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> with 304 and <PERSON>Sen. Albert Gore</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> with 178.
   On the second ballot, <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> had the lead after the roll call,
but before the chair recognized vote changes. Gore pulled out,
began a bandwagon for Kefauver, and <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> moved that <PERSON>Kefauver</PERSON>'s
nomination be made unanimous. The ticket lost.
   With that exception, every vice presidential nominee in modern
times has been the presidential nominee's choice _ albeit an uneasy
choice, sometimes. In <DATE>1944</DATE>, <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> didn't want to
run with Vice President <PERSON>Henry Wallace</PERSON> but had no other favorite. He
was persuaded to accept <PERSON>Harry S. Truman</PERSON>, who then succeeded him 82
days after the inauguration when <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> died.
   In <DATE>1960</DATE>, <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> offered the No. 2 spot to <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON>,
thinking that his chief opponent for the presidential nomination
would not accept. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> did, helped <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> win by bringing in
<LOCATION>Southern</LOCATION> states, and became president when <ORGANIZATION>JFK</ORGANIZATION> was assassinated in
<DATE>1963</DATE>.
   When <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> ran for president in <DATE>1964</DATE>, Republican nominee <PERSON>Barry
Goldwater</PERSON> picked Rep. <PERSON>William E. Miller</PERSON> as a teammate, saying ``one
of the reasons I chose <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> is that he drives <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> nuts.''

   Former vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine
Ferraro</PERSON> says she partly blames herself and her candidacy for her
son's cocaine conviction because it made him ``a target,'' and says
the family will appeal the verdict to the <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' said <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> of her
24-year-old son, <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr</PERSON>. But she acknowledged that he had
possessed cocaine, and said his legal troubles showed him ``the
horrors of drugs.''
   A <ORGANIZATION>Vermont District Court</ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated for slightly more than
two hours <DATE>Saturday</DATE> before finding <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> guilty of selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while
he was a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION> two years ago.
   No sentencing date was set, and an appeal could take two years.
The felony conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in
jail and a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine.
   In a statement after the verdict, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> blamed her son for
possessing cocaine, as well as herself ``and my candidacy for
making my son a target.'' Ferraro ran on the Democratic ticket with
<PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   ``We are a concerned family who has lived through a very
difficult two years,'' she said. ``We love our son. We do not
minimize in any way his use of drugs at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION> or the
fact that <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION> is the place where drugs was available
to so many students and continues to be so. It was wrong.''
   ``There are four people who are guilty in this whole episode,''
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said. ``John for possession. We are grateful that God has
chosen this way to show him the horrors of drugs. Me and my
candidacy for making my son a target.''
   Ferraro's statement went on to name former <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury</ORGANIZATION> police
Sgt. <PERSON>David Wemette</PERSON> ``for setting my son up'' and <ORGANIZATION>Addison County
State</ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> for ``prolonging the agony for two
years'' by rejecting a plea bargain.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said. The family had
asked prosecutors to allow <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> to plead guilty to a lesser
charge of possession of cocaine.
   But <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> would not accept a plea for less than a felony.
   ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the charge,
that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any justification
for reducing the charge,'' <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said. ``There was plenty of
evidence he was selling. I never considered a possession case and
they know that,'' he added.
   Ferraro pointed to several drug cases recently heard in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>
in which plea bargains were arranged easily and light sentences
were given to defendants accused of selling larger quantities of
drugs.
   ``That may or may not be true. I know there are some cases like
that. It depends on the particular prosecutor. It depends on the
particular circumstances of the case,'' <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on, I feel more strongly about drug cases. I
just think it's becoming more of a problem in the country and we
need to deter that,'' <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said.
   The defense also had raised the argument that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his
mother, but the <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> refused to overturn the
charges on that basis.
   Jury selection lasted four days, prolonged by wide publicity the
case had gained, but the verdict came only one day after the trial
itself began.
   Opening arguments and testimony began <DATE>Friday</DATE>, with the defense
claiming <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was entrapped by a young, inexperienced,
attractive undercover police officer. ``This is a case of improper
and overzealous police conduct,'' <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON>Charles
Tetzlaff</PERSON>, argued.
   He called no witnesses, instead basing his defense on attacks on
the prosecution witnesses and attempting to show the police
investigation was based purely on rumor and that the undercover buy
was poorly executed.
   But <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was a well-organized drug dealer. He
described the deal with undercover officer <PERSON>Laura Manning</PERSON> as just
another sale.
   ``When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the
good merchant that he is, ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives
it to <PERSON>Manning</PERSON>, <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said.
   Manning's drug buy came <DATE>Feb. 20, 1986</DATE>. <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said it was
arranged after an anonymous note was left on <ORGANIZATION>Wemette</ORGANIZATION>'s desk in the
<DATE>fall of 1985</DATE> with <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s name, address, car registration and the
words: ``The Pharmacist.'' Police and prosecutors said <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> had
earned the nickname because of his reputation as a drug dealer.
   Wemette testified he first heard rumors of <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s drug
dealing in <DATE>1984</DATE>, but did not pursue them because <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> left
college to help his mother's campaign.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said <PERSON>Bob Woithe</PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION>Palm Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   The college had reacted to the arrest by forming a task force
that made 20 recommendations to address student drug abuse, most of
which have been adopted. They include the hiring of a health
educator, publication of a drug brochure, additional security
staff, and improved relations with the <LOCATION>Middlebury</LOCATION> police.

   Potential jurors questioned <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in the
cocaine trial of <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON> said their judgment would not be
influenced by the fact that the defendant's mother is former vice
presidential candidate <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s family while she was a candidate in <DATE>1984</DATE>,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> after his
arrest.
   The questioning was watched by six reporters one day after <PERSON>Judge
Francis McCaffrey</PERSON> imposed and then lifted a gag order.
   Most of the jurors questioned said they had read newspaper
accounts of the case since <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was charged in <DATE>1986</DATE> with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>,
24, was then a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION>.
   The offense carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and
a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
said <PERSON>Joanne Cillo</PERSON> said when asked if she was pleased with how
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> has been treated.
   But she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if
she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers taking
notes intently. But she stopped when <PERSON>Cillo</PERSON> spoke about the
treatment her family received, rested her head in her hands and
looked down.
   <PERSON>John Zaccaro Sr.</PERSON> accompanied his wife and son on the second day
of questioning.
   None of the other jurors questioned so far have said they would
be influenced by the fact <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> is <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s mother. ``It
wouldn't matter one way or another who she was,'' <PERSON>Ellen Daly</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Rutland</LOCATION> said.
   At the noon break, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> declined to comment, telling one
reporter, ``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not
answering anything for anybody.''
   McCaffery had imposed the gag order <DATE>Monday</DATE> in response to
complaints by defense attorneys that the presence of too many
reporters could intimidate potential jurors. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded later that day when all sides
agreed to permit a pool of six reporters.
   Prosecutor <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> said he was not sure how long it would
take to pick a jury.
   Pre-trial publicity seemed less of a problem than the jurors'
opinions about drug use.
   One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd probably be the one going
to jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   The trial comes more than two years after <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was arrested
outside the <LOCATION>Middlebury</LOCATION> restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> sold cocaine to
undercover agent <PERSON>Laura Manning</PERSON> after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother, but the <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> refused to
dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Ferraro's Son to Four Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has sentenced <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON> to
four months in prison for selling cocaine to an undercover police
officer, rejecting <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>'s plea that ``my son has been
punished enough.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Vermont District Court</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Judge Francis McCaffrey</PERSON> also ordered
<PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> to pay <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> and perform 300 hours of community service
during his sentencing <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, 24, could have faced up to
five years and a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine for selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the
sentence. His mother, the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic vice presidential
nominee, said after the hearing that her son had been treated
differently than the average defendant.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said, noting that other defendants in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>
drug cases have received lighter penalties. Zaccaro's attorney,
<PERSON>Charles Tetzlaff</PERSON>, had requested a suspended sentence with probation
and community service.
   <ORGANIZATION>Addison County State</ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON>, who had requested a
jail term, denied that he had treated the case differently.
   ``This was a case where we caught a person red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said. ``I felt that it was important for
this court to say it doesn't matter who you are, you're not going
to escape the consequences of selling cocaine in this state.''
   <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON> said he was at a loss to understand why <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> sold
drugs, saying the only explanation he could think of was greed and
a desire for acceptance by his peers.
   ``I can't in good conscience sentence you without any time to
serve,'' the judge said. <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> had grown up
with every advantage, including a good education and family support.
   McCaffrey suggested that the jail time be spent in special
<LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> corrections program that allows convicts to be kept under
house arrest with supervision by a probation officer. But <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON>
said later that <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> must still be accepted into the program.
   Zaccaro's parents sat quietly and leaned forward as <ORGANIZATION>McCaffrey</ORGANIZATION>
passed sentence.
   In a hearing before <PERSON>McCaffrey</PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> broke down in
tears on the stand as she described her reaction to her son's
<DATE>February 1986</DATE> arrest. She was in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> giving a lecture that day
and had to watch the event on television.
   ``When I got home from <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, I went home and my son put his
arms around me and he cried and he said he was sorry,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>
recalled. ``He was sorry for what he had done to us.''
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> held his head in his hands as his mother described the
impact the case had on the family.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> prosecutor, criticized <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> for
failing to allow a plea bargain.
   ``I have never had a case where people weren't interested in
discussing any sort of disposition,'' <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said, adding that the
defense had ``begged and pleaded'' for an agreement.
   ``If it had been anyone else ... we would not be sitting here,''
she said. ``My son has been punished enough. I want him back. I
want him back so that we can start our lives all over again.''

<TEXT>
   Mindful of <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>'s ill-fated vice
presidential quest in <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> had aides accompany
<PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> on his first campaign solo flight.
   The 67-year-old <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> is no stranger to campaign work, and the
silver-haired senator took several of his own aides with him on the
campaign foray to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> last
week.
   Officials in both the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> camps remember how
<PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON>'s running mate four years ago, hit the
campaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaign
activities.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Ferraro</PERSON> badly mishandled the controversy surrounding her
husband's finances, and the issue quickly destroyed any momentum
the Democrats had following their nominating convention in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>. The ticket went on to lose 49 of the 50 states to <PERSON>Ronald
Reagan</PERSON>.
   ``They put her out, basically without any senior help from the
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> campaign,'' said <PERSON>Francis O'Brien</PERSON>, who had been called in to
help rescue the <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> campaign, and was on the <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> plane last
week.
   Four years ago, ``there was a lack of communication between the
two campaigns,'' he said. ``People who went through that experience
learned from that experience.''
   O'Brien led a cadre of <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> people on the <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> plane,
including Tad <PERSON>Devine</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> chief delegate-counter before the
convention, who will coordinate and direct the senator's campaign
from the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> headquarters in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. Devine also worked for
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> four years ago.
   But <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> also will keep a group of his long-time advisers
with him to handle day-to-day issues.
   ``We've done a very good job of integrating the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> staff,''
said <PERSON>Joseph O'Neill</PERSON>, a former <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> aide on Capitol Hill, who
will become his top traveling campaign staffer.
   A formal announcement of the campaign staff is planned later
this week, said <PERSON>Jack DeVore</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s spokesman.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s campaigning was kept at a deliberate pace last week
with careful staging of each event.
   His speeches were cautious, citing his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> record on issues
of interest to each audience and working in some digs at the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration _ but avoiding harsh attacks.
   Care was also taken to emphasize areas where he and <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>
agree.
   While the <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> choice is certainly a lot less daring than
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> decision, <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> probably have more
disagreements on policy. Bentsen is much more conservative on some
issues, including his opposition to gun control, support for aid to
the <ORGANIZATION>Nicaraguan Contra</ORGANIZATION> rebels and school prayer.
   The political message for the trip was found mostly in the
locations, which were designed to highlight the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> campaign
theme of aggressively going after electoral votes that the
Republicans have controlled for years. The Democrats last won <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1976</DATE>, and haven't won <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> since
<DATE>1964</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, found a
friendly audience with a businesswomen's group in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>. He
played a ``come home to the Democratic Party'' theme to a union
audience in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and at his <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> stop in
<LOCATION>Amarillo</LOCATION> _ a Republican area that's home to his opponent in this
year's <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race, Rep. <PERSON>Beau Boulter</PERSON>.
   As permitted by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> law, <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> is running for the vice
presidency and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> at the same time.
   The trip hit two areas a day, instead of the three-a-day planned
for later in the campaign.
   As a state-wide campaigner in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the national campaign isn't
as big a step up for <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> as it was for <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>, a member of the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> also has the experience of his
unsuccessful <DATE>1976</DATE> campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   The senator said that from his viewpoint ``it's gone very
well,'' and he was surprised he didn't face a sea of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> signs at
his rally in <LOCATION>Amarillo</LOCATION>.
   ``I think we could have done a few more things,'' he said. ``But
we wanted some time in there in case things weren't working out.''
   The trip was cut short by a day when the campaign canceled a
planned visit to <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> because of a conflict with <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>'
schedule.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where he plans to immerse
himself in a heavy <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> schedule including action on the trade
and plant-closing notification bills.
   Dukakis aides said <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s congressional schedule was a plus
even though it will cut into his campaign time. One aide said it
provides ``meat and potatoes'' for the Democratic effort.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> says he expects to campaign in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>. But aides say it's still to be decided how the
candidate's time will be apportioned.
   ``That's going to be a part of the discussion'' as the campaign
begins to nail down staffing and strategy in the next few days,
<PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   On the road, <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> said he was encouraged by the large number
of local officials who want to appear on the dais with him and
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> when they hit town.
   Aides said that kind of reaction is a good indication of the
level of local support.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Zaccaro Drug Case Was More Than Possession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor says he refused to reduce a
felony charge against <PERSON>John Zaccaro Jr.</PERSON> because ``there was plenty
of evidence'' that the son of former vice presidential candidate
<PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> was selling cocaine.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said she and her candidacy were partly to blame for her
son's conviction <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but blasted <ORGANIZATION>Addison County State</ORGANIZATION>'s
Attorney <PERSON>John Quinn</PERSON> for failing to accept a plea bargain.
   <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said he was reluctant because of the problem of drugs in
society.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on I feel more strongly about drug cases,''
<PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``I just think it's becoming more of a problem
in the country and we need to deter that.''
   <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>, 24, was convicted of selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine to an undercover officer at his off-campus apartment on
<DATE>Feb. 20, 1986</DATE>. He was a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION> at the time.
   No sentencing date has been set. The felony conviction carries a
maximum sentence of five years in jail and a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> fine.
   At a news conference after the verdict, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said the family
would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>Vermont Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' she said.
   Ferraro blamed her son for possession of cocaine, as well as
herself ``and my candidacy for making my son a target.'' She was
the Democratic vice presidential nominee in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   But she said <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> prolonged ``the agony for two years'' by not
allowing <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> to plead to a lesser count of cocaine possession.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> said.
   ``To me it was clearly a selling case,'' said <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON>, who said
the family first approached him about a pea agreement at <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s
arraignment. ``There was plenty of evidence he was selling. I never
considered a possession case and they know that.''
   He added, ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the
charge, that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any
justification for reducing the charge.''
   Zaccaro's defense lawyer, <PERSON>Charles Tetzlaff</PERSON>, had argued that his
client was entrapped by a young, inexperienced, attractive female
undercover police officer.
   ``This is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct,''
he told jurors.
   But <PERSON>Quinn</PERSON> called <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON> a well-organized drug dealer, and said
he was known on campus as ``The Pharmacist'' because of his
reputation as a dealer.
   After <PERSON>Zaccaro</PERSON>'s arrest, <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College</ORGANIZATION> officials formed a
task force to look at the campus drug problem. After more than a
dozen meetings, it made 20 recommendations, most of which were
implemented by college trustees.
   They included the hiring of a health educator, publication of a
drug brochure, additional security staff, and improved relations
with the <LOCATION>Middlebury</LOCATION> police.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said <PERSON>Bob Woithe</PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION>Palm Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.

   Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Patricia Schroeder</PERSON>, who scrapped her possible presidential candidacy last month, isn't the only woman who has decided not to run for high federal office this time around. 

   It's still early yet, but candidate recruiters from both parties say they are having trouble getting women to run for the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
The bipartisan Women's Campaign Fund candidate school has signed up only about half a dozen potential <DATE>1988</DATE> House candidates, and neither party anticipates having a serious female contender for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> next <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
There are currently 23 female <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members and two female senators. 

   Record numbers of women are running for and winning state and local offices, and the number of women nominees for federal office rose steadily from three <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and 44 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> candidates in <DATE>1974</DATE> to 10 <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and 65 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> candidates in <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
But the number of federal candidates has reached a plateau since then, and some analysts say it could even decline next year. 

   "We're still trying to find bodies," says <PERSON>Linda DiVall</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> pollster and consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>National Republican Congressional Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
Observes Vermont Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Madeleine Kunin</PERSON>, who is seeking re-election rather than running for an open <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat next year: "There's a feeling not only among candidates, but women supporters are less willing to say, 'Run, run, run.'" 

   Many political analysts figured that Rep. <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>'s selection as the Democratic vice presidential candidate would set off a wave of women candidates. 
But the euphoria of <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>'s candidacy has faded now, and analysts say the present mood is colored by disappointment at the embarrassment the public limelight has caused her family and at <PERSON>Mrs. Schroeder</PERSON>'s tearful decision not to run for president. 

   The <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> experience especially seems to have caused some women to have second thoughts. 
"I have heard some women in politics say: 'I wouldn't like what happened to <PERSON>Gerry Ferraro</PERSON> to happen to me. 
I don't know if I'm willing to expose myself to that sort of brutal pressure,'" says <PERSON>Ruth Mandel</PERSON>, director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION>. 
The recent string of scandals in the campaigns of male Democratic presidential candidates has also contributed to a "chilling effect," Gov. <PERSON>Kunin</PERSON> says. 

   The issue of spousal financial disclosure has proven to be a particular stumbling block. 
Women candidates more frequently have spouses with business dealings, which must be disclosed publicly under federal law. 
<ORGANIZATION>California Secretary of State March Fong Eu</ORGANIZATION>, considered a formidable potential challenger to <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Sen. Pete Wilson</PERSON>, now isn't expected to run in the Democratic primary because her husband doesn't want to disclose his finances. 
"If he doesn't disclose, she can't run," says <PERSON>Joanne Howes</PERSON>, a veteran political consultant. 

   Colorado Rep. <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON>'s complaint that she was under pressure to change her style and give up too much of herself to run for president strikes a chord among other women officeholders as well. 
"I think a woman can do it," says <PERSON>Kansas Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum</PERSON>, who is often mentioned as a possible <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> vice presidential prospect. 
"That's not the question in my mind. 
It's 'How much do you want to give up?'" 

   The controversy about <PERSON>Mrs. Schroeder</PERSON>'s show of emotion when she announced she wasn't running "is another example of the extraordinary burden that any individual political woman carries with her," says <PERSON>Ms. Mandel</PERSON>. 
"She can never run without everything that she does being judged as a statement about womankind in general." 

   Most women suggest that the current reluctance to run for federal office will prove temporary. 
"There aren't very many running at the upper reaches, but there are a lot in the pipeline," emphasizes <PERSON>Anne Wexler</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lobbyist who helped run <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON>'s campaign. 
She and others are encouraged that women are choosing races they're more likely to win, are moving up steadily in state government, and now hold powerful behind-the-scenes jobs on campaigns and in congressional offices. 
"The landscape in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is totally different from what it was 10 years ago," she concludes. 

   <PERSON>Eleanor Smeal</PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION>, has launched a new group called the Fund for the <ORGANIZATION>Feminist Majority</ORGANIZATION>, which is sending speakers around the country urging women to run for all levels of government office. 

   But <PERSON>Sen. Kassebaum</PERSON> observes that there are still too few role models at the top to break the ice with the voters. 
"We haven't had a woman who's secretary of defense, secretary of state," she says. 
"We've never had a woman really in the top inner council of government." 

   There also are special factors in the <DATE>1988</DATE> cycle that are limiting the pool of women running for national office. 
There are fewer open seats available than in previous recent congressional elections. 
"This looks like a bad year to run for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and women know it," says <PERSON>Celinda Lake</PERSON> of the Women's Campaign Fund. 
In addition, the free-for-all presidential race in both parties has siphoned off women who might be congressional candidates in other years but who instead are working for presidential hopefuls. 

   But analysts also are concerned about other long-term reasons why women may not be running for federal office. 
A Women's Campaign Fund survey found that women officeholders are less likely to attempt a major political leap upward -- say from school board to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- than are their male counterparts. 

   "I sometimes conclude, and it is a reluctant conclusion, that women continue to harbor some inner barriers," Gov. <PERSON>Kunin</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>National Women</ORGANIZATION>'s Political Caucus convention this <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
"At some gut level, the art of politics -- combative, competitive, self-asserting -- is sometimes difficult to integrate with our feminine selves." 

   Even when they don't have such internal doubts, women candidates for federal office still have an uphill struggle with the electorate. 
While The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has shown a steady increase since <DATE>1984</DATE> in the number of Americans who think the country is ready for a woman president, <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> still don't think the country is prepared for such a change. 
A new survey for the <ORGANIZATION>National Women</ORGANIZATION>'s Political Caucus by <PERSON>Ms. DiVall</PERSON> and another pollster, <PERSON>Harrison Hickman</PERSON>, found that while <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of Americans think a woman would do better than a man in serving on a school board, <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> think she would do a worse job in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> think she would do a worse job in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT> think she would do worse as president. 

   Despite all the gains of recent years in the number of women candidates and officeholders, a woman running for federal office still "has to be better, stronger and sharper than a male counterpart with all the same credentials if she is going to win," concludes <PERSON>Ms. DiVall</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Running Against Women Gives Some Men the Blues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before his first debate with <PERSON>Susan Molinari</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON>Bob Gigante</PERSON> received an unusual warning from his
consultants: ``Whatever you do, don't make her cry.''
   Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>.
   ``Remember <DATE>1984</DATE>? I can't forget it,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said recently of his
vice presidential race against Democrat <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>.
   The subject arose after <PERSON>Clayton Williams</PERSON>, the Republican nominee
for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> governor, said he'd rather run against state Attorney
General <PERSON>Jim Mattox</PERSON> than state Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>. The two
Democrats are in a runoff <DATE>April 10</DATE>.
   ``I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman,''
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said.
   ``I know exactly what he means and I refuse to elaborate on
it,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> sympathized.
   And no wonder. The political landscape is strewn with faux pas
by men _ mostly older ones _ more accustomed to thinking of women
in the kitchen than on the campaign trail.
   ``The men are nervous,'' says Democratic pollster <PERSON>Celinda Lake</PERSON>.
``Women running is just plain different and men sense it.''
   ``They are very confused,'' adds Republican pollster <PERSON>Ann Stone</PERSON>.
``The rules have changed very quickly over the <DATE>last 10</DATE> to 15 years.
You've got to kind of feel sorry for them. ... Maybe their heart's
now in the right place but their mouth's not there yet.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> got himself in trouble six years ago when he boasted that
he had ``kicked a little ass'' in a debate against <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>. The
same race featured <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> agriculture commissioner <PERSON>Jim Buck
Ross</PERSON> asking <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON> if she could bake blueberry muffins. ``Yes. Can
you?'' she replied.
   A few years later, men told women in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>
that they shouldn't be running for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> because they had young
children. One of the candidates, <PERSON>Sen. Gordon Humphrey</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.H.</LOCATION>,
later apologized and called his statement ``just plain stupid.''
   ``There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to
be a little bit more chivalric, if that's the right word,'' said
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>John Van de Kamp</PERSON>, who is vying with
former <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
   Van de Kamp offered only one specific: he wouldn't punch his
opponent in the nose. But he still is taking a few swings at
<PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON>, including an attack ad that ends, ``<PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> _
if she couldn't manage a city, how could she manage <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>?''
   In contrast, <PERSON>Martha Layne Collins</PERSON> was elected governor of
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> ``in part because her opponents never could figure
out how to run against her. They never did point out anything wrong
with her,'' said Democratic pollster <PERSON>Harrison Hickman</PERSON>.
   ``Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like
a candidate and talks like a candidate, you treat it like a
candidate,'' added <PERSON>Hickman</PERSON>, whose clients include Van de Kamp and
<PERSON>Sen. Paul Simon</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Democrat trying to fend off a
challenge by <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON>.
   Women like <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, who have hired two of the
hardest-hitting media consultants in the business, are making it
easier for men to attack by proving that they can be as aggressive
as the next guy.
   They also are coming up with some deft responses to
gender-related missteps.
   <PERSON>Ferraro</PERSON>'s good-natured comeback to <PERSON>Ross</PERSON>'s blueberry muffin
question was considered ideal. Richards came up with a good
one-liner after <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> _ a self-styled symbol of the
free-wheeling, boot-wearing Texan _ confessed he wouldn't relish
running against her. ``Even cowboys get the blues,'' she said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, 58, has been even bluer since he compared the bad
weather at his ranch last month to a rape. ``If it's inevitable,
just relax and enjoy it,'' he said. The incident created a furor
and <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> eventually apologized ``from the bottom of my heart.''
   Stone attributes <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>' remarks, both on rape and running
against women, to his generation and upbringing in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. ``His
lexicon hasn't caught up with the times yet,'' she said.
   But while men of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>' age may not be used to competing with
women, many younger candidates like <PERSON>Gigante</PERSON>, 41, consider it
routine. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Democrat, who has four children and a working
wife, was surprised by his coaches' advice to be tough on <PERSON>Molinari</PERSON>
without making her cry.
   ``Why would she cry?'' Gigante asked. ``She's a mature woman.
She's held office. She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on
an issue just like I wasn't going to cry if she attacked me.''
   For the record, <PERSON>Molinari</PERSON> did not cry. She won the election and
was sworn in last week as a Republican congresswoman from <LOCATION>Staten
Island</LOCATION>.
