   The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that
a magnetic field surrounds <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet is
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s
northern lights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to
determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, believed to be 17 to
18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
internal structure, said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Just as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field traps the Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> radiation
belts, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field also may help create radiation belts
around that planet. Scientists don't yet know if that poses a hazard
to Voyager 2's electronic components, <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said.
   Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 5.92 million miles
from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at
42,236 mph.
   The spacecraft was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 2 will make its closest
approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:59 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when it flies about
3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest
planet.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to the two discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, two partial rings, or ring arcs,
of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to
jet streams and giant cyclones on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Discovery of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field was confirmed <DATE>Friday</DATE> by
intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's
vicinity. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically
charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
field lines.
   ``Mercury, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic
fields, while <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Mars do not,'' the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. ``Whether <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> has one
or not is unknown.
   ``A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines
that surround a planet,'' the agency said. ``Such fields are thought
to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. (<ORGANIZATION>Molten</ORGANIZATION> iron in
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s core, for example).''
   Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along
magnetic field lines toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s poles, creating the northern and
southern lights. A magnetic field at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> means that planet also
may have auroras, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s internal structure. Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>
has said he believes that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock
closer to the planet's center. That would mean that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like
neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings
to turn them dark in color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause
similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The nature of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s radio signal allowed scientists to
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said <PERSON>James Warwick</PERSON>, head
of Voyager's radio science team.
   ``The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur
in a limited range of frequency,'' <PERSON>Warwick</PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Colo.-based Radiophysics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said in the release.
   Once <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> confirmed the existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in
data collected by Voyager as early as <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``Early analysis indicates <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field is of an
intensity similar to the fields of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and Uranus,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said scientists don't yet know how <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic
field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet
spins.
   Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the
planet's north rotational axis.

   Discovery of a magnetic field around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies
past the planet.
   ``Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said <PERSON>Norm
Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Similar radiation belts at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> disrupted <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s internal
clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the
wrong time.
   Today, Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 5.01 million
miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251
mph.
   The ship will make its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of
the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was
launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike
radio signals coming from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ strong evidence the planet has a
magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed
electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere
along magnetic field lines.
   Mercury, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic fields.
Venus and Mars do not. Whether <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> has one is unknown, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a
planet's core. Molten iron in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s core, for example, creates a
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a
nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft
electronics.
   So far at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, ``there's nothing to indicate it (the
radiation) is anything worse than we expected,'' said <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON>. ``But
time will tell.''
   Existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field suggests the planet has an
aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern and southern lights, created when
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a
planet's poles.
   Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists
determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ now believed to be
between 17 and 18 Earth hours _ and gain better understanding of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s internal structure, said <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>.
   Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> has said he believes
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center.
   That would mean that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, like neighboring Uranus, probably
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in
color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause similar radiation
darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> also released new photographs taken by Voyager.
Blurry black-and-white images show markings on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
largest moon, but ``it is still too early to tell if the features
are clouds or features on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   A color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> shows complex, frequently changing
weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy
clouds, a small cloud dubbed ``the scooter'' because it rotates
quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks.
   In recent weeks, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> also has discovered four Neptunian moons
besides two observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of
debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet
streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   After the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft goes into
orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> as much as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ATMOSPHERE: About <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the
brightest object in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus' surface is about <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT>
rolling plains, <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> flat lowlands and <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> highlands
that may be similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s continents.
   GRAVITY: About <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> as strong as on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in <DATE>1977</DATE> to probe <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> next <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>'s surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> probes found
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Photographs taken of <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 in <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1975</DATE>
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 found that <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in <DATE>1976</DATE> and <DATE>1977</DATE>
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce <DATE>summer</DATE> storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <ORGANIZATION>Nep</ORGANIZATION>
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that may be
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>. They visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1981</DATE>, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   At a cost <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> pegged at <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

<TEXT>
   Geologists may get a glimpse of what
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s surface was like a few billion years ago when the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft's radar pierces the clouds of Venus to reveal secrets of
an alien terrain.
   ``Venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in
detail, and probably is the most important from the point of view
of understanding the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science team and a geology professor at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> after a 15-month, 948-million-mile voyage from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitored the
spacecraft's health <DATE>Saturday</DATE> so it will be ready by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> to use
its radar to peer through thick Venusian clouds and make the most
detailed pictures and maps yet of the planet's landscape.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> entered orbit so smoothly that it used very little
thruster fuel to point it properly while the rocket fired. So
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> weighs more and moves faster than expected, making the low
point in its orbit 183 miles above Venus instead of 171 miles as
planned, said navigation chief <PERSON>John McNamee</PERSON>.
   The orbit is so good that an adjustment maneuver planned for
<DATE>Aug. 28</DATE> will not be needed, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON>
said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is designed to study the geology and geography of
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a ``greenhouse effect''
gone berserk.
   Venus' high temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure might
make rock in the planet's crust much thinner and more flexible than
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s, <PERSON>Head</PERSON> said.
   So Venus may resemble Earth before our home planet's crust
cooled off and broke into colossal plates. Those plates now drift
across the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, moving whole continents and colliding
to uplift mountain ranges and trigger volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes.
   Most of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s original surface was destroyed long ago by
erosion and plate movements, so ``we have grave difficulty
answering fundamental questions about the early history of the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' Head said.
   While <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is hot, dry and lifeless, ``it is very similar in
size and density and also is the closest planet to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' he
said. ``That means it probably had the most similar conditions when
the planets formed (4.6 billion years ago). So if we want to study
another planet to learn something about the early <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is a
good candidate.''
   Learning how <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust moves and is deformed ``will tell us a
lot more about the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may settle debate over competing theories that seek to
explain the creation of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' continent-like highlands, which
include Africa-sized <ORGANIZATION>Aphrodite Terra</ORGANIZATION>, Australia-sized Ishtar Terra
and Hawaii-like Beta Regio.
   Saunders believes ``hot spots'' of rising molten rock created
the highlands, just as hot spots created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``If you could look at a time-lapse movie over billions of
years, it might look like a big pot of thick porridge simmering,'
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said, adding <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust may feature ``a bunch of big
Hawaiis all over the place.''
   Some other scientists think <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' highlands are big pieces of
crust that solidified first as the planet's initial molten surface
cooled off.
   But Head believes plate movements formed the highlands.
Aphrodite Terra resembles <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s midocean ridges, the undersea
mountain ranges where molten rock emerges to add new material to
the drifting plates of crust.
   Ishtar Terra ``has many of the features that you would expect
where blocks of crust are colliding,'' including volcanoes such as
those along the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coasts of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and
folded mountain belts such as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Himalayas, which were created
because <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is smashing into <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
   Even if the Venusian crust hasn't yet broken into plates, ``we
probably will find faults like the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,'' a
pretty sure sign that ``Venusquakes'' shake the second planet from
the sun, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.

   Voyager 2 cruised away from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
toward the stars <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, completing an <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON>, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.2 million
miles beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and now past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   For <MONEY>$865 million _ 20 cents</MONEY> per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
<PERSON>Voyager</PERSON> has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than <DATE>a half billion years ago</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>
geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> showing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Planetary Society</ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON>Bruce Murray</PERSON>, former director of
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   He said <PERSON>Sherwood Rowland</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mario Molina</PERSON> first warned of
depletion of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   From <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said <PERSON>Voyager</PERSON> also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until <DATE>2020</DATE>.

   Voyager 2's close-up photos of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt
explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles
high, scientists said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``I believe they are active,'' or erupted at least within the
past 100 years, said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Larry
Soderblom</PERSON>, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``There's 10 or 20 or 30 _ lots.''
   ``This is a crazy idea ... but it's the best we have at the
current time'' to explain the pockmarked terrain, he added.
   While more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active,
``the whole process makes physical sense,'' said <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>,
leader of the Voyager 2 imaging team. ``That is a perfectly sensible
explanation.''
   If <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> are right, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is only the third object
in the solar system known to have active volcanism. Earth and
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io are the others.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes with
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io. But he said the volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>
are produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools rises
to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got to explode
and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> estimated the
eruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps faster,
sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist. The
deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened ices that fell to the
surface after being carried skyward by the blast, he added.
   Voyager 2 made its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloud
tops. Early <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, the spacecraft zoomed about 24,000 miles
past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, taking the photos that have revealed at least three
kinds of icy volcanism on the moon.
   Voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from the
floors of long valleys, a process likened to toothpaste coming out
of a tube slit with a razor blade.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists announced that Voyager had discovered a
different type of ice volcanoes, which appeared inactive and
possibly extinct. They are huge flat craters, called calderas,
similar to the one in which <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone National Park</ORGANIZATION> rests.
   Some calderas, such as the crater atop <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION> volcano,
fill with lava lakes. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s calderas, measuring up to hundreds of
miles wide, fill with flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that
gushes up from below, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   New evidence released <DATE>Sunday</DATE> shows <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s ice-lava lakes ``can
come up and overflow. You see that happen in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> all the time''
when molten rock lava overflows crater walls, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   So eruptions from <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s calderas once produced ``a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions,'' resulting in ``massive,
oceanic-scale flooding,'' <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said during a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> news
conference. He said at least four such calderas have been spotted on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the past
century because they are located on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s huge south polar ice
cap.
   A year on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a <DATE>summer</DATE>, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.
   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has discovered six moons orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It
also has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including
two that are broad bands of dust.
   The latest ring photo released by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> shows one of those
bands is even broader than thought, forming a beautiful, circular
sheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings
and extends inward toward the planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s latest results from <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>'s close encounters with
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> found that:
   _Winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
atmosphere.
   _A day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or take
four minutes.
   _<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, are
much hotter than the planet's middle latitudes.
   _The planet's magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degrees
away from from the poles around which the planet rotates, a much
greater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially
estimated. That means <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic north pole is closer to its
equator than to its rotational north pole.
   It also means <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is much more similar to Uranus, which has a
magnetic field tilt of 58 degrees. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted
12 degrees from its true, or rotational poles.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will be 2.76 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.19 million miles behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the
planet at 37,621 mph.
   The probe on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was looking for lightning and auroras on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. It also sent back its best picture of heart-shaped moon
1989N1, which has usurped Nereid as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon.

   Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny
``moonlets'' hidden in one of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s two brightest rings, and
also found three more rings orbiting the planet, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's
fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a
tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern
and southern lights.
   The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink
snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed
viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is
present as well, they said.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will
be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager traveled a curving
4.43-billion-mile path to achieve <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s close encounter
with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>'s flight past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We have five rings at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,'' including the two bright ones
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said <PERSON>Bradford
Smith</PERSON>, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't
well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as
five. He reversed himself later <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, deciding the rings are
distinct enough to count the total as five.
   A bright ring discovered <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE> initially appeared to be a
partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring.
Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12
miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   ``You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring
has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others.
   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has discovered six objects orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that
are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight
moons, including <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The ring containing the moonlets remains <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s outermost
ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring,
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse
band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest
to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band
of dust <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said was 1,550 miles wide.
   The initial confusion over the number of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings is
reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Ten thin rings were
apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed
that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible
when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing
how many distinct rings orbit Uranus.
   Researchers said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that Voyager also found:
   _<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away
from the poles around which the planet rotates. Earth's magnetic
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one
magnetic pole in northern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> about 1,000 miles from the true, or
rotational, north pole.
   _The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than
the <ORGANIZATION>Van Allen</ORGANIZATION> belts encircling <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The radiation belt's location
near the orbit of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> may explain the pinkish hue of some of the
moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas
that color.
   Deputy Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said there is
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south
latitude, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has an aurora similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and
southern lights. Other scientists <DATE>Saturday</DATE> refused to discuss the
evidence, saying it was too preliminary.
   If the aurora proves real, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s tilted magnetic field would
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's
equator rather than the rotational poles.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth,
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational
poles are relatively close.
   Voyager continued <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to send back recorded photographs
taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed
photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global
temperature map of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, search for auroras and more rings, and
study the weight of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager 2 will look
back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space,
looking for the edge of the solar system.

   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' has
eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds
or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing
atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support
anything resembling human life.
   Venus is not exactly <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>.
   For eight months beginning in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, the space probe
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will circle the second planet from the Sun, using
computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable
that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.
   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that
will completely astound and baffle us,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis, to be launched from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit on its 15-month
trajectory to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   Pictures from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> should help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else,'' said geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>, a scientist
working on the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project.
   Peering through acid-laden clouds, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> should give
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different
from the garden of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> yet apparently shaped by the same geologic
processes.
   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is most like our
own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,
meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary
movement of huge land masses. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will also look for evidence
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.
   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might
produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,
where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing <ORGANIZATION>Everest</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, once it begins orbiting Venus on <DATE>Aug. 10, 1990</DATE>, will
look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the
planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked
``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the
temperature until water disappeared.
   It's a <MONEY>$550-million</MONEY> project with the scientific world watching.
   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar
system,'' said <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Flagstaff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plotting
the path of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as it swoops to within 155 miles of the
planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977
miles.
   In looking for similarities between <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, scientists
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and
distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s moon,
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Mars.
   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot
for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said
<PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>, himself a geologist.
   The moon, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Mars have cold surfaces free of
continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives the
geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs
from that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Rock in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt
manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea
mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away
from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually
collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subduction
zone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.
   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.
   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and
subduction zones. Saunders and <PERSON>Gerald Schaber</PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION>
geologist, believe <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> loses its internal heat mostly through
``hot spot'' volcanoes.
   On <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through
thin parts of the crust, such as in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. But there's evidence
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has crustal movement similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and that the
volcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s midocean
ridges.
   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on
Venus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are
squeezed up against <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and
Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than <ORGANIZATION>Everest</ORGANIZATION>.
   These regions look something like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Himalayas</LOCATION>, mountains
formed when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> smashed into <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. So crustal movements on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
may be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, <PERSON>Schaber</PERSON> said.
   If large plates of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crustal rock are in motion, ``you can
bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.

   Venus may be ``a terrible place to
live,'' but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures,
incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to
learn about the solar system's evolution.
   A robot craft called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first American space probe in
11 years, is on its way to survey <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for clues to the forces
that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun.
   The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> craft will use a powerful radar imaging system
to map <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, where scientists believe the geologic
history of the planet is imprinted. By studying that history,
scientists hope to learn what's contained in the ``the missing
chapters'' of solar system evolution.
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is known as the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sister planet because it is about the same size as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
and close to the same distance from the sun, in astronomical terms.
Venus, the second planet from the sun, is 67 million miles away,
while <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the third planet, is 93 million miles out.
   Despite the similarities, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> ``has evolved into ... a
substantially different object,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said.
   ``It has an atmosphere that is 90 times that of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It
has a runaway greenhouse effect. It has a surface temperature of
900 degrees. And it rains sulfuric acid,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``It would be
a terrible place to live.''
   The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, along with <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Mars, are known as
the ``inner planets'' because of their grouping nearer to the sun
than the ``outer'' planets, such as <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   The family of inner planets are all thought to have accreted, or
formed, 4.5 billion years ago. In the beginning, it's believed,
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were near-twins in size and character.
   But while the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> went on to become a lovely, gentle world
thriving with life, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> became a hellhole _ so hot that lead
melts on its surface.
   ``You've got to ask yourself why?'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``You've got to
ask yourself if our own environment is that fragile? With only
small changes, could Earth evolve into a different place?''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may help answer some of those questions.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to slip into <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' orbit in <DATE>August
1990</DATE>, and spend the following 243 days mapping the planet's surface
with the most sophisticated radar ever sent to deep space.
   Radar signals are able to penetrate the dense cloud cover that
conceals Venus from telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Radar views from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
will be enhanced by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> computers to give clear pictures of
powerful geologic forces at work on Venus.
   All the data could help experts ponder a fundamental question:
Is the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, like <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, fated to one day become a barren,
lifeless world backing in superheat and bathed by acids?
   Scientists expect to find thousands of volcanoes rising from the
baked Venusian plains. Venus also has vast mountain ranges with
peaks towering higher than the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   Most scientists believe the runaway greenhouse effect on <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>,
caused by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, long ago caused
all water on the planet to boil away.
   The experts also will look for indications of continental drift,
the force that causes rock plates to inch about the globe over
millions of years.
   If there is evidence of volcanism and crustal drift on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, it
will prove that the planet retains enough internal heat to melt
rock. The internal heat machine is what creates the lava for
volcanoes and drives the movement of continents.
   Meteors crashing into the shallow surface crust of the planet
are expected to have left craters in every sector of Venus. <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>
said these scars will be of particular interest to experts. The age
of a solid planet or moon, he said, can be calculated by the number
and distribution of craters.
   ``Knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just one of the natural
consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system'' will help
answer such questions, said <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Flagstaff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   He said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> also may help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else'' in the universe.

   A bedeviled, beleaguered <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is hoping
the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> next month will
provide our best look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> unmanned device,
centerpiece of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a 15-month journey from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. And <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Saunders</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said <PERSON>Phil Allin</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project official at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot <PERSON>Mount Maxwell</PERSON>, which is a mile
taller than <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science
team and a geologist at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At <TIME>9:31 a.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>
to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   If scientists are lucky, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   Venus is the planet most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Pioneer Venus orbiter in <DATE>1978</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>'s Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will radio the
information back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION>
stations in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   Computers at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said <PERSON>Bill Dimmer</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
comptroller's office in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> of that total, he said.

   Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands
of dust orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and found evidence the planet has
``southern lights,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited
scientists as unique in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON>Rich
Terrile</PERSON>, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands
orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered
by Voyager earlier.
   Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken
during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers
celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby.
   ``My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had
one hell of a party <TIME>last night</TIME>,'' <PERSON>Mike Urban</PERSON>, a Voyager engineer,
said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then dove past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at <TIME>2:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   During its approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons
besides <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were first observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be
a complete ring.
   While only the narrow rings were visible as Voyager flew toward
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
That makes them look like <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s broad rings, but only when viewed
from behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The same thing happened when Voyager passed Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. That
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft,
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus.
<PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dust bands are not as extensive.
   Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at
30 degrees south latitude on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s ultraviolet light
sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project
scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Because the scan didn't cover different longitudes, scientists
don't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
east to west, as do <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s auroras, <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said.
   Miner said <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> also found nitrogen in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere.
Nitrogen makes up <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles,
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates
magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On
Earth they glow in visible light. Neptune's lights glow ultraviolet
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere.
   Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape
recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during
the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, <ORGANIZATION>Urban</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which is four-fifth's the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon. But pictures
returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> were more than enough to stun scientists.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
<PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The photographs show a cracked, frozen <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> scarred by
thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters,
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far
defy explanation.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON> said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> and some
other moons, but <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the first place scientists have actually
seen ice volcanoes, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. Photographs showed at least three
inactive volcanoes.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000
to 2,000 feet high.
   The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen
``are very different from ordinary ice,'' said <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON>, a member of
the Voyager imaging team. ``That may explain the exoticness of the
landforms.''
   Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment
of radiation that produced chemical changes, <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said. ``We've got
pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.''
   Preliminary measurements of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic field suggest that
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic
field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said.
   <PERSON>Robert Strom</PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said the relative
scarcity of craters on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> tends to confirm speculation that
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> originated outside the solar system and became captured by
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons.
   Voyager also revealed that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere and is
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog.
   On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other
volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and
condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager 2 will look
back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space.
   Weary <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists, many of whom spent all night at the
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over
the spectacular images being received.
   <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said: ``Wow! What
a way to leave the solar system.''

VOYAGER DISCOVERS MAGNETIC FIELD ON NEPTUNE

<P>
For the first time, the spacecraft Voyager has detected intense radio signals 
coming from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, revealing that the planet has a magnetic field and 
indicating that next week's close encounter will be as intriguing as scientists 
had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery suggests that the spacecraft will find a wide range of 
interesting phenomena as it passes close to the distant planet <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, 
including the kind of auroral activity that produces the northern and southern 
lights on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The signals were first detected last <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but scientists at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory were not sure they were coming from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, according to 
<PERSON>James Warwick</PERSON>, principal investigator on the planetary radio astronomy 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not What Was Expected 
</P>
<P>
"Their character was different than what we were expecting," <PERSON>Warwick</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The radio emissions are very intense," <PERSON>Warwick</PERSON> said, adding that they came in 
short, powerful bursts over a limited frequency range. Scientists had expected 
radio signals from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, but they were looking for something less intense 
and less limited in frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
Warwick and fellow scientists working on the project decided to announce the 
discovery <DATE>Friday</DATE> after they grew more confident of what they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery means <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a strong magnetic field because radio waves are 
generated by charged particles that become trapped in the magnetic field and 
spiral into the planet's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same process that produces the northern lights on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Charged 
particles from space flow along the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field lines and into the 
atmosphere at either the North or <LOCATION>South Pole</LOCATION>, producing the celestial fireworks 
over the higher latitudes. Now, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> is expected to see the same thing at 
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Within 3,000 Miles 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager spacecraft, which will make its fourth and final planetary flyby 
next week when it passes within about 3,000 miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloud tops, used 
a radio receiver and a giant pair of "rabbit ears" to detect the radio 
emissions -- just as it did at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. Each 33-foot-long 
ear scans a series of frequencies and, since they work separately, the 
"polarization," or vibration, of the signals can be determined, thus 
distinguishing between radio signals generated by lightning and those created 
by a magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are dealing with a magnetic field," <PERSON>Warwick</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a magnetic field also tells scientists something about the 
interior of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field is generated by the movement of 
its molten iron core, and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s strong magnetic field suggests that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> 
also has a region of fluid in its interior. 
</P>
<P>
Venus, Mars and probably <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> do not have magnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
Early analysis of the data from Voyager indicates that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field 
is similar in intensity to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more data is collected on the magnetic field, scientists will be 
able to determine more precisely the length of a Neptunian day -- the time it 
takes for one rotation. That is believed to be about 18 hours, but by the time 
Voyager is through that figure should be known exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists have known little about <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> other than such things as 
its atmospheric composition, which includes the methane that makes it appear 
blue. But Voyager will pass right over the planet's north pole, and that is 
fortuitous for scientists who are interested in its magnetic field. That 
trajectory will carry it through the intense field where charged particles are 
being funneled into the polar atmosphere, and that should reveal much about the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, by the time Voyager zips past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> it will have collected enough 
data for scientists to learn more about its magnetic field than any other 
planet except <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spaceship swooped past Venus
early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at <TIME>12:59 a.m. EST</TIME>, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared
light sensor to start observing <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, they
arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE>.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus is about <PERCENT>95
percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> a boost for
its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a slingshot next <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again
on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was programmed to photograph <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
atmosphere. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> arranged for the <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Venus
Orbiter</ORGANIZATION>, circling <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since <DATE>1978</DATE>, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While nearly 20 other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet spacecraft have visited
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> send back a small
amount of data, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> added.
   Studies from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and previous spacecraft indicate <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION> and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> originally
planned to send <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> on a two-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by launching
it with a <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched with a much weaker <ORGANIZATION>Inertial Upper Stage</ORGANIZATION>
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to redesign <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route so the craft could
utilize gravity from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> from having a
shuttle carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the
risk was minimal.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s major moons.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON>, referring to
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s previous exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the <DATE>next week</DATE>,'' Stone
said during a <TIME>late morning</TIME> news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s flight past its largest moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly closest to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> about <TIME>8:55 p.m. PDT</TIME>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at <TIME>8:15 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> indicating the thrusters
started firing at <TIME>4:09 a.m</TIME>. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and another moon,
<LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, cable television stations will
carry live <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which had been discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager also discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> listed <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position as of <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> as 2.743
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus
in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the
<MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager <PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
will conduct daily news conferences through <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   They also say <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field may create auroras like
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   Voyager 2 found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> to
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward
and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean-size floods of
frozen lava, scientists believe.
   If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's
photographs, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is only the third object in the universe where
active volcanoes have been identified.
   ``It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the
solar system,'' says <PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON>, Voyager spacecraft mission
design manager at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras _ somewhat like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and southern
lights _ in several places in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s skies and over much of the
day side of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Roger Yelle</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>, said
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   The auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light, and they occur at odd
places because of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s tilted magnetic field, <PERSON>Yelle</PERSON> said. When
the particles are pulled toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s poles along magnetic field
lines, they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble
auroras.
   Voyager today snapped and sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> beautiful
photographs showing the sunlit, crescent edges of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>
as they were backlighted by the sun. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> expects to release prints
of the photo no earlier than <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> apparently has three types of volcanic activity.
   Scientists announced two of them <DATE>Friday</DATE>: huge inactive
crater-shaped volcanoes, called calderas, filled with lava made of
ice instead of molten rock; and long fault-line valleys filled with
oozing ice, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube
slit with a razor blade.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest surprise came <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> announced that a third kind of
volcanic activity apparently had been identified. The latest
recorded photographs sent by Voyager reveal what look like active
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles
and gas 12 to 20 miles high.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>,
leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be
a ``crazy idea,'' but other scientists expressed their support.
   ``It sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis,'' said Voyager
project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in addition to
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It also has
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that
are broad bands of dust.
   By <TIME>9 p.m. PDT tonight</TIME>, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.65 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward
interstellar space at 37,600 mph.
   As the craft sped toward the ill-defined boundary of the solar
system, about 1,500 mission scientists, engineers and their families
celebrated at a bash that featured rock 'n' roll legend <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON>
singing ``Go, Voyager, go!'' a slightly modified version of his
classic ``<PERSON>Johnny B. Goode</PERSON>.''
   A recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the
cultural and historical items aboard aboard Voyager.
   The spacecraft made its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole
cloudtops. Early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, it zoomed about 24,000 miles past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s volcanic activity.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io. But he said the
volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground
pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   ``I believe they are active,'' <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said. ``There's 10 or 20
or 30 _ lots.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> estimated the
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps
faster.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said the deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the
blast.
   Earth's volcanoes spew molten rock, and Io's erupts sulfur. Venus
also may have active volcanoes, but none has been spotted on the
cloud-shrouded planet.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also revealed more surprises about <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
apparently inactive caldera-like volcanoes, which measure up to
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> described as flows
of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.
   The new photos show <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s ice-lava lakes ``can come up and
overflow,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. ``You see that happen in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> all the
time'' when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop <LOCATION>Kilauea</LOCATION>
volcano.
   So eruptions from <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s calderas once produced a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive,
oceanic-scale flooding, <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said.
   A volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100
years. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located
on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s huge south polar ice cap.
   A year on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a <DATE>summer</DATE>, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

<TEXT>
   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE> for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at <LOCATION>JPL</LOCATION>,'' joked <PERSON>Franklin
O'Donnell</PERSON>, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   As of <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
<PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will conduct
daily news conferences starting <DATE>Monday</DATE> and continuing through <DATE>Aug.
29</DATE>.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   _A magnetic field surrounding <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Miner</ORGANIZATION> said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will start a 49-minute trip through
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s shadow. Instead of photographing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

<TEXT>
   Neptune's icy volcanic moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the
coldest body ever measured in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
and the planet itself has something in common with <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>: smog.
   The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern lights on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, scientists said.
   Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on <DATE>Monday</DATE> snapped a
series of family portraits of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, appearing as
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.
   Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
making the moon ``the coldest body we have seen in the solar
system,'' said <PERSON>Roger Yelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   In another finding, the best close-up photo yet of another moon,
<DATE>1989</DATE> N1, showed that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon has a huge crater
about half as wide as the lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide satellite.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into <DATE>1989</DATE> N1,
one of six moons discovered since <DATE>June</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>, according to
<PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, the leader of <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s photographic imaging team.
   Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find
liquid lakes or oceans on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, but the moon almost certainly is
too cold to have them, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, a scientist at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.
   Johnson defended the theory, advanced by other scientists <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles
20 miles skyward. ``It isn't a crazy idea,'' he said.
   Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> occurred <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
and it passed <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, capping its epic tour of the four
outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   The probe has also found five rings, including three thin ones
and two broad bands of dust.
   1989 N1 took <ORGANIZATION>Nereid</ORGANIZATION>'s place as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon
after <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. N1 and the other five moons discovered by Voyager in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
have not yet been permanently named.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras somewhat like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights
over wide sections of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s skies and over much of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s day
side, said Yelle.
   But unlike <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s auroras, which glow in visible light as
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases, the
auroras on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> are invisible to the human eye. That's
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles
excite hydrogen gas.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
atmosphere ``converts it into photochemical smog'' that forms a
90-mile-thick icy layer at the bottom of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s stratosphere,
said <PERSON>Jim Pollock</PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> have ``definite
similarities,'' although <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> smog has components absent on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Finding smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> ``is no surprise,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
``Photochemical smog exists any place (planet or moon) we've been
that has an atmosphere. In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the problem is it's
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts
exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy
moon.
   Auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles
from the solar wind spiral toward a planet's magnetic poles along
magnetic field lines. On Earth, the magnetic poles are tilted only
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates, so
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions.
   Neptune's major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from
its rotational poles, and scientists have said the planet may have
multiple magnetic poles. That could explain why <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s auroras
appear over wide areas of the planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s aurora is created differently. Electrically charged
particles in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s orbiting radiation belt, discovered recently
by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>, excite gases in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere to create its
auroras, said <PERSON>Andy Chen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION>.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.759 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.097 million miles beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, slowly decelerating as
it speeds toward the stars at 37,582 mph.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON>, manager of the flight
engineering office.

   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
spacecraft launched since <DATE>1978</DATE>, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said <PERSON>George Alexander</PERSON>, chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> dived over <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at <TIME>9:32 a.m.</TIME>, slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to be captured by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
<PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, out of radio contact with engineers on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Magellan
emerged at <TIME>9:53 a.m.</TIME>, but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radio
signal takes to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said <PERSON>David Okerson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project
engineer.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary <PERSON>Sharon Kyle</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> encountered Venus 144 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the heart of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release the first pictures in <DATE>September</DATE>, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has raised <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the <MONEY>$1.5
billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
<PERSON>Wesley T. Huntress Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> director of solar system exploration,
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in <DATE>May
1989</DATE>, was the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary spacecraft launched since <DATE>1978</DATE>,
when <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' <PERSON>Huntress</PERSON> said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
between <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>last year</DATE>, but they were launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, launched in <DATE>October</DATE>, is headed toward a <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous
with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   During the coming decade or so, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would return more data than all previous
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> missions combined.
   Venus is similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was named for the Portuguese explorer <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand
Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and its radar
was built by <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   Here are some facts, figures and
theories about <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the planet visited early today by the
Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> as much as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ATMOSPHERE: About <PERCENT>96 percent</PERCENT> carbon dioxide and most of the rest
nitrogen, but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor.
The atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   DAY LENGTH: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, so one day on
Venus equals 243 Earth days. Its rotation is retrograde, so the sun
rises in the west and sets in the east.
   YEAR LENGTH: Venus orbits the sun once every 225 Earth days.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the
brightest object in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   GRAVITY: About <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> as strong as on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space <DATE>Friday</DATE> to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and the

   Liftoff is scheduled for <TIME>2:24 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and six hours later,
<PERSON>Atlantis</PERSON>' five astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the <DATE>1978</DATE> Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> this year. The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is
to set forth in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in <DATE>1986</DATE>. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s Venera 1, which scouted Venus in <DATE>1961</DATE>. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has successfully sent five probes to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
six to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, four to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, three to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, and one each to
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. And in <DATE>August</DATE>, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has sent 19 successful spacecraft to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 <DATE>last September</DATE> while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> may represent what
might happen to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> probe to cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the best
look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> sky
at <TIME>2:47 p.m. EDT</TIME>, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator
<PERSON>Dale Meyers</PERSON>.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> craft, which had to be launched
by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> emergency landing site.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s first attempt to launch Atlantis last <DATE>Friday</DATE> was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander <PERSON>David M.
Walker</PERSON>, pilot <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON>.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
must follow to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until <DATE>May 28</DATE>. At that point, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> would have moved out
of alignment and the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission would not be possible for two
years.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> marks the beginning of a new era in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> because it is so close in size
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in <DATE>1978</DATE>, was the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space launch and <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, will fly past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. It
earlier visted <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. In <DATE>October</DATE>, the robot
craft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in <DATE>1990</DATE>,
and to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   From 3.8 billion miles, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in <DATE>February</DATE> and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded <DATE>Feb. 13-14</DATE> but were not played back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until
late <DATE>March</DATE> because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> was too close to the sun
to be photographed and <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was within a band of sunlight but
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
<DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September 1977</DATE> from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years <DATE>2000</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

   Voyager 2 photographed an active geyser
or volcano blowing gaseous and frozen nitrogen 5 miles high on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, proving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s biggest moon is the solar system's third
object with active eruptions, scientists said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``We caught one in the act!'' said <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>, deputy Voyager
project scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> news release called the eruptions ``geyser-like
phenomenon.'' But with 5-mile-high plumes, they can be considered
either volcanoes or giant geysers, said <PERSON>Brad Smith</PERSON>, leader of
Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Earth and Io, a moon of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, are the only other bodies in
the solar system known to have active volcanoes. Io's volcanoes
spew molten sulfur.
   Images radioed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when Voyager flew past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material
lying on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s south polar ice cap. At the time, scientists said
they believed the deposits were created by volcanoes spewing gas
and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said they believed the
volcanoes were active or had been active in the past few hundred
years.
   But it wasn't until late last week that closer examination of
<DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> pictures taken from a distance of 62,000 miles revealed an
eruption in progress, <ORGANIZATION>Miner</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``Resembling a smokestack, the narrow stem of the dark plume
rises vertically nearly 5 miles, forming a cloud that drifts 90
miles eastward in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s winds,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said in a stratement.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> made the announcement as Voyager formally ended its
two-month close inspection of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the solar system's
fourth-largest planet. The one-ton space probe was 34.7 million
miles past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, traveling at 37,337 mph. It was 2.83 billion
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and had traveled 4.46 billion miles on a curved
course since its launch in <DATE>1977</DATE>. Voyager 2 explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Voyager 2's encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> formally started <DATE>Aug. 5</DATE> and
it will continue to look back at the planet until <DATE>December</DATE>.
   But the formal end of the encounter was marked by the activation
<DATE>Monday</DATE> of a new set of computer commands replacing the program that
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close
examination of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2, like its twin Voyager 1, is expected to return
information to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for another 25 or 30 years before its
plutonium power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic
fields and electrically charged particles in space. Voyager 1
explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The eruption isn't apparent in any single image of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, but
was ``recognized by examining several images taken from different
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s eruptions are of nitrogen ice with nitrogen gas, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
said.
   ``It's a semantic issue'' whether to call them volcanoes or
giant geysers, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. ``If we're talking about the materials
involved, it's closer to a geyser than a volcano. But if you're
talking about the mechanics involved _ shooting material miles
above the surface _ that's closer to a volcano.''
   Scientists don't know what causes the eruptions on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
coldest known object in the solar system with a surface temperature
of 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   ``One possibility being considered is that pressurized gas,
probably nitrogen, rises from beneath the surface and carries aloft
dark particles and possibly ice crystals,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. ``Whatever
the cause, the plume takes the particles to an altitude where they
are left suspended to form a cloud that drifts.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon.
   Voyager 2 also discovered gargantuan storms and 720-mph wind in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, and six moons orbiting the planet in addition
to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It also
discovered three thin rings and one broad band of dust orbiting the
planet.

   Voyager 2 brushed by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then dove past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at <TIME>2:10 a.m PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> told hundreds of scientists
and dignitaries <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedingly
delighted to be here on this very historic day for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s space program.''
   During its approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons in
addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and frost-covered <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first
observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around
the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will
also prove to be a complete ring.
   Voyager's closest photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, but those returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> astounded
scientists. <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>.
   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been
seen on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> and some other moons, ``it's the first
time we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one of
the huge craters on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. ``This is a real volcano.''
   But Stone noted that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s volcanoes are ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across.
   Other <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying
cliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier
terrain,'' <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> said. ``They're like
things you see in polar caps on Mars.''
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said, adding that the faults suggest
``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.
   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``erupted
plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys
or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is
``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''
<PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said.
   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices
and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.
   Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io are the only objects in the solar
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active.
   Voyager also revealed <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere, as predicted.
It's content wasn't immediately determined, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the haze
might be like photochemical smog.
   Stone said the discovery that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface once was
geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting
moon _ about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ once was a
comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Under that theory, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> initially would have orbited <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in
a long ellipse, but <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity slowly pulled it into a
circular orbit, making <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> a semi-molten, geologically active
ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 1.385 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the
giant planet at 37,847 mph.
   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s bluish
atmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands of
miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone
called the Great Dark Spot.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Its trip to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> followed a
4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 1 also was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>
and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> before speeding out of the plane of the planets.
   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager
2 will look back over its shoulder at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it, like Voyager
1, will head toward interstellar space.
   ``Voyager 2 is now past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and is continuing to press
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON> said. ``The Voyagers are destined

encounter.''
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, an associate administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, called the
climax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time

<HEAD>Voyager Proves Volcanism Still Active on Neptune's Moon Triton</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geyser-like volcano blasting nitrogen
ice and gas five miles high was photographed on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> by Voyager 2 in the craft's last hurrah of its grand
solar-system tour.
   The discovery, announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> as Voyager 2 formally ended its
two-month encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, proves <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the solar
system's third known object with active eruptions, scientists said.
The others are Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, which has
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers.
   Photographs radioed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when Voyager flew past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material
lying on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s south polar ice cap.
   At the time, scientists believed the deposits were created by
volcanoes spewing gas and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said
they believed the volcanoes were active or had been active during
the past few centuries.
   But it wasn't until late last week that closer examination of
pictures taken from 62,000 miles revealed an eruption in progress,
said <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>, deputy Voyager project scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``We caught one in the act!'' he said.
   A <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> news release
called such eruptions ``geyser-like phenomena.''
   But Voyager's project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON> said, ``From the
standpoint of a major eruption, one would clearly discuss it as a
volcano.''
   He said a column of dark material rising five miles from the
surface can bee seen.
   On Earth, volcanoes erupt material that makes up the planet's
crust _ molten rock _ while geysers spew water.
   ``It's a semantic issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> scientist
<PERSON>Brad Smith</PERSON>, head of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The eruption isn't apparent in any single image of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, but
was recognized by examining several images taken from different
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said,
calling the discovery ``Voyager's last hurrah in its journey past
the planets.''
   Voyager 2's encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest
planet formally started <DATE>Aug. 5</DATE> and ended <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when the one-ton
probe was 34.7 million miles past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, traveling at 37,337 mph.
   The spacecraft was 2.83 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and traveled a
curved 4.46-billion-mile path since its launch in <DATE>1977</DATE>. Voyager 2
explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Although Voyager will continue to look back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> until
<DATE>December, Monday</DATE>'s formal end of the encounter was marked by the
activation of new computer commands replacing the program that
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close
examination of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2, like its twin Voyager 1, is expected to return
information to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for 25 or 30 more years before its plutonium
power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic fields and
electrically charged particles in space as they search for the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Scientists don't know what causes the eruptions on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which
is about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon and is the coldest
known object in the solar system, with a surface temperature of 400
degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Stone said one possibility is that heat from sunlight penetrates
and is trapped below <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s polar ice, evaporating nitrogen ice
into gas that powers the eruptions.
   The active volcano is the third and apparently the only active
type of volcanism discovered on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.

   With <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> safely in orbit around
Venus today, exuberant <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers started preparing the
spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped
the landscape of the hellishly hot planet.
   ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and
volcanoes,'' said <PERSON>Bill Johnson</PERSON>, chief engineer for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar
imaging system.
   Geologists hope the <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> exploration will reveal ``the
way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and
the way volcanoes work,'' said <PERSON>Steve Saunders</PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mapping is set
to start next month.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> plunged over the north pole of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, fired
its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges
from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface.
   ``We made it!'' said <PERSON>Carolynn Young</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project team
member. ``I had goose bumps from head to toe. It's wonderful.''
   The spacecraft successfully jettisoned the retrorocket <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, laboratory spokesman <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON> said.
   He said engineers' plans for today included monitoring
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s performance and collecting precise information on its
orbit _ details needed for successful mapping.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s arrival at Venus broke a string of bad luck for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
Hydrogen gas leaks have grounded the shuttle fleet temporarily and
a mirror focusing flaw severely impaired the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Hubble
Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is equipped with radar designed to peer through the
thick Venusian clouds and unveil the landscape of the second planet
from the sun. On <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, it will start mapping by bouncing radar
waves off Venus and capturing the echoes.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the radar should be able to yield pictures and maps of
about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of Venus at a level of detail 10 times better than
in images produced by two Soviet Venera spacecraft that were
launched in <DATE>1983</DATE>. It should be able to detect features as small as
about two football fields.
   ``It's like going to the Grand Canyon instead of having someone
tell you about it,'' mission analyst <PERSON>Rob Lock</PERSON> said.
   Magellan project manager <PERSON>Tony Spear</PERSON> said some worthwhile
pictures of Venus' surface may be produced by radar tests that
start next <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but ``it is most likely in <DATE>September</DATE> ... that
we will get images of sufficient quality.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>,
starting a roundabout 948-million-mile journey to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. It met the
planet at a distance of 144 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor other than the moon, and is
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, mass, density and position.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may reveal similarities and differences between the two
planets, including whether any of Venus' volcanoes are active and
whether its surface features are formed by large-scale movements of
gigantic plates of rocky crust.
   It also will look for signs that the bone-dry planet may have
had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has no ability to determine what caused global warming on
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, but may find clues to when it started.
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space science,
called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s arrival at Venus ``the beginning of one of the
most exciting eras of planetary exploration'' _ a period that
includes upcoming missions to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, Mars, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, asteroids and
comets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary spacecraft launched since
Pioneers 12 and 13 were sent to Venus in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and also the first
launched from a shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, named for 16th century global circumnavigator
<ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, is 21 feet long and 15 feet wide. After firing
the heavy fuel-filled braking rocket, its 3.7-ton weight dropped to
less than 1.5 tons, <ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said.

   Voyager 2 fired its thrusters <DATE>Monday</DATE> in a
delicate maneuver to bring it closer to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s mysterious moon
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. Then it searched for northern lights over <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
snapped pictures of its turbulent storms.
   One of two partial rings _ called ring arcs _ discovered earlier
this month by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has not been seen in subsequent photographs,
leading scientists on a ``search for the lost arc,'' said <PERSON>Bradford
Smith</PERSON>, the head of the Voyager imaging team, which analyzes the
spacecraft's photographs.
   Scientists expect to find many ring arcs as they get closer to
the planet, and to obtain very detailed photographs of them, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
said in a press briefing at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Scientists issued their first weather forecast for <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
predicting fairly accurately on <DATE>Aug. 13</DATE> where <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s Great Dark
Spot _ an Earth-sized cyclone _ would be found <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``It's not perfect, but weather forecasting isn't a perfect
science,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   The length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ the time the planet takes to
spin on its axis _ was estimated to be 16 hours, based on
observations of intense bursts of radio waves from the planet's
magnetic field, which varies with its rotation. Previous estimates
had put the day length at 17 or 18 hours.
   Voyager has so far discovered four new moons around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
bringing the total to six.
   The course correction executed <DATE>Monday</DATE> didn't use Voyager's main
thrusters, but two tiny thrusters that kept the spacecraft pointed
in the right direction to remain in communication with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The
smaller thrusters also avoided heating that could have disrupted a
radio receiver that partly malfunctioned a year after Voyager was
launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   It was the first time such a maneuver had ever been performed,
the researchers said.
   Use of the main engine could have put mission controllers out of
touch with the spacecraft for up to two days, said <PERSON>Norman Haynes</PERSON>,
Voyager project manager. The controllers couldn't risk that with the
spacecraft's closest encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> set for <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at <TIME>8:55
p.m. PDT</TIME>.
   The spaceship will pass 3,000 miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, and about
24,000 miles from <LOCATION>Triton</LOCATION> <DATE>five hours later</DATE>. The course correction
will bring the spacecraft 439 miles closer to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and will allow
better observations of any rings arcs and of the atmospheres of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   The latest pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> show the moon is brighter, cooler
and only about half the size scientists previously thought, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
said. Its diameter is now estimated at 1,740 miles, about
four-fifths the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon.
   The pictures show dark spots near <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s equator and a pinkish
cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas, or methane,
falling to the moon's surface as a sludge, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is a ``most intriguing moon,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in a
backward direction, according to Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward
Stone</ORGANIZATION>. That suggests it may have been a giant comet that smacked
into some other moon of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, then became trapped into orbit
around the planet.
   At <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.74 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 2.29 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, with a speed relative to
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> of 37,697 mph.
   Voyager's schedule of activities <DATE>Monday</DATE> including searching for
aurora, or northern lights, near <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole; making 36
photographs of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to study its weather, 24 pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
29 pictures of the moon <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and several photos of the recently
discovered moon designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N1.
   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> found evidence <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field,
suggesting it should also have auroral lights as electrically
charged particles are sucked toward its magnetic poles.
   The probe also was programmed to take 39 pictures of the region
in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   Pictures taken <DATE>Monday</DATE> were being recorded on tape aboard Voyager
for transmission back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> later in the week.
   Voyager's <DATE>Monday</DATE> schedule also included using an infrared sensor
to study composition of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.

   Voyager 2 plunged over <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north
pole and <DATE>today</DATE> took its closest look at the moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, discovering
dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults
and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic
exploration of four planets.
   ``This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory
astronomer <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON> said after the 12-year-old spaceship made
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. Neptune ``is not
a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real
place.''
   The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s icy
north pole cloud tops at <TIME>8:56 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> _ the closest of its
planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity
to a speed of 61,148 mph.
   Its photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> revealed that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s major moon has
large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said
Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.
   ``It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a
moon of Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. ``This is a real volcano.''
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> in a speech to
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Reiterating President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s <DATE>July</DATE> statement in support of an
eventual permanent base on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon and a manned trip to
<ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> declared: ``We Americans have been opening new
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so.
Today, space is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s frontier.''
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, an associate administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, called the climax of the
Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time we're seeing a
planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the
planets, except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.''
   Five hours after the rendezvous with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the spaceship made
its closest pass by the moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>2:10 a.m.</TIME>, a flyby that was
confirmed when signals reached <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> at <TIME>6:16 a.m. PDT</TIME>.
   The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's
radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The array of information on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon had
scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
itself.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> will upstage <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. It's filled with hummocky,
rippling terrain,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' said <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>. The
faults suggest that ``Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time
on the moon.
   Later, <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist, said there was ``abundant
evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like
substance rather than molten rock.
   Voyager's newest photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> received <TIME>this morning</TIME> showed a
smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> said
measured several hundred miles across.
   ``It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,''
<PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> said. ``It looks like some sort of feature flooded by
material, and the material is probably volcanic material.''
   The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows
on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and earlier found active
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> emphasized there is no evidence yet that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s icy
volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the
crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, head of Voyager's photographic imaging
team at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had described <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
surface in photos taken <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as ``extremely strange and
puzzling.''
   The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and
``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist
<PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While difficult to interpret, the early photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> gave
``the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and
alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white
topography that is ``closer to flat than big mountains,'' said
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, who called the pictures ``Just short of spectacular.''
   At <TIME>11:59 p.m. PDT</TIME>, signals were received showing that Voyager had
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it
passed through the plane containing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings, said <PERSON>Donald
Gurnett</PERSON>. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the
spacecraft, <PERSON>Gurnett</PERSON> said.
   Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the
spaceship's near encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   ``There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. ``We are all very
excited.''
   Scientists announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that Voyager discovered two more
tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a
60-mile-wide moon designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N5, and the even smaller <DATE>1989</DATE> N6,
which is a mere 30 miles wide.
   That brought the number of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moons discovered before the
close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid _ and four found earlier by Voyager.
   Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc.
Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> almost certainly also is a complete ring.
   During its flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, Voyager was programmed
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study
their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the
rings and search for others; and take its best but still
2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid.
   Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds,
high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other
cyclones.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> calculated <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position during the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby as
nearly 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. But the ship had traveled a
curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Champagne flowed at the laboratory <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when Voyager crossed
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
magnetic field.
   Earlier pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> suggested the backward-orbiting moon
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural
gas on its pink-and-blue surface.
   Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry
to aim a space probe built with <DATE>1960s</DATE> technology, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was
supposed to be after the long journey.
   ``Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer.
   Voyager 1 visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and now is
speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after
it stops studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> temporarily
the solar system's outmost planet.
   ``Someday there ought to be a <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> flyby,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``But
there are no active plans to do that.''

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to four more active ice volcanoes on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager
2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the
fastest yet seen in the solar system.
   Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly
five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, ``chances are that there are a dozen of these things going
off globally'' at any time, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, a planetary
scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>
after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its <DATE>Aug.
24-25</DATE> flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION>American Geophysical Union</ORGANIZATION>'s fall
meeting.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is only the third world in the solar system known to have
active volcanism. The others are Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, which
has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are
volcanoes on cloud-shrouded Venus.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas
past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like
Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   ``These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the
previous record winds of 1,100 mph in <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s jet stream, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>
said. ``These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is
Mach 1.''
   The speed of sound on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is about 700 mph, depending on
temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s air.
   The clouds racing in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s winds could be seen in a movie
made by computer from still photographs taken by Voyager. Also
shown at <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s news conference was another computer movie
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar
system.
   The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts
back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud
also is visible.
   The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three
more plumes, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   When Voyager swept past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> early <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE>, scientists saw
streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what
they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> announced it
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic
analysis of the photos.
   But the images were so fuzzy ``you had to take our word for
it,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   So <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> used a computer to overlap still photos taken from
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes.
   The causes of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s nitrogen ice volcanoes and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s high
winds are mysterious.
   Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material
settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent
nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker
material beneath. But the heat cannot escape through the ice, so
some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build
until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark
material with it.
   Neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists are
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot,
not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15
and 20 degrees south latitude, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in
the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is
needed to power high winds, he said.
   Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission
in which it flew past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. The spacecraft
discovered six moons at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, bringing the total to eight, and
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30
times farther from the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Magellan Resumes Venus Mapping After Communications Woes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> bombarded Venus
with radar <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the first attempt to make pictures of the
planet's cloud-shrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost
touch with it last month.
   ``Most people are sighing with relief,'' said <PERSON>Jim Scott</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission director at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're just happy to
get into the position where we wanted to be.''
   Acting on computerized commands radioed 154.9 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> started bouncing radar off the planet during the
morning and engineers received confirmation 13 minutes later, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION> tracking station at <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
started receiving data on the radar images, and computers will
assemble it into pictures that will be released to the public early
this week, said <PERSON>Ed Sherry</PERSON>, technical assistant to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s
project manager.
   ``I'm just delighted. I'm happy as a clam,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, totally concealed by
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet. It was launched from
the space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, and started orbiting
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, after a looping 948 million-mile voyage from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft's radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which reached Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Engineers lost radio contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for 14 hours starting
<DATE>Aug. 16</DATE>, then for 17{ hours beginning <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>. They still haven't
learned the cause of the temporary blackouts, which they believe
could happen again.
   But they gave <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> new computer instructions so it can
recover quickly from future communications breakdowns.
   The <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> blackout happened only hours after <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> used its
radar for its first pictures of Venus during two orbits around the
planet. Only 1{ orbits worth of picture information was sent to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> before contact was lost.
   Half the remaining picture information was radioed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and the rest was sent back <DATE>Saturday</DATE> before mapping
resumed, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said.
   The first pictures showed <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has large flows of solidified
lava; pervasive ``Venusquake'' faults; big meteorite impact
craters; volcanic cinder cones; large collapsed volcanic craters,
called calderas; and parallel mountain ridges and valleys like
those in the <LOCATION>Great Basin</LOCATION> that covers most of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and western
<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s official position is that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s formal mapping
mission won't begin until late this month. But if all goes well
through the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, officials may decide afterward that the
243-day mapping effort began <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sherry</PERSON> said.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, rotates once on its axis
every 243 Earth days. Magellan circles <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in a nearly polar
orbit, so as <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> revolves beneath it the craft should be able to
map <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the planet during its 243-day
mission. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, however, has said it expects to use <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for
additional 243-day cycles so the entire planet can be mapped.
   Venus is considered <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s virtual twin in terms of size, mass,
density and distance from the sun, although the planet's surface
has been heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a runaway ``greenhouse
effect.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s goal to learn exactly what forces shape <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, and
whether its crust is broken into giant drifting plates like those
that carry continents across the face of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Many scientists believe Venusian crustal movements are
predominated by ``hot spots'' - rising subterranean plumes of
molten rock like those that created the <LOCATION>Hawaiian Islands</LOCATION>.

   Voyager's pictures of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>,
an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
has something in common with <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>: smog.
   Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
<DATE>last Thursday</DATE> and zipped past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists
recognized that the frosty surface of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon
reflected much more light than originally expected, said <PERSON>Mary Beth
Murrill</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.
   Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68
seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON>
said.
   Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas,
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square
miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen
particles 20 miles skyward.
   During its <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six
moons in addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad
rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON>, manager of the flight
engineering office.
   By <TIME>9 p.m. PDT tonight</TIME>, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.55 million miles behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the
edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph.
   Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface
temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon
``the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said <PERSON>Roger
Yelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   Voyager also found smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's
atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of
photochemical smog at the bottom of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s stratosphere, said <PERSON>Jim
Pollock</PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an
atmosphere,'' imaging team leader <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON> said of other
planets and moons.
   ``In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the problem is it's happening way down low
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen
except on Titan,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy moon.
   In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon
<DATE>1989</DATE> N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its
lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into <DATE>1989</DATE> N1,
one of the six moons discovered by Voyager since <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   Voyager found earlier that <DATE>1989</DATE> N1 really is <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
second-largest moon after <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. Scientists previously thought
Nereid was No. 2.
   Instruments aboard Voyager discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is encircled by
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape,
called a torus.
   The torus is created by gases coming off of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Ralph
McNutt</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. Jupiter is
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur
volcanoes on the Jovian moon Io.
   The space probe also found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> have auroras
vaguely like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern and southern lights. They glow in
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however,
unlike <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s visible auroras.
   Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> capped its epic
tour of the four outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and
Uranus. The probe was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> along with its twin, Voyager
1, which explored only <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>.

   Atlantis' astronauts, safely in
orbit after a cliff-hanger weather delay, sent the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft streaking across the solar system <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on a
<MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mapmaking mission to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   The robot spacecraft, reviving an American planetary-science
program dormant for a decade, slipped from the shuttle's cargo bay
at <TIME>9:01 p.m. EDT</TIME> and drifted into space.
   ``Magellan is deployed,'' reported shuttle commander <PERSON>David
Walker</PERSON>.
   An hour later, after Atlantis moved a safe distance away, both
stages of a spacecraft motor fired to start <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on a 456-day
journey to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, 158 million miles away. It will travel 806
million miles, looping 1{ times around the sun, before reaching and
orbiting its target in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>.
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
<PERSON>Walker</PERSON> replied when told both stages had fired.
   Minutes later <ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION> reported:
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is coming to life and is on a proper path toward
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, falling toward the sun.''
   Mission specialists <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON>, operating remote
controls inside the shuttle cabin, checked the health of the space
probe before sending a signal that spring-ejected it into its own
orbit while Atlantis soared over the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> 600 miles
southwest of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first planetary craft ever launched from a
shuttle, is to map up to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' cloud-shrouded
surface. Its high-resolution radar system is expected to produce
images of objects as small as a football field _ 10 times the
clarity of any previous pictures of the mysterious planet.
   The release of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the main task of the four-day flight,
came a little more than six hours after Atlantis thundered into
orbit 184 miles high.
   The launch was delayed 59 minutes by shifting clouds and winds
that had threatened the second postponement in six days. When
Atlantis finally left its pad, just five minutes remained in the
launch ``window'' dictated by the need to have the shuttle in the
proper position to dispatch <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   The launch team had advanced the countdown to the 5-minute mark
and held there, waiting for a break in the clouds that obscured a
runway near the launch pad where Atlantis would land in an
emergency.
   Chief astronaut <PERSON>Dan Brandenstein</PERSON>, flying a weather scout plane,
found a break, signaled the go-ahead, and the count was started and
carried down to the blazing liftoff.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger. I'm glad you stuck with it,''
acting <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON>Dale D. Myers</PERSON> said as he congratulated
the launch team.
   It was the 60th <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> man-in-space flight, the 29th for the
shuttle and the fourth since the Challenger explosion more than
three years ago.
   ``Four of us are very happy to be back in space, and the fifth
one is very happy to be here,'' radioed <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>.
   Walker, pilot <PERSON>Ron Grabe</PERSON> and mission specialists Cleave and
<PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON> flew on previous shuttle flights. Lee is a rookie.
   ``Did somebody win the pool up there?'' mission control
commentator <PERSON>John Creighton</PERSON> asked the crew. ``We had only five
minutes left in the window.''
   ``We wouldn't want to push it any closer,'' replied <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>.
   The commander also reported Atlantis' separation from its
external fuel tank as it entered orbit was rougher than he
remembered on his first shuttle flight.
   ``It was more violent _ although I hate to use that word,'' he
said. ``It wasn't the soft separation I remembered from the
previous flight.''
   A launch attempt last <DATE>Friday</DATE> was halted with just 31 seconds to
go because of a short circuit in an engine fuel pump. Technicians
worked around the clock over the weekend to replace the pump and a
fuel line. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had to launch <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or ground it for
two years until <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> were again in the proper alignment.
   Among tens of thousands who watched the rare afternoon liftoff
were some of the country's most renowned planetary scientists. They
have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since <DATE>1978</DATE>,
when Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
expedition.
   Success for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> would signal the start of a science-rich
three-year period during which five major probes will be rocketed
into space.
   ``The overture, the symphony, begins with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
science chief <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>. ``It's going to be a long symphony.
It's going to have a lot of crescendos ... Nobody is going to
question our leadership in planetary science again.''
   Fisk hailed <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s flight as the start of a ``second golden
age'' of space science. The first was the period from the mid-1960s
to the late-1970s when unmanned spacecraft for the first time were
launched to make closeup examinations of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, Mars, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   Looking ahead, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said that in <DATE>August</DATE> the Voyager 2 spacecraft
launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> will take the first close look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> after a
planetary odyssey that earlier took it near <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and
Uranus.
   In <DATE>October</DATE>, another Atlantis crew is to start the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> is to orbit the sun
in <DATE>October 1990</DATE> and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in <DATE>1992</DATE> on an unmanned rocket.
   The planetary program had languished for 11 years because of a
combination of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget cuts and the Challenger explosion that
delayed most of these missions more than three years.
   When <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, it is to fire into
orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist.
   The radar is designed to pierce Venus sulfuric acid clouds and
produce images showing features as small as 100 yards across, the
size of a football field. In comparison, two <DATE>1983</DATE> Soviet spacecraft
captured features about 1,200 yards across and the <DATE>1978</DATE>
Pioneer-Venus could not distinguish anything smaller than 60 miles
across.
   ``Everything we have learned about planetary science says that
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is the planet most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said. ``A major
question is why Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though
at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.''
   The surface temperature of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sultry twin is 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure
is 90 times greater than that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The atmosphere of Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide,
and the upper clouds, which hide the planet from view, are made up
of sulfuric acid droplets. Earlier exploration by unmanned
spacecraft have revealed continent-sized plateaus, deep canyons and
one of the highest mountains in the solar system.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

MAGELLAN PROBE MANEUVERS INTO ORBIT OF VENUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After its 15-month journey from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, a planetary 
probe cobbled together from leftover pieces of other projects, slipped into a 
perfect orbit around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, providing <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> with an emotional 
high in its long <DATE>summer</DATE> of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver required the spacecraft to fire its solid-rocket motor while it 
was behind <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and out of touch with human controllers at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>. Project scientists spent a tense 21 minutes until the spacecraft 
emerged again at <TIME>10:06 a.m.</TIME>, signaling a successful firing and precipitating 
high fives, bearhugs and prolonged clapping. Had the solid rocket not fired, 
the craft would have sailed past the planet at 25,000 miles per hour and been 
lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will start radar mapping the cloud-shrouded surface 
of our sister planet, painting a portrait more detailed than what is available 
even for much of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which is shielded from such mapping by its oceans. 
At its low point, the spacecraft will sweep within 186 miles of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The flight to the hot, dry planet and insertion into orbit went so smoothly, 
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> researchers said, that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was left with a large excess of fuel for 
its maneuvering rockets, enough to keep it in operation for 30 years, decades 
longer than had been projected. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first of several planetary probes already launched or in 
preparation that will give the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> operating observatories around 
other objects in the solar system -- including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, Mars, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, asteroids 
and comets -- well into the next century. "We are back in the planetary 
exploration business," said <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Steve Wall</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after the successful rocket firing, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> associate 
administrator <PERSON>Lennard A. Fisk</PERSON> shrugged off questions about <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s short-term 
grounding of its shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks. Instead he focused on 
the successful Venus flyby of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, the launches of the 
Cosmic Background Explorer observatory last <DATE>November</DATE> and the <ORGANIZATION>Gamma-Ray 
Observatory</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June</DATE> and the upcoming launch of Ulysses into a solar orbit. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is not the first spacecraft to reach Venus. Soviet and American probes 
have preceded it, and two of the Soviet probes even landed on the surface, 
transmitting pictures of a parched, cracked landscape. But those pictures only 
covered the area immediately surrounding the craft's landing site. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have also used cloud-piercing radar to map the upper quarter of the 
planet, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists have employed the massive <LOCATION>Arecibo</LOCATION> radio observatory 
to map the entire planet, but only very crudely. In both cases, the resolution 
was sufficient only to pick out objects the size of 10 football fields, just 
enough "to whet our appetites," said <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Bob MacMillan</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, in contrast, will be able to image objects the size of a single 
football field, providing unprecedented clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope that by observing Venus in great detail, they will be able to 
learn about not only its past but <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s as well. Venus is very nearly <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s 
twin in size, but its surface temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and its 
atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, indicating that two planets 
took different paths in a very early stage of planetary evolution. 
</P>
<P>
The sweltering temperature of Venus is caused by the high concentration of 
carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, which permits the sun's heat to pass through 
and warm the planet but prevents heat from escaping back into space. 
Researchers are predicting a similar, albeit less disastrous, "greenhouse 
effect" on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> because of continued release of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"From looking at places like <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, we can . . . know more about what might 
happen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Gentry Lee</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But geologists are especially interested in studying the surface of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, 
which "is completely unlike anything seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> or Mars," according to <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist. Because so much of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s 
crust is obscured by oceans, geologists have a hard time interpreting many of 
its features. The study of Venus should give insight into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s crustal 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know a lot more about that planet to understand our own," <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers will have to wait a little longer. Spacecraft controllers will 
spend the next three weeks checking <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s systems and flexing its radar 
unit. The actual mapping will begin <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE> if no adjustment to its orbit is 
necessary, as now seems likely, or <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> if adjustment is required. 
</P>

<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will spend about a third of each 3.2-hour orbit mapping a narrow swath 
of Venus about 16 miles wide. During the remainder of the orbit, the data will 
be radioed to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The spacecraft will require one <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> day -- 243 Earth 
days -- to map about <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of its surface, all but the south pole.

Following this primary mission, the spacecraft will enter an extended mission 
in which it will map the remaining <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the planet and go back over 
interesting parts of the surface to provide stereoscopic images. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite and its operation for the next year will cost <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$551 million</MONEY>. 
Counting the cost of its launch by the shuttle Atlantis, the total cost of the

   The shuttle Atlantis and its five
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission
to start a robot craft streaking toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the cloud-shrouded
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists.
   The crew finished final spacecraft checks and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials
said the space probe called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was ready as the 23-minute
launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no
earlier than 2:24 <PERSON>p.m.
   Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said launch of the
explorer craft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will mark ``a resurgence of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
planetary program.'' The last American probe to deep space was
dispatched in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. A
launch control commentator announced ``all conditions look good''
for launch time weather in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Officials kept close watch on
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the
<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>.
   Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at <TIME>2:24 p.m. EDT</TIME>, heading to
orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Launch pad workers completed fueling <TIME>early this morning</TIME>. After
breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits
they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> workers
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours
after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile
unmanned trip of its own.
   Mission specialists <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON> will operate remote
controls that propel <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Atlantis is commanded by <PERSON>David M. Walker</PERSON>. The other crew members
are pilot <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON> and mission specialist <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>.
   The liftoff opportunity, dictated by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s path to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23
minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history.
   After its release from the shuttle, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s own rocket will
send it out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will
fly around the sun 1{ times before settling into an orbit of Venus
in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>.
   Venus has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward
and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar ``star'' of
the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after
sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon.
   Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million
miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets
since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily:
Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, which has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet.
   An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the
surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.
The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the
Venusian surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then
sending the image back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for computer enhancements.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the surface
while orbiting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> day.
   The last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary probe was the Pioneer-Venus, launched in
<DATE>1978</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said that in the 11 years since, ``we had a planetary
program that was in danger of being an also-ran.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of American planetary
exploration missions.
   Voyager 2, a probe launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and an earlier visitor to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus, will fly past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. In
<DATE>October</DATE>, the robot craft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A
space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to
the sun in <DATE>October 1990</DATE>, and to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said at a <DATE>Thursday</DATE> news conference.
   Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of Venus and until the
Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space
probes have been sent to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, including four by the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been
photographed.
   <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist, said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
studies may help scientists understand how the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> developed into
a place where life flourishes while <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> became a world of torrid
heat.

<TEXT>
<P>
Every once in a while, a clever screenwriter reminds us that when we peer up at 
some distant star or planet, we are actually looking into the past because the 
light thrown off by the celestial body takes so long to travel to us here on 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On public-television stations around the country tonight, would-be astronomers 
and insomniacs alike can spend the wee hours looking at close-up photographs of 
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s recent past as Voyager 2 zips past the planet and its moons at 38,000 
m.p.h., snapping pictures like a shutter-happy tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling at the speed of light, the signals that make up those photographs 
will take four hours and six minutes to traverse the 2.7 billion miles 
separating <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. And just as soon as the signals are received by 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s deep space tracking 
antennas in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and then turned into photographs by 
scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, viewers will be able 
to see them on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic slide show begins at <TIME>11:30 p.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>KCET Channel 28</ORGANIZATION>, at <TIME>11 p.m.</TIME> on 
KVCR Channel 24 and at <TIME>12:25 a.m.</TIME> on KPBS Channel 15, and will continue until 
at least <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Anyone willing to stay up will get the first look at 
these pictures from deep space just hours after the 1-ton Voyager spacecraft 
makes its closest pass over the clouds of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, turns 45 degrees with the 
help of the planet's gravity and then flies past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s quirky moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. 
Voyager is scheduled to buzz within 3,000 miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s wispy cloud tops 
tonight at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the pale-blue eighth planet 
from the sun that was discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, will also be carried throughout the 
<TIME>night</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>Cable News Network</ORGANIZATION> and C-SPAN. CNN will have extended live coverage of 
the mission beginning at <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
During its 4.4-billion mile, circuitous journey through the solar system, 
Voyager 2 has already photographed <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. Tonight's 
meeting with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, which is four times the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, will be Voyager's 
final visit to a planetary system before it darts off into the infinity of 
space. Scientists hope that <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will provide the first direct measurements 
of the environment outside the solar system sometime in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
PBS' "Neptune All Night" will feature 20-minute updates each hour from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientists as they examine and interpret the most recent photographs. The 
remaining 40 minutes each hour will originate live from WHYY-TV in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> 
and will include a panel of experts on the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> analyzing the 
new data, live viewer calls on a nationwide toll-free hot line, reaction to the 
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> voyage from science-fiction writers and celebrities, a recap of 
Voyager's previous planetary encounters and a frivolous look at space travel in 
movies and science-fiction literature. 
</P>
<P>
"We are staying on the air all night to present this program because there 
really has been a rebirth in public interest in the space program," said <PERSON>Don 
Leifer</PERSON>, program director at <ORGANIZATION>KVCR</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Bernardino</LOCATION>. "We literally had a block 
party on my street with all the people watching the lunar eclipse (last week). 
This show is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. It's the first time anyone 
will have seen such close-up pictures of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, and we felt this falls 
exactly into where public television should go." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>, Voyager's chief project scientist, called the 
meeting with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> "the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer 
planets, and like a symphony, its tempo is accelerating as it nears the end." 
</P>
<P>
Already Voyager has discovered four previously unknown Neptunian moons, a 
complete ring and several partial rings circling the planet, a huge storm 
system the size of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> that may pack winds up to 400 m.p.h. and a strong 
magnetic field. JPL scientists expect further discoveries today as the 
spacecraft sails through the upper reaches of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere and then 
within 2,500 miles of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the moon that revolves the "wrong" way and 
appears to have a transparent atmosphere and a pinkish, iced surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It may snow from time to time in places, there may be heavy frost laid down," 
astronomer <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON> said of the eccentric satellite. "What we would 
really like to do is to get some idea of what <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s geological history has 
been. It's a strange satellite, it's in the wrong orbit, it's going backward 
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, and something truly catastrophic must have happened at some 
time in its past." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's snapshots of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> can also be seen on the NASA-Select satellite 
feed by anyone with their own satellite dish, on some cable-access channels and 
at various locations around the <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION>. The NASA-Select feed will contain 
fresh images from space as well as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> press conferences and 
discussions of the mission and the spacecraft's discoveries. The <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> feed will 
begin at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> and continue through the <TIME>night</TIME>, and also will be 
broadcast from <TIME>9 a.m. to 11 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>every day through Tuesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The NASA-Select feed can be seen at the <ORGANIZATION>California Museum of Science and 
Industry</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Griffith Park Observatory</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cal State Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>El 
Camino College</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego State</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Monica College</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, Ambassador 
College, <ORGANIZATION>Southwestern College</ORGANIZATION> and on some cable systems. Interested viewers 
should call their cable operators for details. 
</P>
<P>
The Learning Channel will also offer a one-hour progress report on <DATE>Voyager 
today</DATE> at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> CNN will air a special report, "Voyager: Rendezvous With 
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>," <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> And <ORGANIZATION>TBS</ORGANIZATION> will carry its own special on Voyager at <TIME>7

<TEXT>
   Some statistics known about <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> as
Voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight:
   DIAMETER: About 30,700 miles, nearly four time's <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s diameter
and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus,
which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31,760 miles.
   MOONS: Two majorones, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, plus at least four
others discovered so far by Voyager 2. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, four-fifths the size
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit
a planet backwards. That suggests it once was a sun-orbiting comet
that hit a Neptunian moon and was ``captured'' into orbit around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   RINGS: So far Voyager has found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is orbited by one
complete ring of debris, and one ring arc, or partial ring, which
scientists believe also may prove to be a complete ring upon closer
inspection.
   DAY LENGTH: Surface wind suggests <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> takes nearly 18 hours
to spin on its axis, but <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s measurements indicate a day on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is closer to 16 hours, the time it takes for the bulk of the
planet's interior to rotate.
   YEAR LENGTH: <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> takes 165 Earth years to make a single orbit
around the sun. That means a winter on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> lasts more than 40
Earth years.
   DISTANCE FROM SUN: Orbits the sun at an average distance of 2.793
billion miles, 30 times as far as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and invisible to the naked
eye from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun,
but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit it is now the ninth and
outermost.
   WEATHER: A chilly 307 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at an
altitude where the atmospheric pressure is twice that at sea level
on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager has revealed cirrus-like clouds, 400-mph wind and
an Earth-sized cyclone and other storms in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere. The
source of the internal heat creating <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather is a mystery;
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s comes from decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   ATMOSPHERE: Primarily hydrogen and helium, but <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> appears
pale blue-green because enough methane, the major component of
natural gas, is present to absorb red light.
   STRUCTURE: Scientists suspect that a third of the way toward
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s center the atmosphere gives way to a slurry of water and
rock, with no distinct sky-sea boundary.
   DISCOVERY: In <DATE>1846</DATE>, by <PERSON>Johann Gottfried Galle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heinrich Louis</PERSON>
d'Arrest at the <ORGANIZATION>Berlin Observatory</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was discovered because
its presence was predicted based on disturbances in Uranus' orbit.

Venus, a planet that started out like the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> but took a dramatic turn 
somewhere along the way, is turning out to be a geological candy store as it 
lays bare its soul for the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs released <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> show a planet 
that is pockmarked with giant impact craters large enough to swallow <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> and a twisted, tormented landscape that has been molded by forces that 
are still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely jazzy images," said <PERSON>Gordon H. Pettengill</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, principal investigator for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s 
radar science team. The images were captured by an electronic "camera" that 
uses radar beams to pierce through the dense atmosphere that normally hides the 
surface of the hot, barren planet. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will help them understand why Venus -- the planet 
that is most like the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in size, mass and distance from the sun -- turned 
out to be so different: devoid of life, with surface temperatures hot enough to 
melt lead and a heavy atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
After a troubled beginning, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> seems to be doing its best to help unravel 
the mysteries, but some of the images produce more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has mapped the surface for more than 80 orbits as it flies in a 
polar trajectory around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>. The problems that caused the craft to sever its 
communications with Earth twice are not fully understood, said chief engineer 
<PERSON>John P. Slonski Jr.</PERSON>, so <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is not completely safe yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems may happen again," <PERSON>Slonski</PERSON> told a press conference at the 
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> lab. He said that even if the "root cause" of the blackouts has not 
been determined, engineers have at least narrowed the range of probabilities 
and taken steps to protect <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the images captured by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> have demonstrated 
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is an extraordinary laboratory in which to test geological theories 
because the photographs are clear and reveal a geological record spanning 
hundreds of millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth, the evidence of earthquakes and volcanoes disappears over time 
because of vegetation and erosion. On <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, where there is no vegetation and 
very little erosion, the geological record stands out in brilliant clarity. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new images shows an extraordinary pattern of what appears to be a 
crosshatching of faults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely regular pattern," said <PERSON>James W. Head II</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>, 
co-investigator on the radar science team. "The regularity is so remarkable," 
he said, that "we have no idea how these (patterns) would form." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that there are similar areas on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he said, but they must be 
hidden by vegetation or erosion. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, "erosion does not appear to be a fundamental process" on the 
surface of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Head</PERSON> said. That is because there is no water to wash away the 
soil and produce sediments that could be transported by the wind, and the wind 
amounts to little more than a slight breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so used to water eroding the surface of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>," Head said. "It's 
astonishing to see all this detail. When you create (a geological feature on 
Venus) it stays there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
If <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> can capture a photo of an active volcano on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, it would answer 
whether the planet is alive in a volcanic sense, but nothing in the images 
transmitted to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> shows that. 
</P>
<P>
Head pointed out that <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has covered only <PERCENT>1 1/2%</PERCENT> of the surface of Venus 
so far. If you looked at that much of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface, you probably would 
not see any active volcanoes either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Head indicated that he believes he already knows the answer. "It's very much 
alive," he said of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The images from <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> reveal a surface that could be changing even as the 
spacecraft zips overhead. In addition to faulting and cratering, the newly 
released images show a "river" of lava hundreds of miles long. The images also 
show giant volcanoes similar to those in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular image is a mosaic covering an area about half the size of 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. It was displayed at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> as a 10-foot-by-12-foot mural, and it shows 
giant craters up to 30 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
One image shows an impact crater that is nearly two miles deep. All of the 
impact craters are at least five miles in diameter. Scientists said that is 
because only the largest objects survive the long journey through space to 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface. Smaller meteoroids apparently break up as they crash through 
the dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to spend nearly a year mapping <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, and scientists said 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that they expect far more images and a lot of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't touch that dial," Head said. "We think we've got a blockbuster <DATE>fall</DATE> 
season coming up."

   The <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft found that
600-mile-wide circular features on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> are mile-high volcanic
bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet, a
scientist said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like nested sets of
concentric rings. Called coronas, the rings are ridges and valleys
that form huge circles. Numerous volcanoes and lava flows dot the
coronas.
   The coronas are formed by the same kind of upwelling of
underground plumes of molten rock that created the <LOCATION>Hawaiian
Islands</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Ellen Stofan</PERSON>, a geologist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They're definitely formed by some sort of thermal pulse from
the interior of the planet'' that lasts hundreds of millions of
years, she said.
   In <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
identified about 30 coronas that measure from 75 miles to more than
600 miles across. But the Venera orbiters couldn't determine if
they were upward bulges or depressions in the ground caused by the
impacts of gargantuan meteorites.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is examining the planet with a more sophisticated
radar, which makes much more detailed pictures and also is able to
calculate surface topography. It found five more coronas and
determined they rise as much as one mile above the surrounding
terrain. <PERSON>Stofan</PERSON> said that shows they are hot spots rather than
impact craters.
   One corona that's 150 miles wide seems to be in the early stages
of bulging upward, suggesting that some of its small volcanic domes
and lava flows may be actively erupting, she said.
   Magellan won't be able to confirm the presence of active
volcanoes until the middle of next year, when it passes over the
same part of Venus a second time and can look for landscape changes
resulting from any ongoing eruptions.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers, meanwhile, said the sun will almost block
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s view of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> on <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> when <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the sun
and <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> will be oriented in almost a straight line.
   That will cause a nine-day halt - starting sometime between
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Monday</DATE> - in <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s use of radar to peer through
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' clouds and map the planet, said <PERSON>Phil Allin</PERSON>, administrative
assistant to <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s project manager.
   The astronomical lineup, called ``superior conjunction,'' also
may make <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> completely lose contact with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> for up to three
days, although engineers disagree on whether that will happen,
<PERSON>Allin</PERSON> said.
   The sun won't completely block Earth's view of Venus and
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> during the planetary lineup, but activity from the sun
already has impaired some communications, he said.
   Engineers twice lost touch with <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> due to a
yet-unidentified problem. If that happens again when the
Venus-sun-Earth alignment also makes communication difficult or
impossible, ``we worry about how quickly we would get things back
to normal,'' <PERSON>Allin</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4,
1989</DATE>, and arrived at the second planet from the sun on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>.

<HEAD>Space Probe Finds Three More Moons Orbiting Neptune</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three new moons were discovered around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by cameras on the Voyager 2 space probe as it hurtled
toward the blue planet, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The discoveries bring the number of known <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> moons to six,
including long-known <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid and a moon found earlier
this <DATE>summer</DATE> by Voyager.
   Voyager 2 was 22 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> when the moons were
confirmed by scientists <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, indicating there may be many
more discoveries as the space probe draws closer in the next few
weeks.
   Finding the moons may presage discovery of narrow rings around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to those around <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. That is because the moons
are orbiting in a region where rings are thought to exist, said
<PERSON>Richart Terrile</PERSON>, one of the team of scientists studying images
transmitted by Voyager.
   ``The whole ring arc idea has it that satellites will be in
association with the rings, and the fact we're seeing the moons
already is encouraging,'' <PERSON>Richard Terrile</PERSON>, using a term for partial
rings.
   The new moons were temporarily named <DATE>1989</DATE> N2, <DATE>1989</DATE> N3 and <DATE>1989</DATE>
N4. The objects were spotted in images from <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>'s TV cameras
and tracked for five days. They were confirmed as moons when they
followed predicted orbits.
   The trio appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in
diameter and are in circular, equatorial orbits moving in the same
direction as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rotation. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, for unknown reasons,
orbits in the opposite direction.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and has explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and Uranus. Now 2.7 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, it is heading at more
than 42,000 mph on a course to pass within 3,000 miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   The number of discoveries at such a great distance from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
suggests more finds are likely, according to <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON>, 38, a 10-year
Voyager project veteran who is among two dozen members of the
imaging team.
   ``At this time in the last encounter, <LOCATION>Uranus</LOCATION>, we had only found
one moon. I think the fact that we found four now bodes well for
finding more,'' he said.
   The moons may shed light on how <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> formed. <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a
large atmosphere and little is known about what its core is made of
and what is going on in there.
   Moons can provide a sample of material from a planet, or be
material captured by it, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   ``A planet just normally doesn't form by itself, it leaves
behind debris,'' he said, adding that the debris can be in the form
of moons or rings.
   Study of moons can also tell scientists about such events as
heating, collisions and geological activity in the solar system.
``The moons have on them, since they are surfaces, an imprinted
history of what's gone on,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   For the moment, the discoveries raise more questions than
answers. If there is a ring system, is it regular or irregular?
   ``We know very little about what's there, yet we're plunging a
spacecraft right through the system,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   Scientists believe Voyager 2 is in a fairly safe position, he
said, but if there is an irregular system ``we might find that it's
a rather hazardous place to fly the spacecraft through.''
   The newfound moons were only points of light on the images, but
the resolution will improve about <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> each of the next 10
days and then improve by <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> a day, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   Of the three, <DATE>1989</DATE> N3 is closest to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, orbiting 17,000
miles above the planet's clouds and completing one orbit every 8
hours and 10 minutes.
   Orbiting 23,300 miles above the clouds, <DATE>1989</DATE> N4 circles <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
in 10 hours and 20 minutes; <DATE>1989</DATE> N2 is 30,000 miles above the
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes.
   Voyager 2 spotted the first new moon, <DATE>1989</DATE> N1, on <DATE>June 21</DATE> and
tracked it until confirmation in <DATE>July</DATE>.

<HEAD>Robot Spacecraft Ready for Rendezvous with Venus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, a robot spacecraft armed with a
sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and begin an
eight-month exploration and mapping of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest
neighbor, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804-million-mile
voyage to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> when it fires a rocket engine to settle
into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface.
   Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles
per hour and the rocket firing will slow <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to 18,400 miles
per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.
   After a checkout period lasting until about <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
will use a powerful radar system to penetrate the dense clouds
above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and gather images for a detailed map of the baked
surface of the torrid planet.
   Tony Spear, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project manager, said at a news
conference that the only major problem experienced by the <MONEY>$413
million</MONEY> spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical
failure in one gyroscope.
   Spear said the spacecraft needs two gyros to control its
position and is equipped with four. Loss of the one gyro, he said,
still leaves a full set of two, plus one spare.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was carried into space by the space shuttle Atlantis
and released into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>. An upper stage rocket
engine fired to send <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> streaking out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit toward
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. During its 15-month voyage, the spacecraft looped the sun,
passed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit once and then sped toward its <DATE>August</DATE> meeting
with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Spear said the plans called for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to spend 243 days, the
length of one <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> day, creating a radar map of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>90
percent</PERCENT> of the planet's surface. If the craft continues to perform,
<ORGANIZATION>Spear</ORGANIZATION> said the mission would be extended for additional mapping
cycles until <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will circle <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once every three hours, spending 37
minutes of each orbit bouncing radar signals off the planet's
surface. Each pass will image a swath 10,000 miles long and about
16 miles wide. The data is stored in on-board recorders.
   When the spacecraft swings toward the high part of its orbit, it
will spin, aim its antennae toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and spend 115 minutes
transmitting the radar data back to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s deep space network.
   Later, computers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> will process
the signals into images that resemble aerial photos. Scientists
expect <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> to detect surface details as small as 260 yards
across, about 10 times more resolution than any of the 20 or so
spacecraft that have previously explored <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Venus holds fascination for scientists because it's nearly the
same size and mass as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the two planets are thought to
have shared a similar planetary formation history.
   But the two planets differ significantly in temperature and
pressure.
   Venus has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees _ about the
temperature of a self-cleaning oven _ and its atmosphere is almost
pure carbon dioxide. Venus has no liquid water and the atmospheric
pressure is more than 90 times that of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Though <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is 23 million miles closer to the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
it is covered by acid clouds so dense that its surface is in
perpetual twilight.
   Because of the clouds, only a radar such as that carried by
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, can gather the images needed to map the Venusian surface.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its <DATE>1995</DATE> encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager <PERSON>Dick Spehalski</PERSON> said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
<TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The pictures and data were stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until <DATE>October</DATE> when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission also will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
they arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a gravity slingshot next <DATE>December</DATE>
and again <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar map at
least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s roundabout route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is an indirect result of
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> would have propelled <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the risk was minimal.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said <PERSON>Edward
Stone</PERSON>, Voyager project scientist for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>, a physicist and vice president at the
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said <PERSON>Candice Hansen</PERSON>, a
planetary scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on <DATE>June 22</DATE> when it was
57.2 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, which called it ``the
best color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot or <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and apparently on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and Caltech planetary
scientist <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, he added.
   Stone said that on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, and possibly <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from <LOCATION>Cape
Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   They explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Voyager 1 flew past <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and will fly about 3,000 miles above
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   Five hours later it will encounter <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s backward-orbiting
moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost
until <DATE>2007</DATE>.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1990</DATE> and again in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the most
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast
oceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by
earthquakes and active volcanoes.
   That planet is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the space
shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, is ultimately bound for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But
its long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home
planet before dispatching it to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   That makes <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the first spacecraft to approach Earth from
interplanetary space.
   ``It's showing people what the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> would look like to an
extraterrestrial,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, project scientist on the
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earth
like this before. We're going to go in and see what this place
looks like.''
   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse
effect and the Antarctic ozone hole, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will film what
scientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer and
writer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the movie, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will appear as a thin, distant crescent,
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10
feet across are visible.
   As the spacecraft pulls away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sunlit side, it will
take a backward-looking shot showing five days of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> recedes.
   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tiny
planet that we're on,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also, at <LOCATION>Sagan</LOCATION>'s suggestion, use its
state-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. And
on its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone hole
over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed to
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the
global environment,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is returning to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> only to pick up a boost in speed
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After its
launch, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will get a gravity kick by passing around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
pick up more speed with the two passes by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and then begin its
primary mission to orbit <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, explore its moons and dispatch a
probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere.
   ``We wouldn't do anything on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> encounters if we thought
it would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said <PERSON>Fraser P. Fanale</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION>, who is in charge of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
science objectives.
   Scientists say the <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> probe's investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that
interplanetary exploration has witnessed. The <DATE>1979</DATE> Voyager views of
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its satellites were fascinating, but <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s images
will be 1,000 times clearer, they say.
   In <DATE>1995</DATE>, a smaller probe is to be fired by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the
Jovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushed
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will orbit the planet gathering information on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces
such phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-old
storm larger than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in <DATE>1982</DATE> on a
direct course to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, but it has been delayed repeatedly as
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> wrangled over <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> financing and as
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.
   On <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE>, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. They
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated
areas, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said its evaluations indicated the risk of
contamination was very low.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will do more than observe the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it makes its way
to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments
to observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of things
we don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a
picture of the whole moon from the data we have.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the
moon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of
the moon's crust and its interior.
   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, searching
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit at
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars
and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Its observations of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon may help resolve a debate
about the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of <PERSON>Louis A. Frank</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>.
   The theory holds that the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s lakes and oceans come from
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.
   If that's true, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> should be able to spot hydrogen clouds
around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon, the result of the comets' water
molecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor rising
from the moon as comets collide with its surface.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make the most accurate measurements yet of the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet
``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the
atmosphere.
   It may also show whether the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is shadowed by a ring of
interplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists have
proposed.
   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We may
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
   Finally, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> observations have what <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> calls ``the
surprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planets
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even been
imagined. Could a fresh look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> do the same?
   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things people
hadn't thought about,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. ``Who knows?''

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> they plan to
launch ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle <DATE>Oct.
12</DATE>, catapulting the ship <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a <DATE>December 1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will fly by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, pass <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, study depletion
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early <DATE>1960s</DATE> are available, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, the project
scientist.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is a marvel,'' <PERSON>Neal Ausman Jr.</PERSON>, the
mission director, said during a news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   <PERSON>Clayne Yeates</PERSON>, acting science and mission design manager, called
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said <PERSON>Yeates</PERSON>.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE>, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
orbit <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, then launch the spacecraft. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE>, using
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and Mars,
where in <DATE>October 1991</DATE> it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again before being sent
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in <DATE>August 1993</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make about 10 orbits around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, passing closest
to Io but also near <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION>, two other Jovian moons.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in <DATE>1977</DATE>, at which time launch was set for <DATE>1982</DATE>. Budget cuts during
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said <PERSON>John
Casani</PERSON>, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Finds Giant `Dark Spot' On Neptune; May Be Huge Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a
6,200-mile-wide dark spot on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, and scientists believe it's a
giant storm similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red
Spot.
   The width is about one-fifth of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s 30,700-mile diameter,
just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the
size of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>, a planetary scientist at the
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 2 was launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, visited
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Its twin,
Voyager 1, explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and is now
heading toward interplanetary space.
   ``I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter
because Uranus was such a bland place,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``So
I'm happy to see such action on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.''
   The top Voyager scientist was similarly excited.
   ``It's huge!'' Caltech physicist and vice president <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>
said of the dark spot.
   While the robot probe is too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to detect winds
within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane-like storm system
similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said Stone,
chief scientist of the Voyager project for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hurricanes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> are much smaller, measuring several hundred
miles across. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week
or two, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since
its discovery more than 350 years ago _ a mystery scientists have
yet to explain.
   Stone said <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot became apparent in photographs
taken by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s television cameras in <DATE>April</DATE>, and faint hints of
it can be seen in pictures made as early as <DATE>January</DATE>.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> may explain the persistence of the spots, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION>
said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the
solar system's fourth-largest planet, at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   It will swoop 3,000 miles from the planet's north pole, by far
the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecraft's
``grand tour'' of the giant, gaseous outer planets. Five hours
later, it will pass 25,000 miles from <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, one of two known
Neptunian moons.
   Voyager 2 <DATE>today</DATE> was 2.66 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 58.98
million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward that planet at 42,216
mph, said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the
planet's southern hemisphere, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white
spot _ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees
south latitude, he said.
   The dark spot's color isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, <ORGANIZATION>Ingersoll</ORGANIZATION> said. But Stone said it is darker than <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
surrounding skies, which are blue-green because of methane in its
mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot is believed to get its color from
organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within
it, said Ingersoll.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> contains dozens of smaller
storm systems, which appear as white spots. <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> has similar
storms, although they are less visible, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot, the scientists
said.
   The existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dark spot is mysterious because
scientists didn't think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce
winds, said Ingersoll. Unlike <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus
lacks enough internal heat to create big storms, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, and is about
30 times farther from the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. But because <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun,
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until
the year <DATE>2007</DATE>.

   An aging Pioneer spacecraft that
gave scientists their first close-up look at Venus continues to
yield secrets of the cloud-shrouded planet 10 years after its
launch, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   The Pioneer orbiter has revealed many previously unknown
features of Venus, whose thick veil of sulfuric acid clouds has
kept <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s telescopes from seeing its 800-degree surface.
   ``It challenges our thinking to try to understand why did Venus
evolve in such a different fashion than Earth,'' project scientist
<PERSON>Larry Colin</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``And are there any lessons to be learned
there in terms of the direction our own climate is evolving?''
   The probe, with some adjustments, should continue to send data
until it burns up in the Venusian atmosphere when its fuel runs out
in the <DATE>summer of 1992</DATE>, said <PERSON>Colin</PERSON> and project manager <PERSON>Richard
Fimmel</PERSON>.
   The two <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials quietly celebrated the 10th anniversary
of the probe's launch with a news briefing at <ORGANIZATION>NASA Ames Research
Center</ORGANIZATION> here, 35 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   The Pioneer orbiter, one of a series of space probes developed
at <LOCATION>Ames</LOCATION>, was launched at <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>May 20,
1978</DATE>. Pioneer originally carried five probes, which separated from
the orbiter and descended into <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere on <DATE>Dec. 9, 1978</DATE>,
studying the atmosphere before they burned up.
   Radar data from the <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> probe provided scientists with
detailed maps of <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the planet's surface. The
information also helped them understand weather patterns in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and how the solar wind affects it.
   While <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has been called <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s twin because it is similar
in size and density, the planet is inhospitably hot because of what
scientists call a ``runaway greenhouse effect,'' or overheating
caused when the atmosphere trapped solar radiation.
   Pioneer revealed hints of old volcanoes on Venus, since
confirmed by radar studies from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft.
   But the orbiter is beginning to show its age.
   ``Like people, spacecraft get old, and <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Venus</ORGANIZATION> has its
aches and pains,'' <PERSON>Fimmel</PERSON> said.
   The probe's solar cells, which power the craft and its
scientific instruments, are degrading, partly due to a natural
process, partly to bombardment by high-energy sun particles, <PERSON>Colin</PERSON>
said.
   When the orbiter had full power, scientists could run all the
instruments at once, but now they must operate them at different
times, he said.
   The probe, a cylinder 8 feet in diameter and 4 feet high and
topped with a yard-wide antenna dish, is now about 1,200 miles
above the planet's surface.
   Scientists are looking forward to the culmination of the mission
in <DATE>1992</DATE>, when the probe's orbit will bring it within 93 miles of
<LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, into the upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere.
   Pioneer has been unable to take measurements in the planet's
atmosphere since its arrival because of a varying elliptical orbit.
During its fatal re-entry, the probe will be able to detect major
changes since then, <PERSON>Colin</PERSON> said.
   The orbiter also has studied several comets, including <PERSON>Halley</PERSON>'s,
<ORGANIZATION>Encke</ORGANIZATION>, Giacobini-Zinner, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON>, <PERSON>McNaught</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Nishikawa-Takimizawa-Tago</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Venus orbiter is one of six Pioneer probes still operating.
Sun orbiter Pioneer VI, launched in <DATE>December 1965</DATE>, is the oldest.
