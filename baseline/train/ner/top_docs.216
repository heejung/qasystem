  [Excerpts] Bilateral trade, economic and business ties 
between <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> are set to grow at a steady 
pace from now on with the Malaysian prime minister <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed</PERSON>'s official four-day visit to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> which began 
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
  The Malaysian leader's visit can be described as historic in 
the sense that it is the first official trip by a Malaysian 
prime minister to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, since the two countries 
established diplomatic ties in <DATE>1964</DATE>. It also reciprocates the 
visit of Philippine President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> last year. 
[passage omitted] 
  <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir</PERSON>'s entourage includes some cabinet ministers 
holding key portfolios as well as about 60 corporate leaders and 
businessmen which demonstrates the seriousness that is being 
attached to increase economic and business cooperation. This 
cooperation entered concrete term on the very first day of the 
visit with the signing of the nine memoranda of understanding or 
<ORGANIZATION>MOUs</ORGANIZATION>, involving the private sectors of the two countries. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>MOUs</ORGANIZATION> may lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. Apart 
from injecting much-needed capital into the Philippine economy, 
the deals are also in line with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s policy to boost 
reverse investment. While the <ORGANIZATION>MOUs</ORGANIZATION> will be signed, officials of 
the two countries got down to details of an investment guarantee 
agreement, IGA, which is likely to be signed in the course of 
the visit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister <PERSON>Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed</PERSON>'s 
official visit to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, the first by a Malaysian 
premier to that country, is already yielding results. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Philippine Government</ORGANIZATION> is keen and serious about enhancing trade 
relations with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>. And this should be the case with 
[words indistinct] <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>. In response to <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir</PERSON> and his 
delegation's visit to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>, a 
high-powered multimember delegation from the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> paid a 
two-day visit <DATE>last weekend</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Territory</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Labuan</LOCATION> 
off the East Malaysian state of Sabah. The Philippine delegation 
was truly interested in knowing more about the development of 
<LOCATION>Labuan</LOCATION> as an offshore financial center and also about foreign 
investment opportunities in both the East Malaysian states of 
Sabah and <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>. What is encouraging is that the visit showed 
the commitment of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Government</ORGANIZATION> to the development 
of the <LOCATION>East ASEAN Growth Area</LOCATION>. The visiting mission was given a 
detailed briefing on the investment opportunities available in 
<LOCATION>Labuan</LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION>Sabah</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sarawak</LOCATION>. 
  It is noteworthy that the Philippine delegation's visit was 
the first by a well-represented government and private sector 
mission from that country. What seemed to interest them was the 
function of <LOCATION>Labuan</LOCATION> as an international offshore financial 
center, or <ORGANIZATION>IOFC</ORGANIZATION>. The delegation included a group of bankers who 
appreciated the <ORGANIZATION>IOFC</ORGANIZATION> concept being adopted in <LOCATION>Labuan</LOCATION>. The 
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine National Bank</ORGANIZATION> has been quoted as 
saying his bank was considering setting up an offshore bank in 
<LOCATION>Labuan</LOCATION>. The bank would like to finalize joint financial 
undertakings not only with the <ORGANIZATION>Malaysian Government</ORGANIZATION> but also 
with the private sector. 
  Cooperation between the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> is 
certainly 
on the way up. One of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s leading companies is currently 
involved in the development of infrastructure in the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. Malaysian participation in the power supply, stock 
development, and telecommunication sector will also be welcomed 
in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. [Words indistinct], both countries can help 
each other to promote their respective tourism industry. The 
idea of setting up a regional air link needs serious 
consideration. The visit by the Philippine president, <PERSON>Fidel 
Ramos</PERSON>, to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> last year and the reciprocal visit by <PERSON>Dr. 
Mahathir</PERSON> have opened the way for increased cooperation between 
the two <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> partners. The private sector of the two countries 
should take this opportunity to go into joint ventures for their 
mutual benefit.

  [Text] Comprehensive development has taken place in 
relations between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> member countries. Trade 
and economic ties between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> countries have 
rapidly increased. In <DATE>1992</DATE>, two-way trade between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and 
the <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> reached <MONEY>$220 million</MONEY>. It was <MONEY>$158 million</MONEY> with 
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> with 
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, and <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> with the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 
  By the end of <DATE>1993</DATE>, about 100 projects for <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> countries 
with invested capital of hundreds of millions of dollar were 
licensed in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. ASEAN investment in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has increased 
10 times as against <DATE>1990</DATE>, now accounting for <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the 
total foreign investment in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. More than 30 agreements on 
economic, scientific and technical, trade, payment, credit, 
aviation, and navigation have been signed between <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 
countries and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. 
  In late <DATE>July last year</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Committee for Foreign 
Investment of Vietnam</ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement of cooperation with a 
prime company of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> which will see the latter invests in 
major projects in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. In late <DATE>1991</DATE> and early <DATE>1992</DATE>, the 
Vietnamese Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> visited all six <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 
member countries. This helped the region to have a better 
understanding about the current reform in this country. 
  In visiting <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, all leaders of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> member countries 
demonstrated sympathy with the problems and difficulties <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
has been confronting, and promised to share experiences with the 
Vietnamese in national development. 
  Prime Minister <PERSON>Chuan Likphai</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is committed to 
create favorable conditions for further multi-sided cooperation 
between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and his country. President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> of the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> has assured <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> chairman 
<PERSON>Nong Duc Manh</PERSON> that the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> has always been <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
friend, and hoped that bilateral ties would be further 
developed. It is the common voice of leaders and people of 
<ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> member countries. 
  Most recently, during his visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 
secretary general, <PERSON>Mr. Ajit Singh</PERSON>, informed <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> of the 
decision by <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN Secretariat</ORGANIZATION> to allow <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to participate 
and observe in various programs in science, technology, 
environment, culture, information, public health, tourism, and 
development sources. <PERSON>Mr. Ajit Singh</PERSON> said the secretariat will 
send senior officials to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to exchange views on concrete 
issues of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>'s concern. 
  These developments show how much bilateral and multi-sided 
cooperation between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> member countries has been 
increasing. At the recent foreign ministerial conference held 
in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> countries appreciated <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
achievements in its renovation process, and welcomed <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
participation in a forum on regional security. Relations 
between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> has created a new atmosphere in 
<LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister <PERSON>Mahathir Mohamed</PERSON> once declared that 
he would be glad to contribute to national reconstruction and 
economic development in <LOCATION>Indochina</LOCATION>, with the confidence that 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> would be stable and developed. It 
would contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the 
region.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thurs.</LOCATION> -- Economic cooperation between 
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> entered more concrete terms today 
with the signing of nine memorandums of understanding (MOUs) 
involving the respective private sectors. 
  While representatives from the various companies worked on 
the details of the projects involved, officials from the two 
governments sat down to finalise details of an investment 
guarantee agreement (IGA), which may be signed in the next few 
days. Prime Minister <PERSON>Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed</PERSON> and 
President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> witnessed the signing ceremonies at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Malacanang Palace</ORGANIZATION>, the latter's official residence, here this 
afternoon. 
  <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir</PERSON>, who arrived here this afternoon for a four-day 
visit, the first by a Malaysian prime minister since the two 
countries established diplomatic ties in <DATE>1964</DATE>, hailed the 
signing of the agreements as "the start of a new phase in our 
relations." "I think we have made very good progress," he told a 
joint news conference after the signings. Asked if more 
investments from <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> could be expected, he replied: "Yes." 
  The nine <ORGANIZATION>MOUs</ORGANIZATION> could lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. 
Apart from injecting much-needed capital into the growing 
Philippine economy, which rose by <PERCENT>2.3 percent</PERCENT> last year compared 
with one per cent in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the deals are also in line with 
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s policy to boost reverse investment. The <ORGANIZATION>MOUs</ORGANIZATION>, signed 
behind closed doors, are for a hotel project on <LOCATION>Samal Island</LOCATION> in 
<LOCATION>Mindanao</LOCATION>; partial acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Bank</ORGANIZATION>; highway 
and mass transit systems construction and the implementation of 
a RM [Malaysian ringgit] 50-million waterwork project; water 
treatment for <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> Base; gaming houses; production of 
refrigerators, the construction of Metro <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> waterworks 
sewerage system; and a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> $72-million power plant. 
  The nine MOUs were signed between <ORGANIZATION>Johan Holdings Bhd</ORGANIZATION>. 
[Limited]/<PERSON>George Kent</PERSON> and Metropolitan Cebu Water District; 
<ORGANIZATION>Johan Holdings Bhd.</ORGANIZATION>/<PERSON>George Kent</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Bases Conversion Development 
Authority Berjaya Topgroup</ORGANIZATION> (HK) <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Team Asia Corp Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; 
<ORGANIZATION>Berjaya/Wy Sdn</ORGANIZATION>. Bhd. [Private Limited] and <ORGANIZATION>Fun Characters Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; 
<ORGANIZATION>Ekran Bhd.</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Department of Tourism/Philippine 
Tourism Authority</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Ekran Bhd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Associated Bank</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Renong 
Bhd.</ORGANIZATION>/Mara and <ORGANIZATION>Public Estates Authority</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Datuk Eugene Campos</PERSON> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Louis Cosan</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The signing of the <ORGANIZATION>MOUs</ORGANIZATION> reflects the determination of both 
countries to step up investment and bilateral trade after ties 
had been held back for so long by the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Government</ORGANIZATION>'s 
claim over <LOCATION>Sabah</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s investment in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> has 
been unpredictable. On an uptrend during the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, investments 
dipped after <DATE>1989</DATE> and in <DATE>1992</DATE>, no new capital from <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> 
flowed into the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 
  Last year some <MONEY>193 million pesos</MONEY> (RM16.3 million) in 
Malaysian investments went into power generation plants, poultry 
breeding, and electronic manufacturing projects in the republic. 
  <ORGANIZATION>MBf Asia Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MCA Power Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, together with a 
third Canadian partner, entered into a deal for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> $<MONEY>2 
billion</MONEY> (RM5.5 billion) power plant irrigation and flood control 
system. Hong <ORGANIZATION>Leong Engineering</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sarte Teodore</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Associates</ORGANIZATION> 
clinched a deal on the manufacturing of computer software in the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> for export. 
  Al-Bakara <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> also took a slice of the pie in a deal 
with a group, led by <LOCATION>Mindanao</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Mastura</PERSON> family to rehabilitate 
the state- owned <ORGANIZATION>Amanah Bank</ORGANIZATION>, now privatised.

  [Text] A call by Philippine President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> for more 
contacts among claimants of the disputed <LOCATION>Spratly Islands</LOCATION> in the 
<LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> Sea which will eventually lead to "demilitarisation" 
of the area drew a receptive response from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, a senior 
Philippine government official said here yesterday. 
  President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> for a three-day 
official visit. He held talks with Vietnamese President <PERSON>Le Duc 
Anh</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> chief Do Muoi and Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van 
Kiet</PERSON>. 
  The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> are among six claimants of the 
<LOCATION>Spratly Islands</LOCATION>. With the exception of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, the two 
countries along with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, have maintained 
various degrees of military presence in the area. 
  Speaking at a press conference before heading for southern 
<LOCATION>Ho 
Chi Minh City</LOCATION> yesterday <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> said his proposal for more 
contacts as well as for joint resources development in the 
<LOCATION>Spratlys</LOCATION> is aimed at defusing tension in the region. 
  "We agreed on the need to devise confidence-building 
mechanisms -- cooperative ventures in the area -- that will 
assure the claimant countries and the rest of the region that 
the <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> Sea can be transformed from waters of contention 
to an area of cooperation," he said. 
  Ramos added that he also mentioned to the Vietnamese leaders 
"the need to agree on demilitarisation" of the Spratlys. 
  Elaborating on his president's remarks, Undersecretary for 
Foreign Affairs <PERSON>Rodolfo Severino</PERSON> told reporters that 
demilitarisation of the Spratlys should be achieved in an Asian 
way, which is "gradual, step by step, in a consensual manner." 
  The Philippine and Vietnamese leaders also said they would 
like to encourage informal contacts from top level down to local 
commanders among the claimant parties, with a view to reducing 
tension in dealing with the <LOCATION>Spratlys</LOCATION>, according to <PERSON>Severino</PERSON>. 
  <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has constantly reiterated its sovereignty over the 
Spratlys and the Paracels in which the latter is also in 
bilateral contention with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
  Stressing that the proposal for joint studies towards 
military reduction and joint resource development is new to 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Severino</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> nevertheless found this "an 
interesting" idea. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN Regional Forum</ORGANIZATION>, to be held this <DATE>July</DATE> in <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> 
and 
to which <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is invited to attend, will steer clear from 
controversial issues such as disputed claims over the <LOCATION>Spratlys</LOCATION>, 
he said. 
  While in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> also presided over the 
signing of several bilateral agreements covering trade, culture, 
tourism and the set-up of a <ORGANIZATION>Joint Commission for Bilateral 
Cooperation</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The two countries said they would try to increase bilateral 
trade, which last year amounted to only <MONEY>US$48 million</MONEY>, 
facilitate Vietnamese rice for Philippine fertiliser barter 
arrangements, as well as work to establish direct shipping 
services.

  [Text] The honor guard at <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>'s international airport has 
probably never been so busy. Since <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lifted its 
three-decade-old economic embargo on <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>, the

diplomatic visitors. 
  Leading the rush, have been the heads of the <ORGANIZATION>Association of 
South East Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> (ASEAN), all eager to look at 
investment prospects and assess <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>'s ambitions to join their 
privileged group. Within the space of a little over a month, 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has hosted visits from the secretary general of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 
and the leaders of <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 
  Communist Party chief <PERSON>Du Muoi</PERSON> was a guest of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> <DATE>last

offensive <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has launched following the break up of the 
Soviet bloc. Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> visited all six <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 
members between <DATE>October 1991</DATE> and <DATE>July 1992</DATE> as <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> searched 
for new economic partners. At the time, most observers 
predicted that it would be at least five years before <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
would be admitted. But in a reflection of the sweeping 
political changes that are occurring across the region, 
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Goh Chok Tong</PERSON> announced in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> that 
he thought <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> may be formally discussed in 18 months. 
Philippine President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> was even more optimistic, 
calling for the immediate acceptance of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. 
  Political differences between communist <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and the six 
capitalist <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> members have been swept aside with <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>'s 
market reforms and the signing of the <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> peace agreement 
in <DATE>1991</DATE>. 
  Goh said <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s communist ideology was no obstacle to 
membership of the bloc, founded when most of its members were 
aligned against <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War. 
  "It (<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s communism) should not be an obstacle," he 
said. "It depends on whether it can contribute to <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>." 
  Vietnam contends that its political system is not going to 
change anytime soon and that the important thing is stability 
for economic development, a line that fits in nicely with the 
way most <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> governments feel about the "soft autocratic" 
style of democracy they practice. 
  Other <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> officials have argued that the speed at which 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is integrated will depend on the pace of its economic 
development and market reforms <LOCATION>While Vietnam</LOCATION> is about 30 to 40 
years behind <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and possibly some 20 years behind in 
development compared to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, the wide 
disparity within <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> itself would suggest that this is not an 
obstacle. 
  However, <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> officials have said that before membership 
can 
be granted, <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> must prove its ability to contribute to the 
group's technical projects and resolve administrative and 
financial obstacles. These include the need to boost English 
language skills and accounting practices. 
  Once again it seems <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>'s ability to zero in on petty 
bureaucratic priorities when faced with the opportunity of 
taking bold action will only reinforce its reputation as a 
hide-bound forum for endless talk and little achievement. 
  Hanoi is upgrading its technical capabilities to accelerate 
its admission but <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> continues to talk of admitting <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
only at an "appropriate time" when it is sure it can make a 
contribution to the regional group. 
  In one frequently cited area, education, it is going to be 
years if not decades before <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> can contribute but in 
possibly the most important area -- security -- <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is ready 
to make a valuable contribution now. 
  As <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>'s only strong 
supporter in the regional grouping noted, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
"incorporation into <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> is an imperative of Southeast Asian 
peace, security and prosperity." 
  "Over the next generation, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is certain to become one 
of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>'s most important states and a major force in 
the balance of power," <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> said during his recent visit to 
<LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>. 
  Of particular interest to <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> is the 
dispute <LOCATION>Spratly Islands</LOCATION>. ASEAN has been reluctant to take an 
assertive stand on the atolls which are claimed in part by four 
of its members, as well as <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and have 
long been regarded as the most likely source of conflict in the 
region. 
  In <DATE>1992</DATE>, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> acceded to the <ORGANIZATION>Bali Treaty</ORGANIZATION> in which the 
original <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> members pledged to settle their disputes 
peacefully. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> refuses to sign the treaty and its use of 
force against <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to settle claims in the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> is 
becoming increasingly troubling. 
  ASEAN was born out of fear of the spread of communism and 
conflict from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Whether it is a member of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> or not, 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> remains crucial to continued peace and prosperity in the 
region. 
  By admitting <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> will be better placed to work 
toward a solution of the <LOCATION>Spratly Islands</LOCATION> issue and also prosper 
if the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> can in the words of Ramos, "be 
transformed from waters of contention to an area of cooperation." 
  As <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> admits itself, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s membership is no longer a 
matter of policy or principle but merely procedure and time -- 
an that time has come.

  [Text] President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> <DATE>today</DATE> said that his meeting 
with top Vietnamese leaders have greatly enhanced 
Philippine-Vietnamese relations, which he describes as a 
critical factor for the solidarity of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and the 
peace and progress of the region. The president said he had 
friendly and powerful meetings with President <PERSON>Le Duc Anh</PERSON>, 
General Secretary Do Muoi of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party of Vietnam</ORGANIZATION>, and 
Vice President <PERSON>Nguyen Thi Binh</PERSON>. The chief executive said he was 
looking forward for his luncheon meeting with the prime 
minister, <LOCATION>Vo Van Kiet</LOCATION>. 
  President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s leaders are all acutely aware 
of their country's need for regional stability so that they can 
have a breathing spell after two generations of almost 
continuous conflict to set their economy on the road to 
self-sustaining growth. 
  The president said that during his meetings with the 
Vietnamese leaders, he was able to explore new avenues of 
possible cooperation in the <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> sea in order to reduce 
tension in the area and promote its joint development as called 
for in the <DATE>1992</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Manila Declaration</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION>. The two 
countries also agreed on the needs to devise confidence-building 
mechanisms or cooperative ventures that will begin to assure 
countries with claims over the area in the rest of the region 
that the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> can transform from waters of contention 
to an area of cooperation. 
  On the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees still in the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, the president said, and I [newscaster] quote, We 
agreed that the increasingly favorable economic situation in 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> should make it easier for our two countries to work out 
the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, unquote. 
  President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> paid tribute to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s revolutionary 
leader <PERSON>Ho Chi Minh</PERSON> by laying a wreath at his mausoleum at the <ORGANIZATION>Ba 
Dinh Square</ORGANIZATION>. The president and his official delegation arrived 
at <TIME>8:00 A.M. yesterday</TIME> and briskly walked towards the mausoleum 
escorted by the curator and a guard. After laying the wreath, 
the president proceeded to the <PERSON>Ho Chi Minh</PERSON> residence, located 
inside the compound of the Presidential Palace. The two-room 
house is made of wooden materials. The president accompanied by 
the caretakers stopped by the pond and attempted to fish out but 
failed to catch any. After this, Representative <PERSON>Antonio Cuenco</PERSON> 
told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>AIPO</ORGANIZATION>] will invite <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> to attend the forthcoming <ORGANIZATION>AIPO</ORGANIZATION> 
meeting in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>. The invitation will be relayed 
today by the Philippine legislators accompanying President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> 
during his official visit in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>. Representative <PERSON>Cuenco</PERSON> said 
that during the <ORGANIZATION>AIPO</ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION>Manila Vietnam</LOCATION> will be offered 
an associate member status, which will make it a dialogue 
partner. Vietnam currently has an observer status in the <ORGANIZATION>AIPO</ORGANIZATION>. 
  President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> visited the assembly plant of <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Motors 
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of Filipino and Vietnamese businessmen. 
In extemporaneous remarks during his visit to the plant site, 
the president said the linking up of the two countries in the 
joint economic endeavor is a breakthrough in business 
partnership. He said this partnership is a new arithmetic in 
business in the global economy. The president said that so far 
<MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> worth of spare parts have been imported from the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> for the plant, which assembles 9,200 <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> and [word 
indistinct] vehicles a year. The plant employs a number of 
Filipino managers and technicians. <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> is a 
joint venture between <ORGANIZATION>Colombia Motors Group</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Hoa Binh Automotive</ORGANIZATION> factory of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> has <PERCENT>70 
percent</PERCENT> equity in the firm. The plant started operations in 
<DATE>1992</DATE>. 
  President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON>, recalling that the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
made solemn commitments to respect each other's territorial and 
sovereign integrity in <DATE>1978</DATE> and in <DATE>1992</DATE>, <TIME>last night</TIME> proposed the 
holding of regular consultations among all states with claims on 
the Spratlys. According to the president, in the <LOCATION>South China 
Sea</LOCATION>, where both the countries are involved, attention needs to 
be focused not on mutual suspicions but on cooperative ventures 
that build mutual confidence and trust among the claimant 
states. The president said regular consultations on the 
Spratlys can result in greater cooperation in local confidence 
building, marine research, environmental protection and joint 
exploratory activities. 
  According to President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> the foundation for the 
friendship between the two countries were laid when they 
established diplomatic relations soon after the reunification of 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. The commitments that they made to each other were 
given substance and strength by a joint communique issued in 
<DATE>1978</DATE> by then President <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON> and then Premier <PERSON>Pham Van Dong</PERSON>, 
and they were reaffirmed by Prime minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and 
President Aquino in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>. 
  According to President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON>, and I quote, By this solemn 
undertaking, we pledge peace between us, resolving to settle 
peacefully any disputes and to cooperate for the common good for 
our people. This pledge I reaffirm, <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, on behalf of 
my government and the Filipino people, unquote. 
  The chief executive said <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> was privileged to be the 
host 
two years ago of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s accession to the <ORGANIZATION>Treaty of Amity</ORGANIZATION> and 
Cooperation in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s acceptance as 
observer in the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION>. It was 
during the same occasion in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> issued the <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> 
Declaration of the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION>, which <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> immediately 
endorsed. President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> noted that his delegation also looked 
intensively into the opportunities for counter trade and 
investments and joint ventures in each other's economy. The 
chief executive also offered the help of the Philippine 
industrialists, academics, managers and technologist in 
rebuilding <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s infrastructure and financial management and 
legislative policy formulation, and in running their tourist 
facilities. 
  According to the president, they also agreed during their 
meeting to collaborate in science and technology, education, and 
public health. The two countries also agreed to exert every 
effort to raise the level of trade and to take every advantage 
of complimentarity, adding that the trade protocol signed 
yesterday identified a long list of products that could 
profitably be exchanged between the two countries. According to 
President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> and I quote, We proposed and they agreed that we 
establish a joint commission to deal comprehensively with the 
whole range of our relationship and nurture its steady 
expansion, unquote. To promote tourism in both countries, 
President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> cited the just concluded tourism and cultural 
agreement between the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and the Vietnamese officials.

  [Text] Leading Malaysian journalist has criticized what he 
called the highhandedness of his country's enforcement agencies 
dealing with immigrants. <PERSON>Kadir Jasin</PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s 
influential NEW STRAITS TIMES, was referring in its <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
weekly column to the roundup by Malaysian police on <LOCATION>Palm</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
of more than 1,000 Filipino maids in front of a Catholic church 
in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION>. In his column, <PERSON>Kadir</PERSON> said he did not think 
many Malaysians were pleased by the highhandedness by 
enforcement agencies in the operations against foreigners. 
  In the operations, 711 Filipino maids were detained. All but 
33 of them were later released after their employers produced 
their work permits. Malaysian Prime Minister <PERSON>Mahathir</PERSON> bin 
Mohamed directed authorities, including the police, to exercise 
greater care when carrying raids of suspected illegal workers in 
places of worship. As this developed, Prime Minister Mahathir 
is reported sending to <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> a personal emissary to meet with 
President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> on the <LOCATION>Palm</LOCATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> arrest. 
  Meantime, <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Roberto 
Romulo</PERSON> 
says the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Government</ORGANIZATION> has reached what he called a 
meeting of the minds with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> on how to cool down the 
dispute. <PERSON>Romulo</PERSON> said he and the Malaysian Foreign Minister 
<PERSON>Abdullah</PERSON> bin <PERSON>Haji Ahmad Badawi</PERSON> have agreed to discuss the matter 
in a joint commission set up last year. That commission carries 
the task of improving bilateral relations chilled by a 
30-year-old Philippine claim of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Sabah State</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Speaking of <LOCATION>Sabah</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Ramos</PERSON> has evaded making a 
direct 
response to a proposal raised in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for the revival of the 
country's claim to <LOCATION>Sabah</LOCATION>. Speaking to reporters in <LOCATION>Cebu</LOCATION> in the 
<LOCATION>Visayas</LOCATION>, the president said <PERSON>Malacanang</PERSON> [presidential office] 
will issue a statement today on its position on the proposal. 
Senator <PERSON>Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</PERSON> presented a proposal the other 
day asking President Ramos to again assert the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>' 
territorial claim of Sabah. Arroyo made the proposal shortly 
after <PERSON>Senator Ernesto Herrera</PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine 
Government</ORGANIZATION> withdraws its invitation to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>'s ceremonial 
king to visit <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> beginning this <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> VNA Feb 25 -- Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> 
received here <TIME>this morning</TIME> a delegation of the <ORGANIZATION>Cuban National 
Bank</ORGANIZATION> led by its First Vice President <PERSON>Osvaldo F. Torres</PERSON>, now on a 
working visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. While here, the delegation paid a 
floral tribute to the late President <PERSON>Ho Chi Minh</PERSON> at his 
mausoleum. It has working sessions with officials of the <ORGANIZATION>State 
Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Commercial Bank of Vietnam</ORGANIZATION> during which the two 
sides affirmed their determination to continue broadening their 
cooperation and exchanging experience in the field of banking 
activities in each country in order to effectively implement the 
agreements between the two countries signed during Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> last year. Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> hailed the results of the two sides' working 
sessions as a new manifestation of the friendly and cooperative 
relations between the fraternal and reliable peoples of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. He said the friendship, cooperation and mutual 
assistance between the two countries were elements of important 
significance to the national construction and defence of each 
country in that cause and would learn much from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s valuable

  [Text] Filipino President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> has described his 
tour of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> as one of the most significant visits he has 
ever made. He told the media on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> before leaving <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> 
that the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, together with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and other countries 
in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>, wish to share a common destiny and there is 
no other alternatives than promotion of economic cooperation and 
construction of peace among them. The president supported 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s succession to <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>. He expressed readiness to share 
his country's experience to build infrastructure and a legal 
system in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. He maintained that the two countries have 
large opportunities in scientific, technological, educational, 
and health cooperation. 
  Before leaving <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> held a press 
conference. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in English] I have, like other heads 
of government in other parts of the world, been covering [words 
indistinct]. In an effort to develop [word indistinct] 
activities in our foreign relations, [word indistinct] the 
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> cannot [word indistinct] with the vigorous economies 
of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>. I regard this trip to the Socialist Republic 
of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> as a one of the most significant I have made. With 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and the other Southeast Asian states, the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> 
has a shared destiny. There is no alternative for peace than 
economic cooperation among us in this region that we are 
inhabit. In <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> acceded to the <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> Treaty 
of the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> nations which binds signatories to settle regional 
disputes peaceably. <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s full membership in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> is now a 
matter [words indistinct] in principle but mainly of time and 
procedure. I reiterated to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s leaders the consistent 
support of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to help facilitate <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s entry 
into <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>. They in turn informed me of their intensive 
preparations for full participation in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> activities. 
  Philippine-Vietnamese relations are a critical factor for 
the 
solidarity of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and consequently for the peace and 
progress of the region. I believe my visit greatly enhances 
these relations. I had friendly and fruitful meetings with 
President <PERSON>Le Duc Anh</PERSON>, General Secretary Do Muoi of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist 
Party of Vietnam</ORGANIZATION>, and Vice President <PERSON>Nguyen Thi Binh</PERSON>; and I look 
forward to our meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> later 
today. 
  Like our own leadership, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s leaders are all acutely 
aware of their country's need for regional stability so that 
they can have the breathing spell after four generations of 
almost continuous conflict to shape their economy and [word 
indistinct] self- sustaining role. With them I explored avenues 
of possible cooperation among the claimants to areas of the 
<LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> Sea and other nations of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> in order to 
reduce tensions in the area and to promote joint development as 
called for in the <DATE>1994</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Manila Declaration</ORGANIZATION>. We agreed on the 
need to devise confidence building mechanisms, cooperative 
ventures in the area that will begin to assure the claimant 
countries of the archipelagoes that the <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> Sea can be 
transformed from waters of contention into an area of 
cooperation. We agreed that the increasingly favorable economic 
situation in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> should make it easier for our two countries 
to work out the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in 
the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. My delegation also looked intensively into the 
opportunities for countertrade and into investments and joint 
ventures in each other's economies. 
  We offered the help of our industrialists, academics, 
managers, and technologists in the building of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
infrastructure, in financial management, in legislative policy 
formulation, and in running the tourist facilities. We agreed 
there is great room for our two countries to collaborate in 
science and technology, education, and public health. And we 
agreed to exert every effort to raise the level of trade between 
us and to make and to take every advantage of complimentarities 
between our two economies. [end recording]

<FÊP=106> [Editorial: "Better and Better in ASEAN"] </F>
  [Excerpts] When President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> <DATE>last 
year</DATE>, he was the first Philippine leader to do so after 25 
years. Last week, <ORGANIZATION>Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed</ORGANIZATION> returned the 
courtesy. Not since <PERSON>Tunku Abdul Rahman</PERSON> had a Malaysian prime 
minister been there on an official visit in 30 years. Such 
reserve showed in the modest trade links: the two countries did 
no more than [<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> dollar] <MONEY>$555 million</MONEY> worth of business 
in the first nine months of last year. [passage omitted] Talking 
to Filipinos in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, one gets the feeling that more than a 
few do not share an <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> destiny. It is not insularity, but an 
apartness built on the country's Spanish-American past and 
Christian outlook. That is changing, however. 
  Improved relations with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> are a key element of that 
process. This impinges on <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> cohesion, as the number of 
territorial disputes, apart from the one on <LOCATION>Sabah</LOCATION>, are a 
constant reminder that good neighbourliness cannot be taken for 
granted. The Spratlys dispute concerns three <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> nations; 
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> have not settled the issue of <LOCATION>Sipadan</LOCATION> and 
Ligitan; while <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> has not given up its claim on <PERSON>Pedra 
Branca</PERSON>. Sabah, lest it be forgotten, is not a closed file. 
There are complexities which will take much negotiation and 
goodwill to disentangle. Neither <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Mr. Ramos</PERSON> 
pretend that a settlement can be had in their lifetime. [passage 
omitted] What bodes will for <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> is that after three decades, 
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> accept that, one, the Sabah 
resolution need not be tied to a time-frame, and two, that 
economic co-operation should not be held hostage to it. The 
Sabah question, as agreed upon before <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir</PERSON> went to 
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, is now held in suspended animation. [passage omitted] 
  What is "positive" was what the Mahathir visit was about: 
trade and investment links. If there is sustained economic 
expansion, no political problem can remain intractable for long. 
It was significant that on the Malaysian side, the initiative 
came from the private sector which was a big part of the 
Mahathir party. The nine memoranda of understanding signed with 
Philippine interests cover infrastructure work that the 
Filipinos need badly to ignite growth: highways, hotels, power 
and water plants, rail systems. Intriguing was the Malaysian 
offer of a financing instrument called the Bilateral Payments 
Arrangement (BPA) to boost trade. Under this system originally 
meant for the Group of 15 developing countries, importers and 
exporters are guaranteed payment through the central banks of 
trading partners. <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> has <ORGANIZATION>BPA</ORGANIZATION> links with 21 countries with 
trade amounting to [Malaysian dollar] <MONEY>$4 billion</MONEY>. It will be a 
help to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. Less clear is the concept of an East 
Asian growth crescent covering <LOCATION>Mindanao</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, the East 
Malaysian states, and eastern <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>. If it takes off it 
will energise development on a big scale, on a par with the 
<ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> free trade area scheme. The framework and growth 
mechanisms will take time to evolve. Conditions are favourable, 
however, such as the greatly reduced threat from the Muslim 
separatists and jungle guerillas in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. This may 
be <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>'s biggest contribution to <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> and to itself.

<FÊP=106> [Speech by President <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON> prior his departure for </F>
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Ninoy International Airport</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> on 28 <DATE>March</DATE> -- 
recorded; passages within slantlines in <LOCATION>Tagalog</LOCATION>] 
  [Text] At the gracious invitation of President <PERSON>Le Duc Anh</PERSON> 
of the Socialist Republic of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, I leave today on a 
three-day official visit to <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Ho Chi Minh City</PERSON> with a 
small official delegation. Accompanying us are four members of 
my cabinet, three senators and two congressmen, the president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>University of</ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, and a business delegation of 
our most prominent industrialists and traders. 
  This trip reciprocates Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>'s visit to 
our country three years ago. I regard this visit as one of the 
most significant I have made. <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is one of our closest 
neighbors. It is less than two hours away across the <LOCATION>South 
China Sea</LOCATION>. Our two countries are alike in terrain, area, 
natural resources, and population. Our cultural connections 
date back at least a thousand years, and our struggles against 
colonialism and foreign conquest were inspired by the same 
ideals of freedom and national independence. But in the course 
of history, we adopted different ideological systems for 
organizing our national societies. The Cold War and the 
<LOCATION>Indo-China</LOCATION> [words indistinct] raised even greater barriers 
between our two countries. Today, mutual goodwill between our 
two countries have brought down those barriers. Our paths 
converge again on the road to self-sustaining economic growth, 
and our two countries today seek national security and regional 
stability, neither in military alliances nor in accumulating 
weapons but in friendly consultation and economic cooperation 
with neighbor countries. 
  With <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and the other Southeast Asian states, our 
country has a shared destiny. We have found that there is no 
alternative to peace and economic cooperation among us in this 
region. Over the next generation, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is certain to become 
one of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>'s most important states and a major force 
in the regional balance of power. Its incorporation in the 
<ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>ASEAN</LOCATION>, is an imperative 
of Southeast Asian peace, security, and prosperity. In <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> 
in <DATE>July 1992</DATE>, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> acceded to the <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> Treaty of the <LOCATION>ASEAN 
States</LOCATION>, which binds iis signatories to settle regional disputes 
peaceably. <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s full membership in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> is now a matter 
no longer of policy or principle, but merely of time and 
procedure. Even now, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> already takes part in a wide range 
of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> cooperative activities. For instance, it is a part of 
the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN Regional Forum</ORGANIZATION>, to which <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> and friendly outside 
powers consult on regional security. 
  The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> took the initiative of wholeheartedly 
supporting <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s membership in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> and its associated 
institutions. We have also consistently supported <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
efforts to re-establish normal relations with the global 
community and to secure membership in international financial 
and political organizations. Philippine-Vietnamese relations 
are a critical force for the solidarity of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> and 
consequently for peace and progress of the <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>- <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region. 
I am confident that this visit, the first by a Philippine 
president to the Socialist Republic of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, will advance 
this relations substantially. 
  The facets of our bilateral relationships are many and 
increasing. There are, therefore, important things for my 
delegation to discuss with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s leaders. There is the 
security of <LOCATION>East Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. Its present status can 
now be enhanced cooperatively by the nations of the region. I 
shall be exploring avenues of possible cooperation between our 
two countries in seeking a breakthrough to the multiple 
competing claims to the Spratlys archipelago in the <LOCATION>South China 
Sea</LOCATION>. Perhaps a joint venture in marine research of the islands 
related to ocean research, weather forecasting, and 
environmental protection, and participated by all the claimants, 
for a start of the confidence-building mechanisms that we need 
to settle these claims for our mutual benefit. [sentence as 
heard] There are other creative proposals that I intend to 
discuss with our Vietnamese neighbors. Then, there is the new 
thrust in economic cooperation which <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> has undertaken. 
Through the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> Free Trade Area or <ORGANIZATION>AFTA</ORGANIZATION>, to which a talented 
and hardworking Vietnamese people have a great deal to 
contribute. 
  I look forward to inform the leaders of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> of the 
political consolidation and economic reforms that we are 
undertaking in our country and the results these measures have 
so far achieved in our overall effort to open our economy to 
market forces and to global competition. In turn, I hope to 
learn from them the workings of their own economic renovation or 
doi moi which has made <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> one of the fastest growing 
economies in the world this past seven years. The lifting of 
the American trade embargo last month and the American 
investment it is expected to bring should both speed up the pace 
and broaden the scope of its economic growth. The increasingly 
favorable economic situation in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> should also make it 
easier for our two countries to find a durable solution for the 
problem of Vietnamese asylumseekers in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. 
  Great potentials for economic cooperation between our two 
countries are opening up. My delegation will look into 
possibilities of counter trade, investments, complimentation, 
and joint-ventures in each other's economies. We shall offer 
the Vietnamese the help of our industrialists, managers, and 
technologists in rebuilding their infrastructure and 
telecommunications systems, planning their new cities, and 
managing their tourist facilities. There should also be great 
room for collaboration between us in education, language 
training, and training of technical people. We shall be 
proposing the activation of our joint commission on trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  The business leaders in my delegation intend to identify 
with 
their Vietnamese counterparts specific products that we can 
profitably exchange in the light of the present low level trade 
between our two countries and of the prospects offered by the 
growth and diversification of our respective economies. There 
are opportunities also in agriculture and in agricultural 
research. Like our country, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is a major producer and 
exporter of agricultural products. We can operate also in 
promoting tourism, both from our neighbors and from outside the 
region. There is also much room for collaboration in science and 
technology, in education, and public health. We have much to 
learn from each other. 
  I expect to discuss these prospects with President <PERSON>Le Duc 
Anh</PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>, General Secretary Do Muoi of 
the ruling party and the country's other policymakers and its 
private sector. Finally, I look forward to visiting with a small 
but growing community of Filipino businessmen and professionals 
in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ho Chi Minh City</LOCATION>. 
  This, then is a historic visit to a very important neighbor, 
a neighbor destined to become even closer to us bilaterally and 
in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>. My dear countrymen, we leave our beloved <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> 
in a good situation and in good hands. I ask you to pray to the 
Almighty for the success of our mission and for our safe return 
two days from now. Long live the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. Thank you 
very much to all of you.

in honour of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s party <ORGANIZATION>General Secretary Do Muoi</ORGANIZATION> now on an 
official friendship visit to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>. 
  At the dinner, the Vietnamese party leader said: 
  We have had very profound impressions of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and its 
people. A few decades ago, <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> was known merely as one of 
the world's largest producers of rubber and tin. Today, it is a 
country with an advanced manufacturing industry and is striving 
to become an industrialized nation according to plan `Vision 
2020'. We are also deeply impressed by the fact that the 
economic development here has been closely linked with the 
promotion of the rich national culture in an atmosphere of 
harmony among different ethnic groups of a unified community. 
<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> has also been known for its initiatives for peace and 
cooperation among nations, especially among the regional and 
developing countries. 
  Allow us to share the pride of the people of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> in 
their great achievements in national construction and sincerely 
wish <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> prosperity and the Malaysian people happiness. We 
are firmly convinced that the industrious, dynamic and creative 
people of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, under the clear-sighted leadership of your 
excellency the Prime Minister, <PERSON>Dr. Mahathir Mohamed</PERSON>, and the 
other leaders of the national alliance, will certainly bring 
about prosperity for <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and make important contributions 
to the common prosperity of our region as well as of the whole 
of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. 
  After nearly half a century of arduous struggle to defend 
our 
national independence, sovereignty and unity, the Vietnamese 
people are now doing their best to build their fatherland, 
striving to become 'a rich people, a strong country, and an 
equitable and civilized society'. In renewing ourselves for 
that lofty goal, we have made very important achievements: 
production is up inflation repelled the people's living standard 
making one step toward improvement social situation stable and 
foreign relations ever broadened. [sentence as received] These 
achievements are providing us with the premise to bring our 
country into a new phase in which we will make a step forward in 
our industrialization and modernization. We are fully conscious 
that this is not a simple work. However, with the tradition of 
dauntlessness in struggle and industry in production, the 
Vietnamese will certainly succeed in building a prosperous 
country and a plentiful and happy life, contributing a worthy 
share to the prosperity of the whole region. 
  Our two countries are indeed close, both situated by a rich 
and beautiful sea.Our two peoples share many similarities in 
culture and history and a past of being colonized by foreign 
powers and having struggled undauntedly and persistently for 
national independence. Today, we also share the aspiration for 
peace and cooperation and the strive toward development and 
prosperity, and toward peace and stability in the region. These 
are the solid foundations for our friendship and long-term 
cooperation in the interest of the prosperity of each country, 
and of cooperation and development in <LOCATION>South East Asia</LOCATION>. We note 
with satisfaction that owing to the efforts by both sides over 
the past few years, we have forged a bilateral relationship full 
of fraternity and mutual understanding and trust. 
  Our many-sided cooperation has also developed quickly and 
favourably. We are sure that this trend will now continue to 
grow fruitfully for the benefit of both countries. A new proof 
is the exchange of views full of openness, friendship and mutual 
understanding that we have had with your excellency the prime 
minister and other leaders of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> VNA <DATE>May 9</DATE> - 'One enemy is too many, a hundred 
friends are too few.' Such is the Vietnamese saying which is 
often quoted these days by mouth and in deed by the Vietnamese 
leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are 
the visits to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> by President <PERSON>Le Duc Anh</PERSON>, to 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> by Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly Nong Duc Manh</ORGANIZATION>, the 
visits to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> by dignitaries from the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>, and the constant influx of foreign business people who 
visit to probe the market opportunities in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. American 
businesses even held an exhibition in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> to advertize their 
industrial and consumer goods. 
  In the 50 days from <DATE>March Vietnam</DATE> hosted over 50 foreign 
delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of 
business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents 
of <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, the prime ministers of 
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the deputy prime 
minister of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, and HRH Princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> and minister of state 
for external relations of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>. During the same period, 
General Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Do Muoi 
visited <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials 
visited countries in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. In the coming days, 
President Le <PERSON>Duc Anh</PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and Deputy 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Tran Duc Luong</PERSON> are expected to visit various 
countries and regions in the world. 
  On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their 
guests and hosts that '<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> wants to be friend all the 
countries in the world', that '<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is trying to build a 
law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an 
equitable and civilised society', and that '<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> pursues an 
open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and 
multilateralise its international relations'. 
  These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have 
fought 
through four decades of war to defend and build their country. 
They are also in line with the current trend of the world. 
  In fact, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has been moving along these lines since the 
beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of 
the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements, 
including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the 
people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country, 
the world is seeing <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8, 
which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years, 
export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850 
joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total 
prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion <ORGANIZATION>USD</ORGANIZATION>. Visiting these 
joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German, 
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages. 
  The world also sees an increased presence of American 
businesses in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. The lifting of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> embargo against 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has finally driven home to many Americans that they have 
come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that 
American economic interests in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> are already, really 
sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON>Le Mai</PERSON> told this writer that 
when the remaining few consular matters are settled, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and 
the <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> will open representative offices at each other's capital. 
  When that comes, it will be yet more proof of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
successes in its renewal cause which has helped <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> improve 
its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and 
international institutions and organisations.
