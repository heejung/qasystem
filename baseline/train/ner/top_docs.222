<LEADPARA>  THERE seem to be two schools of thought, neither of which is very large, about
this new photo at the top of my column. Some people tell me they love it.
Others say it makes me look old, because I must be bald if I'm wearing a hat.
Well, I still have my hair, but I am old.;    Meanwhile, there have been
letters on other, more interesting topics:  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Lee Quarnstrom's columns appear on Mondays.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Mr. Lee Quarnstrom</PERSON>, I resent your ignorant view you have of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz
County</LOCATION> . . .;    <PERSON>Dennis Campi</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>;    Thanks for sharing, <LOCATION>Dennis.</LOCATION>; We
appreciate the fact that you included our store in your feature article on
shopping in our part of the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Mall</LOCATION>. We have no doubts that your
intentions were good, and that you thought that by describing <PERSON>Anubis Warpus</PERSON> as
a "punk" store, you were helping our business . . . We are writing to you
because we feel that you misrepresented the true character of our store . . .
The store has much more to offer, and "punks" constitute a negligible portion
of our clientele . . . Your article has stirred some negative emotions toward
us, since the word "punk" tends to have negative associations, especially
among people who are older and more conservative than ourselves and people who
shop at Anubis.;    Anubis Warpus; <PERSON>Jacek Lentz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brian Friedman</PERSON>,; owners;
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>;  You note in your letter that you sell <PERSON>Dr. Martens</PERSON> shoes, those
favored by punks. I guess I could say, if the shoe fits, wear it. But, since
I'm basically a nice guy, let me merely say that your inventory, which
includes black leather clothing, material on tattooing, lava lamps, etc.,
looks dandy, and I'm sure you're correct when you say that your customers
include grandmothers, students and "young people in general with a taste
somewhat out of the ordinary." Let me also say that what you consider
"somewhat out of the ordinary" seems to this "older and more conservative"
<PERSON>Santa Cruzan</PERSON> to be rather banal. Anyway, best of luck. Meanwhile, let's try to
call it "the Avenue" instead of the Mall.; YOUR column indicates that you have
accepted the <ORGANIZATION>Warren Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s canard that <PERSON>Lee Harvey Oswald</PERSON> murdered <PERSON>John
Kennedy</PERSON> from the sixth floor of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> School Book Depository . . .;   
<PERSON>Iain Prentice</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>;    If you'd have been a newspaper reporter for as
long as I have, you, too, might have serious doubts not only about the ability
of the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military, whom you say you suspect, to pull off such a
conspiracy, but also to keep everyone involved from blabbing during the past
27-plus years. Also, frankly, more than a quarter-century later, I don't
really care anymore who killed JFK. The man is dead, and a lot of good-headed,
good-hearted political concepts died with him.; THE statement that
"<LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> is on the brink of disaster" is totally inaccurate and
reprehensible. This city has made great strides in recovery . . . from the
earthquake and agricultural setbacks.;    <PERSON>Anne Lucero</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>;    There
has been a lot of construction on Main Street compared to what's been going on
in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. But I still believe that <ORGANIZATION>Green Giant</ORGANIZATION>'s pullout to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>,
coupled with the need for much more rebuilding, present some grave problems
for your town -- where, by the way, I worked for nine years and still visit
frequently.; Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for making my day. No, my
month . . . with your article about bees. I have not laughed so hard for so
long . . . You are truly funny.;    <PERSON>Janice Marklein</PERSON>; <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;  I'm passing
your kind remarks along to my editor.; Are you still writing a column? Here is
a self-addressed, stamped envelope.;    Dad;    It's in the mail.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  WHILE MANY of their compatriots up the street have yet to return to buildings
that have yet to be rebuilt, the merchants of one stretch at the south end of
Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz seem to be flourishing.;    The men and women
whose businesses sit in the block between Maple and Laurel streets are
exhibiting a vigor and vitality that should be an inspiration to the rest of
us in Surf City, particularly the sorry nitpickers who are passing the time
fretting about how many feet apart the trees should be when the avenue is
rebuilt.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     People like <PERSON>Ken Stocks</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Retrospect Records</ORGANIZATION> fills the space where
<PERSON>Lott</PERSON>'s auto stereo shop sat for decades, have made that one-block stretch of
Pacific a delightful place to hang around. Not only do these business folks
operate some interesting and unique shops, but they also have banded together
to keep their block free of the bums whose besotted presences lurk in some
other parts of town like a bad smell that won't go away.;    Let's take a look
at some of the businesses along the southerly end of <LOCATION>Pacific Avenue</LOCATION>:;   
STOCKS' SHOP features old and rare recordings as well as old posters from the
days of psychedelic rock 'n' roll at the Fillmore, the Avalon and <LOCATION>Winterland</LOCATION>
up in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. Anybody my age -- except Republicans -- will have
something approaching a flashback when they see the old posters touting
appearances by <ORGANIZATION>Big Brother</ORGANIZATION> and the Holding Company, the <ORGANIZATION>Quicksilver Messenger
Service</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Airplane</ORGANIZATION>, the Grateful Dead, the Siegel-Schwall Blues Band,
the Charlatans, the <ORGANIZATION>Paul Butterfield Blues Band</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>James Cotton</PERSON>, Moby Grape and
even the Peanut Butter Conspiracy.;    Nearby are places like <PERSON>Zachary</PERSON>'s, which
serves the best breakfast in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, bar none; <LOCATION>Tampico Kitchen</LOCATION>, which puts
a tasty <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> black-bean spin on some of its entrees; Haber's, the
classiest furniture store in the county; and <LOCATION>Cognito</LOCATION>, where I look for
Hawaiian shirts whenever I have a couple of bucks to waste.;    New on the
block is Anubis Warpus, which seems to be a supply depot for punks -- a place
where punks can buy the outfits they need in order to hang out up the street,
near the Metro transit center. (You might think that punk, like disco, is long
dead. Not in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>!);    There are other shops as well -- like <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz
Glass Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>PIP</ORGANIZATION> instant printing, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>'s Barber Shop, like Cotton Tales, for
kids' stuff, <ORGANIZATION>Beat City Records</ORGANIZATION>, for music mostly by bands I can't stand, the
<ORGANIZATION>Free Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, a used-clothing emporium, Gateways, a New Age, spiritual book
outlet -- and they're worth a visit.;    ONE NICE thing about this south end
of <LOCATION>Pacific Avenue</LOCATION> is that the merchants have taken steps to make their
neighborhood attractive by getting the bums out. They've agreed to call the
cops every time they see any illegal activity -- such as panhandling -- and
they're very happy with the response of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Police Department</ORGANIZATION>.
They've written judges asking that winos and crooks who used to frequent the
area be ordered to stay away from <LOCATION>Pacific Avenue.</LOCATION>;    The result is a
surprisingly bum-free business district, at least for that one end of the main
street.;    "It is hard to keep it hip and artsy and keep out the bad element
at the same time," admits <PERSON>Ken Stocks</PERSON>. "But we're doing it.";    The area
between <ORGANIZATION>Laurel</ORGANIZATION> and, say, the Catalyst has become the bohemian (or hip or chic
or cool or whatever you want to call it) district in a town noted for being a
lot less-than-traditional.;    "Look out there," Stocks, 44, said the other
day, waving his arm at the street outside the shop he's operated for a year.
"It looks like a healthy old town out there.;    "Business is getting better
and better. The stores here are interesting, really interesting.;    "Get the
word out. Let the people know. Tell 'em to come on down."  </TEXT>

FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: Semi-comic King Kong takes powerful grip - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is as though an ancient Greek tragedian has completed his trilogy and is
turning his hand to lighter things. <PERSON>Harrison Birtwistle</PERSON>, who dealt so
massively with myth and ritual in The Mask of Orpheus and <PERSON>Gawain</PERSON>, has
returned to cast a wry backward glance over similar material for his new
semi-comic opera.
A year ago it looked as if The Second <PERSON>Mrs Kong</PERSON> might not reach the stage as
intended. The Arts Council had singled out <ORGANIZATION>Glyndebourne Touring Opera</ORGANIZATION> to
lose its subsidy, but after much argument the company won a reprieve - an
outcome which is starting to look as much of a ritual as anything in
<LOCATION>Birtwistle</LOCATION>'s operas. This autumn's GTO tour includes revivals of Yevgeny
Onegin and Il barbiere di <LOCATION>Siviglia</LOCATION>, with this <PERSON>Birtwistle</PERSON> premiere in pride
of place.
The idea of <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION> came from the opera's librettist, <PERSON>Russell Hoban</PERSON>. He
had always loved the film and found that the composer had, too. As a
scenario, they envisaged souls meeting in the world of shadows, each
choosing characters according to his own partiality. Hoban was obsessed by
<ORGANIZATION>Vermeer</ORGANIZATION>'s 'Girl with a <ORGANIZATION>Pearl Earring</ORGANIZATION>'. <PERSON>Birtwistle</PERSON> - true to form - wanted
Orpheus and <ORGANIZATION>Eurydice</ORGANIZATION>. Goebbels was going to put in an appearance at one
point, but then they decided against it. Other sundry dead souls include a
Texan film producer and an Indian spiritualist.
There is no logic to the story. Characters from different times and places
are thrown together, merely because their creators want to amuse themselves
seeing what might happen. The girl with the pearl earring from <ORGANIZATION>Vermeer</ORGANIZATION>'s
portrait is soon reclining in a 21st-century living-room, zapping the
channels on her wall-sized television, watching repeats of old films like
Brief Encounter, a British Rail documentary and - yes - <LOCATION>King Kong</LOCATION>.
At first it seems that <PERSON>Birtwistle</PERSON>, tongue-in-cheek, is going to parody
himself. (The scene of the shooting, repeated over and over, satirizes the
ritualistic repetitions of The Mask of Orpheus.) Then the tone falters.
Dense mists of sound build up in the orchestra, submerging any sharpness of
mind and obscuring the words, despite the authoritative presence of <ORGANIZATION>Elgar
Howarth</ORGANIZATION> in the pit. A scene involving a computer search for <ORGANIZATION>King Kong</ORGANIZATION> is
overlong and woefully heavy-handed. A fight scene sinks to the weakest
knockabout humour.
By the interval it looks as though the opera is lost, but come the second
act, composer and librettist unexpectedly nail the right style - mythic
pretension played up one moment, brought down to earth with a comic bump the
next. Setting out in search of the girl with the pearl, <LOCATION>Kong</LOCATION> and Orpheus
encounter first a sphinx with a sharp ear for one-liners and then a
character called the <ORGANIZATION>Death of Kong</ORGANIZATION>, leading to a superhuman struggle of
ideas where the issues slug it out on stage. All this is more entertaining.
It helps, crucially, that now the words can be heard. <PERSON>Philip Langridge</PERSON> is
clarity itself as <LOCATION>Kong</LOCATION>, a bizarre addition to his gallery of operatic
portrayals. <PERSON>Nuala Willis</PERSON> is amusingly dead-pan as the Sphinx. <PERSON>Michael Chance</PERSON>
sings beautifully as the counter-tenor Orpheus, especially after he has been
beheaded (shades of Gawain). <ORGANIZATION>Helen Field</ORGANIZATION> reaches tirelessly for the top
notes as <ORGANIZATION>Vermeer's Pearl</ORGANIZATION>. Among some magical sights in <PERSON>Tom Cairns</PERSON>'
production are two haunting scenes in which Anubis rows the souls back and
forth across the waters of the underworld.
Above all, the music finds its sense of direction in the second act.
Birtwistle shapes the act in a single arc, starting Ring-like from a few
ideas swirling in deep soundwaves, through the comedy of the central scenes,
to a peroration of primeval power underpinning what I take to be the opera's
serious message: that ideas live on, even though people may die. Like so
many new operas, it asks to be seen half a dozen times, but its very
complexity means it is unlikely to get the chance. That is the tragic irony
of the modern opera composer.

<LOCATION>Glyndebourne</LOCATION> until <DATE>October 29</DATE>, then on tour to <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Plymouth</LOCATION>,

FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: A motley cast for 'Aida' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a motley crew for <ORGANIZATION>Verdi</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Aida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, motlier than I can
remember seeing at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Opera</ORGANIZATION> - and that was just the audience, who ran
from American neglige (greying T-shirts, busted chinos) to bold chic
imported from deeply foreign countries. It was a nice touch for the RO to
have imported another motley new cast, unable to communicate with one
another nor even, apparently, with the conductor <PERSON>Edward Downes</PERSON>. I have to
report that by the end, most of the audience were vociferously delighted.
'New cast' is too simple, because the singers successively contracted for
this Aida - <PERSON>Elijah Moshinsky</PERSON>'s new production - have been dropping like
flies. Somebody at the <ORGANIZATION>RO</ORGANIZATION> has had to spend desperate hours on international
phone-lines. <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s Radames, the Icelander <PERSON>Kristjan Johannsson</PERSON> (new to
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>), was flown in on the afternoon of the performance: it was no wonder
that he and his Aida seemed never to have been properly introduced.
Of the ex-Soviet singers - not including the Amonasro of <PERSON>Gregory Yurisich</PERSON>,
who is Australian - <PERSON>Nina Rautio</PERSON>'s Aida sang in even less intelligible
Italian than <PERSON>Paata Burchuladze</PERSON>'s High Priest. Burchuladze, however, lent
imposing power and presence to his faceless role; <PERSON>Miss Rautio</PERSON>, musically
quite effective, kept herself glumly to herself, and her acting to raising
one or both arms heavenward at high notes. It was amusing to watch <PERSON>Dolora
Zajick</PERSON>'s Amneris (a daunting Midwestern hostess), Yurisich's wild <LOCATION>Amonasro</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Johannsson</PERSON>'s stiff, upstanding Radames trying in turn to get some
dramatic response from her, all in vain.
The <PERSON>Zajick</PERSON> mezzo has too sharp an edge for the crucial Act 2 scene with Aida
 -which I have not seen more crudely played: where was <PERSON>Moshinsky</PERSON>?  - but
came into its own with the Act 4 showdown. <PERSON>Johannsson</PERSON>'s Italian-schooled
tenor has bright metal and force (he must be a stirring Manrico in
Trovatore), but not much grace. '<ORGANIZATION>Celeste Aida</ORGANIZATION>' was brittle, and he kept
rushing his fences - again and again <PERSON>Downes</PERSON> made considerate room for him to
breathe in, but he refused to take it.
Otherwise, <PERSON>Downes</PERSON> himself sounded un-tender with the score, though of course
efficient: grand, noisy ensembles, but no magic in the quieter music. As
usual <PERSON>Moshinsky</PERSON> has built a clean, thrifty production, designed to last; I
thought that recycling <PERSON>Michael Yeargan</PERSON>'s Nile act set, with its tall array
of Anubis-heads, for the Act 4 trial looked too much like parsimony. And why
Aida and her father should belong to a genetically deviant tribe of
Ethiopians (none of them was remotely black) remained a mystery: could this
be a perverse example of pc?
In repertory with a variety of singers until <DATE>July 22</DATE>

A ONE-SIDED 'PROMETHEUS' RANTS AT HIGHWAYS

<P>
When <PERSON>Keith Antar Mason</PERSON> chose the infamous "wilding" incident that occured last 
year in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION> as the basis for a performance piece, he must 
have realized what he was up against. 
</P>
<P>
How could anyone of any race summon up a shred of sympathy for the pack of 
black youths accused of raping and nearly beating to death a white woman 
jogger? 
</P>
<P>
And yet "Prometheus on a Black Landscape: The Core," which opened <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at 
Highways in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, is full of whining and ranting about the history of 
black oppression and the frantic needs of the black libido -- carryings on 
that, at the very least, make a mockery of black men who have not found it 
necessary or amusing to deprive others of their liberty. 
</P>
<P>
The attack itself is suitably horrific, with the five insolent, swaggering 
<ORGANIZATION>Ashanti Bloods</ORGANIZATION> closing in on the jogger (<PERSON>Erika Schickel</PERSON>), "beating" her and 
carrying her away as she screams in all-too-real terror and pain. 
</P>
<P>
But she remains a kind of cartoon figure, reappearing later to sob and droop in 
her downstage corner, comforted by her "spiritual" counterpart, <PERSON>Raina Paris</PERSON>, a 
shriekingly protective good-fairy figure in a blue tulle skirt. We never get to 
know her as a person, and the sole reference to her investment banking career 
-- "Tomorrow I was gonna make a kill" -- is shrilly stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
As the woodenly paced, two-hour piece lumbers along, the Bloods sometimes hang 
out in front of the stage, staring down members of the audience, or laughing in 
a witless, evil way at occurences on stage. They get to do most of the moving 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Garbed in woolly loincloths, they crumble into doubled-over postures to 
illustrate how they are "the broken people," Outfitted in color-dappled 
jumpsuits, they form a genial chorus line. In slacks and shirts, they prowl 
with scuffing, sliding movements of their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Crank (<PERSON>Daryl A. Swann</PERSON>), one of the alleged attackers in this version, 
languishes in jail, where he is visited by various folk from his past and 
future. They include his impotently God-fearing father, a chic black woman 
(<PERSON>Alretha Rakel</PERSON>) who falls in love with him, urges him to greater things and 
ultimately gives him up, and Omo/Exu (<PERSON>Lynell Gardner</PERSON>), a wiry, hyperactive 
doomsayer whose body is painted with white letters. 
</P>
<P>
Wafting through the piece for no observable rhyme or reason are figures from 
Greek mythology and Western history. A black Medusa (<PERSON>Meri Danquah</PERSON>) does a 
perfunctory, pelvic-thrusting dance; another Medusa (poet <PERSON>Wanda Coleman</PERSON>) 
recites on a videotape. A white Perseus (<PERSON>Bruce Sanborn</PERSON>) is embarrassed about 
the size of his sexual organ and stabs himself in the foot with his cardboard 
sword. Crank's free-form trial at the end offers the opportunity for cameo 
testimony by <ORGANIZATION>Joan of Arc</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Curtis York</PERSON> cutting a sweet, serpentine figure), an 
impossibly affected <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Woolf</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Roxanne Beckford</PERSON>), <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Angela Davis</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Other personages are apparently <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION>'s own creations: KaKro (<PERSON>Brian Foster</PERSON>), an 
orotund, justice-meting vulture in a pearl collar and feathers and <PERSON>Drumrock</PERSON> 
(<PERSON>Keith Coleman</PERSON>), a leering, prancing, purple-headdressed spinoff of the 
Egyptian god Anubis. 
</P>
<P>
But the meeting of camp and rage in the piece not only evades the central issue 
of responsibility for crime; it also makes for bad theater in which too much is 
regurgitated and too little is experienced afresh. 
</P>
<P>
"Prometheus" will be repeated tonight and <DATE>March 1-4</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1972</DATE>, <PERSON>Shirley Strum</PERSON> found herself alone with
a troop of baboons among the spare, scattered acacia trees on the
plains of <LOCATION>East Africa</LOCATION>, a jacket knotted around her waist and a
clipboard in her hand.
   A graduate student in anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Strum</PERSON> had been dispatched to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to observe
the baboons. She knew little about them. And she knew less about
survival in the African wilderness.
   ``It was only total ignorance of what I was getting into that
gave me the courage to go,'' she said recently in an interview.
   Strum was supposed to stay in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> for 18 months, just long
enough to collect the data she would need to write a Ph.D. thesis.
Instead, she made <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> her home.
   By <DATE>1976</DATE>, her studies had grown into the <ORGANIZATION>Gilgil Baboon Project</ORGANIZATION>.
She now employs six full-time researchers.
   Strum has written a lively, personal account of the project in
``Almost Human'' (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>). She was in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
promote the book, which synthesizes the ideas she has developed
during 15,000 hours of watching baboons in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> during the past 15
years.
   In ``Almost Human,'' she compares the behavior of the olive
baboon, Papio anubis, to the behavior of <PERSON>Homo</PERSON> sapiens. Her studies,
vividly recounted in the book, challenge the accepted wisdom that
baboons are brute, aggressive beasts. In so doing, the studies have
changed her thinking about human nature.
   ``If baboons were aggressive, then the killer ape was where we
started from,'' she said. Early baboon studies formed part of the
underpinning for the idea widely popularized in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> by the
writer <PERSON>Robert Ardrey</PERSON> that a ``killer ape'' lurks inside each of us.
Humans are fundamentally aggressive, <PERSON>Ardrey</PERSON> wrote in ``African
Genesis,'' and nothing we do can change that; we can only control
it.
   That is not what <PERSON>Strum</PERSON> found, however. She draws an engaging
picture of baboons as sophisticated creatures who prefer
negotiation and persuasion to aggression.
   The old picture was of a society in which males held all power
and used force to attain dominance. Strum found that males were
transients and that they did not arrange themselves in a hierarchy
with dominant males on top. She found that females were the stable
core of baboon troops, and were ranked in a dominance hierarchy.
Females _ not males _ were the linchpins of baboon society.
   They did not, however, exert their dominance over the males.
``It turns out to be a society where there is a complementarity of
roles,'' <PERSON>Strum</PERSON> said. ``Even if you have dominance and aggression in
the traditional sense, it doesn't explain everything.''
   No one suggests that the hominids, or human-like creatures, that
gave rise to humans resembled baboons. But, said <PERSON>Strum</PERSON>, if baboons
had developed to the point where they no longer relied on naked
aggression, then humanity's early ancestors probably did too.
   ``It's impossible for me to believe that the early hominids were
less sophisticated than baboons,'' she said. Thus our early
ancestors may have abandoned aggressive social practices long ago.
   Strum grew up in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, and she had no plans to become an
anthropologist when she left home in <DATE>1965</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>. But the turmoil of those years in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> made a mark
on her.
   ``As I lived through the Free Speech movement and the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>

<NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 4-6</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1972</DATE>, <PERSON>Shirley Strum</PERSON> found herself alone with
a troop of baboons among the spare, scattered acacia trees on the
plains of <LOCATION>East Africa</LOCATION>, a jacket knotted around her waist and a
clipboard in her hand.
   A graduate student in anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Strum</PERSON> had been dispatched to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> to observe
the baboons. She knew little about them. And she knew less about
survival in the African wilderness.
   ``It was only total ignorance of what I was getting into that
gave me the courage to go,'' she said recently in an interview.
   Strum was supposed to stay in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> for 18 months, just long
enough to collect the data she would need to write a Ph.D. thesis.
Instead, she made <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> her home.
   By <DATE>1976</DATE>, her studies had grown into the <ORGANIZATION>Gilgil Baboon Project</ORGANIZATION>.
She now employs six full-time researchers.
   Strum has written a lively, personal account of the project in
``Almost Human'' (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>). She was in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
promote the book, which synthesizes the ideas she has developed
during 15,000 hours of watching baboons in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> during the past 15
years.
   In ``Almost Human,'' she compares the behavior of the olive
baboon, Papio anubis, to the behavior of <PERSON>Homo</PERSON> sapiens. Her studies,
vividly recounted in the book, challenge the accepted wisdom that
baboons are brute, aggressive beasts. In so doing, the studies have
changed her thinking about human nature.
   ``If baboons were aggressive, then the killer ape was where we
started from,'' she said. Early baboon studies formed part of the
underpinning for the idea widely popularized in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> by the
writer <PERSON>Robert Ardrey</PERSON> that a ``killer ape'' lurks inside each of us.
Humans are fundamentally aggressive, <PERSON>Ardrey</PERSON> wrote in ``African
Genesis,'' and nothing we do can change that; we can only control
it.
   That is not what <PERSON>Strum</PERSON> found, however. She draws an engaging
picture of baboons as sophisticated creatures who prefer
negotiation and persuasion to aggression.
   The old picture was of a society in which males held all power
and used force to attain dominance. Strum found that males were
transients and that they did not arrange themselves in a hierarchy
with dominant males on top. She found that females were the stable
core of baboon troops, and were ranked in a dominance hierarchy.
Females _ not males _ were the linchpins of baboon society.
   They did not, however, exert their dominance over the males.
``It turns out to be a society where there is a complementarity of
roles,'' <PERSON>Strum</PERSON> said. ``Even if you have dominance and aggression in
the traditional sense, it doesn't explain everything.''
   No one suggests that the hominids, or human-like creatures, that
gave rise to humans resembled baboons. But, said <PERSON>Strum</PERSON>, if baboons
had developed to the point where they no longer relied on naked
aggression, then humanity's early ancestors probably did too.
   ``It's impossible for me to believe that the early hominids were
less sophisticated than baboons,'' she said. Thus our early
ancestors may have abandoned aggressive social practices long ago.
   Strum grew up in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, and she had no plans to become an
anthropologist when she left home in <DATE>1965</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>. But the turmoil of those years in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> made a mark
on her.
   ``As I lived through the Free Speech movement and the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
War protests, I found myself confronting, over and over, questions
about human nature, about what was innate and impossible to modify
and what was flexible and worth changing,'' she writes.
   She drifted in and out of the psychology and sociology
departments before fixing on anthropology. She fell under the spell
of <PERSON>Sherwood Washburn</PERSON>, a leading American anthropologist who had
done some of the first observations of baboons in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and

<DESCRIPT>  HOLIDAY; ENTERTAINMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WE KNOW The Question. It is deceptively simple. And it has dogged us ever
since that first time we got to stay up late and watch from the top of the
stairs as Mom and Dad donned silly hats, blew cardboard horns and indulged in
other mysteriously un-grown-up behavior. Every year, without fail -- somewhere
between the first flying champagne cork of New Year's Eve and the last fizzing
Alka Seltzer of the Tournament of Roses Hangover -- we ask ourselves: "Why do
we do this?";   We do it because after all these years music, dancing,
champagne and people we love are still four of the very best things in life.  </LEADPARA>

merry seems like a slothful, downright cowardly  way to greet a new year full
of possibilities.;   We do it because we want -- and deserve -- to be
unshackled from yesterday's business. Shredding the calendar. Cleaning the
slate. End-ing the inning. Initiating a karma download. Closure, by whatever
name, is a comfort and a joy.;   Goodbye, <LOCATION>Gorby</LOCATION>. So long, <PERSON>Bill Graham</PERSON>. Happy
trails, <PERSON>Johnny Carson</PERSON>. That's a wrap, <PERSON>Willie Smith</PERSON>. Don't slam the door on

989-1855.;  FARTHER AFIELD;    <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Bowl Summer Festival</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>July 3-Sept</DATE>.
21. This <DATE>summer</DATE> ritual with amplification and 15,000 folks a night is famous.
The <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION> holds forth, with everyone from <PERSON>Simon Rattle</PERSON> to <PERSON>Henry
Mancini</PERSON>, <PERSON>Itzhak Perlman</PERSON> to Miles <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>. New this year is the conductor that
the San Jose Symphony almost snagged, <PERSON>John Mauceri</PERSON>, as director of the new
<ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Bowl Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. (213) 850-2000.;    <ORGANIZATION>Bear Valley Festival</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>July

years of hiatus, <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> gamely cranked up again its mighty <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> "Ring"
tetralogy, more than 16 hours of myth and man -- and super-women, too --
sprawling over four days, with casts not on a plane with what <LOCATION>San Franciscans</LOCATION>
are used to. But <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> has discontinued its every-five-years "Ring"
sequence, thus <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>'s "Ring" wins the Western states by default. Using the
<DATE>1986</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Robert Israel</ORGANIZATION> production, it features stage director <PERSON>Francois Rochaix</PERSON>,
conductor <PERSON>Hermann Michael</PERSON>. (206) 443-4711.;    <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>) Chamber Music
Festival, <DATE>July 7-Aug</DATE>. 19. This year the multitude of programs highlight

the spice of <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s first opera, "<PERSON>Bastien</PERSON> and Bastienne" (<DATE>July 11</DATE>, 13).

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; CLUB  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A COUPLE months back, there was a story about a brick that clung precariously
to the wreckage of the Trust Building in Santa Cruz for 710 days after the
Loma Prieta quake. By the time it finally surrendered to the law of gravity,
it had come to symbolize the city's hang-tough attitude after the quake. It
was, as E.B. White would have put it, some brick.;   I was thinking about that
brick last Friday night as Iron John and I drove through the pounding rain
down to Marsugi's. Like the brick, the scrappy little San Jose rock joint is
hanging tough against all odds. And like the brick, its impending fall has
been falsely rumored for months.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MARSUGI'S GROWS OLD WITH THE OLD GUARD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  CLUBS  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     At 10:30, even with the rain, the corner of <LOCATION>South First</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>
was alive with knots of freshly minted <ORGANIZATION>San Jose State</ORGANIZATION> students,
post-collegiate club kids and the apres-cinema crowd from up the block at
Camera One. "They never had any of this when I went to <LOCATION>San Jose State</LOCATION>," said
<PERSON>Iron John</PERSON>, taking it all in. "If you wanted rock 'n' roll, you went to the
Spartan Pub or you got nuthin' . . .";   Back in the bad old days before
redevelopment, "human cesspool" would not have been too strong a term to
describe the night scene at <ORGANIZATION>First</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>. The local color consisted
of junkies, pimps, hookers, johns and winos. Today, two of the old porn
palaces are rock clubs -- F/X and the <ORGANIZATION>Cactus Club</ORGANIZATION> -- anchoring the southeast
and southwest corners. To the northeast, halfway up the block, there's the
artsy new <ORGANIZATION>Ajax Lounge</ORGANIZATION>. And holding down the last corner, <ORGANIZATION>Marsugi</ORGANIZATION>'s -- the
weakest sibling in the rock 'n' roll family.;   It's conceivable that some
bionic bon vivant could rock around the block in one night -- hard rock at the
Cactus, hip-hop and house at F/X, hard-bop jazz at <ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> and home-brewed rock
at <ORGANIZATION>Marsugi's</ORGANIZATION>. But Iron <PERSON>John</PERSON> and I were feeling the weight of our years and we
decided to take it easy. So we hit only three.;   Life was tough back in '85
when Ed Sugitan leased the notorious Three-Star bar, told the nymphs du pave
to hit the road and rechristened the club <ORGANIZATION>Marsugi's</ORGANIZATION>. And it's still tough --
now that three competitors are breathing down his neck. But <PERSON>Sugitan</PERSON> said he
plans to stay at least a year longer.;   His plain-as-dirt operation could
make Oliver Twist's workhouse seem like <ORGANIZATION>Club Med</ORGANIZATION>. The interior of the
77-year-old red-brick building is little more than a shoe box. There are some
dead-dog ugly amateur paintings (the real art is the graffiti in the
restrooms), a few dusty beer signs -- and not much else.;   On the little
stage, hard by the front windows, the <ORGANIZATION>Delinquent Johns</ORGANIZATION>, a fast-and-tight
alternative-rock quartet, were going through the motions in front of about 40
college-age customers.;   <ORGANIZATION>Marsugi</ORGANIZATION>'s is home to the remnants of the loose-knit
tribe of alternative-rockers who used to haunt the Laundry Works and <ORGANIZATION>Muzzie's</ORGANIZATION>.
Those clubs are long gone and the local scene that once burned bright is now
hopelessly fragmented. But all the old suspects -- the rockabilly cats, skate
punks, bikers and college-radio types -- still turn up at <ORGANIZATION>Marsugi</ORGANIZATION>'s on a
regular basis. The club has the highest black-T-shirt-and-black-leather
quotient of any club downtown. My kind of folks.;   It's been <DATE>five years this
week</DATE> since I started writing about this tribe. And after a thousand long
nights looking for that elusive flash of rock 'n' roll glory, many of them are
nearing the end of the chase. <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, in between the hugs and the gossip
and the glad-handing, talk turned to marriages and houses and kids.;   The
Frontier Wives, the oldest of the old guard, went on at 11:30. When they
slammed into the opening chords of "Elvis Was A Spy," eight people began to
dance loosely around the front of the little stage. And when they rolled
through the goofy rave-up "<PERSON>Louie Pasteur</PERSON>," there were 20 people bouncing
around. Beers were spilled. Chairs were knocked over. Good times rolled. At
the end, it sounded as if 100 ragged voices were singing the chorus to "Ace
Frehley.";   "I get the feeling these people had heard it all before," <PERSON>John
said.</PERSON>;   "Yeah," I replied. "It's a tribal thing."; <ORGANIZATION>Marsugi</ORGANIZATION>'s; 399 <ORGANIZATION>S. First
St.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>; Admission: <MONEY>$3</MONEY>-<MONEY>$5</MONEY>; Details: Live music, <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>

HERE ARE SOME CHOICE CUTS: FROM OPERA'S BAIT, SWITCH TO DEADHEAD TRAFFIC JAMS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, unlike <DATE>last year</DATE>, we didn't hear any <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> city officials 
decrying Shakespeare as "too high-brow" for the citizenry. But that doesn't 
mean that <DATE>1989</DATE> hasn't supplied plenty of material for the annual <ORGANIZATION>Turkey Awards</ORGANIZATION>, 
which we hand out for the lapses in taste, bad calls and downright 
air-headedness that too often have made us want to reach for the ax. 
</P>
<P>
So with a drum(stick) roll -- let the Turkeys begin! 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost to local arts groups that try to sell tickets based on hype, 
rather than performance. Here's a sample from one of the ads touting <LOCATION>New York 
City Opera</LOCATION>'s appearance earlier this year at the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Performing Arts 
Center</ORGANIZATION>: "Treachery and murder. Mystery and magic. Passion and love. Delightful 
tales and sinister plots abound. . . . This magnificent week of soaring music, 
masterful song and opulent settings is destined to be one of the most exciting 
and memorable events of <DATE>1989</DATE>!" I'm sure it was, though I really can't remember 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
An award to organizations that sell one thing, then deliver another -- the arts 
world version of bait and switch. Opera Pacific was a prime example. When 
tickets were put on sale last <DATE>February</DATE> for its 1989-90 production of <ORGANIZATION>Puccini</ORGANIZATION>'s 
"Turandot," only the name of tenor <PERSON>Lando Bartolini</PERSON> was in the ads, leading any 
reasonable person to assume that if you bought a ticket, you'd be hearing 
<PERSON>Bartolini</PERSON> in the lead role as <PERSON>Calaf</PERSON>. But just <DATE>last week</DATE>, the company slipped 
out a press release announcing that in three of the six performances, <PERSON>Calaf</PERSON> 
will be sung by one <PERSON>Giorgio Tieppo</PERSON>, who is an unknown even to opera experts, 
much less to the average opera-goer. Worse, the release referred to <ORGANIZATION>Tieppo</ORGANIZATION>'s 
"New York Metropolitan debut," implying an association with the Metropolitan 
Opera in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (whose officials had never heard of Tieppo) instead of 
calling it his "<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metropolitan-area debut" -- at <LOCATION>Long Island University</LOCATION>, 
which, come to think of it, isn't technically the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> metropolitan area, 
either. The release was unequivocally misleading, if not deceitful. In 
response, <ORGANIZATION>Opera Pacific</ORGANIZATION> general director <PERSON>David DiChiera</PERSON> explained that he had 
"always intended on double-casting" the role. Too bad he hadn't "always" let 
ticket-buyers in on the secret. 
</P>
<P>
To numerous local rock clubs that continue to enforce the abominable "pay to 
play" policy, in which struggling bands buy a predetermined number of tickets, 
or fork out cash outright for the privilege of getting exposure. 
</P>
<P>
To the producers of "Elvis: A Musical Celebration," not so much a "celebration" 
as a theatrical grave-robbing of the late King of Rock 'n' Roll's legacy. If 
Elvis were alive and saw this show, which played the Center in <DATE>March</DATE>, he might 
wish he were dead. 
</P>
<P>
To <ORGANIZATION>Cypress College</ORGANIZATION> administrators who deleted a photo of an artwork by <PERSON>Rafael 
Serrano</PERSON> at the last minute from a flyer announcing the show because it used 
phallic symbols as part of its anti-war imagery. 
</P>
<P>
To the Deadheads who show up for Grateful Dead concerts at <ORGANIZATION>Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre</ORGANIZATION> without tickets and clog traffic, parking lots and surrounding 
strawberry fields, seemingly forever. Another helping to city officials who 
think the answer is banning the band, instead of the offending ticket-less 
fans, from <LOCATION>Irvine Meadows</LOCATION> in the future. 
</P>
<P>
To Music Plus, the first major <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> record chain to drop vinyl LPs 
completely from its stores. It, and others who have followed in treating vinyl 
as malaria of the music world, cite declining demand and consumer preference 
for CDs (which just happen to give record companies about double the profit 
margin). Of course sales of vinyl are dwindling -- you can't buy what you can't 
find. 
</P>
<P>
To security guards at <LOCATION>South Coast Plaza</LOCATION>, who snapped into action and hustled 
out a couple of trouble-making . . . artists. It seems a couple of local women 
who like to paint <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION> scenes one day a week decided to while away one 
rainy day making sketches of the mall's indoor carousel. Little did they know 
they hadn't applied for the proper papers, so they were told, politely but 
firmly, they would have to stop. This in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, the self-proclaimed "City 
of the Arts." Boy, lucky for the artists they weren't actually doing something 
illegal within city limits -- like standing on a street corner seeking gainful 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
To magician <PERSON>David Copperfield</PERSON> for his lascivious stage manner in shows at the 
Performing Arts Center, where he'll return in <DATE>January</DATE>. His bump-and-grind form 
of entertainment smacks more of Harbor Boulevard "tricks" than magic from the 
time-honored <PERSON>Houdini</PERSON> school. 
</P>
<P>
To the <LOCATION>Laguna Beach City Council</LOCATION> for declaring that a beer permit for Club 
Postnuclear would constitute a public danger, unlike all the other 
establishments in the area that do have liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
To <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Fullerton</ORGANIZATION> students and Associated Students officers, for the 
recent campus flap over the appearance of <ORGANIZATION>Morton Downey Jr</ORGANIZATION>. A turkey to the 
students who named <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> as their No. 1 choice in a survey of potential guest 
speakers, and stale stuffing to the Associate Students for following up this 
bone-headed choice by spending <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> collected in student fees to pay <PERSON>Mr. Big 
Mouth</PERSON>. The payoff? Only 150 students (of 25,065 enrolled this semester) bought 
tickets. Bravo to the good taste exhibited by the remaining 24,915. 
</P>
<P>
To the Beach Boys, for their by-the-numbers performance (yet again) at the 
<LOCATION>Pacific Amphitheatre</LOCATION> in <DATE>May</DATE>. Maybe they should call the producers of "Elvis" 
and commission a stiff musical in which they would star as themselves, paying 
homage to how wonderful they once were. Oh, wait -- they already do that. 
</P>
<P>
To poet and author <PERSON>Donald Britton</PERSON> for his pretentious series of articles 
entitled "The Dark Side of Disneyland." Writing in Art Issues magazine last 
<DATE>summer</DATE>, he described the Happiest Place on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as "less an amusement park 
than a moving elegy for dead children," stopping just short of dubbing it "The 
Tragic Kingdom." Don -- get a life. 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Performing Arts Center</ORGANIZATION>'s tired batch of road shows that, 
with one notable exception (see below), masqueraded as the best of current 
musical-theater: "Anything Goes," "Fiddler on the Roof," "Cats" (for the third 
time) . . . <DATE>May</DATE> we expect singing waiters and chicken-fried steak dinners 
before show time in the near future? 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Board of Supervisors</ORGANIZATION> for for contributing precisely zilch 
to the arts in recent years. Now they have a new plan starting in <DATE>1990</DATE> to 
support art -- at the <LOCATION>John Wayne Airport</LOCATION>. Maybe this is for all our 
fly-by-night art lovers? 
</P>
<P>
To actor-turned-would-be-rock-star <PERSON>Dennis Quaid</PERSON> for thinking even for a 
millisecond that he could emulate <PERSON>Jerry Lee Lewis</PERSON> in a suffocatingly bland show 
at <ORGANIZATION>Club Postnuclear</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> <DATE>last March</DATE>. There's more to rock 'n' roll 
greatness than a wicked smile and the ability to pound a piano. A modicum of 
talent please, maestro? 
</P>
<P>
To the <LOCATION>Pacific Symphony</LOCATION> for keeping ticket holders waiting for more than two 
months while they dawdled around deciding what to play on a concert program 
after canceling <ORGANIZATION>Verdi</ORGANIZATION>'s Requiem. Again, the concert-goer gets the message: 
"We've got your money, we'll give what we decide to give, if and when we decide 
to give it." 
</P>
<P>
To any and all others who treat Orange County audiences with disdain, as 
credit-card numbers instead of culture-hungry denizens deserving of respect. 
</P>
<P>
Well, now that the turkeys have been thoroughly carved up, it's only fair to 
offer Thanksgiving Day toasts to those who have made our lives a little tastier 
and culturally satisfying this year: 
</P>
<P>
To the <LOCATION>San Francisco Ballet</LOCATION>, whose <DATE>October</DATE> engagement at the Performing Arts 
Center featured some refreshingly bold works of cutting-edge choreographer 
<PERSON>William Forsythe</PERSON>. All that classical ballet is swell, but it's also nice to 
look forward now and then. Ditto for the appearance of the <ORGANIZATION>Lewitzky Dance 
Company</ORGANIZATION> for introducing some modern dance on the sacred <PERSON>Segerstrom</PERSON> stage in 
<DATE>October</DATE>, courtesy of the <ORGANIZATION>Master Chorale of Orange County</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>Celebrity Theatre</ORGANIZATION>'s bold bookings of everything from rap and comedy to 
country and punk. If only we had a 1,000-seater run by people with similar 
sense of adventure and open-mindedness. Next best thing: any 1,000-seat pop 
music venue. 
</P>
<P>
To the Imagination Celebration, for managing to get blues musicians <PERSON>John Cephas</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Phil Wiggins</PERSON> into the Performing Arts Center as part of the annual arts 
program for children. But a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> cheer to whoever wrote the impenetrable, 
overly intellectualized program. If you have to explain the blues like a 
doctoral dissertation, you jus' ain' got no kulcha. 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>Costa Mesa City Council</ORGANIZATION>, which created a new agency to provide greater 
and more stable funding for artsrecognizing that the arts can not only be an 
aesthetic asset to the community, but good business, too. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco-based Landmark Theatre Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which in <DATE>1989</DATE> bought the 
Port Theatre in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> del Mar and leased the old <ORGANIZATION>Fox Theatre</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fullerton</LOCATION>, 
which will now be completely refurbished. The company might be able to make 
greater profits showing "<DATE>Friday</DATE> the 13th, Part 39 -- <PERSON>Jason Takes Mylanta</PERSON>," but 
it prefers to cater to the smaller, under-served audience for foreign films, 
independents and other "art" films. 
</P>
<P>
To comedian <PERSON>Jerry Seinfeld</PERSON>, a regular on the <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> comedy front, for 
showing, a la <PERSON>Jay Leno</PERSON>, that you can still get people to laugh without verbally 
or physically abusing your audience, ethnic minorities, people who are 
overweight or in any way different from the performer. Seinfeld's school of 
comedy celebrates the things we all have in common, rather than reinforcing 
those things that separate us. 
</P>
<P>
To Alternative Repertory Theatre in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, Illusion's/New View Theatre in 
<LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION> (though it recently closed), Way Off Broadway Playhouse in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> for 
noble efforts, even when artistically unsuccessful, at establishing some sense 
of a storefront-theater scene in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
To KOCE Channel 50, <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>'s public television station, which nearly 
qualified for a turkey for its heavy promotion of the popular <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> series 
"EastEnders" in a <DATE>March</DATE> fund-raising drive, then turned around in <DATE>April</DATE> and 
canceled the show because they "couldn't afford it." But they earned thanks for 
rescuing the show from oblivion with a last-minute reprieve in the form of 
corporate underwriting from the <ORGANIZATION>Queen Mary-Spruce Goose Entertainment Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. This followed an unprecedented flood of hundreds of letters and 
phone calls protesting the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Museum Center</ORGANIZATION> for its "Document Orange County" exhibit, 
especially the entertaining segment called "Looking Forward," which presented 
local kids' notions about the face of <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> Yet to Come. Some were 
quite dark, but you couldn't help predicting that the fourth-grade kid who 
envisioned a futuristic "Computer Mug (that) will be used for drinking coffee 
and doing work at the same time" is soon gonna be a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
To Bogart's in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, for providing at least one relatively close outlet 
for invigorating, eclectic shows, most of which never find their way to <LOCATION>Orange 
County</LOCATION>, and for providing a desperately needed outlet for aspiring <ORGANIZATION>Orange 
County</ORGANIZATION> rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
To "Into the Woods" at the Performing Arts Center. This engaging <PERSON>Stephen 
Sondheim</PERSON> musical had a message, even a heart, instead of the empty visual flash 
of "Cats" and all the other <PERSON>Andrew Lloyd Webber</PERSON> tripe that is so much the rage 
in the musical theater world. 
</P>
<P>
To <PERSON>Nicholas Slonimsky</PERSON>, the beloved and seemingly immortal critic and raconteur. 
During his UC <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> talk in <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Slonimsky</PERSON> always had an insight or witty 
retort aimed at keeping artistic standards high and stuffed-shirts deflated. 
</P>
<P>
To <ORGANIZATION>South Coast Repertory</ORGANIZATION> for, among other things, a lively staging of <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION>'s 
"You Never Can Tell." (A separate toast to those continually amazing eyebrows 
of actor <PERSON>I.M. Hobson</PERSON>.) Also, for its endlessly imaginative Second Stage 
production of <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON>' "Hard Times," in which five actors miraculously, 
and convincingly, managed to conjure up dozens of distinct characters, proving 
again that invention and imagination will always triumph over spectacle and 
special effects. 
</P>
<P>
To <PERSON>Neil Young</PERSON> for a riveting performance in <DATE>August</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Pacific Amphitheatre</LOCATION>. 
Built around a powerhouse new "Freedom" album, Young's show demonstrated again 
that the best socially conscious rock is compelling, not simply suffocatingly 
well-intentioned (are you listening, <LOCATION>Bono</LOCATION>?). But was it just another persona 
donned by rock's stylistic carpetbagger? Answer: when the result is this 
powerful, it doesn't matter a whit. 
</P>
<P>
To the <ORGANIZATION>Grove Shakespeare Festival</ORGANIZATION>, which is as adept outdoors (in fine <DATE>summer</DATE> 
performances of "Romeo and Juliet" and a particularly admirable performance by 
<PERSON>Charles Lanyer</PERSON> as "Cyrano de Bergerac") as it is indoors (in a moving 
production of <PERSON>Rod Serling</PERSON>'s "Requiem for a Heavyweight"). 
</P>
<P>
To <ORGANIZATION>Dr. Dream Records</ORGANIZATION>, the tiny label in Orange that is putting dozens of local 
rock acts on tape and vinyl, providing tangible evidence of a still-exciting 
original-music scene. The company released albums by noteworthy performers 
including <ORGANIZATION>Imagining Yellow Suns</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Eggplant</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National People</ORGANIZATION>'s Gang, <PERSON>Ann De 
Jarnett</PERSON> and the late, lamented <ORGANIZATION>El Grupo Sexo</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And, lastly, to any and all who conceive of, promote and disseminate the arts 
as art first, commerce second. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Turkey Day!

<LEADPARA>  LIKE Count Dracula, the Broadway-Brommer connection keeps rising from the
grave, despite assurances from the powers that be that it's dead. Like Richard
Nixon or a week-old fish, this stinker keeps returning to the public plate as
Santa Cruz city officials hold their noses with one hand while seemingly using
the other to give a finger to the residents of the town's east side.;    It
should be noted right off the bat that I have a personal as well as an
altruistic stake in this: My home abuts Broadway and I hate the idea of the
already busy street being turned into a thoroughfare by double-talking Santa
Cruz politicians.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  IDEA DESERVES FINAL DETOUR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Over the years, I have, with very few exceptions, voted for the progressive
candidates for city council. We don't agree on everything, but we agree on
most things.;    I've been particularly impressed with the progressives'
promises when election time rolls around that as far as they are concerned,
Broadway-Brommer is dead, will remain dead and need never again even reach the
talking stage.;    Broadway-Brommer, for those of you who live where most of
the city council members live, on the west side of town, is a proposal that
would benefit 41st Avenue businesses -- and really hurt shopkeepers on the
east side and in downtown <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. It would do so by putting some sort of
concrete strip across the meadows at the upper end of the yacht harbor to join
<PERSON>Brommer</PERSON> Street, in Live Oak, with Broadway, on the east side.;    The result,
of course, would be to make it easier for <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> shoppers to speed out to
41st Avenue to spend money in <LOCATION>Capitola</LOCATION> and raise sales-tax revenue for that
rich little burg instead of patronizing merchants in quake-devastated downtown
<LOCATION>Santa Cruz.</LOCATION>;    Despite progressives' promises that Broadway-Brommer would
never again rear its ugly head, it's back. This time, it's one of several
grotesque concepts touted as part of the proposed "arterial streets master
plan" -- the work of the city traffic engineer, a bureaucrat in the public
works department.;    NEVER ones to obey the old adage, "If it's not broken,
don't fix it," these engineers seem driven -- pardon the pun -- to come up
with insane traffic flow schemes. In this draft report, he suggests the need
for any or all of the following:;    Broadway-Brommer; a second <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> Street
bridge over the yacht harbor; a <LOCATION>Soquel Avenue</LOCATION> widened, at points, to six
lanes; and elimination of parking along parts of <LOCATION>Soquel Avenue</LOCATION>, an area where
businesses are always in trouble already because there's nowhere for customers
to park.;    Also put back on the table is the controversial eastern access
route through the Pogonip property to the UC-Santa <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> campus.;    Yes, yes,
this is only a draft proposal, as far as I can determine. However, it seems
that the draft has been prepared by bureaucrats who work, ultimately, for the
very same city council that has a majority that has promised us that
Broadway-Brommer is dead.;    Come on, give those of us who live and/or do
business on the east side a break.;    It's long been clear that most of the
city council's thoughts seem to revolve around the west side neighborhoods
where most of them live.;    Although I've long thought that district
elections for the city council would be wasteful and unnecessary, the very
fact that bureaucrats don't know about, don't care about or don't believe in a
city council policy against Broadway-Brommer makes me wonder: Might we get
better representation on the east side if we were to have our own two or three
neighbors speaking for us down at <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>?;    IF THE politicians don't mind
their underlings trying once again to revive Broadway-Brommer, and if they
can't understand that the businesses on the east side need parking, not a
speedway in front of their shops, maybe we need some changes.;    However, I
am sanguine that once again, the council will reassure us not to worry, that
Broadway-Brommer is dead.;    If not, it's time to drive a stake through its
heart.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Caught between earthquake recovery and a flagging economy, the downtown Los
Gatos retail district, once a chic area that drew shoppers from far and wide,
is struggling to regain its health.;    Granted, many of the scars of the 1989
Loma Prieta quake have disappeared and shoppers are returning to the
once-devastated area, but business is still painfully slow.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Retail is just off. It's a national trend, not just a local problem," said
<PERSON>Sue LaForge</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Gatos Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. "But we've got the double
whammy of that and the quake. A lot of business owners have just finished
rebuilding, now the recession.";    While some businesses are failing or
barely staying alive, others surprisingly are doing well. It's difficult to
explain, said <PERSON>LaForge</PERSON>, and many factors are involved, including shop location,
how long they've been in business and what they're selling.;    Longtime
anchor stores, such as <ORGANIZATION>Chrislow</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department Store</ORGANIZATION>, Domus housewares, Crown
Books and the <ORGANIZATION>Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Company</ORGANIZATION>, all say business has been
strong. And a number of established restaurants, the retail area's bread and
butter, also report business has been good.;    But for others, many in
business for five or more years, like Melange clothing boutique, Folk Arts of
<LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hathaway Collections</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Elisabetta Fashions</ORGANIZATION> and Kids Too clothing
shop, the combination quake-recession pushed them over the edge.;    <PERSON>James
Aguiar</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Hathaway Collections</ORGANIZATION>, a jewelry and art boutique on <LOCATION>North
Santa Cruz Avenue</LOCATION>, is closing because he couldn't attract enough customers. He
mostly blames his location -- at the lonely southern end of the shopping strip
-- for failing to bring even kids walking dogs to his door.;    <PERSON>Aguiar</PERSON> said
high rent and the fact that he opened the shop right after the <DATE>1989</DATE> quake when
shoppers were staying away from downtown also contributed to the collapse of
his business.;    "I think we were in the right town, but not in the right
location or at the right time. It's been a real disappointment," said <PERSON>Aguiar</PERSON>,
who last week finally saw a steady stream of customers come through the door
to take advantage of his price-slashing close-out sale.;    Despite hard times
brought by the quake, many landlords are still demanding high rents for retail
space, which, coupled with paltry cash register receipts, is killing some
businesses that otherwise could have hung on. <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> has always been known
for its high rents, but merchants hardly fussed about paying them until the
quake changed the downtown retail scene.;    Some merchants have asked for
rent breaks, but many of the landlords say they, too, are struggling with
hefty payments on earthquake reconstruction loans and can't help them.;    But
one property owner, <PERSON>James Farwell</PERSON>, is trying to be flexible, and in at least
one case so far has offered new tenants six months' free rent to help them get
on their feet in the new location.;    <ORGANIZATION>Farwell</ORGANIZATION>, whose La <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> building has
been undergoing quake repairs for the past 12 months, says it makes good
business sense to help shop owners establish themselves so the downtown can
become more stable and attract the returning customer. The block-long retail
building houses the popular <ORGANIZATION>Mountain Charley</ORGANIZATION>'s saloon and has space for 20
stores.;    Businesses in the small downtown, especially new ones with a
product never before tried in <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, have had a high failure rate over the
last five years. In fact, many downtown retail areas throughout the valley
have suffered ever since the <DATE>summer 1986</DATE> opening of the revamped <ORGANIZATION>Valley Fair</ORGANIZATION>,
which pulled customers away from old-style mom and pop stores to the flashy,
upscale mall with plenty of parking out front.;    <PERSON>Jennifer Borgardt</PERSON>, owner of
<PERSON>J. Alexander</PERSON> clothing store, knows that all too well. For five years prior to
the remodeling and expansion of <ORGANIZATION>Valley Fair</ORGANIZATION>, her business prospered in the Old
Town Shopping Center in downtown <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>. Then, suddenly it started to take
a dive. Problems with the Old Town landlord forced her to move to another
location, which further hurt her business.;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, after another move to
<LOCATION>North Santa Cruz Avenue</LOCATION> and Main Street, Borgardt and new partner <PERSON>Diane
Richardson</PERSON> say they feel things can only get better. So far, their location
has been a great draw for foot traffic. And their idea to combine their two
businesses into one -- Borgardt's designer clothes and <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON>'s line of
cosmetics -- has been well-received by customers.;    In fact, they say other
struggling business owners are teaming up to do the same, to save their
businesses and to enhance what they're selling.;    But innovative marketing
plans alone won't bring the scores of new customers the downtown needs to turn
it around. The area is in dire need of more parking, which has been a sore
point for merchants for a number of years. They're tired of hearing customers
say they don't like coming downtown because of the lack of parking and because
police aggressively ticket cars parked on busy streets.;    "If there was ever
anybody running a campaign to keep customers from shopping in <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>, it's
the police department, " said <PERSON>Paul Dorsa</PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Opera House</ORGANIZATION> furniture
store on East Main Street. "I've actually paid tickets for customers so I
wouldn't lose them. We don't need it.";    The town, through a property
owners' assessment district, has rebuilt and repaved a number of downtown
parking lots. But construction of the largest lot -- a 308-space, two-level
facility -- has ground to a halt because toxic contamination was found beneath
it. The latest report from town officials is that the lot likely won't be
completed in time for Christmas.;    But merchants like Borgardt say that
won't keep them down. "Come <DATE>spring</DATE>, there will be a turnaround. We are going
to hang in there. If we didn't believe it, we'd be outta here and running
parachute rides at the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> boardwalk."  </TEXT>

A MOCK-CHINESE OPERA STAGED IN AMBITIOUS SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA FE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is business as usual in <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>. Unusual business. 
</P>
<P>
As one drives the highway toward the most popular mirage in the local desert, 
the familiar road sign still offers helpful advice: "OPERA TRAFFIC KEEP LEFT." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the open proscenium of the opera house that masquerades as an adobe, the 
lights of <LOCATION>Los Alamos</LOCATION> twinkle innocently in the distance. They provide a 
naturally magical cyclorama for the unnatural acts on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Sangre de Cristo Mountains</ORGANIZATION>, visible from every seat in this semi-alfresco 
theater, serenely haunt the horizon. The lowest stars in the universe -- when 
left undisturbed by clouds or rain -- serve as an otherworldly yet emphatically 
dramatic ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
One would cheerfully come back, and back, to a setting like this even if it 
meant enduring yet another automatic-pilot "Carmen" or one more 
"Boheme"-by-the-numbers. But <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Crosby</PERSON>'s idealistic company concentrates, much of the time, on unhackneyed 
repertory. Employing essentially youthful casts and imaginative directors, 
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> tries to take opera, the most irrational of art forms, seriously as 
musical drama. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe may not always succeed. At least it tries. 
</P>
<P>
It is trying this <DATE>summer</DATE> with five new productions. Only two of them -- <PERSON>Richard 
Strauss</PERSON>' "Rosenkavalier" and <PERSON>Verdi</PERSON>'s "Traviata" -- can be classified as 
conventional. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the unconventional, the current agenda includes the first 
professional staging in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> of a long-forgotten example of perfumed Gallic 
trivia, <ORGANIZATION>Massenet</ORGANIZATION>'s "Cherubin" (<DATE>1905</DATE>), not to mention an ambitious exhumation of 
an ultra-Baroque extravaganza, <PERSON>Cavalli</PERSON>'s "La Calisto" (1651). Even more 
newsworthy, however, is the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> premiere of <PERSON>Judith Weir</PERSON>'s "A Night at the 
Chinese Opera."(<DATE>1987</DATE>). 
</P>
<P>
A new-wave-chic entry from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, it was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> and much 
praised when first performed by the Kent Opera in <LOCATION>Cheltenham</LOCATION>. Serving as her 
own librettist, <PERSON>Weir</PERSON> has concocted a fascinatingly complex musico-theatrical 
package that wants desperately to seem simple. 
</P>
<P>
Born in <DATE>1954</DATE>, raised in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, trained mostly in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> (briefly, in the 
States), influenced, to a degree, by the likes of <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Britten</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Messiaen</PERSON>, she has dropped an imposing calling card with this, her first 
full-scale grown-up opera. <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, incidentally, made her acquaintance in 
<DATE>March, 1988</DATE>, when the <DATE>Monday</DATE> Evening Concerts mustered the American premiere of 
"The Consolations of Scholarship," a 25-minute scena for soprano and nine 
players predicated on 13th-Century Yuan dramas. 
</P>
<P>
"A Night at the Chinese Opera," seen here <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, shares a similar 
inspiration. Weir has, for some time, been preoccupied with the stark rituals 
of Asian narrative, although she filters the ancient impulses through 
distinctly modern sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In this opus, she introduces herself as a virtuoso juggler. In an hour and 40 
minutes (the timing excludes two mood-shattering intermissions), she manages to 
juxtapose farce and tragedy, realism and stylization, symbolism and fantasy, 
vaudeville and political satire, always with creative strokes that are 
extraordinarily bold, economical, swift and deft. 
</P>
<P>
The outer acts focus, with mock-Brechtian objectivity, on the plight of <PERSON>Chao 
Lin</PERSON>, an innocent canal builder oppressed by Mongolian rule in the era of <PERSON>Marco 
Polo</PERSON>. The central act, a startling opera within the opera, concentrates on the 
parodistic parallel of an actual Yuan play, "The Orphan of the Chao Family." 
</P>
<P>
Weir tells her multilayered tale in bleak Western tones cleverly ornamented 
with colorful imitation-Eastern accents. She speaks a fragile, concise, 
inventive musical language enhanced by subtle dynamic effects reliant on 
primitive harmonic constructions. 
</P>
<P>
The vocal lines, craftily stressed and supported by a percussive 
chamber-orchestra, span formal speech, expressive parlando, expanded 
declamation, agitated recitative and, occasionally, poignant lyricism. The 
composer even interpolates a caricature Italian-tenor aria for <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>, who 
makes an irreverently amusing cameo appearance in the third act. 
</P>
<P>
For all its gutsy, extrovert trappings, the opera remains a fragile, 
introspective creation that seems to demand an intimate hall and a sensitive 
directorial touch. Unfortunately, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> couldn't provide the former and 
didn't provide the latter. 
</P>
<P>
The crafty words and muted emotional climaxes tended to get blurred in the wide 
open spaces. The dramatic affect tended to get blunted in the heavy-handed, 
gag-oriented staging of <PERSON>Robert Carsen</PERSON> (remembered for his ersatz-Sellars 
"Marriage of Figaro" this season in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
Ever resourceful when it comes to trendy cliches, <PERSON>Carsen</PERSON> interpolated tai-chi 
exercises for the cast before the music began, sent his protagonists into the 
auditorium in quest of false immediacy, and eventually blinded the audience 
with flashing searchlights, all for no apparent reason. Not content with such 
extra-operatic distractions, he reduced the Yuan play to a plodding burlesque 
that even dishonored the <ORGANIZATION>Marx Brothers</ORGANIZATION> allusion of the title. 
</P>
<P>
He did elicit neatly focused performances, however, from such hard-working, 
versatile singing actors as <PERSON>John David de Haan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Drew Minter</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Kuether</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Philip Zawisza</PERSON>, <PERSON>Judith Christin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kathryn Gamberoni</PERSON>, <PERSON>Douglas Perry</PERSON>, <PERSON>James 
Busterud</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joyce Castle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anthony Laciura</PERSON>. <PERSON>Michael Levine</PERSON> designed witty, 
minimalist-cartoon decors, brashly lit by <PERSON>Craig Miller</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps next time. . . .

<LEADPARA>  AMONG the face lifts created for tonight's San Francisco Symphony gala opener
is that of Davies Symphony Hall, which looks suspiciously like the cosmetic
surgery attempted unsuccessfully for San Jose's Center for the Performing
Arts.;   The symphony's black-tie concert, priced as high as $275 a ticket for
just 65 minutes of concert music (and including a post-concert party), will
feature not so much deja vu as deja entendu -- already heard.  </LEADPARA>

S.F. SYMPHONY TO TRY OUT THE HIGHER RISERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The most visible features of the renovation are the much higher, steeper
risers for the musicians, which acousticians <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Kirkegaard &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>
also had introduced at the <LOCATION>San Jose Symphony</LOCATION> before Music Director <PERSON>George
Cleve</PERSON> threw them out in disgust.;   Apart from that, you may need binoculars
to spot the labors that shut down the hall for the whole <DATE>summer</DATE>. The
see-through overhead plastic panels have gone from round to square, each of
them on a computer-controlled winch allowing fine-tuning.;   The new acoustics
will get their baptism under fire in two weeks when <LOCATION>London Records</LOCATION> moves in to
record <PERSON>Schubert</PERSON>'s "Great C Major" Symphony and <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>'s "Siegfried Idyll,"
with Music Director <PERSON>Herbert Blomstedt</PERSON> again on the podium.;   <DATE>This week</DATE>'s
mostly <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> repertory is capped by a salute to the crescendoing freedom
movement in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> via <ORGANIZATION>Berlioz</ORGANIZATION>'s rousing "Rakoczy" March for a grand
finale, commemorating a hero of the <DATE>1848</DATE> revolutions.;   The program also
offers paired treats via the coloratura-soprano vocalist, and for once <ORGANIZATION>Flint
Center</ORGANIZATION>'s repeat concert (<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>) is getting far more than a fill-in
substitute. Tonight it's the popular star <PERSON>Kathleen Battle</PERSON>, while at <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> it
will be the up-and-coming <PERSON>Harolyn Blackwell</PERSON>, making her Bay Area debut before
her "<PERSON>Don Giovanni</PERSON>" Zerlina at the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> later this month.;   ALL
IN THE FAMILY -- The leadership of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s three biggest
performing-arts organizations sounds like a lunch group at the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
corporate-counseling firm of <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Tully Friedman</PERSON> was president
of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Opera until last year, while partner <PERSON>F. Warren Hellman</PERSON>'s
sister, <PERSON>Nancy Hellman Bechtle</PERSON>, is in her fifth year as president of the <LOCATION>San
Francisco Symphony.</LOCATION>;   Now the likeliest heir apparent for the board
chairmanship of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Ballet</LOCATION> this fall is Chris (<PERSON>Mrs. F. Warren</PERSON>)
<PERSON>Hellman</PERSON>, according to sources around town.;   Says one arts board insider, "It
looks like a takeover, but it isn't, because all three of them donate very
generously to the groups.";   <LOCATION>SANTA CRUZ PODIUM</LOCATION> HARMONY -- Two of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
brightest conducting stars may become a tandem in conducting the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo
Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> through the 1990s.;   <PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON> and
composer-conductor <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> are integrating their heavy international
schedules to work in <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION> compatibly.;   "We're talking to <PERSON>Dennis</PERSON>, he's
talking to <PERSON>John</PERSON>, and they're talking to each other," says Cabrillo Executive
Director <PERSON>Tom Fredericks</PERSON>, who is trying to firm up the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> County-based
<DATE>summer</DATE> fest's conducting commitments for years to come.;   The likeliest
scenario: <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> returning to conduct in <DATE>1992</DATE>. If and when <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> resident
<PERSON>Davies</PERSON> decides to move on (and <DATE>1993</DATE> is a good guess), <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> will become the
successor.;   Meanwhile, Cabrillo wrestles with a <DATE>1991</DATE> deficit of <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>,
piled atop the hangover <MONEY>$14,900</MONEY> from the year before, with recession-related
contribution shortfalls blamed.;   CHANGES -- <PERSON>Marilyn Horne</PERSON> canceled her five
performances as <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> with the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> because of knee surgery,
but not to worry -- two other American mezzos will replace her into the title
role. <PERSON>Kathleen Kuhlmann</PERSON> will do the opener <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and six other performances
of the Bizet favorite, while <ORGANIZATION>Denyce Graves</ORGANIZATION> will sing <DATE>Oct. 25</DATE> through <DATE>Nov. 1.</DATE>; 
 Before the first note of the season is sounded, the <LOCATION>San Jose Symphony</LOCATION> has
already changed its opening work from <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s "La Clemenza di Tito" Overture
to <PERSON>Berlioz</PERSON>'s "<PERSON>Benvenuto Cellini</PERSON>" Overture for <DATE>Sept. 13-15</DATE>. The conductor,
<PERSON>Michael Palmer</PERSON>, is the latest candidate for <PERSON>George Cleve</PERSON>'s job.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts is bringing the
Asian-American acting company, <ORGANIZATION>Pan Asian Repertory</ORGANIZATION>, to its spanking new
facility <DATE>March 14</DATE> through 16.;    The company is presenting <PERSON>Wakako Yamauchi</PERSON>'s
play, "And the Soul Shall Dance," set in the <LOCATION>Imperial Valley of California</LOCATION> at
the end of the Depression. A <DATE>1977</DATE> production of the play in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> won
three <ORGANIZATION>LA Drama Critics Awards</ORGANIZATION>. The play has been revived and had a successful
run most recently in <LOCATION>New York.</LOCATION>;    "And the Soul Shall Dance," called an Asian
"Grapes of Wrath" by some critics, has apparently become more daring in its
new production, including more sensual material. That's according to director
<PERSON>Kati Kuroda</PERSON>, who seems to know the magic words in attracting an audience.;   
Meanwhile, TheatreWorks in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> readies a new production of the classic,
"Rashomon," at the <ORGANIZATION>Lucie Stern Theater</ORGANIZATION>, to run <DATE>March 16 through April 6</DATE>, after
previews <DATE>March 14</DATE> and 15.;    The play, written by <PERSON>Fay</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Kanin</PERSON> from
the ancient stories by <PERSON>Akutagawa</PERSON>, will have an all-Asian cast locally. There
was a Broadway production in <DATE>1959</DATE> and an <PERSON>Akira Kurosawa</PERSON> film after that.;   
In <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> the play will be directed by <PERSON>Yuriko Doi</PERSON>, who is artistic director
of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s Theatre of Yugen.;    Add to this an upcoming San Jose
Civic Light Opera production of <PERSON>Stephen Sondheim</PERSON>'s "Pacific Overtures," <DATE>May 16</DATE>
to <DATE>June 11</DATE>. The show, with a mostly Asian cast, deals with <ORGANIZATION>American Commodore
Perry</ORGANIZATION>'s "opening" of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to international trade.;    Finally, the hit
British musical "Miss Saigon" is readying previews on Broadway, with an
opening set for <DATE>April 11</DATE>. "Pacific Overtures" and "Miss Saigon" are Broadway
shows with Asian themes and not Asian shows themselves. However, as interest
in the themes grows, along with the Asian population, it's a good bet we will
be getting more Asian-oriented productions in our theaters, and soon.;   
<LOCATION>Burgeoning Flint</LOCATION>;  <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Flint Center</ORGANIZATION> seems poised to get a lot more
theater on its stage. <PERSON>Vicki O'Brien</PERSON>, who manages the <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> schedule, is in
discussions with the <PERSON>James Nederlander</PERSON> theater people in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> concerning
the possibility of bringing the hit musical "Grand Hotel" to <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION>. The show
was supposed to play <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, but a rift between the <PERSON>Carole Hays
Shorenstein</PERSON> office and <ORGANIZATION>Nederlander</ORGANIZATION> has scratched that run. So it may play
<LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> for a week in <DATE>August</DATE>. The only holdup is cost.;    Also possible for
<ORGANIZATION>Flint Center</ORGANIZATION> is a new production of "Annie" with <PERSON>Gretchen Wyler</PERSON> and <PERSON>John
Schuck</PERSON>, the first week in <DATE>June</DATE>, and yet another production of "My Fair Lady"
with <PERSON>Neil Harrison</PERSON> or <PERSON>Richard Chamberlain.</PERSON>;    <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON> says that recent
productions of "Cats," "The Phantom of the Opera" (non-Broadway version) and
"A Chorus Line" have all done extremely well in <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, leading to thoughts
of expanding the theater schedule.;    The Theater Beat;  <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> needs
more theater, especially during the bulk of the year when <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare Santa
Cruz</ORGANIZATION> is hibernating. The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Actors Theater</ORGANIZATION> is trying to fill the
vacuum, with two original one-act comedies, "Yesterday's Paper" and "Citizen
<PERSON>Klein</PERSON>," on tap <DATE>March 15 through April 14</DATE> at 1001 Center St. . . . <PERSON>Philip
Slater</PERSON>, a local playwright, is the author . . . <PERSON>Rick Reynolds</PERSON>, a local comic,
is very hot stuff in the stand-up trade. His "Only the Truth Is Funny,"
opening a new run at the Theater on the Square in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> <DATE>March 5
through 31</DATE>, goes to <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> this <DATE>spring</DATE>. Quite a leap . . .  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  For 76 years, first as a silent movie house with a Wurlitzer organ, then as a
theater for the early talkies, and more recently as an art film cinema, the
Los Gatos theater has provided a steady diet of local entertainment for young
and old, sophisticated and square, clean-cut and punk.;    From the 1922
silent "Robin Hood," starring Douglas Fairbanks, to "Oklahoma!" and cult
favorite "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the little 600-seat theater on the
town's main drag has screened it all through the years.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  L.G. THEATER'S ENCORE
HISTORIC MOVIE HOUSE SHATTERED BY QUAKE GETS
READY FOR COMEBACK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For a time, it was a favorite gathering spot for teen-agers on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>. Then the punkers and foreign film buffs packed the house. More
recently, yuppies brought their kids to see family-oriented movies like "Gone
with the Wind" and "<PERSON>Ferris Bueller</PERSON>'s Day Off.";    The old-fashioned
neighborhood movie house with its <DATE>1950s</DATE> marquee has been dark for the last 21
months since the <LOCATION>Loma Prieta</LOCATION> earthquake pulled its lath and plaster facade
away from its frame and cracked its walls. The curious who stroll down <LOCATION>North
Santa Cruz Avenue</LOCATION> often stop and press their faces against the large glass
doors, straining to see some sign of repairs. They want the little theater to
open again.;    With luck and a lot of hard work by construction crews, that
could happen this <DATE>fall</DATE>. Within the last few weeks, carpenters, plasterers,
plumbers and electricians have begun tearing out bathrooms, walls, ceilings
and the theater's little glass ticket booth to rebuild them.;    They plan to
restore the cinema to its look just before the quake, only the structure will
be substantially stronger after crews finish pumping super-strength epoxy into
the walls and ceiling, making it less likely to shift in another quake.;   
Special care will be given to restoring the <DATE>1930s</DATE> art deco goddesses and
towering pillars that stand floor-to-ceiling on both sides of the theater,
trademark touches in many old neighborhood movie houses. The deep red velvet
seats for the most part have held up well and will not need massive
re-upholstering, said contractor <PERSON>Chuck Taddo</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bay Area Construction</ORGANIZATION>, which
has taken on the repair job.;    Fond memories;    <PERSON>Taddo</PERSON> said the <MONEY>$160,000</MONEY> job
is definitely a challenge, but one he finds fascinating because the theater
has such a rich history. He remembers going to matinees there as a kid, and
the job has brought back nostalgic memories of munching on M&amp;Ms and popcorn
from the old-fashioned popcorn machine -- still in the lobby -- and watching
movies like "Shane.";    Owner <PERSON>Carmel Cormack</PERSON>, 53, one of <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>' more
colorful downtown characters, bought the building in <DATE>1974</DATE> after it had been
severely damaged by fire. Paying a rock-bottom price of <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> for it, she
brought in a crew of friends and relatives and fixed it up.;    Slept
upstairs;    It reopened in <DATE>1976</DATE>, and <PERSON>Cormack</PERSON> even had small residential
quarters built on the theater's second floor where she could sleep overlooking
the classic neon marquee that faced <LOCATION>North Santa Cruz Avenue.</LOCATION>;    <DATE>Today</DATE>, the
property is estimated to be worth between <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$1 million.</MONEY>;    But
<PERSON>Cormack</PERSON> apparently did not have quake insurance on the theater, and has
struggled to obtain federal quake relief funds for reconstruction. Taddo said
she recently received a <ORGANIZATION>Small Business Administration</ORGANIZATION> loan enabling her to
start repairs. Cormack failed to show up at appointments with the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News</ORGANIZATION>
to discuss the project and the future of the theater.;    But <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>
officials who have worked with her on obtaining building permits said she is
enthusiastic about the cinema reopening and has said she wants to jump back in
and crank up the projector and dish out candy and popcorn.;    Officials also
say she is considering plans to transform the theater into a triplex to
attract more patrons.;    Changing concept;    The concept is a far cry from
the days when the theater first opened in <DATE>1915</DATE> to silent movie crowds who were
treated to live organ and piano music played on a Wurlitzer "photo player."
The photo player also featured drums and cymbals.;    The little theater first
opened on dusty <LOCATION>North Santa Cruz Avenue</LOCATION> as The Strand, with a ticket booth in
the center of the front of the building. In later years, the ticket booth was
reconstructed on the right side of the theater after a barber shop moved out
of the space and the cinema expanded.;    <LOCATION>Longtime Los Gatos</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Wilma
Thompson</PERSON> said she remembered when kids paid a dime to see a movie back in the
late '20s and early '30s. Movie-going was so popular that the theater changed
films every two days. "This was a small town. Going to the movies was it," she
said. "We'd go to 2 or 3 a week.";    Among her favorites were the <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME> serial Westerns, Tarzan movies, <ORGANIZATION>Laurel</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Hardy</PERSON> and the Little
Rascals.;    <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> historian <PERSON>Bill Wulf</PERSON>, who remembers the movie house from
his teen-age days, said he has a hard time envisioning the classic theater as
a triplex. Even though the old character of the place will be preserved, it
won't be the same if the theater is sectioned off. "It'll be like sitting in
an elevator shaft," he said. "I wonder what people will think of that."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN THE heyday of Verdi, Rossini and Puccini, opera houses vied to perform the
star composers' latest works before the clamoring public.;    One man commands
that kind of attention today: Berkeley's John Adams, whose 1991 opera "The
Death of Klinghoffer" was booked by six opera houses before the first
rehearsal started.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OPERA'S YOUNG BRIGHT HOPE TO TAKE BOWS AT
CABRILLO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  PERFORMANCE  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Earlier this month the low-key, local-boy-turned-star <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> was back home
briefly between conducting the <LOCATION>Cleveland Orchestra</LOCATION> and recording his opera
with the <ORGANIZATION>Opera de Lyon</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. It's that kind of life now: commissions,
major engagements, jet commutes, 15-hour days.;    At 44, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> still manages
the aw-shucks, pebble-kicking quality that has endeared him to the Bay Area
musical community since joining the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Conservatory of Music</ORGANIZATION>
faculty in <DATE>1972.</DATE>;    Music macabre;  Now it's Cabrillo's turn. In the biggest
coup since engaging Music Director <PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music
Festival</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> has <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> on the podium for two weeks during <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>'
sabbatical year.;    The kind of audacity marking <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' guest-conducting
programs around the country is being carried over to <LOCATION>Cabrillo</LOCATION>. Few
composer-conductors have the panache to open their festival with such morbid
morsels as their own "Aria of the Falling Body," and close with <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>'s
"Songs on the Death of Children" and <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Sinfonia da requiem," after
several equally lugubrious selections.;    The edge of the new;  While <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mahler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Britten</PERSON> all get attention, the Cabrillo focus is on newer music, in
which the composer-conductor offers special insights, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> points out.;   
"It's helpful on both sides. My composing informs my conducting. When doing
music of other composers, I have a different intuition.;    "Also my
conducting informs my composing -- I'm aware of necessities, of what
instruments can and cannot do, and what can be done in limited rehearsal
time.";    The <DATE>1991</DATE> Cabrillo sojourn getting into full swing tonight could be
termed a season of mystical horizons. It offers <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s songs on <PERSON>William
Blake</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' stunning vocal concert piece "The Wound-Dresser," his own
orchestration of Liszt's "The Black Gondola" (a preview of his
premiere-studded <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Symphony program in the fall), part of
<PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Kingdom of the Pagodas," and <PERSON>Milhaud</PERSON>'s "The Creation of the World"
(danced by <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Beal &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>).;    Overriding it all is the shadow of <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>'
opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer," a work based on the Palestinian hijacking
of the "Achille Lauro" cruise ship in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. The work will
not reach the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> until <DATE>November 1992</DATE>, but Cabrillo scheduled
excerpts and offers performances by its title-role singer, baritone <PERSON>Sanford
Sylvan.</PERSON>;    Because of the opera, a <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> theme overlays the concerts
the <DATE>second weekend</DATE>, with <PERSON>Nazim Ozel</PERSON> on Turkish flute and "semi-civilized tree"
(a custom-made, plucked musical instrument) <DATE>Aug. 3</DATE>, and a collaboration by
<ORGANIZATION>Group Parvaneh</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ballet Afsaneh</ORGANIZATION> with Turkish and Persian music and dance
<DATE>Aug. 4.</DATE>;    Modern melodies;  But nothing is a one-man show, not even with
<PERSON>Adams</PERSON> around. Music Director <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> collaborated via long distance in the
programming decisions. <PERSON>JoAnn Falletta</PERSON> leads the juried concert of music by
living <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> composers <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, with pieces by <PERSON>Ross Bauer</PERSON>,
<PERSON>David Jaffe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Stefan Carow</PERSON>, <PERSON>Allen Shearer</PERSON> and "the other" <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>John
Luther</PERSON> Adams.;    This Cabrillo season features prominent soloists such as
violinist <PERSON>Stephanie Chase</PERSON> and pianist <PERSON>Richard Goode</PERSON>, and finally what may be
an end to the nomadic Cabrillo life: an entry into the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Civic

<HEADLINE>  THE VERY SPECIAL F/X OF SAN JOSE NIGHTLIFE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Clubs  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Admission: <MONEY>$3</MONEY>-<MONEY>$5.</MONEY>; Details: Dancing; Thursdays-Sundays, <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> Live; music
<DATE>Wednesdays</DATE>, 10 p.m.; (408) 298-9796; CLUBS; The very special F/X; of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>
nightlife; FIVE years ago, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> had a downtown that could rival <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> in
terms of sheer destruction. The only difference was that life after dark in
<LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> was much more interesting. Now, more than a half-decade of aggressive
redevelopment has given the <LOCATION>Garden City</LOCATION> a downtown full of gracious,
broad-shouldered new buildings and inviting public spaces. And still the
question lingers: Is this a two-night-per-week party town or what?;    It's
not supposed to be like this any more. Nightlife was . . . In The Plan. It's
almost as if the architects of the New Downtown paused to admire their
handiwork in the rosy glow of a weekday sunset, looked at each other and said
"Oh, great. I thought you were bringing the boulevardiers and bon vivants . .
.";    A recent <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME>: The Oasis, the <ORGANIZATION>Heartthrob</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>Cactus Club</ORGANIZATION> are all line-less and listless. Marsugi's is flat-out dead, with
three people hunched at the bar. On First Street, between the <LOCATION>Pavilion</LOCATION> and the
Fairmont, the only souls afoot are a lone jogger and a man blowing dust in
little circles with a leaf-blower.;    But there is a flicker of light in this
weeknight wasteland: F/X. By 10:30, a hipper-than-thou collection of 45
underground-rock aficionados -- out-of-work local musicians, unreconstructed
punks and disaffected post-collegiate neo-Bohemians -- is milling about the
club's shoebox-shaped main room, waiting to see <PERSON>Helen Keller</PERSON> Plaid and the
<ORGANIZATION>Frontier Wives</ORGANIZATION>. In an hour, the crowd will swell to more than 100. With a
dirt-cheap <MONEY>$3</MONEY> cover for two of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s finest club bands, this is the
place to be on this particular <DATE>Wednesday.</DATE>;    The basic
I-Have-A-Marketing-Degree-I-Just-Look-Like-A-Skate-Thug aesthetic is much in
evidence: Young men with slick hair, ratty plaid shirts, black T-shirts and
baggy shorts. Young women with black tights, T-shirts, tattoos and serious
boots. In other words -- it was a nice crowd. Several of the men sport
scraggly little beards, knee-length dungarees, porkpie hats and work boots --
as if they had just stepped out of a Depression-era <ORGANIZATION>Walker Evans</ORGANIZATION> photo. Let us
pray Madison Avenue doesn't get wind of the <LOCATION>Joad Look.</LOCATION>;    The year-old club
has tried to bring innovative theater, film, dance and fashion programs to the
First Street scene with limited success. Nevertheless, the club seems to have
a strong sense of identity. And the owners seem to harbor the all-too-rare
belief that clientele -- not six-for-a-dollar schnapps specials or other
gimmicks -- is what makes a scene.;    At 10:45 the four surly youths in <PERSON>Helen
Keller</PERSON> Plaid come out fighting like a mad mother bear. Soon, the dance floor
is half-full, with 50 people just absorbing the sonic wave. The band's
brilliant Velvet-Underground-Meets-the-Replacements-on-Mars set is sweet and
strong -- the mailed fist shielding the tender heart.;    The world-weary
looks of the clubhounds melt. Dancing, hugging, beer-spilling and random
collisions occur under the strobe light. It's as if the audience's collective
memory begins to wake: This is the good stuff. This is the sound we heard and
the way we felt that very first time -- when punk rock swooped us up and
turned us into sweaty, grinning idiots.;    It was like that for the <ORGANIZATION>Frontier
Wives</ORGANIZATION>, too. San Jose's oldest alternative rock band was in fine form -- from
"Elvis Was a Spy" right through "<PERSON>Louis Pasteur</PERSON>," a tender tale of how the
great scientist learned the secret of bacteria from a witch doctor. This is
the good stuff. One-hundred-and-ten decibels of earwax-melting,
speaker-shredding rock 'n' roll -- with heart and brains and brawn.;    This
home-brewed music is rude, inelegant and not even remotely upscale. When the
city fathers envisioned glittering nightlife, it's unlikely they were thinking
of the <ORGANIZATION>Frontier Wives</ORGANIZATION>. But the native flame is hard to snuff. Smother it with
zoning restrictions and license requirements and noise abatement acts, and
still it burns.;    <LOCATION>Winterland</LOCATION>, <DATE>1978</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Mabuhay Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1981</DATE>. One Step
Beyond, <DATE>1986</DATE>. The Laundry Works <DATE>1987</DATE>. And now, in the wee hours of a <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
morning in the heart of the new <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, still it burns.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  THEATER; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  SO I GET the season announcement for Shakespeare/Santa Cruz, with the plays
and the actors and the dates and the prices. And down a couple of paragraphs,
I find this:;    "Megan Cole, who is playing the stage manager in 'Our Town,'
and both Hippolyta and Oberon in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' . . ."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BRUSH UP YOUR SHAKESPEARE
A SPIRITED SANTA CRUZ COMPANY PULLS THE BRITISH
STUFFINESS OUT OF SHAKESPEARE, LETTING LAUGHTER
AND MUSIC PLAY ON IN ITS WOODED GLEN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     How nice, I think, <PERSON>Megan Cole</PERSON>, she's been at <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> Rep (most recently,
<PERSON>Amanda Wingfield</PERSON> in "The Glass Menagerie").;    I read a little further: "<LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> actor <PERSON>Michael Rogers</PERSON> . . . a respected veteran of many off-Broadway
productions . . . is playing Theseus and Titania in 'A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Night</ORGANIZATION>'s
Dream.' ";    That's an interesting doubling, I think, Theseus and Titania. I
don't believe I've seen a production that had the same actor as . . .;    Hold
it.;    Theseus and Titania?;    <LOCATION>Hippolyta</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Oberon</PERSON>?!;    Wait a minute,
wait a minute. I go back and read it again. There must be some mistake.;   
But no. That's what it says.;    I read a little further: Ah. That explains
it. The director is <PERSON>Danny Scheie.</PERSON>;    The man, or munchkin, responsible for
the world's funniest "Comedy of Errors" in <DATE>1988</DATE>, in which 16 speaking roles
and "several gaolers, officers and attendants" were portrayed by nine actors
and two musicians; in which a packing crate doubled as a stage, a bicycle
built for two held four and two of the actors played their own twin brothers,
both onstage at the same time, which you must admit is unusual, not to say
impossible. I mean, <PERSON>Hayley Mills</PERSON> had a trick camera.;    AND that -- to get
serious here -- is what puts <PERSON>Shakespeare/Santa Cruz</PERSON> in a class by itself.
Without being all academic and heavy, it's the Shakespeare festival that
believes in doing things a little different.;    "Henry V" with a company of
11 actors playing 44 roles. (Because director <PERSON>Michael Edwards</PERSON> decided to take
"We few, we happy few" literally.) "Hamlet" and "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead," back to back in rotating repertory. A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> "Othello." An "As
You Like It" that picked up everything, including the audience, when the story
moved to the Forest of Arden.;    Some years, the company goes straight for
the gold: no high concept, just simple beauty. "Richard II." "The <DATE>Winter</DATE>'s
Tale." "Twelfth Night." "Love's Labour's Lost." "Much Ado About Nothing."
"Much Ado" may have been the prettiest: An entire Franciscan mission, down to
its clay pots of impatiens and a tiny graveyard, was built in the glen next to
the Performing Arts complex at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Cruz.</LOCATION>;   
For me, it all began in <DATE>1984</DATE> when I, new to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, wandered down to <LOCATION>Santa
Cruz</LOCATION>, got lost trying to find the festival, found it, got lost trying to find
the glen, found it -- and found there the Globe Theater, battered and
bullet-scarred, crowned with the wreckage of a snub fighter plane.;    This
was <PERSON>Michael Edwards</PERSON>' production of "<PERSON>Henry IV</PERSON>, Part 1," which knocked the
stuffing out of the stultified Britishness that Americans endure, nay, expect
as a condition of <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>. The poetry was there, not in the measured
cadences of the Queen's English but in an exciting mix of American accents.
Prince <PERSON>Hal</PERSON> looked like <PERSON>Boy George</PERSON>, the king like a contemporary politician,
his generals like generals, his enemies like partisans.;    "I want the actors
to speak in their own voices," says <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON>, the 40-year-old Australian who
came here to direct "Merry Wives of <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION>" in <DATE>1983</DATE>, who planned to stay two
years and instead became artistic director in <DATE>1987.</DATE>;    "In their own voices"
sounds so simple, but it leads to larger iconoclasms: the willingness to take
risks, challenge the text, be just a little anarchic. These are things
Shakespeare/Santa <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> takes for granted as its birthright.;    In the
beginning, founding director <ORGANIZATION>Audrey Stanley</ORGANIZATION> wanted to pay homage to her late
colleague, the respected Shakespearean scholar <PERSON>C.L. Barber</PERSON>, and to give
something tangible to UC-Santa <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> students. So every <DATE>summer</DATE>, there have been
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Shakespeare Company</ORGANIZATION> guests, who teach and coach as well as act. Since
<DATE>1985</DATE>, the festival also has had an increasing complement of Equity
(professional) actors.;    The <DATE>1991</DATE> season is the festival's 10th. It opens
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> with (what else in a commemorative year?) "A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Night</ORGANIZATION>'s Dream"
in the glen; continues indoors with "Our Town," the quintessential American
play, opening next <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and "Measure for Measure," one of the most
difficult of the problem comedies, with its opposed forces of license and
repression; and ends outdoors with the work that most defines 20th-century
art, "Waiting for Godot," in which the fragrant and shady glen will adopt the
persona of "A country road. A tree. Evening.";    All will run in repertory
through <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, with a brief adjournment Aug. <DATE>24-25</DATE> for "Midsummer" to play
at <PERSON>Villa Montalvo</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Saratoga.</LOCATION>;    <LOCATION>Barber</LOCATION>, who died in <DATE>1980</DATE>, is known for a
book-length essay on the vis comica of the <ORGANIZATION>Bard</ORGANIZATION>, the lighter face of the
two-faced mask of Thespis. It's called "Shakespeare's Festival Comedies.";   
<PERSON>Shakespeare/Santa Cruz</PERSON> is the place where the festive comedies (as well as the
tragedies, the histories, the romances and a lot of other plays not by
<ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>) come off the page, played here as delicately as wind chimes and
there as broadly as vaudeville. In <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> is shamelessly
alive.;     Shakespeare/Santa Cruz; Repertory: 'A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Night</ORGANIZATION>'s Dream'

<LEADPARA>  ALTHOUGH my editors over at World Headquarters think of Santa Cruz as a suburb
of San Jose, most of us here in Surf City realize we are, in fact, part of
Greater Honolulu. I suspect that I'm one of many Santa Cruzans who make more
visits to and spend more time in Hawaii every year than San Jose -- as lovely
and nearby as the Garden City may be.;    Having just returned from what must
have been my 18th or 19th visit to the Islands, I thought I'd update you on
what's been going on in Honolulu and environs in recent days.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LEI ASIDE SURF CITY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     WE got there just as the tail end of Hurricane Fefa was petering out in the
<LOCATION>mid-Pacific</LOCATION>. It brought some rain, followed by one of those bouts of muggy
<LOCATION>Kona</LOCATION> weather with no cooling trade winds to keep things comfortable. My pal
<PERSON>Rick Carroll</PERSON>, who used to work for this newspaper and now writes and does
public relations on <LOCATION>Oahu</LOCATION>, put a good spin on the hot, humid day, though. "It's
like a good day in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>," he opined.;    <PERSON>Rick</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Marcie</PERSON>, used to
be locals over here. Rick lived in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and worked in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Chronicle</ORGANIZATION> after leaving the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>. Marcie also worked at the <ORGANIZATION>Chron</ORGANIZATION> after
some years as a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION>Monterey Peninsula Herald</ORGANIZATION>. Both have a lot of
friends in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, and both asked me to pass along their
alohas.;    <PERSON>Rick Carroll</PERSON>, you might recall, uncovered the yarn about <PERSON>Marty</PERSON> the
<PERSON>Marijuana Mouse</PERSON>, the rodent who supposedly was gnawing his way through the
evidence locker at the <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Police Department</ORGANIZATION> a decade or so ago.;   
Soon, <PERSON>Rick</PERSON>'s latest book, on the great outdoor adventures of <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, will be
published in <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;    Strolling along Kalakaua Avenue each day, on
the way to the shave ice stand at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center</ORGANIZATION>, I
discovered an alarming trend that won't, I hope, make it to the mainland,
especially to <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>: large numbers of young men prowling the sidewalks
with giant parrots on their shoulders. I think some of the guys who used to
hand out time-share brochures or <ORGANIZATION>Hare Krishna</ORGANIZATION> tracts must have had midlife
career changes and gotten into birds instead.;    (There are, of course, some
shave ice outlets in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, but so far none has seemed authentic to me.
Instead of shaving little flakes from a big block of ice, the new machines
here -- and, unfortunately, at some Hawaiian locales as well -- seem to crush
ice cubes instead. The resulting heap of slush doesn't hold the flavored
syrups as well as the genuine article -- "da kine," as they would say in
pidgin.);    ANYWAY, there have always been one or two guys with colorful
macaws standing along <LOCATION>Kalakaua</LOCATION>. Their shtick is to befriend tourists, then
charge the rubes a couple of bucks if they want to take a picture of
themselves with the parrot as a prop.;    (A frighteningly high proportion of
the tourist population seems willing to part with cash in order to get a
snapshot of Mom with a large bird on her shoulder.);    A positive trend is
showing up in the Hawaiian shirt business. Aloha shirtmakers, led by the folks
at <ORGANIZATION>Paradise Found</ORGANIZATION>, are using fabrics that look and feel so much like the
material used during the heydays of the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and <DATE>'50s</DATE> that there's really no
need anymore to look at expensive antique garments. (A good aloha shirt from
the <DATE>'40s</DATE> can run you <MONEY>several hundred dollars</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> these days. I know; I
collect Hawaiian shirts the way some people collect baseball cards.);    As
always, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> calls. I consider it my home away from home. When I win the
lotto, you'll probably find me in the Islands as often as in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. I'll
be the guy in the <ORGANIZATION>Mercury News</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Honolulu</LOCATION> bureau, covering things for our
readers in <LOCATION>Surf City.</LOCATION>;    In the meantime, aloha!  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  OCEAN; BIRD; DEATH; POPULATION; DECREASE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Pelicans and cormorants, two of the most visible and popular of the sea birds
that live and fish off the shores of Monterey Bay, are dying by the dozens and
perhaps the hundreds off the coast.;    "We've had maybe 30 dead birds here,"
Patricia Wilson, director of wildlife at the Native Animal Rescue headquarters
in Santa Cruz, said Monday, "but we've heard reports that there may be
hundreds of dead ones out there.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SEA BIRDS DYING; SCIENTISTS PUZZLED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "They're sick and dying, and we don't know why.";    Sick pelicans and
cormorants, she said, could be brought to <ORGANIZATION>Native Animal Rescue</ORGANIZATION> for treatment
-- which includes doses of vitamin B-1 to counteract possible thiamine
deficiencies.;    Dead birds, she said, are shipped to the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game wildlife investigations laboratory in <LOCATION>Rancho Cordova</LOCATION>, where
carcasses are analyzed -- so far without success -- in an attempt to determine
what is killing them.;    She said most of the sick and dead sea birds have
been found between <ORGANIZATION>Natural Bridges State Beach</ORGANIZATION> at the far west end of <LOCATION>Santa
Cruz</LOCATION> and 30th Avenue, near Pleasure Point.;    <PERSON>Ray Jenkins</PERSON>, superintendent of
state parks in the county, also said most of the deaths occurred in the area
off <LOCATION>Santa Cruz.</LOCATION>;    "We've had just a few, just a little more than normal"
between the county's north coast and the <LOCATION>Pajaro River</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said.;   
Although she said she didn't want to theorize about what was killing the
birds, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> noted that pelicans have been gorging themselves on vast schools
of anchovies that have arrived in the bay waters off <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> in recent
weeks.;    "Some fish," she said, "have an enzyme that can break down vitamin
B-1. That's why we're treating a possible thiamine deficiency.";    She said
it is possible that large numbers of birds congregating in such close quarters
to dive for anchovies create a situation in which disease can spread easily.; 
  <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said that so far, blood tests of dead birds seem to indicate they are
not dying of a bacterial disease that killed scores of local pelicans a few
years ago. That bacterial disease, she said, apparently was carried in fish
slime and seemed particularly to affect birds near <LOCATION>Fisherman</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Wharf</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Monterey.</LOCATION>;    A sick pelican can be captured, she said, by dropping a towel or
other piece of cloth over it. She described cormorants as "unapproachable
until they're almost dead.";    Asked to describe symptoms of the illness,
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said:;    "With pelicans, you'll see them leaning back on their tails,
twisting their heads around, contorting their necks and heads. Sometimes their
feet curl up. They may flip over onto their backs. In the water, they twist
their heads around if they're ill.";    <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> noted that pelicans, whose
numbers have increased greatly since dropping to a dangerously low level two
decades ago, are still an endangered species. The birds, she said, are
susceptible to the pesticide DDT -- which, although banned in this country, is
still sprayed on fields near pelican breeding grounds in <LOCATION>Mexico.</LOCATION>;    <ORGANIZATION>Native
Animal Rescue</ORGANIZATION> is located in the <ORGANIZATION>SPCA</ORGANIZATION> animal shelter on Rodriguez Street off
Seventh Avenue.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CRUZ; PLANNING; CITY; REPAIR; INCREASE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Hoping to present design consultants and city leaders with a mental picture of
how an ideal post-earthquake Santa Cruz would look, a non-profit advisory
board of prominent Santa Cruz citizens Tuesday night unveiled plans for a
Shangri-La by the Sea.;    Vision Santa Cruz's eight-page document is the
product of six months of debates, questionnaire-collecting and public input.
Although general in tone, the "Vision Statement" is uncompromisingly Santa
Cruzan in character. It describes a rejuvenated city with sweeping
improvements in housing, cultural events, commerce and urban design, all the
while emphasizing that the new downtown serve as "a living room for the entire
city" that encourages people to get out of their cars and walk the streets
with their neighbors.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ADVISORY BOARD UNVEILS PLAN FOR SHANGRI-LA
BY THE SEA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "If we don't have grand dreams, then we can't hope to achieve even the
smallest parts of them," said <PERSON>Laura Perry</PERSON>, a city planner and housing expert
who works as Vision <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON>'s only paid staffer.;    According to the
document, <ORGANIZATION>Vision Santa Cruz</ORGANIZATION>'s rebuilt city would include:;    (check) A
pedestrian-oriented and economically vibrant central business district along
<LOCATION>Pacific Avenue</LOCATION>, Church, <LOCATION>Locust</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> streets, comprised predominantly of
two and three story buildings but including several taller structures.;   
(check) Dense downtown housing up and down the <ORGANIZATION>Garden Mall</ORGANIZATION> that caters to
low-and middle-income residents.;    (check) Expanded cultural facilities,
including a Performing Arts Center on the banks of the <LOCATION>San Lorenzo River</LOCATION>; an
Art and <ORGANIZATION>History Museum</ORGANIZATION> in the abandoned jail building on Front Street and
plentiful outdoor art shows and concerts.;    (check) A streetscape rich in
native trees and flowers. Sidewalk cafes, street vending, outdoor performance
areas, and other public conveniences such as benches, planters, abundant
bicycle racks and public restrooms also are included.;    Vision <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON> is
an advisory body that was formed after the quake to collect citizen input and
to make recommendations about how to rebuild <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>. Its 36-member board
includes public officials such as Mayor <PERSON>Jane Yokoyama</PERSON>, downtown business
owners, housing experts and representatives from the arts and social welfare
communities.;    The Vision Statement is available at the Vision <PERSON>Santa Cruz</PERSON>
office, <DATE>1543</DATE> Pacific Avenue, and will be open for public comment at a downtown
recovery citizen study session at <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> at the Civic Auditorium.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Opera singer <PERSON>Enrico Caruso</PERSON>, asleep in the
Palace Hotel when the Great Earthquake struck in <DATE>1906</DATE>, was so
unnerved by the shaker that he ran into the streets in his nightie
shouting, ``I'll never come back.''
   He caught a ferry to <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> and never did return.
   But the artists, actors, musicians and performance managers who
experienced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s big quake vowed their shows would go on _
eventually, somewhere. Some of the promises couldn't be kept.
   ``The music or the arts, what they're about is the spirit of
life. ... It imparts something uniquely human; it kind of reminds
people that there a great richness to being alive,' ' said
singer-performer <PERSON>David Byrne</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Talking Heads</ORGANIZATION>, who is touring
to promote his new solo album ``Rei Mommo.''
   After watching television reports of the earthquake while
backstage in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Byrne</PERSON> canceled this week's shows at <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Warfield</ORGANIZATION>.
   The concerts were rescheduled to <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and moved to the
Greek Theater in <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, but the likelihood of rain later forced
a cancellation there. Ticketholders were offered refunds.
   Elsewhere in the city, the cultural center of <LOCATION>Northern
California</LOCATION>, performers struggled through traffic jams and
cordoned-off sections of the city to attend rehearsals.
   All 106 members of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION> made it to a <TIME>7
p.m.</TIME> rehearsal <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, including 17 who battled enormous traffic
snarls on the east side of <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION>.
   ``We have a big responsibility to the community to energize,
give them the impetus to get on with their lives,'' said <PERSON>David
Neuman</PERSON>, a 31-year-old clarinetist with the symphony. ``The show in
general must go in, meaning life.''
   On the rock scene, <PERSON>George Clinton</PERSON>'s weekend concerts were
postponed until <DATE>December</DATE>; <PERSON>Deborah Harry</PERSON>'s <DATE>Sunday</DATE> concert was
indefinitely postponed; <ORGANIZATION>Oingo Boingo</ORGANIZATION>'s concert <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>
was canceled, and <PERSON>Stevie Nicks</PERSON>'s concert <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> was opened to
ticketholders from <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s canceled performance.
   ``It doesn't seem quite right to produce an event in the middle
of a catastrophe, having people walk by buildings that have just
been condemned,'' said rock impresario <PERSON>Bill Graham</PERSON>, who canceled
nine concerts after the quake.
   Theatrical productions were disrupted, but most shows were to
resume early next week.
   Mayor Art Agnos encouraged <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> area art
institutions to reschedule performances soon, but cautioned them
not ``rush to open before people are ready, otherwise it would e a
distraction rather than a relief.''
   The <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> premieres of the traveling musical
``Les Miserables'' were canceled after a water tank atop the Curran
Theater broke and drenched the stage.
   At the landmark <ORGANIZATION>Geary Theater</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American Conservatory
Theater</ORGANIZATION>'s production of ``Right Mind,'' a multi-media presentation,
was ended after a giant light rack crashed onto the stage and large
plaster chunks fell from the ceiling. A recording for people
holding ACT tickets warned theater-goers: ``Be careful out there.''
   The troupe's upcoming production of a ``Tale of Two Cities'' may
be postponed, said <PERSON>John Sullivan</PERSON>, ACT managing director. Classes
for 200 students at ACT's prestigious drama school were postponed
through <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Stairwell damage to the Golden Gate Theatre forced cancellation
of the musical ``Durante'' through <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION>'s performance of <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s ``Idomeneo''
on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was canceled after windows and the glass front door blew
out of the <ORGANIZATION>War Memorial Opera House</ORGANIZATION>.
   The opera moved out of the baroque <ORGANIZATION>War Memorial Opera House</ORGANIZATION>
while structural engineers continued to check the building, whose
seats were littered with chunks of ceiling plaster.
   Performances were moved at least through the weekend to the
<ORGANIZATION>Masonic Auditorium</ORGANIZATION>, where only soloists would be in costume.
Productions there would have no scenery and a minimum of props.
   ``If the mundane things are not going on, at least the spiritual
things are continuing,'' said <PERSON>Lotfi Mansouri</PERSON>, general director of
the opera, which in its 57-year history had never had a change of
venue. ``We want to rally the people, and get them to look to
rebuilding. Our function is to prove to everybody that the spirt of
the city goes on.,''
   The opera and the symphony will give a free joint concert in
<LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, performing <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven's Ninth Symphony</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's a work that contains every emotion; despair, happiness,
tragedy, hope and joy,'' said <PERSON>Peter Pastreich</PERSON>, executive director
of the symphony. ``We think all of those feelings of a disaster are
there in this music.''
   Most of the art museums in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> suffered only slight
damage to priceless collections, but at least 33 pieces at the
Asian Art Museum were damaged, for a loss estimated in the
millions, according to <PERSON>Clarence Shangraw</PERSON>.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Art Museum</ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON>Phil Mumma</PERSON> said a
4-foot-tall jade figurine toppled in its case and was broken into
several hundred pieces. He did not have a loss estimate.
   ``A lot of the pieces, even if they have a dollar value, you
can't replace,'' he said. ``You may have the money, but you don't
have the object.''

<LEADPARA>  To the stirring strains of fight songs played by the Santa Cruz High School
marching band, a crowd of 200 Surf City luminaries and taxpayers gathered
Tuesday at the edge of the San Lorenzo River for a half hour of hoopla
celebrating the opening of the new Riverside Avenue bridge.;    The span,
which cost more than $8 million to design and build, is a replacement for the
bridge destroyed by the Loma Prieta earthquake. Because the damage was caused
by the quake, almost all of the tab for the project was picked up by the
federal and state governments.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     On hand under gray, wintry skies, as Mayor <PERSON>Jane Yokoyama</PERSON> gave a brief
speech and cut a ribbon marking the reopening of the main route to the beach
and boardwalk, were business bigwigs, local politicos, <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> media mavens
and the usual smattering of people who talk to themselves.;    As the mayor
spoke, reciting a litany of thanks to various council colleagues and other
public officials and bureaucrats for their roles in putting up the new bridge,
the marquees of motels more or less isolated since the <DATE>Oct. 17, 1989</DATE>, temblor
beckoned from across the <LOCATION>San Lorenzo</LOCATION>. Operators of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Six</ORGANIZATION>, Budget 8,
<PERSON>Mardi Gras</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> Pan and other beach-area motels have been marking time since
the earthquake, waiting for traffic to return across the river.;    Beyond the
strip of motels, the elegant hills and gullies of the <ORGANIZATION>Giant Dipper</ORGANIZATION> roller
coaster invited us toward the boardwalk.;    <ORGANIZATION>Seaside Co.</ORGANIZATION> officials, also on
the verge of ecstasy with the reopening of the direct route to their amusement
park, handed out chocolate-coated bridge mix (bridge mix, get it?).;    After
a fanfare from the high school band, which had played at the opening of the
old bridge in <DATE>1936</DATE>, a beaming <PERSON>Yokoyama</PERSON> proudly announced that the new
structure is 275 feet long, 73 feet wide and 30 feet tall. It has four lanes,
one more than the old bridge. It boasts bike lanes, sidewalks and some
overlooks where weary pedestrians can stop for a spell and gaze down into the
shallow trickle of the <LOCATION>San Lorenzo.</LOCATION>;    A new traffic pattern also has been
inaugurated on either side of the new bridge -- a scheme that has drawn fire
from some Pearl Street residents who have complained that their narrow lane
has been turned into a thoroughfare.;    The new circulation plan -- which has
Ocean Street one-way northbound between the river and <PERSON>Barson</PERSON> Street -- has
diverted many motorists onto <LOCATION>Pearl</LOCATION>. The city's plan calls for drivers who used
to turn left off Ocean onto <LOCATION>East Cliff</LOCATION> to go west on <PERSON>Barson</PERSON> and south on
Riverside before turning east onto East Cliff.;    But <LOCATION>Pearl Street</LOCATION> has become
a shortcut.;    City employees were busy <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> morning handing out notices
to neighborhood residents telling them of a traffic commission meeting tonight
to look at problems caused by the new system of one-way streets. Alternatives
the commission will look at include making one lane of Ocean Street available
for southbound traffic; changing <LOCATION>Pearl Street</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bixby</PERSON> Street and <LOCATION>Canfield
Avenue</LOCATION> to one-way northbound; or leaving things the way they are.;    The
traffic commission meeting will get under way at <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> at the city council
chambers in <LOCATION>City Hall.</LOCATION>;    The mayor cut the ribbon, the band played and
everyone moseyed across to the other side.;    The first dog across the new
bridge was <LOCATION>Tenaya</LOCATION>, a yellow Labrador retriever owned by <PERSON>Debbie Malkin.</PERSON>;   
First bicyclist was former <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Councilman Bruce Van Allen</ORGANIZATION>. First person
to walk a bicycle across was local political activist <PERSON>Bob Hall.</PERSON>;    The first
motorist to drive across the new bridge was <PERSON>Jack Ownbey</PERSON>, 70, whose van sported
a yellow ribbon on its antenna and a small version of the Stars and Stripes on
the dashboard.;    As we walked, the rain began to fall.  </TEXT>

On Film: Love and the Single Android
---
By Julie Salamon</HL>
<DD> 04/09/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON>, the heroine of "Making <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON>," is a tough and efficient, but pointedly feminine, executive -- a throwback to the "career gals" of '50s comedies (<PERSON>Kay Thompson</PERSON>'s fashion mag editor in "Funny Face" comes to mind). 
Wearing a striking black and red dress and matching shoes, <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON> dashes into a meeting. 
"Hi gentleman. 
Sorry to keep you waiting," she says, a little breathlessly. 
"I'm always late." 
Then, coyly: "But I'm worth it." 

   Like almost everything else about "Making <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON>," <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON> is both post-modern and retro. 
She's settled for an exciting career and a humdrum boyfriend, but she still harbors fantasies about the perfect man -- the kind <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> has always awarded its romantic-comedy heroines. 
But she discovers that the only way to find a perfect man these days is in the lab: <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON> is an android. 

   More on him later. 
In <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON>, at least, director <PERSON>Susan Seidelman</PERSON> and comedienne <PERSON>Ann Magnuson</PERSON> have created a great character. 
Physically, <PERSON>Ms. Magnuson</PERSON> -- a performance artist and actress -- could be <PERSON>Shirley MacLaine</PERSON>'s daughter or <PERSON>Michael J. Fox</PERSON>'s sister, with her crinkly eyes and wise-guy gumption. 
She's got the smart girl's version of what they used to call "it." 
If this, her first major film role, is any indication, the husky-voiced charmer is off to a promising movie career. 

   Director <PERSON>Seidelman</PERSON> is still something of a cinematic debutante herself. (This is her third film.) 
One of only a handful of female directors working in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, she casts an affectionate, amused eye on the foibles of modern women better and more acutely than anyone else making movies today. 
During the opening credits of "Desperately Seeking <PERSON>Susan</PERSON>," her last film, she showed us women sitting under hairdryers, painting their toenails, having their legs waxed. 

   As "Making <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON>" opens, we see <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON> driving her red convertible to work (she's late), shaving her armpits with an electric razor. 
When she's down in the dumps, she takes solace in a pint of ice cream and a Diet <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Whenever <PERSON>Frankie</PERSON> is at center stage, especially during the spry first half of this likable picture, <PERSON>Ms. Seidelman</PERSON> keeps a firm grip on her light comedy -- without squashing the froth. 
She shot the picture among the old Art Deco hotels of lower <ORGANIZATION>Collins Avenue</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION>, a nice backdrop for the story's wistful yet ironic vision of romance. 
Cinematographer <PERSON>Edward Lachman</PERSON> heightens the nostalgic aura with his "dated" Technicolor-bright light (the same look he gave <PERSON>David Byrne</PERSON>'s "True Stories"). 

   Like <PERSON>Mr. Byrne</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ms. Seidelman</PERSON> uses her bemused fascination with TV as a running joke (a good one) throughout the movie. 
Almost everyone ends up plopped down in front of a TV -- or on it, as part of a story on the nightly news everyone else is watching. 
Frankie's best friend is the unhappy wife of a daytime television hunk, the star of "<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>," a soap opera specializing in sadomasochistic episodes. 
There is good music here, too, in the fine, inventive score with its electro-Latino beat. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Seidelman</PERSON> has picked up a lot of technique since she made "Smithereens," a low-budget, imaginative picture about a <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> girl hanging around the punk scene of <LOCATION>Lower Manhattan</LOCATION>, waiting to become famous. 
"Making <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON>" is her slickest movie -- and also her least satisfying. 
It has plenty of charm, but loses its snap along the way. 
The story, by <PERSON>Floyd Byars</PERSON> and <PERSON>Laurie Frank</PERSON>, flounders among subplots meant to enhance the good-man-is-hard-to-find theme. 

   However, the more serious problem lies with <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON> himself. 
<PERSON>John Malkovich</PERSON> plays two parts: <PERSON>Dr. Peters</PERSON>, the scientist who isn't mad, just a woman-hater, and <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>, the sweet, sentimental android. 
Frankie, an "image consultant," meets them both after she's hired to sell the idea of sending <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> on a space mission to the public. 

   Either because of the way the scientist's part is written, or the way <PERSON>Mr. Malkovich</PERSON> plays it, or both, <PERSON>Dr. Peters</PERSON> is too much of an airheaded <PERSON>Caspar Milquetoast</PERSON> to be a plausible villain, too insubstantial to serve as a satirical vision of the "perfectly" unemotional man. 

   As <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>, the soft-hearted android, <PERSON>Mr. Malkovich</PERSON> radiates the placid serenity of someone who's undergone a frontal lobotomy. 
He sighs at stars and utters banalities about the wonders of the world in a very soft voice. 
That's all very nice, but you never for a minute believe that this goofy bag of motor parts could be anyone's dream man. 

   But if <PERSON>Mr. Right</PERSON> isn't all he's cracked up to be, his girlfriend is worth a detour all by herself. 

   ---
   If nothing else, "The Secret of My Success" is certainly the trendiest movie of the moment. 

   It stars <PERSON>Michael J. Fox</PERSON>, the cute, clean-cut heart throb of teens and grandmas alike. 
It was co-authored with <PERSON>A.J. Carothers</PERSON> by <PERSON>Jim Cash</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Epps Jr.</PERSON>, the "hot" screenwriting team of "Legal Eagles" and "Top Gun." 

   At a time when <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> is remaking French bedroom farces with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stars, "The Secret of My Success" skipped the bothersome translation problems: It's a home-grown bedroom farce. 
Trendiest of all is the central plot device: a hostile takeover. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Fox</PERSON> gamely runs through his paces as the young man from <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> who quickly proceeds to the top of the corporate ladder. 
He's charming, but seems much younger than he is and should be spared from having to play romantic leading man. 
<PERSON>Helen Slater</PERSON> is sweet, but a little bland, as the pretty Harvard-trained executive and love interest. 
What all of this adds up to is a harmless, if lazy, little frolic. 
I say lazy because the picture skips along, as it should, then pauses -- far too long, long enough to kill the comic momentum. 
Then it skips again. 
And pauses again. 
And so on.

   Cabrillo Festival: New Music in Garlic Land
   ----

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10

<LP>
   Santa Cruz, Calif. -- The most dramatic way to approach
Santa Cruz is by driving west, entering the coastal region
through Gilroy, the garlic capital of the world. The aroma of
a dozen Little Italys penetrates a car's closed windows. The
radio suddenly seems overrun by new-age music stations and
earnest '60s-style Berkeley radicals. When the ocean appears,
its spectacular beauty takes your breath away.
   It's a particularly appropriate route to take if you
happen to be headed for the Cabrillo Music Festival, where
pre-concert pastries include such local specialties as
garlic-bread pudding, where a Saturday-night concert can pair
a fine performance of a Benjamin Britten song cycle with the
work of a tedious new-age Turk, and where a pervasive '60s
informality can be both endearing and infuriating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Cabrillo festival was begun 29 years ago by the dean
of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> composers, the wonderfully lyric and
unpredictably multicultural <PERSON>Lou Harrison</PERSON>, as a quirky
chamber-music series in a coffee-house hangout for <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo
College</ORGANIZATION> students in nearby <LOCATION>Aptos</LOCATION>. It grew quickly, moving to
the college itself and later to a convivial circus tent on a
thrilling site at the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, overlooking the sparkling bay.
   In <DATE>1974</DATE>, it hired an up-and-coming young conductor, <PERSON>Dennis
Russell Davies</PERSON>, then music director of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul Chamber
Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> put together a first-rate small
orchestra, invited world-class composers each year,
commissioned and premiered important work and created
arresting programs. One year, for instance, he featured works
in every concert by <ORGANIZATION>Ravel</ORGANIZATION>, the American eclecticist <PERSON>William
Bolcom</PERSON> and the eccentric Estonian minimalist Arvo Part.
   Meanwhile, however, the festival has fallen on leaner
times. For the first time in 17 years, <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> -- who is
now music director of the city of <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, as well as of the
<LOCATION>Brooklyn Philharmonic</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>American Composers Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> --
took a sabbatical, leaving his future involvement with the
festival uncertain.
   The festival itself has the same economic troubles every
small-scale arts organization has these days, and it has
hired new management to address the situation. No longer able
to afford its sensational site, it has moved to the unwieldy
and acoustically unflattering Civic Auditorium in depressing
downtown <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>.
   But the festival's spirit survives, and it continues to
offer two of the most thoughtful and original <DATE>summer</DATE> musical
weekends anywhere in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   Actually, this year's festival looked, on paper,
considerably more conventional than it generally does when
<PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> programs it. But, thanks to a brilliant stroke, it
wasn't. By inviting the composer <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> as guest
director, <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION> ensured that however common the
repertoire, it would be filtered through the sensibility of a
controversial composer who is also proving to be an
interesting conductor. He is best known for his operas "Nixon
in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>" and the new "The Death of Klinghoffer," which
reaches the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> next month at the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Academy of Music</ORGANIZATION>.
Often cast as a minimalist, <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> employs minimalist
repetition as only one facet of his multistylistic approach,
which can include everything from American swing to
Schoenbergian dissonance. At <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION>, he showed himself to
be simply uncategorizable.
   He began the festival's second and more elaborate weekend,
the one I attended, with the American premiere of his "Eros
Piano," a moving short elegiac score for piano and chamber
orchestra that sounds a little bit like the '50s jazz of <PERSON>Bill
Evans</PERSON> meeting the mystical sweetness of <PERSON>Olivier Messiaen</PERSON>. He
followed that with the ravishing second act of <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s
seldom-played ballet, "The Prince of the Pagodas," with its
glamorous orchestral imitation of Balinese gamelan. He wound
up the program with a performance of <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>'s
"Petroushka" that emphasized the music's rhythmic bite and
brash orchestral colors, unlike most glossy modern orchestral
accounts.
   It was a canny Cabrillo evening. <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> bowed toward
the multicultural impulses that have always characterized the
festival -- much of <PERSON>Mr. Harrison</PERSON>'s music is inspired by the
gamelan. He offered a fresh look at <LOCATION>Britten</LOCATION>, a composer who,
like <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>, spent his career coming to his own individual
terms with modernism. And he presented some insight into his
own striking musical personality, which vacillates from the
gloomy to the glitzy in fascinating ways.
   Occasionally <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>'s instincts went awry, however, as
they did in a big way on his weirdly devised Saturday-night
program. The first half consisted of a terrific performance
of <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s stern, seldom-heard "Songs and Proverbs of
<PERSON>William Blake</PERSON>," sung with a riveting sensitivity to every
word by the baritone <PERSON>Sanford Sylvan</PERSON> and accompanied with
wondrous fluidity by the pianist <PERSON>Richard Goode</PERSON>. But it was
followed by nearly an hour's worth of needless noodling from
the Turkish-born <PERSON>Nazim Ozel</PERSON>, who plucks away on all 400
strings he has strung on a branch of a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> live oak he
calls the "Semi-Civilized Tree."
   Earlier that day there was a delightfully noncondescending
family concert featuring the witty <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Beal &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the
local choreographer collaborating with <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> for a
mysterious and mildly risque version of <ORGANIZATION>Milhaud</ORGANIZATION>'s "La
Creation du Monde." The next evening was mixed: <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> led
a driving, properly disturbing account of <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Sinfonia
da Requiem"; <PERSON>Mr. Sylvan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> became emotionally
overwrought in Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder"; <PERSON>Mr. Goode</PERSON>
offered one of his typically nuanced renditions of <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s
Piano Concerto No. 25, with <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> accompanying solidly.
   Missing, for the first time in memory, was anything by <PERSON>Mr.
Harrison</PERSON>, who still reigns as the informal paterfamilias of
the festival. But a CD of <PERSON>Mr. Harrison</PERSON>'s gorgeous <ORGANIZATION>Third
Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, performed by <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music
Festival Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>, was just released on <ORGANIZATION>Music Masters</ORGANIZATION>. No
one else today writes orchestral music as rapturous as this,
or combines musical cultures as effectively. And no place is
better for producing such music as <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION>.

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CRUZ; THEATER; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  'A MIDSUMMER Night's Dream," which opened Shakespeare/Santa Cruz's 10th season
this weekend, is a merry romp, though it misses the inspired lunacy of "The
Comedy of Errors" (1988), which also was directed by Danny Scheie.;    What
made "Comedy" tick was its single-mindedness. With just nine actors,
everything had to be reduced for their number. Two guys played their own twin
brothers (there being no one else to play them), and everyone took multiple
roles, which required much doffing of costumes under breakneck circumstances.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'MIDSUMMER' GETS CARRIED AWAY
PRODUCTION GOES HEAVY ON GAGS AND UNDERWEAR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Gender switching;  "Midsummer," by contrast, tries to do too many things.
Using the play as a metaphor for theater is a wonderful conceit; using it to
"prove" dubious assumptions about gender roles is less successful.;    Scheie
(pronounced shay) juices up the common doubling of Theseus/Oberon and
Hippolyta/Titania by crossing their genders, so the actor playing Theseus
(<PERSON>Michael Rogers</PERSON>) goes into drag as <LOCATION>Titania</LOCATION>, and the actress playing <LOCATION>Hippolyta</LOCATION>
(<PERSON>Megan Cole</PERSON>) assumes the mantle of Oberon.;    While this isn't nearly as
funny as the director thinks it is, the fairy attendants more than compensate.
They're played by beefy guys in scanty outfits with gauze wings pinned to
their backs. Funniest of all is their leader (Tom Graves), who mouths the
words to <ORGANIZATION>Mendelssohn</ORGANIZATION>'s lullaby, using his magic wand as a mike.;    All the
nonsense of mixed-up lovers, quarrelsome spouses and the rude mechanicals
rehearsing their "tedious brief comedy" takes place on a brilliant,
self-effacing set by <PERSON>Mike Edwards</PERSON> (not the artistic director of the festival
but its erstwhile properties manager).;    It consists of a main ground
platform and several smaller ones up in the trees of the redwood glen. The
whole superstructure of the set is rope -- bridges, cargo nets, flying wires
for Puck and the fairies, a dumbwaiter to take Titania's bower (a garden seat)
up and down. It is what used to be called a hemp house -- as all theaters were
in the days before electric pulleys and winches.;    Winged stagehands;  The
production delights in its old-fashioned theatricality. Common stage tricks --
trap doors, flying harnesses, flowers with squeegee stems that douse their
victims with real water instead of fairy dust -- occur in plain view. The only
people who can't see the jokes coming are those in the play.;    It's a
terrific idea, well carried out by all hands -- and I mean that literally, for
the stagehands, who wear gauze wings over their black T-shirts and jeans, are
an indispensable part of the humor as they raise and lower the fairies with
counterweights and "fly" Puck across the glen. Emblazoned on their T-shirts is
a strange device that seems to be an insect at the pupa stage. "Of course!"
said my friend. "They're fairies who haven't hatched yet.";    The poetry gets
a tad lost in all this, and the acting suffers in some measure. This
production confirms what I've felt over the years: that <PERSON>Scheie</PERSON> needs a "second
unit director" for the actors, who get but glancing attention as he
choreographs the play around them.;    As the lovers, <PERSON>Luck Hari</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mikael
Salazar</PERSON>, <PERSON>Shannon Kenny</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Stuhlbarg</PERSON> play everything BIG and dramatic,
as teen-agers would. But the girls tend to get a little strident.;    The
mechanicals are a funny lot, led by <PERSON>Daniel Stewart</PERSON>'s hand-wringing <PERSON>Peter
Quince</PERSON> (whose carpenter's toolbox has the legend "Petie Q" stenciled on it).
They include <PERSON>Patrick Chew</PERSON> as rotund, placid, well-named Snug and <PERSON>Michael
Faulkner</PERSON> as <PERSON>Robin Starveling</PERSON>, who never stops stuffing his face.;    They have
a short colleague named Scooter, typecast as the man in the moon's dog. A
method actor, Scooter plumbs his deepest emotional recesses to understand and
portray a dog's feelings.;    <PERSON>Frank Farrell</PERSON>, who has studied at <ORGANIZATION>Ringling
Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' college for clowns, plays the physical side of <ORGANIZATION>Nick Bottom</ORGANIZATION> well. He
isn't nearly as comfortable playing with the text, especially the soliloquy,
"Bottom's dream," which he recites as though neatness counts.;    As <PERSON>Puck</PERSON>, the
festival's founding artistic director, <ORGANIZATION>Audrey Stanley</ORGANIZATION>, is intrepid enough to
fly, but her performance is otherwise without a spark of color.;    <PERSON>Cole</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> have an almost impossible task. Cole is the better off, for her
costumes strongly define her two identities: <LOCATION>Hippolyta</LOCATION>, an <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION>, becomes a
literal <LOCATION>Brunnhilde</LOCATION>, with blond braids and a German accent; and <PERSON>Oberon</PERSON> is cool
and asexual in a sleek navy jumpsuit with a bat-winged cape.;    <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION>, an
imposing Theseus, doesn't know whether to camp it up or play it straight as
Titania, and I think the director is to blame for his confusion.;    Funny
underwear;  B. Modern (yes, that's her real name) created the costumes. The
lovers come straight from a '50s sock hop: <LOCATION>Hermia</LOCATION> in plastic wing-frame
glasses, lace-trimmed anklets and court shoes; <ORGANIZATION>Helena</ORGANIZATION> in tartan skirt, prim
blouse and saddle shoes; crew-cut Demetrius in a preppy sweater. As the kids
spend most of the play in their underwear, Modern has not neglected the girls'
funny foundation garments and the boys' boxer shorts.;    After the <ORGANIZATION>California
Shakespeare Festival</ORGANIZATION>'s chill and joyless production, it's great to see a
"Dream" that's genuinely funny, even if the jokes are telegraphed and the
fairies intentionally cheesy.; A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Night</ORGANIZATION>'s Dream; By <PERSON>William

<P>
The slightness of <PERSON>Tina Howe</PERSON>'s "Coastal Disturbances" may come as a surprise to 
playgoers who have heard the raves from the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>. Though it is a common failing 
of daily-newspaper critics to weave skeins of high-flown praise around some of 
the most slender stage fare, one expected a work of shimmering subtleties at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
But, as revealed by an ambitious, cleverly conceived and well-directed 
production at <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santiago College</ORGANIZATION>, this Off-Broadway import comes across in 
its <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> premiere as a pleasant, sometimes volatile, frequently 
whimsical play that -- if it were on television -- might be labeled a soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
It depicts a week on a private <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> beach frequented by three women, two 
children and an elderly couple, all watched over by a strapping lifeguard. The 
disturbances of the title reflect their feelings, a kaleidoscope of moods as 
variable as the ocean breezes of late <DATE>summer</DATE>. Sudden gusts of emotion ruffle 
the surface of their mundane lives, exposing failures of the past and fragile 
hopes for the future. The present seems a brief and not altogether successful 
respite from both. 
</P>
<P>
Teeming with digressions, "Coastal Disturbances" revolves chiefly around a 
romance that blossoms between outdoorsy <PERSON>Leo Hart</PERSON>, the always solicitous 
lifeguard who perches above the sand dunes on his wooden platform, and artsy 
<PERSON>Holly Dancer</PERSON>, the neurasthenic photographer who has come to the beach for a few 
days to pull herself together. Holly, having been ignored by her lover back in 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and denied a show at his art gallery, says she's having a breakdown. 
It's unclear whether she's serious. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the play's texture is delicate and fragile, though not what you would 
call subtle. The production excels, in fact, on the flip side of subtle with an 
environmental setting that packs a double whammy: a silky blanket of 
fine-grained sand that reaches across the stage to suggest a landscape of 
dunes, and a beachside cafe called <PERSON>Geoff</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Snack Shack</ORGANIZATION>, where the audience is 
seated for the show and served real beach food (hot dogs, soft drinks and ice 
cream). 
</P>
<P>
The dual setting has the effect of drawing us into the play and bringing us 
closer to the characters: Faith, a pregnant mother, doing a bit of 
lifeguard-ogling; <ORGANIZATION>Ariel</ORGANIZATION>, a divorcee with an unruly young son, talking of her 
dried-up reproductive organs; their careening kids, <PERSON>Winston</PERSON> and <PERSON>Miranda</PERSON>, who 
take a certain pleasure in aping the adults; <PERSON>Dr. Adams</PERSON>, a retired eye surgeon, 
scavenging for seashells; his wife, <LOCATION>M.J.</LOCATION>, painting seascapes. 
</P>
<P>
Leo, a reassuring presence, is just as ready to help unfurl a beach umbrella as 
he is to administer first aid. No task is too small, no expectation too great. 
Even when it comes to large commitments like love, he seems rock solid. Holly, 
on the other hand, is flyaway as the sand on the beach. Self-absorbed and 
fearful, she is reluctant to get involved with him. But dependable <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> has an 
instinctive fix for that, too. He playfully buries her to the neck in the sand. 
The movement of his hands on her body works like an erotic massage. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Arlo Gates Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Colleen Dunn</PERSON> are both well cast in the leads. And they are 
nicely supported by the rest of the company: <PERSON>Ralph Richmond</PERSON> as <PERSON>Dr. Adam</PERSON>; 
<PERSON>Suzanne Chapman</PERSON> as <LOCATION>M.J.</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Fernanda Thomas</PERSON> as Faith; <PERSON>Cindy Hanks</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Ariel</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Jerome 
Shelton</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Winston</LOCATION>; and <PERSON>Karyn Stevens</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Miranda</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is only in the second act, with the appearance of Holly's lover, <PERSON>Andre</PERSON>, that 
the play takes a particularly awkward turn. The character rings false on all 
levels, though he is clearly intended to be a phony, out-of-sync with <PERSON>Holly</PERSON>, 
the beach and everything that is natural, true and right. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is a walking cliche. It is hard not to snicker at his windy 
speech about his family's emigration from <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> and how he pulled himself up 
by his bootstraps and became an influential art connoisseur. 
</P>
<P>
For another, <PERSON>Trapper Johnson</PERSON>'s portrayal of Andre leaves much to be desired. We 
don't believe for a minute that he is Jewish, suave or worldly. His Frenchified 
accent sounds ridiculous. His double-breasted white suit and black shirt is 
anything but chic. And for all his claims, he doesn't give the least impression 
of being knowledgeable about art or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that <PERSON>Holly</PERSON> buys this egregious impostor says as much about the play's 
weakness as it does about her own flaws. It's passable if we see through <PERSON>Andre</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Holly</PERSON> doesn't, so long as we don't take her for an idiot. But what else can 
we conclude, given her decision at the end of the play? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how many times can <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> come to the rescue? Many more, we are given to 
believe. Will Leo take <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>? Tune in next time . . . 
</P>

FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Weill success at Santa Fe - Paul Griffiths enjoys a
pre-Brecht double bill at the Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opera best made for <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> has to be The Magic Flute: thunderstorms
are almost guaranteed to be rolling around the nearby mountains as the sky
darkens during performances in the open theatre, and <PERSON>Sarastro</PERSON>'s crew are
right at home in a city whose 20th-century psychic history goes back from
the shamanic healers and Eriksonian hypnotists of today to a <DATE>1911</DATE> Masonic
temple shaped as a Moorish fantasy in strawberry mousse.
Almost inevitably, the piece is a regular here. This year's new production,
though, cut away from awesomeness and spirituality to side with <ORGANIZATION>Papageno</ORGANIZATION>'s
vulgar good sense. <PERSON>Marie Anne Chiment</PERSON>'s costumes were on the lurid side of
dreaminess: robes of scarlet and purple for the adepts, snowy fur and little
forehead lights that made the boys look like Christmas-tree decorations.
Reto Nickler's staging provided the pantomime that <PERSON>Mikael Melbye</PERSON>, as
<ORGANIZATION>Papageno</ORGANIZATION>, knew well how to handle. In such a context, <PERSON>Kurt Streit</PERSON>'s handsome
and musically fine <ORGANIZATION>Tamino</ORGANIZATION> provided a challenge that was never resolved.
As on previous occasions, the festival's successes were in areas that the
place would not seem to suit so well. For example, nothing could be less in
harmony with this relaxed, sunny, natural city than the music of <PERSON>Kurt Weill</PERSON>,
and yet it was a double bill of pre-Brecht <PERSON>Weill</PERSON> - The Protagonist and The
Tsar has his Photograph Taken, both to words by <PERSON>Georg Kaiser</PERSON> - that provided
the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Opera</ORGANIZATION> with both its novelty and its sharpest night. The
director <PERSON>Jonathan Eaton</PERSON> and his designer <PERSON>Robert Perdziola</PERSON> set both pieces in
the <DATE>1920s</DATE> of their composition, and so neutralised the costume-drama
tendencies in The Protagonist (as <PERSON>Mr Eaton</PERSON> rightly pointed out, the music
speaks of <LOCATION>Weimar Germany</LOCATION>, not of the libretto's Elizabethan England) while
availing themselves of opportunities for a comic-glamorous look just right
for The Tsar.
Both works ostensibly have to do with persons and personae. The protagonist
of The Protagonist is an actor whose mood is swung by what he happens to be
playing. His sister, who has been his sheet anchor to truth, finds him
rehearsing a piece of slapstick, and judges this will be a good moment to
introduce her secret lover. By the time she returns, however, the play has
been changed, and she spills the news to a man wrapped up in a drama of
sexual jealousy.
In The Tsar people are clear about where roles end and reality begins; it is
the situation that confuses them. The tsar, escaping from public duty for a
moment, wants to flirt with the lady photographer whose studio he has
entered. But the photographer is a disguised anarchist, and her camera is
loaded with a pistol. All through both pieces, then, there is a weapon
waiting to go off: the febrile actor's capacity to carry out in life the
deeds of murderous revenge he executes on the stage, and the weapon in the
photographic apparatus. What makes for catastrophe in The Protagonist is in
The Tsar a joke.
Yet musically the pieces are more similar than that might imply. Writing
very much in the wake of <ORGANIZATION>Busoni</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Hindemith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Weill</PERSON> shared their ideal of
music moving over its own planes aside from the dramatic continuity, and the
<LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Fe double bill pointed up how much of the familiar Brecht-Weill irony
 -the ostinatos, marches and dances, the embittered harmony - came out of
those musical exemplars and was in place before the composer met the
playwright to match him. In accordance with the precedence of pure music -
or rather of impure music - the chief glory of <ORGANIZATION>The Protagonist</ORGANIZATION> is its pair
of mime sequences: spiky wind music for the farce, and ominously seductive
hints from the cello of a slow uncurling line in the tragedy. The score was
beautifully played here under <PERSON>George Manahan</PERSON>.
On the vocal side this opera is, fittingly, a vehicle for the protagonist,
and <PERSON>Jacque Trussel</PERSON> seized it with a fury of intensity. In The Tsar, <PERSON>David
Malis</PERSON> offered a nice contrast of bluff jollity. He was also a ready Marcello
in the charming revival of La Boheme that boasted too a bright <PERSON>Rodolfo</PERSON> from
<PERSON>Martin Thompson</PERSON> and an excellent orchestral performance, perceptive and
sophisticated, under <PERSON>John Keenan</PERSON>.
<PERSON>John Crosby</PERSON>, moving spirit of this festival for 37 years and unashamed
<PERSON>Strauss</PERSON> nut, conducted a luscious Capriccio that was elegantly presented by
the director <PERSON>Willy Decker</PERSON> and designer <PERSON>Wolfgang Gussmann</PERSON> as a play of vivid
facsimiles - 18th-century ladies and gentlemen in white, ivory and silver -
within a blank space of effulgent blue. The frank realism of these people's
behaviour - their evident belief in themselves - was thoroughly beguiling,
and yet they were placed in a nowhere. They were clouds singing about
clouds.
As such they were the perfect creatures for this opera in which the audience
is invited into a long, lingering enjoyment of knowing pretence. All that
was wanted was more cream and radiance in the singing. <PERSON>Sheri Greenawald</PERSON> as
the Countess had a potentially lustrous performance checked by the need to
control flare and vibrato. <PERSON>Mark Thomsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Michael McGuire</PERSON> as the
composer and poet were eager young blades, without suggesting that their
music might exceed expressive need. But <PERSON>Richard Stilwell</PERSON>'s amused urbanity
was entirely enough for the Count, and <PERSON>Eric Halfvarson</PERSON> was ideal as the old
pro La Roche, robustly in command of the interior theatre, the box within a
box, where he offered his dancer and Italian duettists. Whether they all
knew they were similarly on show - personae not persons - was a question
left poised exquisitely in the air.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN conductor Larry Granger studied with the San Francisco Symphony's Herbert
Blomstedt, he was readily confused with Larry Granger of the symphony's cello
section (who is no relation). Both had studied in the California State

who now uses his full name, John Larry Granger -- has been named music
director of the Santa Cruz County Symphony after a two-year search.  </LEADPARA>

offers balanced, rather than spicy-hot, Sichuan cooking  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW; SANTA-CRUZ  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  OF ALL the gifts the University of California campus has bestowed upon Santa
Cruz, liberals and traffic among them, the most blessed may be a restaurant
called O'mei, which blends first-rate Sichuan cooking with Western
influences.;    Those influences include the decor, which eschews
Chinese-restaurant cliches; the desserts, which are heavenly; the music, which
is classic (i.e., pre-"Bitches Brew") jazz; the wine list; and certain aspects
of the cookery, such as the use of feta cheese in a red-pepper appetizer.
(Decor and music, however, are "not untypical of finer restaurants . . . in
Hong Kong and Taiwan," according to co-manager Carol West.)  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  OH ME, O'MEI, IT'S SUBTLE SICHUAN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Restaurants  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     O'mei is the name of a mountain in <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION> province and a common
designation for <ORGANIZATION>Sichuan</ORGANIZATION> restaurants, according to <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>. This one first took
root at UC-Santa <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kresge College</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979.</DATE>;    Owners <PERSON>Roger Grigsby</PERSON> and
<DATE>April</DATE> Shen -- he went from Chinese studies to Chinese cooking at <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>
restaurants; she's Taiwanese and focuses largely on service -- opened a second
O'mei on Mission Street a year and a half later. In <DATE>1984</DATE>, they closed the
campus restaurant.;    O'mei supplements its lengthy basic menu with seasonal
specials. At the time of our visit, these included wok-grilled lamb chops with
garlic, shrimp with corn and chilies, and roasted fresh bacon in two styles --
with seafood in a casserole, and with bean curd.;    We started with three
small appetizer plates from the selection shown us by our waiter -- braised
artichokes in sesame-pepper sauce, red peppers and feta, tofu in chili oil,
<MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> apiece -- as well as a small (<MONEY>$3.95</MONEY>) order of rice-smoked chicken wings
and another (<MONEY>$3.50</MONEY>) of red oil dumplings, which are like potstickers.;   
O'mei's approach to <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION> is subtle and balanced, rather than fiery,
although the artichokes were peppery enough to start one of my companions
coughing. The peppers, in a mild, faintly sweet dressing, would not have been
out of place in an Italian restaurant, while the chicken wings, deeply imbued
with smoke, would put to shame any of those coarse preparations known as
<LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> wings.;    Our main dishes were a seafood pot with braised noodles, a
dish of chopped shrimp with pine nuts and crispy spinach, and an oddity from
the <ORGANIZATION>Spring Specials</ORGANIZATION> list, Chinese black date and sweet potato chicken. All
were <MONEY>$8.95</MONEY>.;    The seafood pot was in the Cantonese style, with thick noodles
floating in a thickened chicken broth. It was not, however, bland, and the
fish and seafood were carefully cooked. The pine nut spinach shrimp was
delicious, if a little insubstantial for the price.;    The
date-and-sweet-potato chicken was a real surprise. It came in a thick, almost
black sauce that tasted powerfully of the barbecue pit, although in fact the
chunks of chicken and sweet potato were braised. It's the dates that are
smoked, explained the waiter; their influence dominates this very interesting
dish.;    Westerners who care more for desserts than most Chinese restaurants
do will be happy at O'mei. We had an "apple blossom" (<MONEY>$3.95</MONEY>), in which vanilla
ice cream nestles among sugared won tons beneath a blanket of hot apple sauce,
flavored with cinnamon; a dark chocolate mousse laced with orange (<MONEY>$3.25</MONEY>); and
a dish of fresh ollalieberry sorbet (<MONEY>$2.95</MONEY>). They were wonderful, and left me
eager to try the restaurant's black sesame ice cream or its <ORGANIZATION>Odwalla</ORGANIZATION> orange
sorbet with bittersweet chocolate sauce.;    O'mei heads its wine list with a
bargain, a dry-style chenin blanc by <PERSON>Calloway</PERSON> for only <MONEY>$10</MONEY> -- nice fruit, nice
acid, excellent with the <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION> menu. "We sell a lot of chardonnays, because
chardonnays still tend to be what white wine drinkers tend to drink," said
West.;  O'mei; (star)(star)(star)(star) <LOCATION>Nouvelle</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION>; Where: 2316 Mission

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
'Lipsticks and Lords': Yale's New Look
---
By Julie V. Iovine</HL>
<DD> 08/04/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   I didn't bother returning last <DATE>summer</DATE> for my 10th Yale reunion because I still live part of each year in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>. 
I even thought I knew what was going on until <PERSON>Sara Cohen</PERSON>, class of <DATE>'88</DATE>, started talking about the "lipsticks" and the "crunchies." 
The former, she explains, are <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>'s radical-chic lesbians; the latter, "the granola dykes who have old-fashioned utopian ideas about feminism." 
Then there are the assimilationists, gay men mostly, who don't want to draw attention to their sexuality, and a growing number of special-interest factions, like the new Chicano-lesbian group. 
Suddenly <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> has a reputation as a gay school: <DATE>Last spring</DATE>, while most campus-wide social activities withered away under <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut</ORGANIZATION>'s new legal drinking age of 21, 1,000 students attended the annual gay-lesbian ball. 

   Before entering <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>'85</DATE>, <PERSON>Stephanie Black</PERSON> had never met a gay person. 
Now, she says, "It's just a matter of your friends being blond, brunette, gay or straight. 
No big deal. 
It probably depends on what part of the country you're from, whether or not you're going to be surprised by two women making out in the library." 
<PERSON>Ms. Cohen</PERSON> says she received a notice before registering freshman year that said one in four Yale students was gay. 
That would put it on a par with <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 

   Verifiable statistics don't exist, but everyone agrees that the gay community's superb organization has increased its visibility at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>. 
So have the fashion statements of the lesbians on campus. 
When I met <PERSON>Ms. Cohen</PERSON>, a self-proclaimed lipstick, she wore a white silk Pierrot outfit with a black leather baseball cap, dead-white face powder, opaque sunglasses and magic-marker-red lipstick. 
And it's not just the clothes that shock: When I asked <PERSON>Ms. Cohen</PERSON> about <PERSON>Wayne Dick</PERSON> {a student who altered Gay and Lesbian Awareness Days (GLAD) posters to read Bestiality Awareness Days (BAD)}, she countered, "What's wrong with a little bestiality?" 

   In recent years, GLAD week has become the major public event for the gay community. 
In my time, you were supposed to wear a pink triangle for a day or two to express solidarity; gay or straight, not many dared do it. 
Last year, a drag parade launched GLAD week -- followed by eight days of lectures, performances, films, readings, tea with <PERSON>Allen Ginsberg</PERSON>, and a cabaret act by sometime-exhibitionist <PERSON>Karen Finley</PERSON>. 
Plans to set up the country's <ORGANIZATION>First Gay-Lesbian Institute</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>fall</DATE> were also announced. 
"In these anti-sex times, I guess the radical thing is to be pro-sex," says <PERSON>Carrie Costello</PERSON>, an '86 graduate who plans to become a gay-family lawyer. 

   Another respect in which times have changed is partying. 
Under the new drinking law, less than one-fifth of the student body can drink legally in public. 
At first, students say, the administration turned a blind eye to the party scene, but last year's death of sophomore <PERSON>Ted McGuire</PERSON> from alcoholic poisoning changed that. 

   Social life on campus has subsequently retreated to a furtiveness last seen during Prohibition. 
No more huge bashes with dining-hall floors reeking from spilled beer and courtyards given over to the all-night concocting of strawberry daiquiris. 
Students are still drinking as much, possibly more, than ever; only now, they get soaked privately in their rooms before going out. 
Then, for thrills, they might go to a bowling or ice-skating party. 
Better yet, they join one of the fraternities. 

   Fraternities? 
"You thought panty raids only happened in Doris Day films?" an associate professor asks. 
"Well, come back to <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>." 
A student recently reeled off for me the names of 12 reconstituted sororities and fraternities (only one had managed to stick it out through the '60s and '70s), including two black fraternities and one fraternity that admits girls who don't like the tea-sipping connotation of sororities. 
The block of tenement houses behind the gym, where once only punks, drug dealers and drama students dared live, is today known to all as Frat Row. 

   Far from calling fraternities a symptom of a pervasive conservative backlash, every student I asked credits the drinking law alone for the subsequent social fragmentation that has triggered their revival and the creation of new social clubs. 
Conservative is hardly the term, though, for the <ORGANIZATION>Rockingham Club</ORGANIZATION>. 
Brideshead Relocated perhaps. 
Established in <DATE>1981</DATE> by then-freshman Lord <PERSON>Nicholas Wentworth Hervey</PERSON>, as the charter says, "to transfer the finest of British traditions to a safe haven . . .," the <ORGANIZATION>Rockingham Club</ORGANIZATION> soon acquired a reputation as an absolutely exclusive reserve for monied or titled -- preferably both -- young, male Eurocrats. 

   One night last <DATE>spring</DATE> I was invited for dinner. 
Upon arrival, I found the boys upstairs shooting pool and drinking champagne. 
A few women dressed in retro cocktail dresses, tight and flouncy, with pearls, sat clustered on a couch flipping through picture albums of club outings to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION>. 
I'd already been informed that "Rock wenches" were there only to get their M.R.S., a phrase I never expected to hear applied in real life. 
Since <PERSON>Lord Hervey</PERSON> graduated in '86 (the six-foot-high, three-foot-wide portrait he commissioned of himself -- a cigarette jutting 3-D from his mouth -- stands as constant inspiration in the stairwell), the European recruits have dwindled to an untitled few, and newer members are trying to cast off the shadow of elitism. 
"As long as they're exceptionally amusing, anyone is eligible to join," one young fogey tells me loftily. 
But as for admitting women, "the ones we'd really want probably wouldn't have anything to do with us." 

   At <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME>, waiters served dinner at a long linen-decked table (candelabra and place cards included) straddling two rooms. 
After the requisitely pompous toasts and cheers, the food started flying. 
Rolls, string beans, butter. 
"It's in the public-school tradition," the fellow to my right explains, dodging a roll that clips me on the chin and pointing to the permanent splatter-marks on the wall behind the presidential seat. 
Throughout, the incumbent president kept up a steady, albeit appropriately jaded, patter. 
"I'm a little weary of it all," he confides. ". . . 
Anyway, now there are so many other things more important than partying. 
Look, I don't even press my dress shirt properly anymore." 

   Indeed, more pressing issues are now in the making as the campus anticipates what may well turn out to be the main event of the year -- a strike by the dining hall and clerical workers' unions. 
Juniors and seniors dread a repeat of the <DATE>1984</DATE> strike, when workers picketing in front of the library shouted, "You're walking on the bodies of dead women." 
President <PERSON>Bart Giamatti</PERSON> resigned relatively soon after the strike was settled. 
Before long, posters around campus asked "Where's Benno?," a pointed comment on the low visibility of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>'s new president, <PERSON>Benno Schmidt</PERSON>. 

   This year's strike, threatened for <DATE>January</DATE>, is going to be an important confrontation for him. 
It's rumored that a law firm known for strike-busting has already been hired, but students are still uncertain if <PERSON>Mr. Schmidt</PERSON> has enough savvy to handle the situation and keep the dining halls open. 

   What I find myself wondering about is how a university as old and established as <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> can still have the energy to transform itself so utterly every 10 years. 
Remember the Black Panther trials? 
The only remaining constants seem to be "Clapping for Credit" and "Nuts and Sluts" -- gut courses in music and sociology. 
Oh, yes, and the study "grind" of yesteryear has been rechristened "the tweeb," while the hot major is history, with the adventurous going for -- get ready -- English, where the deconstructionists and new-Marxists reside. 
Who knows what this year will bring? 
Maybe the Whiffenpoofs will finally admit women.

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CRUZ; JUVENILE; SOCCER; CLUB  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Hoping to provide children in Santa Cruz's rough Beach Flats neighborhood with
something better than drugs and gang violence, a non-profit resource center
and the city police department are putting together a youth soccer league in
the shadow of the Beach Boardwalk.;    The Familia Center and the local patrol
officers who have volunteered their time and money to get the project off the
ground have no prior experience running a soccer program. They have virtually
no budget and even less equipment.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  YOUTH SOCCER LEAGUE BORN IN BEACH FLATS ON HOPE, SHOESTRING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/1/91, pg. 2B);  A story in Friday's
Mercury News should have said Santa Cruz's city parks and recreation
department donated $250 to the Beach Flats Youth Soccer Program. Because of a
reporter's error, incorrect information was given.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Their makeshift field, a grassy vacant lot at Third Street and <ORGANIZATION>Park Place</ORGANIZATION>,
normally doubles as a parking lot for amusement park visitors.;    But come
this <DATE>summer</DATE>, they say, about 40 children ages five to 12 and their parents
will participate in a casual league expected to provide not only exercise, but
an overdue boost of community self-esteem.;    "The kids here see so much
poverty and violence," said <PERSON>Marcos Rodriguez</PERSON>, executive director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Familia Center</ORGANIZATION>. "But a lot of them are great kids -- all they need is some
hope and attention.";    <PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> has more than a passing familiarity with
poverty and violence. Operating in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>'s highest crime area, just three
blocks from the popular <LOCATION>Beach Boardwalk</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Familia Center</ORGANIZATION> provides health care,
housing information and immigration assistance to the Beach Flats' 2,500
residents, <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of whom are Hispanic.;    <DATE>Last fall</DATE>, after noticing how
many young children always seemed to be kicking tattered balls around in the
streets, <PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> and police Sgt. <PERSON>Tom Vlassis</PERSON> came up with the idea for a
structured soccer league.;    Because there are no large parks in <LOCATION>Beach Flats</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Vlassis</PERSON> -- who has walked a beat in the area for three years -- convinced the
Seaside Company to donate the Third Street parking lot.;    When city leaders
said they couldn't run the league because of insurance liability concerns, the
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Police Officers Association</ORGANIZATION> donated <MONEY>$500</MONEY> to buy an insurance
policy. Seaside kicked in an additional <MONEY>$250.</MONEY>;    Seaside spokeswoman <PERSON>Ann
Parker</PERSON> said the lot only is used on the busiest <DATE>summer</DATE> weekends when other
lots fill up.;    "We won't need to use it more than about 18 or 20 times a
year," <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> said.;    Many of the families in <LOCATION>Beach Flats</LOCATION> emigrated from
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION>. As a result, their children often are left out of <LOCATION>Santa
Cruz</LOCATION>'s private youth soccer leagues because of language barriers or
transportation problems.;    "These kids are somehow always left out,"
<PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> said. "But we've got a lot of future Peles here.";    The league
represents a bright opportunity for police as well.;    If young children can
be supervised and given a positive avenue for their energies, some might avoid
gangs, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON>Mike Dunbaugh.</PERSON>;    A few officers have said
they would volunteer off-duty time as referees and coaching assistants, a move
certain to improve their image in the area as well.;    But the league is
still desperately in need of adult volunteers, including people who know the
rules of soccer and who can speak Spanish. It also needs soccer balls,
T-shirts and plastic fencing.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; To donate time, materials
or money to the fledgling soccer league, call the Familia Center at (408)
423-5747.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WITH a rare incense-like Guatemalan weed in hand, composer Allen Strange is
ready to present the "Hurricane" scenes, which open his new opera "Popul Voh,"
for Opera San Jose's closed-door evaluation Aug. 20.;    The aromatic weed is
one burned at timeless rituals in Central America, suitable for the mood of
this Creation drama drawn from an ancient Quiche-Mayan codex.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  OPERA SAN JOSE AUDITIONS ALL-ELECTRONIC MAYAN
MYTH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The title "Popul Vuh" refers to a sort of <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> papyrus long used for
setting down history and myth.;    Composer Strange is fashioning an
all-electronic score with some pre-taped segments; no pit orchestra will be
used or needed. His opera will be four hours long when completed, but
performable in chunks of one, two, three or four hours, at the option of the
opera company. Even if both the funding and the final OSJ approval is
forthcoming, its world premiere will not be before <DATE>1993.</DATE>;    <ORGANIZATION>OSJ</ORGANIZATION>'s growth has
also been tallied for the <DATE>1990-91</DATE> season, in which it played before 139,065
people in 157 performances: 56 of them community ones, 62 school, and 39
theater. The <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Theater</ORGANIZATION> is thus only the tip of the iceberg -- the
nicest thing it's been called all year.;    Elsewhere, a new opera company has
popped up in <ORGANIZATION>Walnut Creek</ORGANIZATION>'s new 800-seat <ORGANIZATION>Hofmann Theater</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Festival Opera</ORGANIZATION> is
opening with <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s "The Abduction from the Seraglio" on <DATE>Aug. 22</DATE> with
<PERSON>Gregory Stapp</PERSON> singing bass and <PERSON>Jim Sullivan</PERSON> conducting the orchestra.;   
BEETHOVEN BONANZA -- "It was a steal!" exulted <PERSON>William Meredith</PERSON> when his
<ORGANIZATION>Beethoven Center</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>San Jose State University</ORGANIZATION> acquired a <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION> first
edition for <MONEY>$200.</MONEY>;    The purchase is already providing valuable clues to the
size of orchestras in early performances of <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>'s symphonies -- much
smaller than modern ensembles playing the same works.;    An auction in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> was a bonanza for <PERSON>Meredith</PERSON>, who also picked up a French
edition of the <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven Symphony</ORGANIZATION> No. 6 ("Pastoral") for <MONEY>$200</MONEY>. In addition,
the center has just purchased abroad a first edition of the Symphony No. 1,
printed in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> in <DATE>1801</DATE>, when <PERSON>Beethoven</PERSON>, 30, was a well-known pianist but a
fairly obscure composer.;    Both editions are rare because they include the
individual orchestral parts and are in good condition despite having been used
and marked. These parts suggest that <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>'s symphonies used 30 to 40
players -- producing a very different sound from our 20th-century orchestras
typically using 50 to 70 musicians for the same works.;    GLAD CABRILLO
TIDINGS -- The <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> announced that ticket
sales through the <DATE>first week</DATE> are up <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT> over last year. It's
significant, reversing for the first time an attendance decline extending back
to <DATE>1987</DATE>, when the infamous Cabrillo tent site on the wind-blown <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>
hill was first conceived.;    Though the festival's home is in the <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>
Cruz-Aptos area, its biggest draws <DATE>last weekend</DATE> were at <LOCATION>Mission San Juan
Bautista.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>George Cleve</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Mozart Festival</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is feeling
upbeat, though the occupancy at its indoor performance sites has been running
<PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> behind last year. Though the financial crunch forced Cleve to
relinquish his conducting fee, long lines of single-ticket buyers had turned
up by last week. And at the new <ORGANIZATION>Flint Center</ORGANIZATION> venue, attendance improved from
623 to 746 between the first and second subscription concerts.;    DOLLARS AND
DANCE -- The difficulties in corporate fund-raising have hit <LOCATION>Dance Bay Area</LOCATION>,
which is eliminating both the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Dance Festival</ORGANIZATION> (originally
scheduled for next month) as well as the whizbang <ORGANIZATION>Isadora Duncan Dance Awards</ORGANIZATION>
ceremony-performance. The <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> awards themselves will still be given, but
without the dancers kicking up their heels on stage.  </TEXT>
