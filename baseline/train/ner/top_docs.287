<HEAD>Archbishop Desmond Tutu Appeals To Harvard to Divest</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> urged fellow
members of a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> governing board <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to back
divestment in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> until changes promised by that country's
president become reality.
   In a news conference following a closed-door meeting of the
<ORGANIZATION>Board of Overseers</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said that much of what <ORGANIZATION>South African
President F.W. de Klerk</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>last week</DATE> was a declaration of purpose.
   ``Sanctions should remain in place until certain conditions are
met,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   In last week's speech, de Klerk promised to free jailed <ORGANIZATION>African
National Congress</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> and lift government bans on
30 outlawed opposition groups.
   Tutu, who won the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
efforts, welcomed the announcement but tempered his response with
pragmatism.
   ``We'd like to see these things immediately but let's be
realistic. The parliamentary session has just begun,'' the Anglican
archbishop said.
   Tutu said he had asked colleagues on the 30-member <ORGANIZATION>Board of
Overseers</ORGANIZATION> to press <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> to withdraw <MONEY>$139 million</MONEY> in investments
in South African companies until <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION> is freed, all exiled
political activists are granted amnesty and the government's policy
of segregation is dismantled.
   The board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a
future meeting.
   The board is less powerful than the university's main governing
body, the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, but is the only alumni-elected panel with
an influence on school policy. The board plays no role in
day-to-day business, but must give formal consent to major
initiaitves and appointments.
   Tutu, who ran for the board on an anti-apartheid slate, was
elected last <DATE>June</DATE> along with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON>
and actor <PERSON>John Lithgow</PERSON>.
   The archbishop said de Klerk's action last week was sparked by
the growing number of countries that had placed sanctions on <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>, a position <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said seemed to be catching on among fellow
board members.
   He said he was encouraged by the attention <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> had
received in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> amid the historic changes in the
Soviet bloc.
   ``The kind of coverage and response is indicative that, in spite
of what has happened in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, which pushed our case to
the back burner, people here do want to see our situation
resolved,'' he said.
   Asked why he was in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> at
such a critical time, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> replied, ``Harvard is Harvard. The
things that <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> does and does not do have an impact far beyond
what you would expect from an educational institution.''

<TEXT>
   Jubilation over the pending release of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s imprisoned black leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> must be tempered
with the realization that apartheid is far from ended, <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop
Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Tutu, visiting to confer with other opposition leaders and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials, said the fight for equality is not over and urged
continued political and economic pressure on the South African
government to dismantle apartheid.
   ``We have not yet the complete dismantling of apartheid and this
is the pinpoint of the sanction program. We want apartheid totally
dismantled,'' said <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>, the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   The Anglican archbishop said his initial joy over the lifting of
some political restrictions against blacks <DATE>Friday</DATE> was tempered
later by the realization that apartheid still is far from over.
   He said his change of heart came after ``having pinched myself
and convinced myself it wasn't a dream and it was real. ... Of
course you see apartheid is still in place.''
   Tutu said he is looking forward to relinquishing his position as
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s pre-eminent opponent of apartheid now that <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>
is to be released from prison.
   ``I said long ago I was just an interim leader until he
(<ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>) comes out,'' he said. ``He's been making us work too
hard.''
   Tutu was accompanied by <PERSON>Patrick Lekota</PERSON>, publicity secretary for
the <ORGANIZATION>United Democratic Front</ORGANIZATION>. They were met at <LOCATION>Logan International
Airport</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Themba Vilakazi</PERSON>, head of the Boston-based Fund for a
Free <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, just returned from <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION>African
National Congress</ORGANIZATION> is based.
   The group was met by <PERSON>Zenani Mandela Dlamini</PERSON>, 30, eldest daughter
of <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Winnie Mandela</PERSON> and a political science student at
<ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Their arrival came less than 24 hours after <ORGANIZATION>South African
President F.W. de Klerk</ORGANIZATION> announced in a speech to Parliament that
<ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION> would be released unconditionally, although he set no date.
   De Klerk also lifted bans on more than 30 opposition groups
after three decades of underground activity against white rule,
including the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <DATE>1960</DATE>.
   The announcements appeared to clear the way for talks on a new
constitution that would end the black majority's exclusion from
national politics.
   Tutu, a member of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University's Board of Overseers</ORGANIZATION>, was
here to attend a meeting at the school. <PERSON>Lekota</PERSON> said he planned to
attend a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Albert Einstein Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>
think tank that advocates the use of non-violent sanctions to solve
political unrest.
   Mandela's daughter, greeted fondly by <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, told reporters she
was skeptical of the recent changes in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, despite the
news her father would be released.
   ``This has been going on for 300 years,'' she said. ``What
happened <DATE>Friday</DATE>, I'm not overly excited about it. Release some
political prisoners, to me, that's nothing. We want total majority
voting in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. Until that happens, I will not be
satisfied.''
   Her husband, <PERSON>Thumbumuzi Dlamini</PERSON>, 39, is a prince from <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>,
one of the sons of the late king Sobhuza II. His brother is now the
king of <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, an independent country almost completely
surrounded by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. They live in the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> area with their
three children.
   <PERSON>Lekota</PERSON>, who was recently released from prison, was more positive
about the changes. He predicted members of the white minority in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> who resist change will eventually be forced to accept
the idea of equality with blacks.
   ``They cannot stop us,' he said. ``We are unstoppable now.''
   <PERSON>Lekota</PERSON> said he also planned to meet with <PERSON>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> officials to give the South African
black perspective on the recent turn of events.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>, who is a member
of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>'s governing board, urged the school to
withdraw its money from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> until promised changes are
made there.
   Tutu told reporters <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that he had asked the 30-member <ORGANIZATION>Board
of Overseers</ORGANIZATION> to sell off <MONEY>$139 million</MONEY> in investments in companies
that do business in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. The money could be reinvested
once it becomes clear that reforms promised by President <ORGANIZATION>F.W. de
Klerk</ORGANIZATION> will take place, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Overseers</ORGANIZATION>, to which the Anglican archbishop was
elected last <DATE>June</DATE>, had met earlier in the day in a closed session.
The board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a
later meeting.
   Last week, <ORGANIZATION>de Klerk</ORGANIZATION> said he would release jailed <ORGANIZATION>African
National Congress</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> and lift government bans on
30 outlawed opposition groups.
   Tutu, who won the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
efforts, praised de Klerk for his announcement, but said actual
advancements would be decided by the <ORGANIZATION>South African Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We'd like to see these things immediately, but let's be
realistic. The parliamentary session has just begun,'' he said.
``If (de Klerk) is playing games, they would be very odd games and
the world would know how to act.''
   When asked why he was in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> rather than in <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> at such a critical time, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said, ``Harvard is Harvard.
The things that <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> does and does not do have an impact far
beyond what you would expect from an educational institution.''
   Tutu ran for the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> board on an anti-apartheid slate and
was elected last <DATE>June</DATE>, along with <ORGANIZATION>Labor</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON>
and actor <PERSON>John Lithgow</PERSON>.

   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> won a seat
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> on a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> governing board, striking a blow
for forces opposed to the school's <MONEY>$163.8 million</MONEY> investment in
companies doing business in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``I ... pray God I will do justice to the honor that has been
given me,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said, speaking from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Prize-winner, who promised a year ago to return
honorary degrees to any schools that had not divested such holdings
by <DATE>May 1989</DATE>, said he would not return the diploma <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> conferred
on him 10 years ago.
   Instead, the South African Anglican prelate will use his new spot
on the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Overseers</ORGANIZATION> to lobby against apartheid and for
divestment, said Tutu spokesman <PERSON>John Allen</PERSON>.
   ``This is really big news,'' said <PERSON>Robert Wolff</PERSON>, director of
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid</ORGANIZATION>. ``I feel very confident
that once (Tutu) arrives there will be enormous pressure on <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>
to divest.''
   Tutu's victory was the only one claimed by the pro-divestment
coalition, which ran four other candidates against an official slate
of 10 people backed by the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   Actor <PERSON>John Lithgow</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Labor</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON>, both
endorsed by the alumni assocation, were the top vote-getters in the
write-in election open to all <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> degree holders.
   Tutu came in fourth with 14,226 of the votes cast by 39,897
people, who elected five officials to serve six-year terms on the
30-member board. The panel monitors the university's academic
policies and advises the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, which manages the
school's business affairs.
   Since <DATE>1986</DATE>, the Harvard-Radcliffe anti-apartheid group has
nominated candidates to the 30-member overseers panel by petition
and has succeeded in placing three members on the board.
   The campaign was more heated than any in recent years, with the
alumni association and university officials speaking out against
electing ``single issue'' candidates.
   But <PERSON>Wolff</PERSON>, a professor of philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION>, said he was optimistic Tutu's presence on
the panel would encourage other ``progressive'' board members to
join the push for divestment in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``There are a large number of progressive board members who would
feel comfortable rallying to Tutu's standard,'' <PERSON>Wolff</PERSON> said. ``In his
presence he will be the moral center of the board on this issue.''
   <PERSON>Wolff</PERSON> said it was not immediately clear when Tutu would come to
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> to meet with the board, but predicted that ``when he
comes, thousands of people will turn out support him.''

   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> should avert war
in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> by talking out their differences, <ORGANIZATION>South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``People must make it more and more clear that we are
peacemongers, because peace is so sensible. It's so much more
sensible than war,'' said the Anglican prelate, who won the <DATE>1984</DATE>
Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to South African apartheid.
   At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION> also urged the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to
continue its economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> ``until the
process of dismantling apartheid is irreversible.''
   Apartheid is <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s official police of racial
segregation and discrimination against non-whites.
   Although <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s President F.W. de Klerk deserves credit
for some reform, ``the pillars of apartheid still stand firmly in
place,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   Tutu came to this ity of 24,000 people to help raise
scholarship money for South African students abroad and for
American Indian students in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
   Tutu heads the 2.6 million-member <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Church of Southern
Africa</ORGANIZATION>. This was his only scheduled stop in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> while en
route to a convocation in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   The visit was arranged by the <LOCATION>Montana Logging</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ballet
Company</ORGANIZATION>, a Helena-based quartet that mixes music, comedy and satire
to promote political and social causes.
   Tutu wrote liner notes for the group's latest album after
hearing it perform an anti-apartheid song, ``Take the Barriers
Down,'' in <DATE>1987</DATE>.

Acting on a grandchild's request, <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> will be 
making an unscheduled stop today at <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, where he and his party of 17 
plan to tour the world-famous amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
The South African cleric, a <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> winner and leader of the struggle 
against apartheid, had planned a weeklong series of speeches and sermons in 
<LOCATION>Orange</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> counties. But on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> an aide told <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> 
officials that Tutu's party -- and especially his 3-year-old grandson, Xabiso 
Tutu -- wanted to visit the park. 
</P>
<P>
The aide did not specify what attractions the little boy wanted to see, but, 
according to <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Bob Roth</PERSON>, the aide did make one request: "The 
Rev. <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> wants the little boy to have the time of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, <LOCATION>Xabiso</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Leah</PERSON>, daughters <PERSON>Mpho Tutu</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thandi Tutu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Naomi 
Tutu</PERSON> as well as family friends and <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> officials are expected to 
arrive at the park's main gate at <TIME>12:30 p.m</TIME>. They will sign the <ORGANIZATION>VIP</ORGANIZATION> guest book, 
meet <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> and spend part of the day touring Fantasyland, which offers a 
carousel as well as attractions based on fairy-tales. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>'s request, most of the nearly six-hour visit will be private -- away 
from reporters and photographers, <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> said, so the archbishop and his 
17-member entourage "can be like everyone else when they're in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite like everyone else, he conceded. As guests of <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Bishop Tutu</PERSON> and his party will not have to pay the admission of <MONEY>$25.50</MONEY> for 
adults, <MONEY>$20.50</MONEY> for children ages 3 to 11. Also, the Tutu group will be treated 
to lunch and probably escorted to the front of all lines. 
</P>
<P>
Also arriving at the park <TIME>this morning</TIME> will be another dignitary -- <PERSON>Zhu 
Quizhen</PERSON>, the Chinese ambassador to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and his wife. An official 
of the <ORGANIZATION>People's Republic of China Consulate</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> said the couple, who 
live in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, would spend the entire day at <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>. They also will 
get <ORGANIZATION>VIP</ORGANIZATION> treatment -- a free and very private tour, <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu is making his first visit to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> with his trip to <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, 
but he plans to return here <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> when he speaks at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana 
High School</ORGANIZATION>. That visit is being hosted by the <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church of the Messiah</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to deliver two sermons in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and will 
appear at <LOCATION>Cal State Long Beach</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> before his arrival in <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>. Tutu 
also has appearances scheduled at <ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in <DATE>1984</DATE> for his anti-apartheid 
efforts, is expected to discuss the recent dramatic turn of events in <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION>, including the release of <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Nelson 
Mandela</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu and Zhu are the latest in a long line of luminaries who have visited 
<ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> in the past 30 years. Park records show there have been cosmonauts 
and astronauts, princesses and prime ministers, presidents and would-be 
presidents -- not to mention a couple of kings. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every famous visitor has taken in the Matterhorn roller coaster and 
several other rides, he said. But there have been exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Japanese) <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON> was here in <DATE>October, 1975</DATE>, for a very brief 
time, he spent the majority of his time watching our bicentennial parade," <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> 
said. <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> noted that a child of about 7 or 8 got into the <ORGANIZATION>VIP</ORGANIZATION> seating area and 
climbed into the Emperor's lap, and <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> "treated him as if he were his own 
child," letting him stay through the rest of the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Each time a celebrity comes to <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, "I think we're honored," <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> said. 
"It's a feather in our cap. It says what this place is all about . . . that 
people want to see a real piece of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
When Tutu returns to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the program at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana High 
School</ORGANIZATION> will also include an appearance by the <PERSON>Saint Joseph</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ballet Company</ORGANIZATION>, 
accompanied by the <ORGANIZATION>Biola University Gospel Choir</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners from the program's organizer, the <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> of the Messiah, 
were granted the first opportunity to buy tickets for the speech. They and 
other local leaders and residents snapped up the 1,500 available tickets within 
10 days and are "very excited" about the visit, said <PERSON>Leonora Will</PERSON>, an organizer 
of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"The Anglican Church in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has played an important role in the 
struggle," Will said. "We're very proud and excited that he's coming." 
</P>
<P>
While Tutu's <DATE>Monday</DATE> visit to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> is expected to be peaceful, Will 
noted that "there are security concerns wherever the archbishop goes because he 
and his family have received death threats in the past." She added that 
organizers of the visit have taken security measures that are required by the 
county and that <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> police will be on hand, but no unusual security 
arrangements are planned. 
</P>
<P>
At <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Roth</PERSON> declined to comment on the park's security plans for today.

<HEAD>Government Broadcast Attacks Tutu's Pro-Sanctions Stance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-run
broadcasting network assailed the pro-sanctions position of
<ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and challenged the Anglican
Church to say if it supports or rejects Tutu's stance.
   Tutu, the first black to head the Anglican Church in <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>, was completing a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour where he appealed for additional
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic sanctions to protest <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid
policies.
   ``Archbishop Tutu has never been voted into a public office that
gives him the right to claim a significant constituency,'' the
<ORGANIZATION>South African Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said in a commentary.
   The statement failed to note that Tutu, like all of the nation's
26 million blacks, is ineligible to vote or be elected to national
political office.
   The <ORGANIZATION>SABC</ORGANIZATION> also said, without elaborating, that the Anglican
Church ``is deeply divided as a result of his (Tutu's) political
utterances.''
   ``What is the church's stand on the widely held view that
sanctions will bring deprivation and hardship in increasing numbers
to black South Africans?'' the <ORGANIZATION>SABC</ORGANIZATION> asked.
   ``The church owes it not only to parishoners but to all <LOCATION>South
Africans</LOCATION> to state unequivocally where the church stands on
sanctions, disinvestments, and their consequences.''
   Anglican Church officials could not be reached for comment
despite repeated telephone calls to their offices.
   The government has attacked Tutu in harsh tones on a number of
issues. In <DATE>March</DATE>, President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION> and
other church leaders saying they ``love and embrace'' the outlawed
<ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group.
   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,
hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said.
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, has continued to
call for sanctions and other forms of international pressure as the
most likely ways to bring about race reform in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> imposed limited sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1986</DATE>, banning the import of selected goods and stopping direct
air links between the two countries. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> now is considering
much tougher legislation that would ban almost all bilateral
economic activity.
   Under apartheid, a racially segregated society is established by
law and custom, with the 5 million whites controlling the economy
and maintaining separate districts, schools and health services.

   Anglican bishops from

Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, the church said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in <LOCATION>South

activity by leading black anti-apartheid groups.
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, was briefly detained three weeks ago when he and other
church leaders tried to march to Parliament with a petition
protesting the crackdown on opposition activity.
   He and other clergymen, including the Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>,
subsequently vowed to continue challenging the government. Boesak
is president of the <ORGANIZATION>World Alliance of Reformed Churches</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s Anglican bishops, in a statement <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, said the
government has ``launched a carefully planned attack'' on Tutu and
<PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> ``aimed at portraying them as Marxists and isolating them
from their churches as a prelude to state action against them.''
   President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> met with Tutu last week and suggested that
the archbishop had aligned himself with the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>African
National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement.
   The bishops' meeting on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> is to take place at <LOCATION>Jan Smuts
Airport</LOCATION> outside <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>. The Right Rev. <PERSON>Keith Sutton</PERSON>, a bishop
from <LOCATION>Litchfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, is to join African bishops at the meeting
as the representative of the <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>, the Right
Rev. <PERSON>Robert Runcie</PERSON>.

<P>
When the "the happiest place on earth" greeted the world's jolliest cleric 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the result was mutual glee. 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>, the moral leader of the anti-apartheid 
movement in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, thrilled <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> visitors who recognized him as he 
smiled and chuckled his way through the park, hugging <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON>, riding a 
carousel with his grandson and dancing in a conga line. 
</P>
<P>
His visit resulted partly from a promise to his grandson, <PERSON>Xabiso Tutu</PERSON>, 3, who 
is learning English while living in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, where his mother is studying 
medicine. Wearing the traditional black-eared hat with his name sewn on, Xabiso 
solemnly and politely shook hands with <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said he was 
actually "using the child as an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to come. Now I can say I have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu's wife, <PERSON>Leah</PERSON>, who had toured the park once before, said she thought Tutu 
would enjoy the park as much as his grandson, especially the faster rides. 
</P>
<P>
Xabiso sucked his thumb while Tutu held a brief press interview in Fantasyland 
under the watchful gaze of security guards in suits and ties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great fun being here," said the diminutive cleric who won the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel 
Peace Prize for his nonviolent opposition to apartheid and white rule in <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION>. "We're all children at heart." 
</P>
<P>
If more people could recapture the childlike innocence represented by 
<LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, he said in his lilting accent, "We wouldn't have all these problems 
in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and everywhere else. People would know we're all part of the 
same family." 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Tutu was greeted by Rep. <PERSON>Robert K. Dornan</PERSON>, who described 
himself as "<PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON>'s congressman." Dornan (R-Garden Grove) said he had 
voted for economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, despite his Republican 
conservatism. He told <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION> that he had cried during one of the archbishop's 
speeches, in which <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION> said he would resign if bloodshed in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> did 
not stop. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, 58, wearing his characteristic dark glasses, a Greek fisherman's cap, 
Reeboks and an <ORGANIZATION>Occidental College</ORGANIZATION> sweat shirt, posed happily for publicity 
photographs and rode down Main Street USA in a fire truck before joining his 
grandson on the carousel. 
</P>
<P>
Next, they watched the Party Gras parade with 50-foot balloon characters. At 
the end of the parade, a line of conga dancers approached Tutu, his wife and 
grandson and drew them into a serpentine dance around a circle in front of 
Sleeping Beauty's castle. Smiling broadly, Tutu appeared to enjoy the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu was taking a break from a 10-day preaching tour in the <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION>, where he 
is also raising funds for South African refugees. He spoke earlier this week at 
<ORGANIZATION>Occidental College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu is scheduled to speak at <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Ana High School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials said they were advised that Tutu likes rum and <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>, favors 
raisin ice cream and dislikes salads. But as they have with other VIPS, they 
provided the entourage a special tour guide, lunch at the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Bayou</ORGANIZATION> restaurant 
-- which serves no alcohol -- and cuts to the front of the lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem proper to have him wait," said <PERSON>Mary Anne Mang</PERSON>, public relations 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Park-goers who recognized Tutu most often used the word "wonderful" to describe 
their feelings toward him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to shake his hand!" said <ORGANIZATION>Paula Monarz of North Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>. "People get 
excited about movie stars, but here's someone who's made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
"There he is! Desmond Tutu!" shouted a middle-aged man in a red coat, who 
raised his hand in a fist. "Free South Africa!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fan!" said <PERSON>Richard Mathews</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, who videotaped his 
14-year-old son with the world-famous leader. "We've got historic film here!" 
he said, shaking his camera. 
</P>
<P>
But some had no idea who the cleric was. A clerk at the tobacco shop, asked 
about Tutu, replied: "Is that a kind of cigarette? We don't carry it." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a toddler ran toward Tutu and the accompanying Disneyland 
characters, but he was more interested in the world-famous mouse and yelled 
"Mickey!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm peeved," the archbishop joked about the youngster's slight. 
</P>
<P>
"But I shouldn't be," he said. "Mickey's older." 
</P>
<P>
The day ended for Tutu and his entourage at <TIME>7:45 p.m</TIME>. They were all given 
<ORGANIZATION>Mickey Mouse</ORGANIZATION> hats as they left the <ORGANIZATION>Magic Kingdom</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all world leaders should come here and recover their childlike 
qualities," <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But what, specifically, captured this world figure's fancy? 
</P>
<P>
"We went on everything -- Space Mountain, <PERSON>Peter Pan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Circle Vision</ORGANIZATION>, the train 
and Splash Mountain," he said. "Splash Mountain was awful. Once was enough and 
I'll never go on it again." 
</P>

<HEAD>Tutu Denounces Namibian Government as Sham</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>KATUTURA</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION> (AP) _ Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>
preached <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the territory's largest black township, derided
its multiracial government and renewed his call for independence
from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Tutu gave his sermon to about 1,500 people, many in the red,
green and blue colors of the <ORGANIZATION>South-West Africa People's
Organization</ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group fighting for independence.
   The congregation had gathered to hear Tutu, the first black
leader of the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, in a church near
<LOCATION>Windhoek</LOCATION>, capital of the territory commonly known as <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
   ``God is here with you in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. He suffers with you,'' said
Tutu. ``He says, `It is going to be all right, because I am the God
of justice, I am the God of liberation.'''
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, lamented last week's
moves by South African President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> to broaden power of his
country's chief representative in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said <PERSON>Administrator-General Louis Pienaar</PERSON> will be empowered
to act against ``subversive'' media, arrange for regional or
racially based elections and refer certain major court rulings to
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s appellate court.
   The archbishop spurned the territory's multiracial interim
government as ``echoes of their master's voice.''
   He was joined at the church <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by 18 Anglican bishops who
serve under him. They included the bishop of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, who wore a
leopard-skin mitre, and bishops from nearby <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION> and
neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Women ululated and held their children above their heads for a
glimpse of Tutu. The service was held at a Roman Catholic church,
the largest place of worship in the township of 60,000 people.
   <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people are <PERCENT>88 percent</PERCENT> black. The rest are
divided about equally between whites, who dominate the economy, and
people of mixed race.
   The rebels in the territory have waged a 22-year-old, largely
ineffectual war of independence.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Tutu blamed <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid system for the
violence.
   Tutu won his Nobel prize for his fight against apartheid, which
establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   ``We are opposed to all violence, especially the violence of the
evil system of apartheid, however it may be disguised by cosmetic
adjustments,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``It can survive only because it
uses evil and immoral methods to defend it.''
   A sheet of hymns distributed at the church <DATE>Sunday</DATE> showed
pictures of detained activists.
   But <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said he opposed violence by both guerrillas and the
military, and he rejected communism as a goal for <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
   ``The best defense against communism is a free and contented
people,'' he said. ``<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> does not want <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> to be
free.''
   Tutu appealed for <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> to observe a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> resolution calling
for a South African withdrawal and U.N.-supervised independence
elections in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
   But <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> says it will stay as long as Cuban troops
remain in neighboring <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, where they are helping the Marxist
government battle combined forces of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and a rebel
movement.

   Supporters and critics of
<ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> scuffled <DATE>Saturday</DATE> during rival
demonstrations before the black Anglican leader embarked on a trip
to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   At least one black man, a supporter of <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, was taken into
custody, and police ordered all members of the public to leave the
main hall at <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Jan Smuts Airport</LOCATION>.
   About 100 of <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>'s supporters remained in the hall and chanted
the archbishop's name when he arrived on a connecting flight from
<LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>.
   Police and clergymen escorted <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Leah</PERSON>, through
the hall as his supporters, most of them black, cheered. Many white
onlookers stared in amazement.
   He gave a final wave to the crowd before entering the
international departure area to catch a flight to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. He is to
fly to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to join ecumenical celebrations of the
1,000th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>Russian Orthodox Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 15 anti-Tutu protesters _ including a few blacks and a
white woman with charcoal on her face and wearing a bishop's
costume _ assembled at <LOCATION>Jan Smuts</LOCATION> with placards denouncing the
archbishop's support for sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. One poster
termed Tutu ``<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s Puppet,'' while another said: ``Red Carpet
for Tutu _ Red Bombs for Us.''
   It was the fourth airport protest against Tutu since he returned
three weeks ago from a trip to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. During
that trip, he repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> as a means of promoting racial reform.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE> marked the first time during the series of protests
that anti-Tutu demonstrators were outnumbered by supporters of the
archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in <DATE>1984</DATE> for his fight
against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s policy of white domination.
   The altercation began after some of the supporters grabbed an
anti-Tutu poster and tore it. Police announced over the public
address system that the arrival hall should be vacated, but many
people _ including members of the rival protest groups _ remained.
   When Tutu arrived, about 45 minutes after the scuffle, one woman
cursed him but few of his other critics were visible.
   Participants in the earlier anti-Tutu protests have included
whites from right-wing organizations and jobless blacks recruited
by conservative black politicians. All the protests have been
filmed and shown on the national television news by the state-run
<ORGANIZATION>South African Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which frequently denounces Tutu.
   Tutu has described sanctions as one of the few non-violent means
of pressuring the government to end apartheid, under which <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
Sanctions could be avoided, he says, if the government dismantled
apartheid and moved to grant the black majority full political
rights.
   Tutu's critics contend that sanctions will result in higher
black unemployment while hardening the attitudes of pro-apartheid
whites.
   These critics also claim most blacks oppose sanctions, but there
is no means of verifying this. Endorsement of sanctions is illegal
under emergency regulations, and blacks are not allowed to vote in
national elections or referendums.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Frank Chikane</PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION>South African
Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, said this week that the anti-Tutu protests
were being ``orchestrated ... to give the impression that there was
mounting protest against anti-apartheid groups.''

   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> was among five
anti-apartheid candidates for <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>'s governing board
awaiting word on whether alumni supported their stand against the
school's investments in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``It has been a vituperative campaign. Things have heated up,''
said <PERSON>Robert Wolff</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard-Radcliffe Alumnae Against
Apartheid</ORGANIZATION>.
   The group, which has three members on the 30-member <ORGANIZATION>Board of

Association-backed</ORGANIZATION> slate of 10, including <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Transportation

   Results of the election, which was open to all <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> degree

<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>'s commencement.
   The anti-apartheid group has pressured the university to
withdraw its <MONEY>$162.8 million</MONEY> in investments in companies doing
business in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Tutu, a black leader of the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>

honorary degree <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> gave him in <DATE>1979</DATE> unless the university
backs away from its South Africa-related holdings.
   <PERSON>Wolff</PERSON>, a professor of philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION>University of

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Pledge Backing For Tutu In Showdown With Botha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican bishops, including an
envoy sent by the <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>, today pledged support
for <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> in his confrontation with the
government.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southern
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, has angered President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> by declaring that he and
other church leaders will carry on the work of anti-apartheid
groups which last month were banned from operating.
   Nineteen bishops, after an emergency meeting with <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, issued a
statement warning that the government ``is driving this beloved
country closer to civil war.''
   ``We offer Archbishop Tutu our loyalty and support,'' the
bishops said. ``We shall not allow the government to isolate him.''
   Tutu, who declared that the government would ``bite the dust,''
said it was important that <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and other white <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>
``know that I am not just spouting forth things that come into my
head.''
   ``These are responsible people,'' said <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>, gesturing to the
bishops. ``They would have knocked me down if they believed that
what I am saying is inconsistent with the gospel.''
   Botha met with <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, the winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>,
last week and suggested that the archbishop had aligned himself
with the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement.
   Referring to this, the bishops said they ``take grave offense at
the cavalier way'' in which <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> treated Tutu.
   Among those attending today's meeting was Bishop <PERSON>Keith Sutton</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Lichfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, who was sent as representative of the
<ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Robert Runcie</PERSON>.
   Runcie is spiritual leader of the 70-million-member worldwide
Anglican communion.
   ``He is a Christian leader,'' <PERSON>Sutton</PERSON> said of Tutu. ``His
objections to apartheid grow directly out of his pastoral work.''
   At a news conference <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> dared <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> to take action
against him.
   ``If they try to restrict me or ban me, they are just wasting
their time, because I will not obey their orders,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
``They will have to put me in jail.''
   ``I can't keep looking over my shoulder to see if God has got
the approval or disapproval of the government,'' he added.
   Three weeks ago, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> and 24 other church leaders were arrested
and briefly detained after they tried to march to <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> with a petition protesting the latest crackdown on
opposition.
   Last month, the government banned 17 other organizations from
participating in any activity not approved by the government.
   Since then Tutu and other church representatives have taken up
the struggle against apartheid, which by law and custom establishes
a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have
no vote in national affairs.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Tutu Rejects Botha Reform Proposal As ``Crumbs of Conscience''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> today
rejected as ``crumbs of conscience'' President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>'s
proposal for giving blacks more political clout in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The black South African cleric accused <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> of making ``slight
adjustments to the evil system'' of apartheid, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
official policy of separation of the races. Tutu, an outspoken
opponent of apartheid, won the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   It won't help if the white-led government merely ``moved
furniture around, because the room would remain the same,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>
said on the <DATE>last day</DATE> of a four-day visit to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Botha told <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that he would move for black
participation in the electoral college and possibly in the Cabinet
as part of the <ORGANIZATION>National Party</ORGANIZATION>'s program of gradual reform.
   Blacks have demanded full voting rights and abolition of
residential and school segregation.
   Tutu, leader of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION>, dismissed
<PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s policy of gradually introducing apartheid reforms.
   ``Reform will not come by `big master' throwing to us crumbs of
conscience that fall from his table,'' the archbishop said. ``It
will happen when all the people in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> are able to
determine the menu together when they sit at the same table.''
   Tutu was speaking at ceremony opening a primary school in this
central <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> industrial city.
   The school is named after <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>, the jailed black

They denounced <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist and said Tutu had not been

<HEAD>Archbishop Defends His Activism Against Criticism From Botha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>WINDHOEK</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>South-West Africa</ORGANIZATION> (AP) _ In a stinging rebuke to
President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>, <PERSON>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</PERSON> today denied that he
endorsed Marxism and said his fight against apartheid was deeply
rooted in Christian tradition.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, released the text of a letter to <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> defending his
challenges of government policy in a church-state confrontation
that has intensified over the past two months.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was responding to a <DATE>March</DATE> letter
from <LOCATION>Botha</LOCATION> in which the South African president suggested Tutu was
furthering the cause of the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla
movement and promoting a Marxist dictatorship.
   Botha, whose letter was quoted at length on South African
television, asked whether Tutu was acting ``on behalf of the
kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>.''
   Replied Tutu: ``I work for God's kingdom. For whose kingdom,
with your apartheid policy, do you work for?''
   ``I reject atheistic Marxism and I reject apartheid, which I
find equally abhorrent,'' said Tutu. He cited numerous scriptural
passages to support his contention that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s policy of
racial separation is ``unbiblical, un-Christian, immoral and evil.''
   Referring to insinuations in <LOCATION>Botha</LOCATION>'s letter, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said he had
never listened to the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s radio broadcasts or read its magazine.
   ``My theological position derives from the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> and the
teachings of the Church,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> wrote. ``The Bible and the Church
predate Marxism and the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> by several centuries.''
   Tutu is presiding this week over a synod of Anglican bishops in
<LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> administers the territory, also
known as <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, in violation of a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> resolution.
   Tutu also offered to debate the morality of apartheid with a
theologian from <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION>. Apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26.5 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs, but the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.
   ``My position in this is not one of which I am ashamed ... I
know that I stand in the mainline Christian tradition,'' he added.
   Botha had chided Tutu for getting arrested, along with 25 other
church leaders, when they tried to march on Parliament six weeks
ago to protest the bannings of 17 major anti-apartheid
organizations and more than a dozen individuals.
   The clergymen have been trying to fill the political void
created by the crackdown.
   Tutu, who leaves <DATE>Saturday</DATE> on a five-week trip to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, asked <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> to ensure that his reply to the
president was covered as prominently by state television as <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s
<DATE>March 16</DATE> letter to Tutu. He also accused the president of falsely
claiming that Tutu once preached under a communist banner.
   ``I pray for you, as I do for your ministerial colleagues, every
day by name,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>'s letter concluded. ``God bless you.''

   Sen. <PERSON>Paul Simon</PERSON> visited black
squatters <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION>, met with <PERSON>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</PERSON> and
renewed his clemency appeal for the <ORGANIZATION>Sharpeville Six</ORGANIZATION>, a group of
blacks facing execution.
   The Illinois Democrat, on a five-day trip to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,
conferred briefly with <PERSON>Prakash Diar</PERSON>, lawyer for the <LOCATION>Sharpeville</LOCATION>
Six. The five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for
involvement in a mob that killed a black town councilor in <DATE>1984</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Sharpeville</LOCATION>, a township south of <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>.
   Later, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> spent about 30 minutes with <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, leader of the
Anglican church in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel
Peace Prize for his campaign against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid
system of race segregation.
   Speaking to reporters after the meeting, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> predicted that
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will toughen sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. As chairman
of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on African affairs,
<PERSON>Simon</PERSON> will have a major role in that decision.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ``would be eager to avoid sanctions if we got a good
strong clear signal from the government here that they were going
to do away with apartheid,'' <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> said. ``But I'm not getting that
signal.''
   He contends that sanctions could push the white authorities
toward reform.
   Before meeting Tutu, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> toured <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION>, the black township of
2.5 million people outside <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>. He also visited two
squatter camps and an all-male hostel for migrant workers.
   ``I've just spoken with a man with five children who sees his
family only once a year,'' <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> said after emerging from the
hostel. ``This is an illustration of what happens under a system of
injustice based on racial separation.''
   Simon also met with <PERSON>Albertina Sisulu</PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid
activist whose husband, <PERSON>Walter</PERSON>, is serving life in prison with
fellow <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>.
   Simon is leading a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> campaign seeking clemency for the
<LOCATION>Sharpeville</LOCATION> Six, whose case has drawn worldwide attention.
President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> has refused to intervene. They were granted a
reprieve in <DATE>March</DATE> hours before they were to be executed.
   Diar will argue the case before the <ORGANIZATION>Appeal Court</ORGANIZATION> next month.
   His clients did not physically contribute to the death of the
councilor, according to court testimony. They were convicted under
the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which holds them responsible
for being an active part of the mob that carried out the killing.
   ``There is a feeling that the system has not provided justice
for a great many people, and to some extent the <LOCATION>Sharpeville</LOCATION> Six are
a symbol of that,'' <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> said.
   He said his request to visit with the <LOCATION>Sharpeville</LOCATION> Six was turned
down but he planned to mention the case in a scheduled meeting
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> with Foreign Minister <PERSON>Roelof F. Botha</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Monday</DATE> compared his country's suppression of blacks to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s
treatment of Palestinians in the occupied lands, where Christmas
celebrations were subdued because of the Arab uprising.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> laureate came under increased criticism
from Jews and also Christians sympathetic to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>, who accused
him of taking a one-sided approach to the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> conflict
during his five-day trip.
   ``Members of our team have remarked on the similarities between
the situation in the occupied territories and that in <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>,'' Tutu told reporters.
   ``In the methods of resistance used by Palestinians, and in the
ways the Israeli government deals with the resistance, we
experienced an extraordinary sense of being at home,'' he said.
   In the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>, hundreds of Christian
pilgrims marked Christmas with a visit to <ORGANIZATION>St. Catherine</ORGANIZATION>'s basilica
in <LOCATION>Manger Square</LOCATION>, the legendary site of Jesus' birth.
   Israeli soldiers removed barricades and metal detectors from
<LOCATION>Manger Square</LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION> passed without incident. But the
military presence was heavy, and at least 50 paratroopers and
soldiers from the elite <ORGANIZATION>Givati</ORGANIZATION> brigade patrolled the square.
   ``I don't like it, but I guess it's for security,'' said <PERSON>Sara
Paredes</PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION>Fort Leavenworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION> as she stood outside the
Church of the <LOCATION>Nativity</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Paredes</PERSON> said making a pilgrimage to <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION> was a ``dream''
for her, but added that she would like to return in the future when
tensions and security are lessened and ``when I can find a better
Christmas.''
   Twenty Palestinians were wounded after troops opened fire on
stone-throwing demonstrators in the <LOCATION>Gaza Strip</LOCATION>, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was investigating the reports.
   Tutu drew harsh criticism after he refused to meet with a
delegation of Ethiopian Jews, saying their visit to the <ORGANIZATION>St. George
Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>East Jerusalem</LOCATION> was not on his schedule.
   ``He did not have time to sit with us, even for two or three
minutes,'' <PERSON>Yitzhak Rahamim</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Ethiopian
Immigrants Association</ORGANIZATION> told a reporter outside the church. ``I
heard he had time to meet with Palestinians, but not with Jews,
even with us from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.''
   Tutu met <DATE>Monday</DATE> with a group of prominent Palestinian leaders to
discuss the situation in the occupied territories, where
Palestinians began their revolt against Israeli rule in <DATE>December
1987</DATE>.
   The Jerusalem-based <ORGANIZATION>International Christian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, headed by
<PERSON>Willem van der Hoeven</PERSON>, a Dutch Evangelist cleric, published a
statement denouncing Tutu's repeated expressions of support for
Palestinians.
   In the statement that was also sent to Israeli leaders, Van der
Hoeven wrote: ``we specifically apologize for the remarks made by
the visiting Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu...we bow our heads in
shame.''
   Tutu's endorsement of a Palestinian state has alienated many
Israelis, and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s two chief rabbis refused to meet with the
Anglican human rights leader.
   When asked to comment on criticisms of his visit, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> replied:
``The bible...speaks about <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> as being an agent of God for
establishing justice and peace, and there is no way I am going to
say the way <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is treating Palestinians is just. And if they
revile me for that, tough luck.''

   The son of <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Desmond
Tutu</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he engineered his own arrest at an airport to
promote an advertising agency he heads.
   <PERSON>Trevor Tutu</PERSON> made the declaration to reporters after going to
court <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> first to face charges stemming from the airport
incident and then to answer minor traffic violations.
   ``We're in the business of playing with people's minds,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>,
32, told reporters at his news conference. He said he tricked police
into arresting him mainly ``to tell people that TuMult had arrived.''
   He serves as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>TuMult</ORGANIZATION>, a black-oriented advertising
agency formed a few months ago. He said the name was chosen to sound
like his last name, which gained international fame in <DATE>1984</DATE> when his
father won the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> and a former girlfriend appeared in a
suburban magistrate's court to face charges of violating civil
aviation laws.
   The charges relate to an incident over <LOCATION>Tutu</LOCATION>'s luggage <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Jan Smuts Airport</LOCATION>. The case against <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Joan
Rhodes</PERSON> was postponed until <DATE>Feb. 15</DATE>.
   But Tutu was taken into custody by <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> police as he left
the <LOCATION>Kempton Park</LOCATION> courthouse, driven to police headquarters, and
fined <MONEY>$160</MONEY> for failing to answer three traffic summonses.
   He pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed vehicle and parking
twice in a loading zone.
   At the news conference, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said he and colleagues planned the
airport incident as a promotion stunt.
   Tutu said he changed into dirty, old clothes while heading into
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>. He said he then placed
luggage near some policemen at the airport and told them he was a
servant acting on instructions of his white employer.
   He said the police did nothing until he came back later to remove
the bags and told them the parcels could have contained bombs.
   At that point, he said, many policemen converged, and he was
arrested, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   ``I tied down 5,000 guys,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said of security personnel. He
repeatedly mocked police, saying at one point: ``They don't know
what they're doing.''
   Police have warned <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> not to leave parcels and
luggage unattended in public places because of a bombing campaign by
anti-government guerrillas.
   Tutu is the eldest of four children of <ORGANIZATION>Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, who leads
the <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. The father won the Nobel
Prize for his campaigning against the country's system of racial
discrimination.
   <PERSON>Trevor Tutu</PERSON> said his father did not know in advance of his recent
activities but added: ``As long as I'm using peaceful means, he
doesn't mind.''
   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Trevor Tutu</PERSON> was held by police for three days before he
was cleared of a charge of drunken driving.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, he was briefly detained after arguing with police at a
courthouse about the detention of black children.

<DATELINE>EXETER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> called
``mind-boggling'' <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s first talks between the South African
government and the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> and said too much was
at stake for either side to be ``bloody-minded.''
   The black Anglican archbishop of <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, an anti-apartheid
campaigner and <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace laureate, said he didn't expect
important agreements to emerge from the preliminary talks in <LOCATION>Cape
Town</LOCATION> which end <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``I just think what most of the people in our community would
like to hear is a real commitment on all sides to talks,'' he told
a news conference at <ORGANIZATION>Exeter University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``And that we want to go in to substantive negotiations, that
would be important and give hope to people who are tired of the
violence of apartheid and the counterviolence of those who oppose
apartheid.''
   Tutu came to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for a three-day visit shortly
before the talks began. He lectured <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in this
university city in <LOCATION>southwest England</LOCATION>.
   Asked by reporters at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Heathrow Airport</LOCATION> if he believed
much could be achieved in the first round, he said:
   ``I am very hopeful. I don't think that any of those people, on
both sides, are going into those talks bloody-minded. We've got too
much at stake. Too many people have already died, too many people
have suffered.''
   Tutu said <ORGANIZATION>South African President F.W. de Klerk</ORGANIZATION> knew that unless
he settled with the black majority ``the whole question of
sanctions and apartheid economy will be exacerbated.''
   Tutu commented, ``It's actually almost mind-boggling to think
that they are now sitting across the table with the people they
tried to demonize.''
   ``On the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> side, they know that most of their supporters would
like to see an end to violence,'' the prelate said.
   He called <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s racial-segregation system ``one of the
most vicious the world has seen.''
   Tutu criticized British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> for
opposing sanctions on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``We admire her eloquency in condemning apartheid. We just wish
there was a matching consistency in action,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tutu: Voters Should Boycott Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>,
saying he was ``obeying God'' in defying the government, urged
blacks and whites to boycott next month's nationwide but segregated
municipal elections.
   Elsewhere on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, black activist <PERSON>Winnie Mandela</PERSON> also violated
state of emergency rules by calling for increased international
economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Tutu, in a service at <ORGANIZATION>St. George's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>,
described the elections as ``ludicrous'' and ``unjust'' and said
the government was attempting to ``force participation.''
   ``I urge black people in this diocese not to vote in the <DATE>October</DATE>
elections and I hope that white Anglicans would join their black
fellow Anglicans in that action,'' said <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I am aware of the penalties attached to this call. I am not
defying the government, I am obeying God,'' the black churchman
said.
   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold
separate elections <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE> to choose local officials. The black
majority has no vote in national affairs, although the nation's 26
million blacks make up about <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
population.
   Under the 26-month-old state of emergency it is illegal to call
for an election boycott in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. If convicted, violators
may be fined or imprisoned.
   In the <DATE>1984</DATE> municipal elections, anti-apartheid groups promoted
election boycotts and only about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of eligible black
voters went to the polls.
   Many black activists view black elected officials as
collaborators with the white-dominated government and its apartheid
policies of racial separation.
   Tutu said calling for an election boycott was a legitimate
``non-violent way of expressing our opposition to the evil and
injustice of apartheid.''
   ``You cannot get security through the barrel of a gun, nor
through the draconian and oppressive state of emergency,'' he said.
   Tutu spoke at a special service to install <PERSON>Canon Colin Jones</PERSON> as
dean of <ORGANIZATION>St. George's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>. Jones, 37, becomes the first black
to serve in the post. He spent last year in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, and
most recently was the chaplin at the <ORGANIZATION>University of the Western
Cape</ORGANIZATION>, a mixed-race school.
   Minister of <ORGANIZATION>Law and Order Adriaan Vlok</ORGANIZATION> has threatened to clamp
down on anti-apartheid clergymen.
   ``We must clip their wings _ as we clipped those of the 19
revolutionary and activist organizations,'' <PERSON>Vlok</PERSON> said on <DATE>Friday</DATE> in
reference to the government's <DATE>February</DATE> decision banning most
leading anti-apartheid groups.
   Anti-government church leaders were among the few prominent
resistence figures spared in the crackdown, and they now are the
most visible domestic opponents of the government.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Mandela</PERSON> called for increased economic sanctions in a speech
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of the Witwatersrand</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>.
   ``When we call for sanctions, when we call for disinvestment
from this country, it is because we are looking for those peaceful
measures as an alternative to the structural violence of the state
we see <DATE>today</DATE>,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Mandela</PERSON> spoke to 400 people gathered to mark the
publication of a biography on her husband, jailed <ORGANIZATION>African National
Congress</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>. The book, entitled ``Higher Than
Hope,'' was written by South African academic <PERSON>Fatima Meer</PERSON>, who also
was present.
   The 70-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s best known black leader,
is in a <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> clinic recuperating from tuberculosis.
   He has been imprisoned for 26 years and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.
The <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla group fighting white minority rule.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> urged
churches once divided over apartheid to work together for a
peaceful future as he opened a church conference <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   About 300 delegates from 90 churches are meeting in hopes of
reaching agreement on how to help <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> move peacefully to a
non-discriminatory democracy. They will spend five days at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Conference of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, billed as the largest such meeting
to be held in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The conference in <LOCATION>Rustenburg</LOCATION>, 62 miles northwest of
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, has brought together the white branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch
Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION> with its black and mixed-race branches.
   The white <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION>, the main church of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate the government, argued for
decades that the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> supported apartheid. It has changed that
view and says it wants to merge with the other branches.
   The black and mixed-race branches have staunchly opposed
apartheid.
   Tutu, the Anglican archbishop who won the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize
for his anti-apartheid activism, called for reconciliation. ``We
come here not to engage in recrimination,'' he said in the opening
speech.
   ``In this land we are bound together by common humanity, by
having one God. The only way we will ever be able to survive, to be
free, to be human, is together, black and white,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Khoza Mgogo</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>South African Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>,
urged delegates to adopt strategies for redistribution of wealth,
most of which is in the hands of the white minority.
   ``The beauty of the meeting is that we are bringing the whole
Christian community of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> together - the establishment
Afrikans churches and their anti-apartheid counterparts,'' the Rev.
<PERSON>Frank Chikane</PERSON>, a conference organizer, told the <ORGANIZATION>Sunday Times</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``For the first time there is the distinct possibility that the
Christian churches - representing <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of the population -
can speak with one voice on apartheid and the country's future,''
he said.
   Two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid
- the <ORGANIZATION>Afrikaans Protestant Church</ORGANIZATION> and the Reformed Church - are not
attending.
   Many of the churches represented belong to the <ORGANIZATION>South African
Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, which often has been at the forefront of the
anti-apartheid movement. Chikane is the general secretary of the
council.
   The nation's church leaders met 30 years ago in an attempt to
forge a united front to challenge apartheid, but the agreement
collapsed when the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION> rejected it.
   The current conference was organized after President F.W. de
Klerk urged church leaders to develop a common position on the role
they envision for the church in the future.
   De Klerk has said he wants to dismantle the apartheid system and
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the country's 5
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is predominantly Christian, with large numbers of
Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Zionists and Pentecostalists.
There also are many Jews and Moslems in the nation.

<HEAD>Tutu Says West Should Sever South Africa Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> said
today he would try to persuade Western governments to break all
diplomatic ties with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> until it eased restrictions on
anti-apartheid groups.
   ``We want to tell the South African government that they do not
deserve to be part of a decent society,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Tutu said Western nations should cut any diplomatic links with
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and expel South African diplomats from their countries.
   ``<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> have kept saying that
sanctions hurt blacks and sanctions are not effective,'' he said.
``While not withdrawing my support for economic sanctions, I am
saying to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and other Western countries, `Here
is your chance.'''
   Tutu was in the Kenyan capital for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>All-African
Conference of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, which he heads.
   He said he has called in the past for Western governments to
break relations with <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>. But he said this time he intended to
actively campaign for such a move.
   ``My own intention now is to challenge the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> to break off
diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, to expel South African
diplomats from their countries until certain conditions are met,''
the churchman said.
   Those conditions are a lifting of the state of emergency,
reversal of a <DATE>Feb. 25</DATE> ruling that outlawed political activity by 18
opposition groups, and the release of political detainees,
especially children.
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize, and other churchmen
were arrested <DATE>Monday</DATE> when they attempted to march on the <LOCATION>South
African Parliament</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> to protest the crackdown on black
opposition groups.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>World Alliance of
Reformed Churches</ORGANIZATION>, also was arrested. In an interview with ``CBS
This Morning'' from <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, he said it is clear that the
government now is outlawing ``all legitimate peaceful activity,''
and that apartheid opponents have no choice but to resist.
   ``And if that means confrontation, if that means disobedience to
your unjust laws then I think that is exactly what we mean,'' he
said. ``We are talking about the possibility of civil
disobedience.''
   He said non-violent protests have ended in deaths in the past
but won't be a deterrent to civil disobedience.
   ``We will have to take the risks that go with it and we will
have to take the consequences that follow these actions of ours,''
he said.

   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that
black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> would be disappointed by a Republican victory
in next week's presidential election.
   ``We would rather see a Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> than a
Republican,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said. ``We have suffered a great deal from the
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration's policy of constructive engagement.''
   Tutu, leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and winner
of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, made the comments in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> while
attending the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION>All-Africa Council of
Churches</ORGANIZATION>.
   He is council president and chairman.
   Tutu did not mention either Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> or
Republican <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> by name. He also did not single out policies
advocated by either candidate that would be harmful or helpful to
blacks in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration preferred a policy on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> that
became known as constructive engagement _ dialogue with the
white-led <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> government rather than the diplomatic and
economic confrontational tactics pursued by former Democratic
President <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>.
   Tutu said President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s policy had failed.
   ``We are now virtually being ruled by martial law,'' he said.
   The archbishop said South African authorities had declared a
state of emergency three times during <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s tenure at the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION>. During that period, he said, more than 2,000 people were
killed, many by security forces.
   Tutu is a key activist against apartheid, the policy of racial
segregation under which <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Tutu Cancels Meeting With Dutch Reformed Church Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> canceled a meeting with leaders of the
white <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION> after they described his challenge of
government policy as ``impious.''
   Tutu, a prominent foe of apartheid and winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel
Peace Prize, had planned to meet the leaders in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
for the first formal talks between the two churches since <DATE>1960</DATE>.
President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> and most other government officials belong to
the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION>, the largest denomination of the dominant
Afrikaner white minority.
   Tutu said he canceled the meeting because of an ``abusive
attack'' on his church in a statement issued <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by Dutch
Reformed leaders and published <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. He said the leaders
``deliberately sabotaged the talks.''
   Later <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> issued a statement asking Tutu to
repudiate the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla
movement. Tutu says he does not endorse the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence
but shares its professed goal of a non-racial democracy.
   ``The question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of
the kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>SACP</ORGANIZATION>
(South African Communist Party),'' <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said.
   ``Are you in favor of the establishment of a Marxist
dictatorship in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> under the rule of the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>SACP</ORGANIZATION>, to the detriment of the church?''
   Tutu later met with <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> to urge clemency for the ``Sharpeville
Six'' _ a group of blacks scheduled to hang <DATE>Friday</DATE> for complicity
in a <DATE>1984</DATE> mob killing during anti-apartheid unrest.
   Tutu said <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> scolded him for taking a confrontational stance
toward the government.
   The archbishop said his decision to cancel the church meeting
was influenced by a ``background of unease'' related to the
scheduled hangings. He urged Dutch Reformed leaders to join
Anglican clergy in prayers for condemned prisoners.
   The Dutch Reformed leaders' statement referred to comments by
<PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>, a mixed-race minister, at a church
service <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>.
   Tutu and <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> were protesting a recent government ban on
political activity by 19 organizations.
   Boesak, president of the <ORGANIZATION>World Alliance of Reformed Churches</ORGANIZATION>,
and Tutu used strong language in responding to Law and Order
Minister <PERSON>Adriaan Vlok</PERSON>'s warnings that he will act against the
clergymen if they did not stop ``preaching revolution.''
   <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> said the government ``signed its own death warrant. ...
No government can challenge the living God and survive.''
   Tutu said, ``If it is revolution to say I work for a <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> that is truly democratic ... I am for that.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION> objected to the clergymen's
``language, convictions and veiled threats that do not breathe the
spirit of the Gospel.''
   It said it was ``not unsympathetic to the problems that churches
in this country have to contend with.'' But the statement called on
<PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> and Tutu ``to divorce themselves from this impious road and
to discuss their problems openly'' with Vlok and <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> ``who are
both avowed Christians.''
   Botha issued a statement <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> through the <ORGANIZATION>South African
Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION> saying the churches had to recognize ``certain
limitations in the execution of their prophetic task outside the
ecclesiastical field.''
   One major point of <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>'s sermons was to dispute
Vlok's statement that they were preaching revolution instead of the
Christian message.
   The Dutch Reformed statement appeared to agree with Vlok and
<PERSON>Botha</PERSON>.
   ``In exceeding these limits they have confronted the state, and
cannot equate themselves with the church in the face of state
retaliation,'' it said. ``The Church of Jesus Christ cannot be used
as a means for a revolutionary change of government.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> denounced the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> for voting to block <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>
resolutions calling for sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> because it
refuses to end apartheid.
   The black Anglican prelate told a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> committee <DATE>Friday</DATE> that
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> ``is able to cock a snoot (thumb its nose) to the
world ... because the South African government knows that when it
comes to the crunch, President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, (British Prime Minister
<PERSON>Margaret</PERSON>) <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON> and (West German) Chancellor (Helmut) <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> will
use their veto to protect the South African government from the
consequences of its actions.
   ``We don't suggest that these worthies are racists,'' he said in
obvious sarcasm, ``but it is an academic distinction.''
   The Western countries say they deplore apartheid but think
sanctions hurt the black population and do not help end the system
of racial separation.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> have veto power as permanent
members of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> does not have a
veto.
   Tutu addressed a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Special Committee</ORGANIZATION> against
Apartheid on the 25th anniversary of the committee's founding.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has defied all <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> resolutions
condemning apartheid and calling for independence for <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, or
<LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>. The South African ambassador recently stalked
out of the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> and said it could do its ``damndest''
to impose sanctions on his country.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in <DATE>1984</DATE> for his non-violent
efforts to end apartheid, called the system ``as evil, as immoral
as Nazism ever was.''
   ``Is it too much to ask that in the land of our birth, we walk
tall as human beings made in the image of God? ... To say we want
to be free?''
   Joining him were the Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>, also an anti-apartheid
leader in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and almost 20 speakers, who called for
renewed dedication to the peaceful abolition of apartheid.
   ``Help us,'' the archbishop appealed, ``because we want the
emergence of a new <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> where black and white people would
live amicably together.
   ``Is it too much to ask to exert pressure to persuade the South
African government to come to the conference table?'' he asked.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   He condemned the ban on 17 organizations and individuals opposed
to apartheid and also said the South African news media is severely
restricted and ``collaborates in self-censorship.''

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
compared apartheid to Nazism during an emotional ceremony <DATE>Friday</DATE> in
which he was installed as chancellor of the country's most militant
university.
   The black Anglican leader, who returned <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from a month in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, also defended his controversial
appeals for tougher Western sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>
told students and staff at the <ORGANIZATION>University of the Western Cape</ORGANIZATION>. ``I
want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can be done away with
without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''
   Tutu's calls for punitive sanctions were covered extensively by
the South African media during his trip. His remarks have been
denounced not only by the government but also by white and black
moderates who contend that sanctions will increase black
unemployment without inducing whites to accept reforms.
   ``There are those who seek to generate hysteria,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said of
his critics. ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide
a viable, non-violent alternative.''
   Tutu, who won the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, was greeted by several hundred cheering students when he
arrived at the university's main hall before the ceremony.
   His aides had to form a human wall around him as they ushered
him through a crowd that chanted the archbishop's name and waved
placards with slogans like ``Viva Sanctions'' and ``Viva Tutu.''
   Tutu said he accepted the chancellorship on behalf of detainees,
political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of ``this vile
and obscene system'' of apartheid.
   He said apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical and
unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil
system _ Naziism.''
   As chancellor at <ORGANIZATION>University of the Western Cape</ORGANIZATION>, Tutu will be
the honorary leader of a university that the government established
for mixed-race students in <DATE>1960</DATE> as part of its segregated
educational system.
   He praised the university, near <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, as <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
``most potent academic institutional dissident.''
   In the <DATE>past decade</DATE>, the university has increased its black
enrollment from a handful to <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of the 11,500 students. Its
students and staff have grown increasingly militant in their
opposition to apartheid, under which the nation's black majority
has no voice in national affairs.
   The university's chief administrator, <PERSON>Rector Jakes Gerwel</PERSON>, says
the campus will be ``an intellectual home for the left.''
   Tutu has been the target of government wrath for years because
of his support of sanctions. Recently, the archbishop has drawn an
unprecedented degree of criticism from white liberals.
   Business Day, a <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> newspaper often critical of the
government, said in a recent editorial that blacks should insist
that Tutu live in the same conditions as the poorest unemployed
black squatter.

<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>
today on the first leg of a pilgrimage to five black-ruled nations
bordering racially-troubled <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Before leaving <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> on the 10-day journey, the pontiff said he
hopes he can help solve some of white-led <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s problems
on a future trip there.
   His fourth journey to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and his 39th abroad will be to
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> _ all
countries less than 20 years old that vehemently oppose <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> but depend on it for economic survival.
   In an unusual statement <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> emphasized the pope
was not snubbing <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and hoped to visit the country in the
future. It said the pope's full schedule on this trip made a stop
there impossible.
   The statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruled
out a visit to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, where a white minority rules 26
million blacks.
   During nearly 10 years at the helm of the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>John Paul</PERSON> has strongly denounced apartheid.
   ``No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be
acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races,''
he said in a <DATE>1985</DATE> address in the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, the pontiff received Anglican archbishop and <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel
Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> winner <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>, who defiantly invited arrest and
prosecution <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by urging a boycott of <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE> municipal
elections in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Tutu's challenge to the government came two days after the South
African law and order minister, <PERSON>Adriaan Vlok</PERSON>, said the time had
come to ``clip the wings'' of church leaders who hide behind the
``mask of liberation theology.'' Earlier this week, police armed
with a search warrant seized a tape of <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>'s sermon at the
archbishop's <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> office.
   When the pope greeted Tutu and other South African clergymen in
<DATE>May</DATE>, he said the system of racial segregation has exacted a
``terrible toll.'' Tutu urged tougher sanctions by Western nations
_ an issue on which the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> has not taken a position.
   South African Roman Catholic bishops, who have worked closely
with Anglicans, were waiting for the pope at his first stop in the
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>. They are attending a conference of
regional bishops there.
   After a meeting with <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>, the pope
planned to address the 71 bishops in a Dominican convent. The
speech, one of 42 drafted during a summer vacation in the
mountains, was expected to set the tone for the 12,400-mile voyage.
   In a document issued <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> said it was
perfectly legitimate for the oppressed to take action _ such as
passive resistance _ to secure structures and institutions in which
their rights would be respected.
   But it warned clergy against direct involvement in politics and
against any efforts to inject Marxism into church work on behalf of
the poor.

Tutu and other religious leaders called <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for a sweeping
campaign of defiance against new restrictions on opposition groups.
   Prominent clergy told their congregations that the church would
become more active in opposing apartheid now that the government
has banned political activity by 18 opposition groups. They called
for a church-led campaign against the latest crackdown.
   ``We have no option but to engage in activities that now are
prohibited,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>Frank Chikane</PERSON>, general secretary of the
<ORGANIZATION>South African Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``No matter what the consequences, we will continue to seek the
unbanning of democratic organizations and the transfer of power
from the white minority to all the people,'' <PERSON>Chikane</PERSON> told about 200
people at <ORGANIZATION>Central Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>.
   The government on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> banned the 18 black-led groups from
political activity and placed restrictions on the activities of 18
senior black leaders.
   Church groups weren't included in the crackdown and
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns,
but most forms of peaceful protest still are banned under existing
regulations.
   The outlawing of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups,
most of them affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION>United Democratic Front</ORGANIZATION> coalition,
is viewed as a clear sign that the government intends to maintain a
hard line against all political opponents.
   Rev. <PERSON>Peter Storey</PERSON>, a prominent white minister and anti-apartheid
activist, compared the crackdown with the government's <DATE>1960</DATE>
decision to outlaw the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group
and the <DATE>1977</DATE> banning of 18 black political organizations.
   ``To do a third time what has failed twice is rank stupidity,''
<PERSON>Storey</PERSON> said at the Central Methodist service. ``What the government
has done flies in the face of history, exhibits a moral bankruptcy
and is a declaration of war on peace.''
   In <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said he would defy government laws he
considers unjust.
   ``Apartheid is evil, apartheid is immoral and apartheid is
un-Christian,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> told about 200 people at the <ORGANIZATION>Bonteheuwel
Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize, described the South
African government as ``illegitimate'' and suggested church leaders
would initiate a civil disobedience campaign in coming days.
   None of the church leaders specified what activities they would
engage in, but there are several ongoing resistance campaigns that
were led by groups now restricted. Those include rent boycotts in
black townships, keeping track of dissidents under police
detention, and a push to restructure black education.
   Church services to express opposition the government's measures
also were held in <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Durban</LOCATION>, the country's other leading
cities.
   Under <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the nation's 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control over 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national
affairs.

<HEAD>Police Clash With Anti-Apartheid Protesters Near Cape Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to
disperse thousands of anti-apartheid protesters, including
<ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, and stone-throwing crowds in several
townships outside <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>.
   Columns of black smoke from burning street barricades were
visible across the densely populated <LOCATION>Cape Flats</LOCATION>, northeast of the
city center.
   The unrest has occurred almost daily for more than three weeks,
coinciding with the launch of a nationwide campaign to defy
apartheid restrictions.
   The <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> area has been the most troubled section in the
country. The area has experienced the most sustained series of
confrontations between police and activists in two years.
   Police headquarters said officers encountered stone-throwing
youths in at least seven black and mixed-race communities near <LOCATION>Cape
Town</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Tutu said that if Law and Order Minister <PERSON>Adriaan Vlok</PERSON> ``does not
constrain his security forces, and if they behave the way they did
today, then we are on the brink of a major disaster.''
   Tutu, leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, tried to
mediate between police officials and protesting youths in the black
township of <LOCATION>Guguletu</LOCATION>.
   The archbishop persuaded the youths to call off a planned march
from a high school to a police station, where they intended to
demand the release of several students and teachers detained in
recent weeks. Instead, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> arranged for a small delegation to go to
the station to present the demands.
   But police fired tear gas at <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, other clergymen, a white
opposition member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and hundreds of other people as they
emerged from a church where the archbishop had been reporting on the
latest developments.
   Tutu said the tear gas was fired without warning after he urged
the protesters to disperse peacefully.
   Police showed an ``incredible impatience and eagerness to use the
whole range of their armory,'' said Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel
Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said he was surprised that youths ``were still listening to
community leaders who urged non-violence. If I was young, I would
not listen to Archbishop Tutu.''
   Police also used tear gas on several thousand marchers at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of the Western Cape</ORGANIZATION>, a militantly anti-government school
where most students are mixed-race.
   The marchers, including teachers, students and workers, were
fired at with tear gas as they reached the main gate of the campus,
leading out to a highway. The marchers carried placards supporting
the defiance campaign and criticizing police action against
activists.
   Organizers said further protests were planned to oppose the visit
to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> by an international rugby team, which activists say
is undermining the sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid. The
visiting team is scheduled to play <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s national team in
<LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>
inspected the bombed headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION>South African Council of
Churches</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, then prayed for those who planted the
explosives.
   Police later surrounded and entered the nearby <ORGANIZATION>Central Methodist
Church</ORGANIZATION>, where the black prelate gave a news conference and tried to
hold a private meeting with members of the church council staff.
   ``The only surprising thing is it took so long,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said of
the bombing while a security police video team filmed him.
   An explosion before dawn <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE> heavily damaged <ORGANIZATION>Khotso House</ORGANIZATION>,
where the council and several other anti-apartheid groups have
their offices. More than 20 people in the area suffered slight
injuries and the building was declared unsafe for further use.
   The council moved into <ORGANIZATION>Khotso House</ORGANIZATION> during Tutu's tenure as
general secretary 1978-1984. Tutu won the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize
for his work against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid policy of racial
discrimination and now heads the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``Foul, foul foul!'' Tutu muttered, bending under crumpled
doorways and crunching shattered glass beneath his feet during a
tour of three of the building's six floors.
   Tutu and the church council's current general secretary, the
Rev. <PERSON>Frank Chikane</PERSON>, entered through a balcony from a temporary
metal staircase over the wrecked main entrance.
   They went to each floor via the back fire escape because the
building's staircases were impassable. Walls were knocked down,
glass was broken and doors were blown out in every room.
   Surveying the elevator shaft, which apparently took the brunt of
the explosion, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said: ``It was done by an expert.''
   He stepped on a small table as he entered his old office and it
collapsed, then a partition fell over next to him. ``I left this
office in better shape,'' he told <PERSON>Chikane</PERSON>.
   At the news conference, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said ``the forces of darkness''
were behind the bombing and declared that ``the government, and its
supporters have tried before to destroy'' the council.
   When asked who he held was responsible, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said: ``Sometimes I
amaze myself at how diplomatic I can be. But people who are wise,
like yourselves, know exactly who we mean.''
   Police have not reported significant progress in their
investigation. Anti-apartheid activists believe the attackers were
right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit.
   If the police make arrests in the case ``I will give them a
prize,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   Police allowed a crowd of blacks to sing and dance in the street
outside <ORGANIZATION>Khotso House</ORGANIZATION> for nearly an hour. Riot police moved in as
Tutu came out to deliver his prayer for the bombers but took no
action.
   Soon afterward, however, officers scuffled with a guard at the
door of the <ORGANIZATION>Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> conference hall when he tried to keep
them out of the meeting.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Police today handcuffed and
arrested <PERSON>Trevor Tutu</PERSON>, son of Nobel Prize winner <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>, for
failing to appear in court for traffic violations.
   The arrest came minutes after the 32-year-old son of the black
Anglican church leader faced a court on another charge.
   Tutu shouted at police during his arrest and urged his immediate
release. ``I have already been threatened with death,'' he told
reporters.
   The arrest came after he appeared in <ORGANIZATION>Kempton Park Magistrate</ORGANIZATION>'s
Court because of remarks he allegedly made to police <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE> when
they told him not to leave his luggage unattended at an airport.
   Police have not said what remarks he may have made, and the court
case was postponed until <DATE>Feb. 15</DATE>.
   As <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> left the courthouse, police handcuffed and arrested him
on charges of failing to appear in court for three traffic
violations. He was then taken to <ORGANIZATION>Johannesburg Magistrate's Court</ORGANIZATION>.
   While he was being arrested, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> called one superintendent a
``stupid hooligan.''
   He was questioned at the second courthouse and taken to police
headquarters for investigation of other possible charges. He told
reporters he intended bringing an urgent court action for his
release and protection from possible police violence.
   <PERSON>Trevor Tutu</PERSON> is the eldest of four children of <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Tutu</ORGANIZATION>,
leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Church</ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and winner of the
<DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning.
   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Trevor Tutu</PERSON> was held by police for three days before he
being cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In <DATE>1985</DATE>, he was
briefly detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the
detention of black children.
   The <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE> incident began when police told him not to leave his
luggage unattended at <LOCATION>Jan Smuts Airport</LOCATION>.
   Police have warned <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> not to leave parcels and
luggage unattended in public places because of a bombing campaign by
anti-government guerrillas, which has killed 35 people and injured
more than 660 in the past 2{ years.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>, the Anglican archbishop
of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> his country's racial policies would
change immediately if the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other Western nations
demanded it.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in <DATE>1984</DATE> for his active
opposition to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s segregation policies known as
apartheid, said his nation's racial policies are maintained because
of ``immense economic interests'' by Western governments.
   ``If the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the Western countries wanted,
apartheid would end tomorrow,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said at a news conference.
   ``Some actions taken by the Western government have a background
of racism,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> told reporters. ``They say that dollars are more
important than people, especially when those people are black.''
   Tutu and six other Anglican officials arrived in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
from <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, where they toured the country for five days. They
leave <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Managua</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the clerics issued a statement backing the
leftist Sandinista government's recent reforms and called on the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government to help resettle the 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels in
<LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>.
   An agreement signed <DATE>Feb. 14</DATE> by five Central American presidents
sought to disband the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. The
Contras have been supported by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government since <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   The Anglican officials are visiting at the invitation of the Rev.
<PERSON>Sturdie Downs</PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Edmond Browning</PERSON>, Anglican primate in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said he
accepted the invitation after hearing about ``the horrible pain and

   The religious leaders were scheduled to meet <DATE>Monday</DATE> with Gen.
<PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, head of the nation's security forces.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government imposed sanctions against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in <DATE>April

<HEAD>Archbishop Denounces Police Response to Bomb Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>
criticized police <DATE>Monday</DATE> for suggesting that a bomb blast at the
headquarters of several anti-apartheid groups was caused by
explosives stored in the building.
   Police officials made the suggestion <DATE>last week</DATE> following the
<DATE>Aug. 31</DATE> explosion that wrecked <ORGANIZATION>Khotso House</ORGANIZATION>, a six-story office
building in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> used by the <ORGANIZATION>South African Council of
Churches</ORGANIZATION> and several human rights groups.
   Police said investigators had been unable to get through the
rubble to the section of an underground garage where the bomb was
believed to have been placed.
   But they suggested explosives were being stored in the building
for use elsewhere. Building occupants said they believe the bombers
were right-wing extremists or even security force members.
   ``The police have implied that those who work in <ORGANIZATION>Khotso House</ORGANIZATION>
are perpetrators of violence,'' said <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>, leader of the Anglican
church in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``It is an absolutely disgraceful suggestion to make, and it is
made worse by the fact the police have made it without a tittle of
evidence and before doing any proper investigation,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said in
a statement.
   ``We are still waiting to hear the government's clear
condemnation of the bombing.''
   He said the bombing should be viewed in the context of a claim
by military commanders last week that the army was beyond the
jurisdiction of the courts because <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> was in a state of
war.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Tutu deliberately defied a government ban on calls
for voting boycotts, urging blacks and whites to stay away from the
polls in next month's nationwide municipal elections.
   State-of-emergency regulations provide for a jail sentence of up
to 10 years for promoting election boycotts.
   A Law and <ORGANIZATION>Order Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Brig. <PERSON>Leon Mellet</PERSON>, said the
text of Tutu's speech would be studied. He declined to comment on
possible action against the black archbishop, who won the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel
Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold
separate elections <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE> to choose local officials.
   Many anti-apartheid activists oppose black participation in any
local or regional elections as long as blacks are excluded from
national elections.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs, although the 26 million blacks make up about <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s population.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>
renewed his call for increased <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pressure to end apartheid in
his country.
   ``What must still happen?'' to prompt the American government to
act, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> asked repeatedly in a commencement address at <ORGANIZATION>Emory
University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``All the things you hold dear in this land are undermined,
destroyed, held in small account (in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>),'' he told the
graduates.
   Tutu dismissed arguments that economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> only hurt black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>, questioning the motives of
``those who suddenly decide they feel sorry for black people.''
   Tutu further criticized <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> news coverage of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,
especially since the government there moved to limit coverage of
protests.
   ``Media in this land, with a few notable exceptions, have shown
extraordinary timidity,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said. He said American readers do
not see the newspaper stories which appear in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
detailing the injustices of apartheid.
   Tutu also made an apparent reference to a controversy at <ORGANIZATION>Emory</ORGANIZATION>
over the dismissal <DATE>last fall</DATE> of a black professor who was denied
tenure. Supporters of the teacher, <PERSON>Sondra O'Neal</PERSON>, demonstrated on
the campus <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and distributed fliers <DATE>Monday</DATE> protesting alleged
racism at the school.
   Tutu said <ORGANIZATION>Emory</ORGANIZATION> ``has a good record'' of seeking racial justice
in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and around the world.
   ``One would want to be equally concerned about similar issues
here,'' he added. ``... It is critical for this institution, with
which I am honored to be associated, to show a zeal to eradicate
something which could be a stumbling block.''
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, received an honorary
doctor of divinity degree during the commencement program.

   Tutu indicated that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> responded positively to the requests

   As chief of <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto leader.

   Tutu, the black prelate who won the Nobel Peace Prize in <DATE>1984</DATE> for

spoke briefly with reporters.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> has elections scheduled for <DATE>May 7</DATE> to elect a new president

Noriega denied the charges.
   Tutu and his fellow Anglican leaders visited <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> for five

<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> told
students that apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical
and unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil
system _ Nazism.''
   At his installation <DATE>Friday</DATE> as chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
the Western Cape</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's most militant university, the black
Anglican clergman also defended his appeals for tough Western
sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable,
non-violent alternative,'' said the prelate, who is the Anglican
spiritual leader for all of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>.
   Tutu said he accepted the position of chancellor on behalf of
detainees, political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of
``this vile and obscene system'' of apartheid, the country's race
segregation system under which the black majority has no voice in
national affairs.
   The prelate returned home <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from a month in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> during which he asked for punitive sanctions
against this country.
   The calls were widely covered here in the news media and
denounced not only by the government but by white and black
moderates who say sanctions will increase black unemployment
without inducing whites to accept reforms.
   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``I want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can
be done away with without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''
   Tutu was greeted by hundreds of cheering students upon his
arrival.
   As chancellor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of the Western Cape</ORGANIZATION>, Tutu will
be the honorary leader of a university that the government
established for mixed-race students in <DATE>1960</DATE> as part of its

   ``We do not want any high-profile visits to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> because

``They suggest that President de Klerk has done something positive,

invitation to meet <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, but would
be unable to accept it because he will be in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
   However, he said <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON>Govan Mbeki</PERSON> and <PERSON>Raymond Mhlaba</PERSON>, who
were imprisoned with <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION> for plotting to overthrow the
government, will meet with the secretary of state.
   Asked to explain why <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> leaders would meet with <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> inside
the country after <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>'s comments, <PERSON>Sisulu</PERSON> said the issue had not
thoroughly been discussed earlier. In any case, he said, <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>'s
meetings are considered different from those of the other black
leaders.
   Tutu, the Anglican archbishop of <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION> who won the <DATE>1984</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, said he expected to meet <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, probably in <LOCATION>Cape
Town</LOCATION>, although the meeting hadn't been confirmed.
   Regarding <ORGANIZATION>Mandela</ORGANIZATION>'s statement, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said: ``I appreciate the
necessity for political leaders to keep foreign governments under
pressure to take a firm stand against apartheid.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Mother <PERSON>Teresa</PERSON> ended a one-week trip
to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> today with a visit to a vast black squatter camp,
and a pro-government newspaper praised her for declining to discuss
politics during her stay.
   The 78-year-old nun, winner of the <DATE>1979</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize,
visited an old age home, a church and a high school in <LOCATION>Winterveld</LOCATION>, a
shantytown of 500,000 blacks north of <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> in the nominally

   At each stop, <ORGANIZATION>Mother Teresa</ORGANIZATION> was welcomed by cheering crowds and
gave brief speeches urging people to love one another.
   At the start of her visit, <PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> told reporters she would
not become involved in political debate and added: ``I did not know
that something like apartheid existed.''
   Under apartheid, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no say in

   The Citizen, a pro-government <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> daily, praised Mother
<PERSON>Teresa</PERSON> for not making political statements and said she was more
worthy of praise than <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, also winner

TUTU CALLS U.S. RIGHTS STRUGGLE INSPIRING

<P>
Softly and reverently the choir began to sing, and a knowing look flashed 
across the face of <ORGANIZATION>South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the pulpit of <ORGANIZATION>Holman United Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>West Adams Boulevard</LOCATION> 
on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> closed his eyes meditatively, and joined the choir in singing 
"Oh Freedom," an African-American spiritual heard often during the civil rights 
movement of the <DATE>1960s</DATE>: 
</P>
<P>
 "And before I'd be a slave 
</P>
<P>
 I'd be buried in my grave 
</P>
<P>
 And go home to my Lord and be free." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu noted the links between the civil rights movement and the liberation 
struggle in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We thank you for the inspiration that we have received from your own civil 
rights movement," he told the overflow crowd of more than 900 at the <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> 
services. "Thank you for <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Thank you for those who were 
his mentors such as <PERSON>James Lawson</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Once an aide to King, <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON>, the church's pastor, was a key figure in the 
civil rights movement. He is also Tutu's friend. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> laureate had come to the church as part of a 
10-day speaking and fund-raising tour in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. While Tutu spoke 
of the need to end apartheid, his message was also punctuated with his 
characteristic humor. 
</P>
<P>
"When the missionaries came to our neck of the woods, we had the land and they 
had the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>," he said, describing the arrival of colonialism to the African 
continent. "They said, 'Let us pray,' and we foolishly closed our eyes. And 
when we opened our eyes, we had the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> and they had the land." 
</P>
<P>
The ebullient Tutu couldn't help laughing along with the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his anecdote on colonialism, Tutu paid tribute to those who came to 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to build clinics and hospitals and to minister. The <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>, he said, 
turned out to be an important tool for the oppressed people of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to oppress people, the last thing you should have made available 
is the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> because it is the most subversive -- the most revolutionary -- for 
those who you would wish to be docile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need a Marxist communist manifesto," he said. "Nothing is more 
radical (than the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>). So we say thank you for bringing the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>. We are 
taking it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu likened black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> to people set free from bondage by God. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing our promised land in sight now," he said. "We are seeing the 
possibility of a new <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
He stretched out his arms, asking: "When God is for us . . . " -- here the 
congregation joined in, reciting the Scripture with him -- "who can be against 
us?" 
</P>
<P>
In a Mother's Day tribute, Tutu came down from the pulpit after his sermon and 
hugged the congregation's oldest mother -- a 97-year-old church member -- and 
the newest mother, who held a 9-day-old child in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, church members sold taped recordings of the archbishop's speech and 
books on <LOCATION>Southern Africa</LOCATION>. Many at <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s services found a special message in 
the sermon for African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"It strengthened my faith in God and the righteousness and victory of our 
struggle," said <PERSON>Karen Williams</PERSON>, who visited <PERSON>Holman</PERSON> to hear Tutu. "It's 
important that we connect our struggle here with (that of) our brothers and 
sisters in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>." Seventeen-year-old <PERSON>Daniel McClellan</PERSON> viewed the speech 
as a "wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
"His message was that we need to shape up our attitude and get more involved in 
foreign policy," <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> said. "I think that one day <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> will be 
free and run by a black majority." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> said he hoped Tutu's visit would inspire the African-American community 
to contribute to the development of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and the continent as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the African-American community must become the instrument for 
pouring into <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> human resources, talent," the minister said. "They need 
doctors, lawyers, engineers, pilots. These are all things in which we can 
help."

<HEAD>Pope Urges `Only Peaceful Means' To Fight Apartheid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> urged Christians
in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to reject violence in fighting apartheid, which he
said had exacted a ``terrible toll.''
   ``I pray that the Christian communities in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> will
continue to foster only peaceful means of responding to the
difficulties of the present situation,'' the pope said in remarks
to a visiting delegation of South African churchmen, including
<ORGANIZATION>Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION>.
   The pope restated his and the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>'s opposition
to all forms of racial discrimination, adding that a change in the
structures of discrimination requires ``a change of hearts.''
   The 10-member delegation was a joint group of the <ORGANIZATION>South African
Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Southern African Catholic Bishops'
Conference</ORGANIZATION>.
   In their address to the pope, the church officials said recent
government actions in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> have ``resulted in bitterness,
resentment and frustration _ feelings which can easily lead to
violence.''
   They said an emergency meeting of church leaders will be held in
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> on <DATE>May 30</DATE>.
   ``The emergency convocation will develop effective non-violent
action to put pressure on the South African government to sit at
the negotiating table and for the church to refuse to collaborate
with the unjust system,'' the delegation said in a news statement.
   At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> winner, said the
pope was making an ``eloquent statement'' by not visiting <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> during his tour of four African nations next <DATE>September</DATE>.
   ``It speaks to the perpetrators of apartheid, it speaks to the
victims,'' he said.
   Tutu called for tougher sanctions by Western nations against the
South African government.
   ``If we do not apply sanctions, or if sanctions are ineffective,
what is effective?,'' he said. ``If you say sanctions will fail or
have failed, than you can tell us what will succeed...then the very
last last option available is violence and we have consistently
expressed our opposition to violence... So we say, `help us.' ''
   He criticized <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for its trade links with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``We hope that the Japanese would be embarassed that they have
stepped into a vacuum,'' he said. ``I hope the Japanese will
remember that they were insulted in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> when the
government was enforcing racial classification. Because they wanted
the Japanese as traders, they called them `honorary Europeans.' I
would hope they would get so upset, they would go back home.''

<TEXT>
   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>, his wife
and 34 other activists were arrested today as they began a march
protesting the alleged beating of clergy and church workers during
an anti-apartheid protest.
   The Anglican archbishop, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>,
was angered by reports that police earlier today had severely beaten
about 20 protesters from the <ORGANIZATION>Western Province Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>.
   The clerics and churchworkers said police used batons and whips
to chase them from a security police office in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, where they
had gone to condemn recent detentions of activists.
   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left <ORGANIZATION>St. George's
Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> to begin a protest march, they encountered police who
formed a human barricade. Police told the demonstrators to disperse,
then led them into vans when they refused.
   The marchers carried placards with slogans such as ``To Hell With
Restrictions!'' and ``Stop Killing Our People!''
   <ORGANIZATION>Canon Winston Ndungane</ORGANIZATION>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Anglican
Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>'s arrest was ``a further
indication that the authorities will use whateverwork stoppages at their
factories to protest a labor law which they say cripples their power
to strike.
   One of the biggest union protests was at a <ORGANIZATION>Unilever Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> factory
in <LOCATION>Boksburg</LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, where 1,000 workers marched
around the premises, many carrying placards denouncing the year-old
Labor Relations Amendment Act.
   The two main black labor federations on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> called on their
1.5 million members to stage protests against the act, which limits
the ability of workers to strike, during work hours today.
   The federations also joined other major anti-apartheid groups in
calling for a national protest on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> against the
segregated parliamentary elections on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. In the past, such
protests have taken the form of a general strike.
   The same organizations have been orchestrating a campaign since
early <DATE>August</DATE> to challenge segregation laws and mobilize opposition
to the elections.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, activists plan to attempt an illegal march toward
the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> buildings in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, and on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> blacks plan to
hold a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in <LOCATION>Durban</LOCATION>.
   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past
week and have banned at least two protest rallies planned for this
<DATE>weekend</DATE>, including a ``peace service'' in <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION> which was to be
addressed by <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Detainees Aid Center, which assists families of detainees,
said two black activists were detained <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Soweto</LOCATION> when they
made their daily appearance at a police station in accordance with
restrictions imposed when they were released from a previous stint
in detention.
   On <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>'s outskirts, where police and militant youths have
clashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race students
reportedly were wounded today when officers fired tear gas and
birdshot to disperse a rally.
   The independent <ORGANIZATION>South African Press Association</ORGANIZATION> quoted a teacher
as saying several students were arrested.
   Police said three mixed-race men were injured <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when
a small mine exploded at a civic center in <LOCATION>Athlone</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>.
There was no claim of responsibility.
   Police headquarters said five black men were found dead from
bullet wounds at a house in <ORGANIZATION>Natal Province</ORGANIZATION>. Much of the province has
been wracked by a three-year power stuggle pitting supporters of
militant anti-apartheid groups against members of the more
conservative Zulu political organization Inkatha.

<TEXT>
   With secular anti-apartheid
groups effectively silenced, clergymen have sharpened their attacks
on the white-led government and rekindled a longstanding
church-state conflict.
   Spared in recent government crackdowns, activist church leaders
represent one of the few prominent opposition forces operating
without restrictions.
   In recent weeks, <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> and other
clergymen have organized and led demonstrations, issued harsh
anti-government statements, focused sermons on political themes and
dared authorities to act against them.
   ``The churches have been pushed to the front line of the
struggle,'' said the Rev. <PERSON>Alan Boesak</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>World
Alliance of Reformed Churches</ORGANIZATION>. ``We have always protested against
apartheid. We must now go over to participate in the resistance
against apartheid.''
   Although President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Party</ORGANIZATION> government has
refrained from clamping down on the clergymen, it has attempted to
undercut the credibility of <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> and other prominent
ministers.
   Botha regularly refers to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> as a country guided by
Christian principles, yet pointedly tells anti-apartheid clergymen
they have no business in politics.
   In recent letters to activist church leaders, <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said the
clergymen ``love and praise'' the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>African National
Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, ``with its Marxist and atheistic
ideology.''
   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,
hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> said. ``The
question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of the
kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>.''
   ``I work for God's kingdom,'' replied Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE>
<ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>. ``For whose kingdom, with your apartheid policy,
do you work for?''
   At one point, the Anglican church threatened to sue <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>,
saying his statements were defamatory.
   ``I would like that,'' responded <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>. ``Then the government
will come forward with all the knowledge and facts it has at its
disposal.''
   <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> did not elaborate.
   The long-simmering, church-state feud began to boil over after
the government on <DATE>Feb. 24</DATE> banned 18 leading anti-apartheid
organizations from participating in politics. Church leaders
marched on <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 29</DATE> to protest the ban, and 25
clergymen, including Tutu, were briefly arrested.
   In early <DATE>March</DATE>, church leaders formed the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Defense of Democracy</ORGANIZATION> in a bid to fill the void created by the
government crackdown. But within days, Law and Order Minister
<PERSON>Adriaan Vlok</PERSON> barred the new organization from ``performing any
activities or acts whatsoever.''
   Boesak reported <DATE>March 11</DATE> that his house had been stoned and that
he had received death threats. He said that if anything happened to
him ``suspicion should fall on the South African government and the
police.''
   Two weeks later, police searched the home of a Catholic bishop,
<PERSON>Edward Adams</PERSON>, and confiscated documents related to local
organizations in the southern <LOCATION>Cape Province</LOCATION>.
   ``The state is intent on an open confrontation with the
church,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference</ORGANIZATION> said in
a statement condemning the search.
   Anglican bishops, backed by <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, declared the government had ``launched a
carefully planned attack'' on <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> and others, ``aimed at
portraying them as Marxists and isolating them from their churches
as a prelude to state action against them.''
   However, <PERSON>Botha</PERSON>'s verbal attacks on activist clergy have won
support from sectors of the white community, including the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch
Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION>, the largest white denomination.
   In this deeply religious country, the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION> has
long had close links to the government and maintained until <DATE>1986</DATE>
that apartheid was justified in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION>.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
25.6 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   Dutch Reformed leaders said recently that black clergy do not
represent the Christian church when they confront the state. The
leaders called on <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> to ``divorce themselves from this
impious road and to discuss their problems openly'' with <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Vlok</PERSON>, ``who are both avowed Christians.''
   The anti-apartheid clergy are denounced frequently in letters to
the editor in the pro-government newspapers.
   ``These men are doing Satan's work,'' said one recent letter in
The Citizen, a <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> daily. ``It is hoped that these
troublemakers are dealt with, and not to worry about the cloth they
wear.''
   But the criticism appears only to have strengthened the
ministers' resolve to confront the government.
   ``The government of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has signed its own death
warrant,'' <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> said in a recent sermon in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>. ``No
government can challenge the living God and survive.''
   ``I am not going to allow this government to choose my friends
for me,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said at the same service. ``If teaching the gospel
of Jesus Christ is going to lead me into trouble, tough luck.''

<HEAD>Tutu Praises White Youth Facing Jail For Refusing Military Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond
Tutu</PERSON> today praised an 18-year-old white man who has been sentenced
to six years in prison for refusing to serve in the armed forces.
   <PERSON>Charles Bester</PERSON> was convicted and sentenced <DATE>Monday</DATE>, becoming the
second conscientious objector to receive the maximum six-year
sentence since a recent toughening of penalties for draft resisters.
   <PERSON>Bester</PERSON> told the court his Christian beliefs did not allow him to
perform military service because he felt the armed forces were used
to uphold apartheid. Dozens of supporters, including many young
blacks, attended the court session, and several were threatened with
contempt charges after they sang an anti-apartheid anthem.
   Tutu, a <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> winner who is the first black to head
the Anglican church in <LOCATION>Southern Africa</LOCATION>, said of <PERSON>Bester</PERSON> in a
statement: ``We believe your cause to be right. Be strong and of
good courage.''
   ``We are certain that justice and righteousness will overcome
evil oppression and we shall all be free, black and white
together,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said. ``Your decision brings that glorious day
closer.''
   Tutu's statement was read at a news conference attended by
<PERSON>Besters</PERSON>' parents, who expressed full support for their son.
   Earlier this year, <PERSON>David Bruce</PERSON>, 25, was sentenced to six years in
prison for refusing military service, and <PERSON>Dr. Ivan Toms</PERSON>, who
completed his initial 2-year military service in <DATE>1979</DATE>, was sentenced
to 21 months in jail for refusing to report for a call-up camp.
   Military service is compulsory for white males in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
and voluntary for other races. The government has banned the End
Conscription Campaign, a nationwide group opposed to mandatory
military service.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs. The white minority controls the economy has separate
districts and health services.

<HEAD>Tutu Visits Blacks Threatened With Eviction</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PORT NOLLOTH, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> prayed with and encouraged blacks threatened with eviction
from this fishing town, hundreds of miles from the nearest area
where they can live legally.
   The church service concluded a two-day visit by the Anglican
leader to a windswept, treeless plain outside <LOCATION>Port Nolloth</LOCATION>, about
400 miles north of <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>. About 500 blacks live in 90 tents in
the remote town.
   ``God is on your side, and God cannot ultimately be defeated,''
<PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> told the congregation. ``That is why those who oppress you
have already lost.''
   The tent dwellers, who were served with eviction notices in
<DATE>January</DATE>, are fighting the order in court.
   Under <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s segregation laws, blacks have no legal
right to live in this sparsely populated region called <LOCATION>Namaqualand</LOCATION>,
which stretches along the <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> to the border with
<LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>.
   The nearest official black township is in <LOCATION>Upington</LOCATION>, more than
300 miles east.
   Tutu arrived <DATE>Saturday</DATE> on his first visit to the desolate camp
whose residents collect water in barrels and use portable outhouses.
   About 100 women, some with babies on their backs, led the black
archbishop and his wife, <PERSON>Leah</PERSON>, through the rows of tents.
   While Tutu conferred with community leader Lingington Sonqishe
in a corrugated metal shack, a crowd outside sang in praise of <ORGANIZATION>Tutu</ORGANIZATION>
and <PERSON>Oliver Tambo</PERSON>, president of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION>African National
Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group fighting apartheid.
   Under apartheid, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no voice
in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   Tutu, winner of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize for his campaign
against the policy of segregation, said he was dismayed at the
living conditions but impressed with the determination of the
residents.
   ``I want to express admiration for the people here, at the
extraordinary resilience and the strength of their commitment to
stand for their rights,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said. ``One is humbled, really, to
see how people refuse to be manipulated and intimidated.''
   Many of the <LOCATION>Port Nolloth</LOCATION> blacks, who work in mines or with the
fishing industry, have been in the area for 10 years. Initially,
they lived with mixed-race people in a shantytown that was
demolished.
   The mixed-race population was given new housing, while most of
the blacks fled to <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>, which is ruled by <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>. Authorities there forced them back into <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1986</DATE>, and the blacks believed the government was going to allow
them to stay permanently.
   A legal battle has been waged since then, with the next court
session scheduled <DATE>Nov. 9</DATE>.
   ``They were given the promise that they would have houses built
for them,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said. ``The town council is reneging on that
promise. Their only sin is that they have black skin.''
   If the tents are demolished, <PERSON>Sonqishe</PERSON> said, the residents would
live outdoors ``like monkeys and baboons. Then the whole world will
see the suffering.''
   Tutu's visit to <LOCATION>Port Nolloth</LOCATION> was covered by crews from
<ORGANIZATION>Independent Television Network</ORGANIZATION> and Visnews, two London-based
television news agencies. ITN's bureau chief, <PERSON>Mike Wills</PERSON>, said
security police seized the film when it arrived at a small airport

   Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON> offered a public vote
of confidence <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON>, saying the new
secretary of state is open to new ideas and ``not dogmatic'' in
discussions with church leaders pressing for sanctions against the
white-ruled government of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``I don't want to be euphoric, but we certainly have been
impressed,'' said the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who flew to
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for the early-evening meeting between <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> and a
delegation sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>World Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>.
   Tutu said <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> made no promises, but indicated the new
administration is reviewing its policy toward <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Asked to compare his first meeting with <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> and past sessions
with former Secretary of State <PERSON>George Shultz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said:
   ``I was very impressed by the fact that he was not dogmatic, he
actually was discussing with the group and was interested in any
initiative that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> might actively take to pressure
the South African government to the negotiating table.''
   ``They are ... involved in a review process. He did not dismiss
us, he listened to us with very considerable interest,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said
after the half-hour session at the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Tutu joined a delegation that has been on a three-week tour of
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, several West European capitals and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to
convince government officials to take a stronger stand against <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION> and its policy of apartheid.
   The archbishop said the delegation asked <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> to consider the
imposition of more economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> as a
means of pressuring the white-rule government to abolish apartheid.
   Tutu stressed, however, the real appeal to <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was made as an
appeal against racial injustice.
   ``More than anything else, the call of the delegation (was) that
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had to take a moral leadership in what is a moral
issue facing the world,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> imposed sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> despite
a veto by then-President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, putting in place a ban on new loans
and investments, a prohibition of the importation of South African
coal and other materials, and halting direct U.S.-South African air
links.
   The group of church leaders, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION>Eminent Church
Persons Group</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>World Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>, is composed of
Metropolitan <PERSON>Paulos Mr Gregorios</PERSON>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Rev. Canaan Banana</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Elaine Hesse Greif</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, World YWCA general

   Police today arrested Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other church leaders as they marched
toward Parliament with a petition protesting the government's
crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.
   The clergymen, wearing robes and crosses around their necks,
stood with arms linked and Bibles clutched in their hands as a
policeman announced through a bullhorn that the gathering was
illegal. Police had been lining the street outside <LOCATION>St. George</LOCATION>'s
Anglican Cathedral, waiting for the marchers to emerge.
   After Tutu, a <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> laureate, and other clergymen
were placed in police vehicles, police fired water cannons at more
than 100 demonstrators sitting on the sidewalk singing a hymn,
local journalists said.
   The clergymen and demonstrators were taken to a police station
and released with a warning that charges would be brought against
them if they staged a similar protest, said the Rev. <PERSON>Allan Boesak</PERSON>,
president of the <ORGANIZATION>World Alliance of Reformed Churches</ORGANIZATION>. He said they
were told summonses might be issued against them for demonstrating
near <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> and they might be called to court.
   Police also took some journalists into custody.
   Upon their release, the white, black, mixed-race and Indian
clergymen held a news conference in the cathedral, which was still
surrounded by policemen with a water cannon nearby.
   ``We are not defying the law,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> said, ``we are obeying God.
We also obey God every day.''
   ``In the past,'' <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> continued, ``it was possible for people to
say it was the usual rabble rousers demonstrating. They can't say
it any more. It's the church.''
   Boesak described today's protest as ``an act of subversion.''
   ``We told the South African government that we had decided we
would be obedient to God. That is a higher law to us,'' he said.
   The clergymen carried a petition, addressed to President <PERSON>P.W.
Botha</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, saying: ``We leaders of a number of South
African churches have come to <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> today to witness and pray
in a time of crisis outside the buildings in which you make
important decisions affecting the lives of millions of <LOCATION>South
Africans</LOCATION> who belong to our churches.''
   The protesters, marching five abreast, walked a few yards toward
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>St. George's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>, the main Anglican church in
downtown <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>.
   In a service in the cathedral before the march, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> and other
ministers declared the churches would lead protests against the
government's anti-apartheid policies because 18 major black
opposition groups had been banned <DATE>last week</DATE> from all political
activity.
   Tutu marched in front of the procession, along with <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON> and
other prominent ministers.
   Tutu warned those at the service that they might be tear-gassed,
sprayed with water cannons or arrested. The church leaders said
they had informed the government about the proposed march.
   The march proceeded with clergymen at the end of each row and
lay people in the middle. As they reached <LOCATION>Government Avenue</LOCATION>, near
the Parliament buildings, they were met by about 50 policemen who
linked arms to block the road.
   The police told the crowd they were gathering illegally, then
began leading away the church leaders, starting with <PERSON>Boesak</PERSON>.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Sid Luckett</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Anglican Board of Social
Responsibility</ORGANIZATION>, led the rest of the crowd to the police vehicles
and they sat down on the sidewalk.
   Police sprayed the seated protesters with water cannons, but
they stayed in place, and were then put into police vans as they
recited the Lord's Prayer.
   Last <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the government banned the <ORGANIZATION>United Democratic
Front</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest anti-apartheid organization, and 17
other major black opposition groups from conducting any political
activity.
   Banning orders were also issued against 18 prominent black
leaders, prohibiting them from taking part in anti-government
activities, confining them to their hometowns, and ordering them
not to speak to the press.
   Church groups weren't included in the crackdown and
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns,
but most forms of peaceful protest are banned under existing
regulations.
   Tutu had called the new regulations ``a declaration of war
against the people.'' He and other church leaders had pledged the
churches would begin to conduct some of the protest campaigns that
had been organized by the banned groups.
   In <DATE>May 1980</DATE>, <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> was one of 54 people, mostly priests, who were
arrested in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> under the Riotous Assemblies Act for
marching in protest against the detention of a <ORGANIZATION>Congregational
Church</ORGANIZATION> minister. All were convicted and sentenced to pay a <MONEY>$45</MONEY> fine
or spend 50 days in jail. Tutu's fine was paid.
   Boesak was last arrested in <DATE>August, 1985</DATE>, when he was charged
with subversion for, among other things, organizing a march to
<LOCATION>Pollsmoor Prison</LOCATION> where African <ORGANIZATION>National Congress</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Nelson
Mandela</PERSON> is serving a life term. Fourteen months later the charges
were dropped.
   Under <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the nation's 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control over 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national
affairs.
