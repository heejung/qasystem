   Three top executives at <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s beleaguered <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm resigned suddenly and a fourth accepted reassignment to an unspecified job with the auto maker in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 

   The sweeping changes are a further disruption for <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>, which hasn't rebounded from safety allegations last year against its Samurai sport utility vehicle. 
The moves also come on the heels of <LOCATION>Suzuki</LOCATION>'s inability this year to successfully sell its first car in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   The three executives who resigned from <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, effective yesterday, are: <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager; <PERSON>John Dorsey</PERSON>, director of sales; and <PERSON>Larry Messelt</PERSON>, national sales manager. 
American Suzuki officials also said that the company's president for the past five years, <PERSON>Yoshiyuki Arai</PERSON>, will return to a job in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> at the beginning of <DATE>October</DATE>. 

   The company said that <PERSON>Kenji Shimizu</PERSON>, who was brought in above <PERSON>Mr. Arai</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>America Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> chairman in <DATE>July</DATE>, will assume <PERSON>Mr. Arai</PERSON>'s title. 
<PERSON>Mr. Shimizu</PERSON> also oversees <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> motorcycle, outboard motor and generator sales. 
The company is also transferring <PERSON>Yoshi Fujii</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to become executive vice president of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary. 

   No successors were named to replace the American executives who resigned. 
<PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> distribution manager for <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, joined Suzuki in <DATE>1985</DATE> shortly before it launched the Samurai in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> lured <PERSON>Mr. Dorsey</PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> and he, in turn, hired <PERSON>Mr. Messelt</PERSON> away from <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> said in an interview yesterday that the recent arrival of <PERSON>Mr. Shimizu</PERSON> and the pending arrival of <PERSON>Mr. Fujii</PERSON> had "no direct role" in his resignation. 

   Speaking for the other two American officials, he said in a prepared statement: "As a result of changes in the company's operating goals and philosophies, we have decided the time is right to move on to new challenges." 
<PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> declined to state more specifically what changes caused the resignations. 
But a spokeswoman for the company said the changes involved product-marketing priorities. 

   Suzuki enjoyed impressive growth selling only the Samurai during its first three years in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
But <DATE>last year</DATE>, Consumer Reports magazine published an extensive story that condemned the Samurai as unsafe because of its alleged tendency to roll over during sudden turns. 

   Although the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> refused to open a safety investigation into the allegations and <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> aggressively challenged its critics, Samurai sales evaporated. 

   Last fall, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials hoped to improve their standing with the new Sidekick sport utility vehicle and the subcompact Swift, which was the first car sold by Suzuki in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Neither vehicle has met expectations. 
Suzuki officials expected to ship 20,000 cars and 30,000 trucks a year at first. 
But <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> has sold only 4,000 Swifts so far this year and watched its truck sales drop <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> from already depressed levels to just 17,419 units.

   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm has named <PERSON>Gary Anderson</PERSON> its top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official in the wake of a series of resignations last month. 

   Three senior executives, all Americans, quit in <DATE>September</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, former vice president and general manager and at the time the top American, said in a prepared statement that his and the other resignations were prompted by "changes in the company's operating goals and philosophies." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>June 1987</DATE>, gets the title of marketing director for the company's automotive division. 
He inherits "bits of several positions," said a Suzuki spokeswoman, who added that a reorganization last month has eliminated some previous posts. 

   In his new job, <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON> will oversee all sales, advertising and dealer development activities in addition to formulating marketing strategies. 
Some of these duties had been handled by <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> and others by <PERSON>John Dorsey</PERSON>, former director of sales, and <PERSON>Larry Messelt</PERSON>, former national sales manager. 
Messrs. 
<PERSON>Dorsey</PERSON> and Messelt were the other two executives who resigned in <DATE>September</DATE>. 

   Suzuki sales so far this year, at 24,405 cars and sport utility vehicles, are less than half the level of a year ago, despite the introduction of two additional vehicles, including <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car. 
The company hasn't recovered from claims by Consumer Reports magazine that its Samurai utility vehicle was unsafe, even though the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> refused to open a safety investigation into the allegations. 

   "Suzuki recognizes its responsibility to boost dealer confidence and improve direct communication with its dealers and field personnel on its plans and strategies," said <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON> in a prepared statement. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Anderson</PERSON> was most recently <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> regional sales manager. 
He also served as manager of dealer development.

PEOPLE: SAMURAI SALES PLUNGE SPARKS SHUFFLE AT AMERICAN SUZUKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, staggered by a catastrophic decline in Samurai 
sales and weakness in its other automotive lines, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that its 
president has been reassigned to corporate headquarters in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and the three 
top officials of the auto division have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kenji Shimizu</PERSON>, chairman of Brea-based <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>July</DATE> and a longtime 
executive and managing director of the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> conglomerate in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, 
will replace <PERSON>Toshiyuki Arai</PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Yoshi Fujii</PERSON>, another longtime <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> executive from corporate headquarters in 
<LOCATION>Hamamatsu</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, has been named to the new position of executive vice 
president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> automotive division, which markets cars and 
sports vehicles. Other American Suzuki divisions market motorcycles and such 
miscellaneous products as outboard motors and snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman said no replacements have been named for the three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
automotive division executives who resigned <DATE>Monday</DATE>: <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, vice president; 
<PERSON>John Dorsey</PERSON>, sales director, and <PERSON>Larry Messelt</PERSON>, national sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dorsey</PERSON> were hired in <DATE>1985</DATE> to create <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s auto division, 
the same year Suzuki introduced the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
The Samurai quickly caught on with younger drivers interested in low-cost 
sports vehicles, and sales soared to 81,349 cars in <DATE>1987</DATE>. But in <DATE>June, 1988</DATE>, 
Consumer Reports magazine criticized the Samurai as being susceptible to 
rolling over, and sales began to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a federal study has since concluded that the Samurai is no more 
prone to rolling over than are similar vehicles, sales slumped to about 50,000 
in the <DATE>first eight months of 1988</DATE>, and in the first eight months of this year, 
just 3,399 Samurais have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s other vehicles -- a line of subcompacts and another sports 
vehicle introduced within the last year -- have also been hurt by the 
publicity. As of <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, Suzuki had sold just 21,389 cars and sports utility 
vehicles in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <ORGANIZATION>American Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s only statement about the management changes, spokeswoman 
<PERSON>Laura Segall</PERSON> said the company "has undergone significant changes in the past 
year." 
</P>
<P>
"When <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arai</PERSON> started in <DATE>1985</DATE>, they had only one automobile product, the 
Samurai, and the goal was to establish a following for and generate sales of 
the Samurai, which they did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now Suzuki is in a situation where we have a full line, including the 
Sidekick and the Swift passenger cars. The complexion of the company has 
changed, and there are different goals and philosophies on how best to run what 
essentially is a new company." 
</P>
<P>
Also <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> announced its <DATE>1990</DATE> automobile lineup. The Samurai 
is being de-emphasized, with fewer models and options being offered. Meanwhile, 
the Sidekick -- a squat version of the Samurai with a lower center of gravity, 
is being offered in several new configurations. As <DATE>last year</DATE>, there will be 
three models of the Swift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHAKE-UP AT <ORGANIZATION>AMERICAN SUZUKI 
</P>
<P>
American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, reorganized its executive suite 
<DATE>Monday</DATE> amid a continuing sales slump.

SUZUKI FALLS VICTIM TO ITS OWN SAMURAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just <DATE>two years ago</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, basking in the 
popularity of its Samurai sport vehicle, predicted that it would soon be 
selling a full line of automobiles in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. By <DATE>1990</DATE>, the company -- best 
known for its motorcycles -- expected to sell 300,000 cars and sport utility 
vehicles in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed for Suzuki since then and most of it for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Samurai have plummeted to 3,399 in the <DATE>first eight months of this 
year</DATE> from a high of 81,349 in <DATE>1987</DATE>. And sales of four new models introduced in 
the past year have been dismal: As of <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> had sold only 21,389 cars 
and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
As the crucial 1990-model season gets into full swing, <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> appears 
unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s president was reassigned to corporate 
headquarters in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, and three core members of the company's American 
management team abruptly resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The shake-up shocked Suzuki dealers, whose first shipments of <DATE>1990</DATE> vehicles 
were arriving that day. The company is not saying whether it plans to name 
replacements for the executives who resigned. The three were widely credited 
for the Samurai's early success. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other changes at <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION> headquarters. More than 
<PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> headquarters staff -- or about 25 workers -- were laid 
off earlier this year, a high-ranking executive of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company in 
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> took over as chairman of the operation in <DATE>July</DATE>, and the company is 
seeking a new advertising agency as the selling season begins. 
</P>
<P>
As Vice President <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, Sales Director <PERSON>John Dorsey</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>National Sales</ORGANIZATION> 
Manager <PERSON>Larry Messelt</PERSON> were resigning last week, marketing strategies for the 
1990-model season were still being developed and the company's only advertising 
was on billboards. The resignations left other plans undecided and raised 
speculation from analysts about more resignations or layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Issue 
</P>
<P>
"The best anyone can do is guess at where this company is headed," said <PERSON>Jeremy 
Anwyl</PERSON>, an auto industry consultant in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The decline of Brea-based American Suzuki can be traced to <DATE>June, 1988</DATE>, when the 
publisher of Consumer Reports magazine sharply criticized the safety of the 
Samurai, claiming that it was more prone to rolling over than other sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki spent <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> on rebates and lobbying in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to 
defend itself against the accusation. Early this year, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> won vindication 
when a federal study concluded that the vehicle was no more susceptible to 
rolling over than other similar sport trucks. By <DATE>March</DATE>, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> officials said 
the problem had been put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
However, not only has the Samurai failed to recover, but a <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman 
now acknowledges that the attacks on the Samurai have also tainted the image of 
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s four other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekick -- a utility vehicle similar to the Samurai -- and three models of 
the spunky Swift subcompact car have earned praise from reviewers, but sales 
have been disappointing. One Swift model, the GLX, has sold fewer than 1,000 
units and is being dropped from the <DATE>1990</DATE> line. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the Samurai, people don't have another image of <LOCATION>Suzuki</LOCATION>, except maybe as 
a motorcycle maker," said <PERSON>Anwyl</PERSON>, president of the ad agency <ORGANIZATION>USP Automotive 
Advertising</ORGANIZATION>. "When people criticized the Samurai, they might as well have been 
criticizing the whole Suzuki name." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials declined to discuss their marketing or sales plans, which for 
several years were developed largely by <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON>. Industry analysts describe the 
next several months as a crucial period for <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> to rebuild identity 
with consumers and with <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealers Disenchanted 
</P>
<P>
"Following these resignations, if they don't come back very strong with a lot 
of money, some new products and some major personnel announcements, (<ORGANIZATION>American 
Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>) might as well just go away," said <PERSON>Lee Sattley</PERSON>, vice president of 
operations for <ORGANIZATION>Astro Management</ORGANIZATION>, which closed its <ORGANIZATION>Lakewood Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> dealership in 
<DATE>August</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Sattley said his company, which still operates large <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> 
dealerships, decided to shut down its Suzuki operations "to stop the bleeding." 
He said he expects that other dealers will likely consider doing the same in 
the wake of <DATE>last week</DATE>'s resignations. 
</P>
<P>
"When you aren't getting a return on investment, and I don't imagine many 
dealers are, you look at your level of confidence in management," <PERSON>Sattley</PERSON> said. 
"Now, with basically all the familiar leadership decimated, it's pretty hard to 
have confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Many dealers made fast and hefty profits in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE> on the Samurai, which 
was introduced in <DATE>1985</DATE>. Now they get few requests for either the Samurai or the 
Swift, which holds the honor as the most fuel-efficient import for <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The struggles of Suzuki are similar to those faced by the West German auto 
maker <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' "60 Minutes" aired a story that said the <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 5000 
had a tendency to suddenly and dangerously accelerate. It wasn't until <DATE>July</DATE> of 
this year that the federal government cleared <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> in a major report, and 
concluded that the problem resulted from driver error. 
</P>
<P>
But <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION>'s sales -- across the board, not just for the <DATE>5000</DATE> -- have fallen 
precipitously over the past three years. After peaking at 73,000 cars in <DATE>1985</DATE>, 
sales fell to 23,000 last year, and analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> may never regain its <DATE>1985</DATE> 
sales level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Identity Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
"With <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> and Suzuki, once these companies were damaged, they can be 
vindicated and bring out the best product anywhere, but it doesn't make much 
difference," said <PERSON>George Peterson</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Auto Pacific Group</ORGANIZATION>, a 
consulting firm in <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki's "identity crisis," as one analyst described it, first took its toll at 
the dealer level. 
</P>
<P>
When Suzuki officials decided that clearing the Samurai name was the company's 
top priority, most of the company's resources were directed to that effort for 
several months. As a result, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s long-time strategy of maintaining close 
relationships with dealers started to weaken, said <PERSON>Jesse Snyder</PERSON>, <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> 
editor of Automotive News. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> said that when <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> introduced the Samurai in <DATE>1985</DATE>, the company spent 
a great deal of time calling on dealers and listening to their ideas and 
complaints. This was important in helping Suzuki build dealer loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Because <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> did not have a broad line of cars, the company couldn't insist 
that dealers sell only Suzukis. Instead, they signed up dealers whose lots were 
crowded with Nissans, <LOCATION>Toyotas</LOCATION>, Plymouths or Fords. 
</P>
<P>
After the Samurai controversy erupted, dealers continued to hang the Suzuki 
sign on their lots, but few customers were asking about Suzukis and few 
salesmen were having much luck selling the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzuki went to the back of the dealer's mind, and it hasn't come back," <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Respond 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bart Thomson</PERSON>, who was sales manager of <PERSON>Cormier Suzuki</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Lake Forest</LOCATION>, described 
Suzuki as slow to respond to dealers' needs. Some dealers felt that they 
weren't getting the answers that they needed to questions about the <ORGANIZATION>Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s 
safety and its future. Cormier, which operates dealerships for several car 
makers, closed its Suzuki dealership in <DATE>August</DATE> when it sold its franchise to 
Superior Suzuki in <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> is now trying to be responsive again. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asking us what we think," said <PERSON>John Mason</PERSON>, sales manager of <ORGANIZATION>Duarte 
Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>. Duarte sold 78 Suzukis in <DATE>August</DATE> and was American Suzuki's top dealer 
for the month. Suzuki's 285 dealers sold fewer than 12 cars each on average in 
<DATE>August</DATE>, a volume considered to be anemic. 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive to its dealers, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> in <DATE>August</DATE> agreed to pay half the cost of 
its dealers' advertising, at least through the end of <DATE>October</DATE>. Right now, that 
advertising makes up most of <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s advertising effort. 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Kenji Shimizu</PERSON> relocated from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> to take the newly 
created position of chairman of all of <LOCATION>Suzuki</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businesses, including a 
struggling motorcycle operation, he said he planned to restore auto sales by 
increasing the company's ad budget. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the <DATE>1990</DATE> Sidekick and the three-door Swift GA were introduced 
<DATE>Sept. 25</DATE>, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> had no major ad campaign to accompany the new models. While 
other auto makers are spending millions of dollars for sophisticated television 
and magazine ad campaigns, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s only ads will be on billboards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Hunt 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki put its advertising account up for review early in the <DATE>summer</DATE>, and had 
planned to name a new agency in <DATE>mid-September</DATE>. However, presentations from 
prospective agencies were abruptly canceled when <PERSON>Shimizu</PERSON> and then-president 
<PERSON>Toshiyuki Arai</PERSON> were called to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for meetings. It was <PERSON>Arai</PERSON> who was later 
reassigned to the home office. 
</P>
<P>
Presentations by the ad agencies have been rescheduled for the middle of 
<DATE>October</DATE>, but some analysts said <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> may not have an ad campaign for the rest 
of its fiscal year, which ends <DATE>March 31</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki spokeswoman <PERSON>Laura Segall</PERSON> said <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> may have a new campaign before 
<DATE>April</DATE> but no decision has been made and she declined to discuss the size of 
this year's ad budget. At the height of the <ORGANIZATION>Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s popularity, annual ad 
spending was estimated at <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY>. For <DATE>fiscal 1989</DATE>, the figure fell to <MONEY>$30 
million</MONEY>, and this year's total might be less than <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>, industry 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have the finest cars. But if nobody knows about you, you won't sell 
them," <PERSON>Anwyl</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that for <DATE>1990</DATE>, Suzuki appears to be de-emphasizing the Samurai, 
which for the first time is only available with a soft-top. Instead, the 
Sidekick and Swift are available with more options. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Competition 
</P>
<P>
A new Swift three-door hatchback with a retail price of <MONEY>$6,400</MONEY> will make Suzuki 
more competitive in <DATE>1990</DATE>, analyst <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said. An early version of the car 
was introduced in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Snyder of Automotive News</ORGANIZATION> said there is still a glut of inexpensive vehicles 
similar to most Swift models. And the Swifts are not the cheapest or sportiest 
of the cars that they compete against, he said. 
</P>
<P>
American Suzuki also increasingly is competing against its own parent company, 
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. In addition to selling cars through <ORGANIZATION>American 
Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>, the parent company sells its Sidekick and a version of the Swift to 
<ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION>, which includes them in its Geo line, an increasingly popular 
line of import cars from several manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekick is sold as the Geo Tracker and the Geo Metro is a Swift, described 
by <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> as a "stripped-down model." 
</P>
<P>
"What is the reason for the Swift to be marketed as the Swift?" Anwyl asked 
rhetorically. "There doesn't seem to be one."

<HL> Suzuki Lashes Out at Samurai's Critics, Calling Testing of Vehicles 'Distorted' </HL>
<AUTHOR> Joseph B. White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> AUT </IN>
<TEXT>
   With sales of its Samurai sport utility vehicle slumping, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> blasted Consumer Reports magazine for using "distorted" testing to reach the "inaccurate" and "defamatory" conclusion that Samurai is unsafe because it tends to roll over in sharp turns. 

   At a 90-minute news conference beamed by satellite from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to reporters in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the company escalated its war on <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union of U.S. Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the magazine's publisher, accusing it of "biased" and "seriously flawed" testing. 
<PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s automotive division, said <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>, a "small Japanese company" is being unfairly singled out for criticism. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> conceded that <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> hadn't asked the consumer group for more detailed information about exactly how it had conducted its road tests. 
But he insisted: "We do not have a rollover problem." 

   R. <PERSON>David Pittle</PERSON>, technical director for <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, asserted yesterday that the group's testing was fair. 
He added that <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> hasn't heard from Suzuki since he sent the company a copy of the Consumer Reports article, a videotape of a road test, and a copy of the test protocol. 
That was one day before the <DATE>June 2</DATE> news conference at which <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> pronounced the Samurai "unacceptable" and urged that all 150,000 Samurai vehicles sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> be recalled, he said. 
The group's findings came two months after similar charges by the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Pittle</PERSON> called <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s suggestion that it is the victim of a conspiracy "bizarre." 
He added: "Let's keep our eye on the ball. 
The car rolls over when it shouldn't." 

   As part of its effort to counter the safety critics, Suzuki spent an extra <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> just for television advertising during the past week, <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> said. 
The company also has supplied its dealers with a videotape detailing the company's case that the Samurai is stable. 

   Suzuki's immediate, combative stance -- complete with broad hints of possible legal action -- is a sharp contrast to the silent treatment some other auto makers have used in the face of similar attacks. 

   Samurai sales were slumping even before the safety questions came to the fore in <DATE>March</DATE>. 
But they fell <PERCENT>22.5%</PERCENT> that month, and <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> in <DATE>April</DATE>, from the year-earlier periods. 
They appeared to rebound in <DATE>May</DATE>, but Suzuki dealers contacted since the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> made its report say showroom traffic is off again. 

   Suzuki's troubles have been a source of glee for <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Jeep-Eagle dealers. 
The Samurai had cut heavily into sales of Jeep's Wrangler models, but one Jeep dealer in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> said questions about Samurai safety appear to be changing that. 

   "We had 30 Wranglers in, and in two weeks time they're gone," said <PERSON>Bill Gill</PERSON>, manager of the sales department for <ORGANIZATION>Royal Jeep-Eagle</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fern Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
Nationwide, Wrangler sales through <DATE>May 31</DATE> were up <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT> from a year earlier. 
Samurai and Wrangler appeal to the same young audience, but now "their parents are bringing them here instead of there," <PERSON>Mr. Gill</PERSON> said. 

   A few miles away, <PERSON>Jeff Nanton</PERSON>, an owner of <PERSON>Seminole Suzuki</PERSON>, said his sales are soft, but he blamed that on a "depressed" regional market. 
"What we're fighting is an allegation rather than a fact," he said. 
"We've had many customers call in total support of the vehicle."

   When <PERSON>Melvin Adams</PERSON> bought his first sport-utility vehicle, a Chevrolet Blazer, back in <DATE>1975</DATE>, he mainly wanted the four-wheel-drive function to help battle treacherous winter roads. 

   Last year, <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> bought a new compact S10 Blazer for outdoor recreation and hunting -- and for his wife's daily use around town. 
Nowadays, "you can drive them to something like a wedding and no one will care," says <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Coleman Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a camping-equipment concern based in <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan</LOCATION>. 
"They're more socially acceptable." 

   Indeed, sport-utility vehicles have surged in popularity in recent years. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales are expected to reach 820,000 this year, more than six times the 132,000 sold in <DATE>1982</DATE> when the boom began. 

   The big reason for the increase has been the rapid proliferation in models and the expanding array of buyers they have drawn, from teen-agers in search of cheap wheels to image-conscious young adults drawn by the vehicles' new high-status looks. 
In <DATE>1981</DATE>, Americans had only 10 essentially similar models to choose from. 
Now there are twice as many, from the spartan, subcompact Suzuki Samurai that sells for <MONEY>$7,725</MONEY>, to the <ORGANIZATION>Range Rover</ORGANIZATION>, a new luxury British import that costs <MONEY>$31,900</MONEY> and has attracted such buyers as actor <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "You can get them as nice as a Cadillac," says <PERSON>Lance Kirk</PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON>Dick Hatfield Chevrolet</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan</LOCATION>. 

   Until the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, the sport-utilities were strictly plain vanilla -- unadorned work vehicles or fun-mobiles mainly for off-road use. 
On many models, the only options available were four-wheel-drive, power steering and air conditioning. 
Jeep, now owned by <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, long dominated the market, with a <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> share in <DATE>1977</DATE>. 

   Today, manufacturers are scrambling to fill a variety of niches. 
A year ago, Jeep discontinued its CJ, a basic model directly descended from the World War II jeep, and introduced the Wrangler. 
"On the CJ, even the top and the doors were optional," says <PERSON>Martin Levine</PERSON>, general marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s new Jeep/Eagle division. 
"On the Wrangler, things like leather interior, automatic transmission, stereo-cassette radio, rear-window defroster, not to mention the top and the doors, are all standard features." 
The company will introduce another upscale sport-utility entry, called the ZJ, probably within the next two years, he adds. 

   Nonetheless, Jeep envies the success of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> at the other end of the market. 
The Japanese company has sold a hefty 91,000 Samurais since introducing the vehicle in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <DATE>less than two years ago</DATE>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Levine</PERSON> says Jeep/Eagle is "studying the lower end of the market" for a possible new entry. 
So is <LOCATION>Yugo America</LOCATION>, which wants to challenge the Samurai with its own vehicle priced under <MONEY>$9,000</MONEY>. 

   Suzuki, meanwhile, plans to counterattack with an upscale model targeted at an older audience than Samurai buyers, says <PERSON>N. Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of the company's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit. 

   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet</ORGANIZATION> division -- which now leads the 10 sport-utility makers with <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of the market -- will soon introduce a sleeker version of the S10 Blazer, called the <LOCATION>Serengeti</LOCATION>, with all-leather interior and paint-trim wheels. 

   Will all these new models find enough buyers? 
The <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> increase expected in sport-utility sales this year is certainly healthy in a year when car sales are down. 
But the sort of double-digit annual sales gains that occurred between <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE> probably won't return, if only because the overall sales volume is now so large. 

   Some dealers and market analysts fear the boom may wane because current owners are starting to have families, and thus are looking for bigger vehicles. 
Both <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which makes the Bronco line, will address that problem by introducing four-door compacts by <DATE>1991</DATE>. 

   "Our sales (of <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s two-door 4Runner model) are down, and I think people wanting a four-door vehicle is part of it," says <PERSON>Robert Bowling</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Seeger Toyota</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Creve Coeur</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>. 
"A four-door is better for car pooling, better for kids, better for cargo." 
Toyota at this time has no plans for a four-door model, a spokesman says. 

   Manufacturers may hit on other new marketing strategies as well. 
Suzuki, for instance, may begin to stress the Samurai's commercial uses. 
"It's a growing incremental part of our business that we think is important," says <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON>. 
Suzuki recently gave a Samurai to the city of <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, home of the company's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> headquarters, "and now they've assigned it to their water company."

<HL> Different Data Lies Behind Samurai Dispute </HL>

<TEXT>
   Consumers might be forgiven for being confused. 
In <DATE>June</DATE>, Consumer Reports magazine said the Suzuki Samurai "is so likely to roll over . . . that it is unfit for its intended use." 
But just this month a federal safety agency refused to order a recall and said the Samurai is no more unsafe than any Jeep-like vehicle. 

   Were they talking about the same car? 
Yes -- but they were basing their judgments on different statistics and road tests. 

   "Under circumstances like these, you have to wonder where consumers can go to get unbiased information," says <PERSON>George Hoffer</PERSON>, professor of automotive economics at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Commonwealth University</ORGANIZATION>. 
"The weakness with the system is that people can design their tests to come up with whatever data they want." 

   That was certainly the case with <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Samurai. 
In its analysis of the <ORGANIZATION>Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s safety, the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> focused on fatality rates; those numbers showed fatalities from rollovers involving <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Bronco II occur three times as often as Samurai rollover deaths. 

   Based on those figures, <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> officials say they saw no reason to open an extensive safety investigation into the Samurai, despite the Consumer Reports article. 
"We looked at other statistics," says <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tim Hurd</PERSON>. 
"But the fatality rates seemed to overwhelmingly suggest there wasn't anything uniquely wrong with the Samurai." 

   But <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union of U.S. Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of Consumer Reports, chose to use different numbers when it condemned the vehicle, citing <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> crash-avoidance surveys taken in four states in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
The statistics showed Samurais rolling over in <PERCENT>64%</PERCENT> of all single-vehicle accidents (those where only a Samurai was involved). 
That compared with a <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> rate for the now-discontinued Jeep CJ-5, which has been a target of rollover charges for years. 

   "We thought our numbers . . . showed reason for some serious concern," says <PERSON>Robert Knoll</PERSON>, the chief of <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>'s auto-testing division. 

   The two sides were also at odds on the road tests. 
Consumers Union ran the Samurai through the same course it uses to test all vehicles. 
On a maneuver to suddenly avoid an object in the road, the Samurai began tipping over. 

   Suzuki and <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> argue that <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>'s tests aren't reliable. 
"We used tests that have been approved by engineers and in use by the auto industry for a long time," says <PERSON>Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm. 
"The tests used by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> were not instrumented, were not recorded and were not scientific." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Knoll</PERSON> disputes such contentions. 
"Our tests replicate what will happen to drivers in the real world," he says. 
"In one of theirs, they drive around and around in a circle at faster speeds. 
I have to wonder how often that happens on roadways?" 

   <PERSON>Mr. Knoll</PERSON> notes -- and <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Hurd</PERSON> confirms -- that <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> didn't do its own testing of the Samurai. 

   Although <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> declined to investigate the Samurai, it did agree to start developing tests to evaluate rollover risks for all vehicles. 
While the safety of sport-utility vehicles has been an issue for more than a decade, there's still no standard driving test to determine whether individual models are prone to roll over. 

   This isn't the first time <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> has gotten into a fight over safety statistics. 

   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>Diane Steed</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that deaths from automatic-shift <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> vehicles slipping from "park" to "reverse" were declining substantially after a settlement that made <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> install warning stickers in the cars. 
Using its own fatality data, <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> said deaths dropped by <PERCENT>300%</PERCENT> following the <DATE>1980</DATE> settlement. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> study <DATE>a year later</DATE>, though, said there had been a delay in reporting many deaths. 
As a result, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> study stated, deaths in <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> park-to-reverse cases had actually increased after the <DATE>1980</DATE> settlement. 

   At that point, <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> decided to switch to the number of reported park-to-reverse incidents instead of the fatality figures. 
The new data showed park-to-reverse accidents declining. 
That data wasn't generated independently; instead it was provided by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. 

   NHTSA at the time said they changed to different numbers because the total fatalities were not high enough to generate accurate statistics. 
<ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> won't comment further on the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> case. 

   But <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>'s critics see parallels with the Samurai. 
"With <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and with Suzuki," says <PERSON>Clarence Ditlow</PERSON>, director of the Washington-based Center for <ORGANIZATION>Auto Safety</ORGANIZATION>, "it was a matter of <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> having a pre-ordained position, and demonstrating its ability to develop numbers to support that position."

<TEXT>
   The maker of the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> took the
offense in a battle over the vehicle's safety, disputing the
validity of tests by Consumer Reports magazine that found the
Samurai dangerously prone to roll over.
   The tests by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, the magazine's publisher,
apparently were intended to persuade the government to adopt new
stability standards for sport-utility vehicles like the Samurai,
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``The Suzuki Samurai has been falsely accused, and it does not
have a design error,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. ``We have absolute confidence in
its safety record and road-worthiness in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   Calling the test results ``inaccurate and defamatory,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON>,
vice president of Brea-based <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the
company was considering a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>.
   Consumers Union stands by its tests, said <PERSON>David Berliner</PERSON>,
assistant director of the non-profit organization based in <LOCATION>Mount
Vernon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y</LOCATION>. He denied the tests were intended to influence federal
regulations.
   <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>last week</DATE> the Samurai rolled over in abrupt
maneuvers because it is too tall for its small wheelbase. Similar
vehicles passed the test. The group called for the immediate recall
of all 160,000 Samurais on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> roads and reimbursement of their
owners.
   But <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said government accident statistics, along with tests
conducted by an automotive engineering consultant for Suzuki, show
the four-wheel-drive vehicle is safe under typical driving
conditions, safer than some other vehicles of its type.
   At simultaneous news conferences in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> showed films of Samurais passing a number of what
were described as rigorous tests of the car's ability to stay
upright.
   ``For years the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> has been pressing the government
for an unrealistic rollover standard,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. ``What better
way than pressing the smallest Japanese automaker with the No. 1
selling sport-utility vehicle?''
   Publicity about the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> tests is expected to cut
Samurai sales, <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said, adding that the company has boosted its
advertising budget by <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> a week to counter consumer fears
raised by the tests. The <MONEY>$8,500</MONEY> vehicle is promoted as a fun car
for the youth market.
   Suzuki's auto engineering consultant, <PERSON>Jon McKibben</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>,
said it appeared the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> test driver deliberately
turned the Samurai more sharply than other sport-utility vehicles
in the obstacle-avoidance test. Sport-utility vehicles are
Jeep-like light trucks.
   McKibben acknowledged that he knew of the test only by watching
a videotape of it.
   Berliner of the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> responded: ``We never suggested
that the Samurai will turn over every time a driver swerves to
avoid an obstacle in the road. We said that its design creates
enough chance of that happening to the typical driver that it poses
an unacceptable risk.''
   The Samurais in the Consumers Union tests may have been made
unstable by 300-pound ``outriggers'' bolted to the cars to keep
them from rolling over completely, <PERSON>McKibben</PERSON> said.
   However, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> contends the outriggers actually should
make the vehicles more stable.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> said there
have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving
53 injuries and 16 deaths.
   Consumers Union filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> seeking rules
requiring that sport-utility vehicles be put through road tests for
safety, rather than just requiring them to meet design standards.
   Suzuki said its study of federal statistics on fatal accidents
found that in the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, there were three fatal accidents
in which a Samurai may have rolled over on a relatively flat
surface. In two of those cases, the drivers had been drinking and
none of the victims wore seat belts, <PERSON>McKibben</PERSON> said.

   American Suzuki, based in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, entered the agreement
without admitting any guilt or safety problems. The <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> is to
cover the states' costs in preparing the cases.
   The states began investigating the Samurai's safety <DATE>last June</DATE>
after Consumer Reports magazine gave the popular, four-wheel-drive
sport utility vehicle its first ``not acceptable'' rating in 10
years.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the <MONEY>$8,500</MONEY>
Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and its center of
gravity is too high to be safe. It was the first car of 349 tested
in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> to roll over during a routine accident-avoidance
test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid an obstacle in the
road, the group reported.
   ``This agreement strongly affirms that the Samurai is a safe
vehicle and strongly supports the federal government decision that
there is no reason to investigate the safety of the Samurai,'' <PERSON>N.
Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, said in a statement.
   Consumers Union, of <LOCATION>Mount Vernon</LOCATION>, had asked the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> to recall the more than 150,000
Japanese-built Samurais sold in this country since its introduction
in <DATE>November 1985</DATE>.
   The agency denied the recall petition in <DATE>September</DATE>, saying the
Samurai had a rollover rate ``within the range of most other light
utility vehicles.'' It also said most rollovers were influenced by
``drinking, low ambient light and lack or driver familiarity (with)
either the vehicle or the road.''
   New York Attorney general <PERSON>Robert Abrams</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the
states took action because ``the federal government has, once again,
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.''
   Samurai print ads now must include the following statement:
``This vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars.
Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers which
can cause vehicles of this type to roll over. Always wear your
seatbelt. For specific details, please read your owner's manual.''
   A shorter version of the statement is required for television and
radio ads, <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> said his investigation indicated previous <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> ads
``deceived the public by promoting the Samurai as a safe, fun
passenger vehicle while knowing it...can present considerable
dangers to young, inexperienced, first-time purchasers who were
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s target buyers.''
   Suzuki contended its advertising did not violate state laws but
decided to agree to a settlement to avoid possible legal action by
the states.
   ``For <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and Samurai owners, this agreement with the
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false
allegations about the Samurai,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION>, a popular sport utility
vehicle, tends to roll over in sudden turns and should be banned,
the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``That car literally trips over its own feet, and I wouldn't
want to be in it,'' said <PERSON>R. David Pittle</PERSON>, technical director of the
non-profit <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the monthly magazine.
   In an article scheduled to appear in its <DATE>July</DATE> issue, Consumer
Reports labels the Japanese-made Samurai ``not acceptable'' _ the
first time it has given such a rating to a car in 10 years.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, defended its
vehicle.
   ``The Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety, including
stability and handling, prior to its introduction into the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of
<ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and
stable vehicle,'' he said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Consumers Union filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> asking that the agency change its
regulations to ban the Samurai, which the petition called ``wholly
unsuitable for consumer use.''
   A similar petition alleging the Samurai's rollover problem was
filed in <DATE>February</DATE> by the Center for <ORGANIZATION>Auto Safety</ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit,
Washington-based consumer group. The government has yet to act on
that petition.
   Both petitions demand that a stability standard for vehicles
that would let the government ban any car that has an undue
propensity to roll over.
   <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said the Samurai is the first car out of 349
tested in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> to roll over during a routine
accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid
an obstacle in the road.
   At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> officials showed a
videotape in which the Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to
roll over when it suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph.
   The car did not roll onto its side because it had been equipped
with arm-like extensions to avoid a rollover. <PERSON>Pittle</PERSON> said the
extensions actually improved the car's stability by lowering its
center of gravity.
   The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
Cherokee and the <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Trooper</ORGANIZATION>, were shown making the same maneuver
without losing stability at speeds over 40 mph.
   ``We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the
Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. ``But
the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads
everyday.''
   Between <DATE>November 1985</DATE>, when the Samurai was introduced, and the
end of <DATE>April 1988</DATE> there have been 154,675 Samurais sold in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The cars have a suggested retail price of about
<MONEY>$8,500</MONEY>.
   According to the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION>,
there have been 44 reported Samurai rollovers involving 53 injuries
and 16 deaths.
   <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Ron DeFore</PERSON> said he could not comment on whether
the <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> has a higher rollover rate than its competitors, but
said utility vehicles generally have a fatality rate three times
that of light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that
rollovers account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility
vehicles.
   <PERSON>DeFore</PERSON> said drivers of utility vehicles such as the Samurai tend
to be younger and more adventurous than the average driver of a
passenger car, and therefore are more prone to accidents.
   In its statement, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> said that in all of the accidental
deaths involving the car, police found that serious driver errors
led to the accidents.
   The company also said it believes the attacks on the Samurai may
have been triggered in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster
public opinion against <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and perhaps the entire sport vehicle
industry.
   Suzuki also said it believes it has been targeted because the
Samurai is the leading imported sport utility vehicle from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>
and has gained tremendous media attention because of its uniqueness
and affordability.
   The company said it would continue trying to determine the
original source of allegations against the vehicle and why the
company is being singled out. It will then consider legal action,
it said.
   The most famous vehicle rollovers involved the Jeep CJ5 and CJ7,
which the Wrangler superseded in <DATE>1986</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which bought
<ORGANIZATION>American Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>, inherited liability for lawsuits
seeking nearly <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY> in damages caused by Jeep rollovers.

   Struggling <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> is trying to rebound by introducing two new vehicles this <DATE>fall</DATE>, including a new Jeep-like model aimed at keeping the young buyers the company is in danger of losing. 

   The new Suzuki Swift subcompact car and <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Sidekick</ORGANIZATION> sport utility vehicle will leave the Japanese manufacturer far less dependent on the four-wheel-drive Samurai model. 
That sport utility vehicle has been <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s sole model since entering the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and its sales plunged in <DATE>June</DATE> following charges that the Samurai is unsafe and tends to roll over in sharp turns. 

   Suzuki's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales and marketing arm will continue to sell the Samurai in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1989</DATE> model year. 
But company officials say Samurai supplies will be far lower, with just 2,000 Samurais a month coming from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> at least through <DATE>April</DATE>. 
Suzuki used to sell 6,000 to 7,000 Samurais a month last year, and sold a record 12,208 in <DATE>August</DATE>. 
That was after <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> instituted deep discounts and aggressive advertising to counter critics and bring buyers back to showrooms. 
Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> refused to order a recall of the Samurai, saying it is no more unsafe than any Jeep-like vehicle. 

   But now the company's marketing attention is shifting completely away from the Samurai in favor of the two new vehicles. 
Suzuki officials say they will spend <MONEY>$11 million</MONEY> in advertising by year end to launch the Swift and the Sidekick. 
By <DATE>April</DATE>, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> expects to ship 20,000 of the cars and 30,000 of the sport-utility vehicles to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   Versions of both vehicles will be imported by <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for its new Geo line. 
But <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> limited <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s version of the Swift to a three-cylinder engine while giving its own models a more-powerful four-cylinder engine. 
Also, availability of <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s version of the <ORGANIZATION>Sidekick</ORGANIZATION> will be limited to a few states. 

   The looks of the Sidekick and Samurai are similar, although Suzuki increased the wheelbase of the Sidekick by nearly seven inches -- a move that's expected to add stability. 
The pricing of the two vehicles also will be close. 
The Sidekick's base price is <MONEY>$8,995</MONEY>, compared with the Samurai's <MONEY>$8,495</MONEY> base price. 

   Suzuki officials insist the two will attract different buyers. 
"There are still people out there that want a Samurai and not a Sidekick," said <PERSON>Jim Weber</PERSON>, communications director for <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "I've got to think a lot of that is utilitarian, or for uniqueness."

   A consumer group's accusation that the sporty
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> is prone to roll over was denounced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the
Japanese automaker as ``inaccurate and defamatory.''
   Test results announced last week by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> publisher of Consumer Reports Magazine, unfairly suggest the
popular four-wheel drive vehicle is unsafe under normal driving
conditions, said <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of
<ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If the magazine had acted responsibly and reviewed the
available information it would have been aware that the Samurai has
one of the best records on file,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said.
   Last week the influential consumer organization condemned the
Samurai as being so prone to roll over that it cannot be modified
to be safe. <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> recommended a omplete recall of the
120,000 or more Samurais sold in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and a complete refund to
owners.
   Responding to the accusations made by Suzuki in news conferences
in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
<PERSON>David Berliner</PERSON> defended the organization's tests as valid. He said
similar vehicles made by competitors passed the same tests that
caused the Samurai to tip over.
   Government accident statistics and tests conducted by an
independent automotive safety consultant showed the Samurai was as
safe or safer than other sport-utility vehicles, <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. That
industry term refers to four-wheel drive cars and light pick-up
trucks.
   Samurai is considering legal action against <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. He suggested the consumer group made its accusations as
part of a calculated campaign to persuade the government to adopt
stricter rollover standards.
   ``For years the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> has been pressing the government
for an unrealistic rollover standard,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. ``What better
way than pressing the smallest Japanese automaker with the No. 1
selling sport-utility vehicle?''

<HEAD>Samurai Sales Hit Record In August Despite Rollover Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boosted by rebates that could cut the sticker
price by almost <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales of the Suzuki Samurai set a
record in <DATE>August</DATE> despite concerns about the four-wheel-drive
vehicle's safety.
   Official sales figures will not be reported until <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but
<PERSON>Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s automotive division,
said <DATE>Friday</DATE> he hoped the total would exceed 10,000 for the month.
   The surprising turnaround appears to be the result of the
generous dealer incentive program by the Japanese carmaker and
fading public concern about the rollover issue raised by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers
Union</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.
   ``It will clearly be a record for our company, which is
impressive for 80 to 90 days from when our accuser first came at
us,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said.
   Sales plummeted <PERCENT>70.6 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>June</DATE> to 2,199 after the <DATE>June 2</DATE>
report by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>. The group said the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s
center of gravity was too high, making it too likely to tip over
when the driver swerved sharply.
   American Suzuki produced its own tests and statistical evidence
to back its claim the Samurai was safe, and on <DATE>July 13</DATE> announced
<MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> incentives to dealers that made it possible for them to cut
a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION>Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$7,995</MONEY> base price.
   Samurai sales rose to 6,327 in <DATE>July</DATE>, about average.
   Sales from <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE>, which is the end of the latest
reporting period, will smash the record of 8,365 set in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Laura Segall</PERSON>, of the public relations firm <ORGANIZATION>Rogers &amp;
Associates</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s public relations agency.
   The dealer incentive program ended <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and the company and
its competitors will be watching closely to see whether the sales
momentum continues.
   Suzuki had been counting on a rebound in Samurai sales to create
a good atmosphere for the introduction this <DATE>fall</DATE> of two new
vehicles: a bigger, more powerful, more expensive sport-utility
vehicle named the Sidekick, and a passenger car named the Swift.
   The Sidekick is scheduled to be introduced this month. The Swift
will be introduced in <DATE>October</DATE> in a two-door hatchback version and
in <DATE>November</DATE> in a four-door hatchback model.
   The Samurai received a boost <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> turned down petitions to investigate
and recall the vehicle. The agency said the Samurai is no more
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies.
   The agency did grant a <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> request to start a
rule-making procedure to establish a minimum standard for vehicles
to protect against rollovers.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> agency said it had found 113
reported rollovers involving the Samurai and related vehicles made
by <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>, which resulted in 25 deaths and 120 injuries. But the
agency attributed many of the rollovers to unsafe driving, drinking
and unfamiliarity with the vehicles.
   American Suzuki, based in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, is the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arm of
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.

   Mini-Sport Vehicle Project
   Is No Longer Attractive,
   U.S., French Firms Say

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. and Renault S.A.
said they agreed to terminate their joint venture to produce
a new mini-sport utility vehicle because the venture "is no
longer economically attractive."
   The U.S. and French auto makers didn't provide much detail
about why they are scrapping the venture, but persons
familiar with the deal say it was plagued with problems and
unanswered questions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of the biggest problems was just how well the little
Jeeps, codenamed "JJ," would sell. When the venture was
established in <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales might reach
100,000 a year. "Clearly, the way that market is performing,
there is no way it could support that many units," said
<PERSON>Christopher Cedergren</PERSON>, director of competitive assessments at
<ORGANIZATION>J.D. Power &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> market research firm.
   This is partly because of increasing competition from
products such as <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Geo
Tracker</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Daihatsu Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Rocky, and <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s
Samurai and <ORGANIZATION>Sidekick</ORGANIZATION>.
   In addition, consumers seem to prefer larger sport utility
models including <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s Jeep Cherokee and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor
Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Explorer. As a result, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> isn't the only <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
auto maker to rethink plans for little sport utility
vehicles. <PERSON>Mr. Cedergren</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> scrapped about a year ago a
mini-Jeep-like vehicle codenamed "UW52."
   It isn't clear whether <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> will abandon JJ
completely. In a statement, the No. 3 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker said it
"intends to continue" with the project and is "reviewing
various implementation alternatives." But a spokesman said <PERSON>JJ</PERSON>
is "still iffy. . . . We aren't going to build any vehicle we
can't make money on."
   One <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> executive said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto maker had
recently taken a "fresh business look" at the venture in the
wake of the mid-May resignation of international operations
vice president <PERSON>Michael N. Hammes</PERSON> to take a top job at <ORGANIZATION>Black &amp;
Decker Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Chrysler officials were said to be concerned about several
issues. One involved <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s ceding four key markets to
<ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION>, including <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>
wanted to build the four-door version first; <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> favored
the two-door.
   The manufacturers budgeted <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> for the venture
but neither would say how much they've actually spent. The
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> will reimburse <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION> for
expenses incurred during the feasibility study but he
wouldn't be more specific.
   The initial agreement called for JJ to be built in <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and sold world-wide, with European
deliveries estimated at 50,000 a year. European production
was to begin in <DATE>July 1992</DATE>, with North American output
following about <DATE>six months later</DATE>.
   In <DATE>February</DATE>, the companies said they had chosen a <ORGANIZATION>Renault</ORGANIZATION>
factory in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, as the European source.
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> hadn't confirmed the <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> location, but
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, Jeep plant was expected to get the
job.
   A <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> union spokesman said union members
at the plant ratified a tentative contract <DATE>Monday</DATE> that would
keep the plant open until <DATE>1997</DATE>. The contract includes a
commitment from <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> that if JJ is built in <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION>, it will be built in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>. But the tentative
contract is contingent on "a lot of ifs," the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
said.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> is so unstable it ``literally
trips over its own feet'' and rolls over, says the publisher of
Consumer Reports, which gave the popular sport vehicle its first
``not acceptable'' rating in 10 years.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> defended the Japanese-built
Samurai as safe and said there was no justification for the
magazine publisher's claim that it should be banned because it
tends to turn over in sudden turns.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
the Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and has too high a
center of gravity to be safe. It asked federal regulators to recall
the more than 150,000 Samurais sold in this country and provide
refunds to owners.
   Consumers Union called the four-wheel-drive sport utility
vehicle ``wholly unsuitable for consumer use'' in a petition filed
with the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``That car literally trips over its own feet, and I wouldn't
want to be in it,'' said <PERSON>R. David Pittle</PERSON>, technical director of
<ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, at a news conference. ``They're promoted as safe,
fun vehicles, when the fact of the matter is, they're not.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said the <MONEY>$8,500</MONEY> Samurai was the first car out of
349 tested in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> to roll over during a routine
accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid
an obstacle in the road.
   Consumers Union officials showed a videotape in which the
Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to roll over when it
suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph. Arm-like extensions
installed to protect the test drivers prevented the car from
rolling onto its side.
   The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
Cherokee and the <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Trooper</ORGANIZATION>, were shown making the same maneuver
without losing stability at speeds higher than 40 mph.
   It was 10 years ago that Consumer Reports labeled the <ORGANIZATION>Dodge
Omni-Plymouth Horizon</ORGANIZATION> models ``not acceptable,'' saying they had a
dangerous steering problem. The problem was corrected the next
model year, the magazine said.
   ``We were thinking of turning it over to our older son. Now we
won't do that,'' said <PERSON>Edward Taylor</PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION>Cleveland Heights</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, who owns a convertible Samurai.
   ``You're driving down the road at 65 mph and a cat or dog jumps
out in front of you, you have to find out how good a driver you
are. It's something I'm not looking forward to,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION>American
Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>, said, ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling a
safe and stable vehicle.''
   The company said the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> in <DATE>November 1985</DATE>. Suzuki sold 154,675 of them through <DATE>April</DATE>.
   ``We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the
Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' <PERSON>Mazza</PERSON> said. ``But
the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads
every day.''
   The petition from <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> asked that the government
require similar vehicles to pass driving tests rather than just
meet design standards.
   The Center for Auto Safety filed a similar petition in <DATE>February</DATE>,
citing the Samurai's rollover problem. The center said the Samurai
had been involved in at least 32 rollover accidents, resulting in
eight deaths and 35 injuries.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> said there
have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving
53 injuries and 16 deaths. A spokesman for the agency, <PERSON>Ron DeFore</PERSON>,
would not comment on the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> petition. The agency has
120 days to respond.
   The company says police found serious driver error in all of the
fatal accidents.
   <PERSON>DeFore</PERSON> said he could not comment on whether the <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> has a
higher rollover rate than its competitors. He said utility vehicles
in general have a fatality rate that is three times that of
light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that rollovers
account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility vehicles.
   <PERSON>DeFore</PERSON> said drivers of utility vehicles tend to be younger and
more adventurous than the average driver, and are more prone to
accidents.
   Details of the tests are in a report to be published in the <DATE>July</DATE>
issue of Consumer Reports.

"We find now we have reached a point where a price increase is unavoidable." 

   Despite the increase, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> said it still had the lowest-price offering in the increasingly competitive sport-utility vehicle market. 

   Several other Japanese auto makers -- including <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- have announced price increases this year because the of sharp rise in the yen's value.

<HL> Japanese Sport Utility Vehicles Remain In Truck Category, Bypassing Car Quota </HL>

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> will continue to allow Japanese-made sport utility vehicles without back seats and passenger "amenities" to enter this country as trucks. 

   The decision resolves, for the time being, a controversy that began last <DATE>fall</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> customs officials proposed reclassifying as cars the popular Jeep-like models, which include <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Montero</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Trooper</ORGANIZATION>. 
This would have restricted their importation because a Japanese government quota limits <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car shipments to about 2.3 million a year. 

   The move represents at least a temporary setback for Rep. <PERSON>John D. Dingell</PERSON> (D. 
<LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION>, who initiated the debate. 
Concerned because manufacturers and dealers often installed back seats and other passenger-related equipment after the vehicles cleared customs as trucks, <PERSON>Mr. Dingell</PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> to determine whether the Japanese companies were intentionally circumventing the quota. 
Truck shipments aren't restricted, but face a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> U.S. duty compared with the <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT> duty on cars. 

   Customs Commissioner <PERSON>William von Raab</PERSON> acknowledged that the decision "seems illogical . . . when people see how these vehicles are being used." 
Their versatility and the availability of such carlike features as stereo radio, air conditioning, plush seats and carpeting boosted sales to nearly 200,000 last year. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. von Raab</PERSON> said in a statement that current law "provides very little room for discretion. . . . 
Customs must classify vehicles in their condition as imported." 

   He said in order to "clear up the confusion over classification criteria, the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> will be asking for public comment in the near future" on how to "simplify" the classification process. 
Possible solutions could include a new category for sport utility vehicles, or changes in the existing criteria to emphasize the way the vehicles are used rather than their condition as imported. 
Such changes could take months as the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> collects and considers the comments. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Dingell</PERSON>'s response was sharp and immediate. 
"We don't like illogical decisions any more than Commissioner von Raab . . . but the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> announcement makes it look like they are bowing to the Japanese firms who are trying to circumvent the Voluntary Restraint Agreement's requirements." 

   Not surprisingly, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arms of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Motors Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> disagreed. 
All had asked the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> district office's proposal to reclassify the vehicles. 

   "We're very happy with the way this came out," said <PERSON>Munford Page Hall II</PERSON>, an attorney with <ORGANIZATION>Dorsey &amp; Whitney</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, representing <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki of America Automotive Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
"It's what we expected," added <PERSON>Richard D. Recchia</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
"We know we did not incorporate any substantial changes into the (current) vehicles" that would have made them different from the models customs officials originally agreed were trucks. 

   As for the prospect that the classification might change in the future, the companies all said they will have to wait and see what the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> decides. 
In the meantime, "our position is that we're just going to continue as is," said <PERSON>E.F. Kern</PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION>American Isuzu Motors Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

<HL> Suzuki Samurai's Sales Have Plunged Since Consumers Union Called It Unsafe </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bradley A. Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> AUT </IN>
<TEXT>
   Sales of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Samurai plunged <PERCENT>70.5%</PERCENT> in <DATE>June</DATE>, following charges by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> that the four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle is unsafe. 

   The whopping monthly sales decline was the worst that <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> has posted since it first introduced the Samurai to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <DATE>November 1985</DATE>. 
The poor sales also left many Suzuki dealers uncertain about the vehicle's future, even though several said sales improved somewhat in recent days. 

   Suzuki, which sells only the Samurai in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, reported <DATE>June</DATE> sales dropped to 2,199 vehicles from the 7,479 it sold a year earlier. 
Suzuki sold 6,074 Samurai vehicles in <DATE>May</DATE>, before <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> published in its Consumer Reports magazine an article saying the Samurai has a "dangerous propensity" to roll over when its driver attempts to make a sharp turn. 

   Suzuki's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials offered little comment yesterday on the steep sales decline, in an apparent attempt to play down the bad news. 
In a news release, the company said it "was not surprised by the drop in sales . . . because of the widespread negative publicity on the Samurai." 

   Suzuki dealers said they hope the company moves quickly to attract buyers back into showrooms. 
"This whole situation is frustrating because I have no control over it," said <PERSON>Tom Lilly</PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON>George Ballas Suzuki</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. 
"Whatever Suzuki comes out with couldn't hurt at this point." 

   Some dealers may take matters into their own hands. 
<PERSON>Mr. Lilly</PERSON>'s dealership, for example, is weighing giving Samurai buyers free life-insurance policies. 
Others are flooding their local television broadcasts with press releases and advertising that stresses the quality and safety of the vehicles. 

   Dealers also are trying to talk upbeat. 
Although <PERSON>Dick Smith Suzuki</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, sold only 17 Samurais in <DATE>June</DATE>, general manager <PERSON>Phil Smith</PERSON> expects to sell about 30 in <DATE>July</DATE> and 40 in <DATE>August</DATE>. 
"As time progresses, the furor tends to get out of people's minds," <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON> said. 
"People may be more inquisitive now, but at least they're coming in the doors again." 

   Since the appearance of the Consumer Reports article, Suzuki officials have hinted that the company may sue its critics. 
But company officials and dealers said they needed to wait and assess the damage to sales. 

   Such damage was evident yesterday, but a Suzuki spokesman said the company still hasn't made any decision about legal action or any other moves, such as increased advertising or buyer incentives. 
Suzuki did increase its advertising immediately after Consumer Reports published its article in its <DATE>July</DATE> issue and changed its theme to safety from fun. 
Attorneys general from several states have begun investigations to determine whether that advertising is deceptive.

<PERSON>Ms. Nicholas</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should reinstate the president's power
to impound appropriated money as a way of bringing the federal
budget deficit under control, former President <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``The budget process is in total shambles,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said in a
speech at the <ORGANIZATION>National Press Club</ORGANIZATION>.
   The power of impoundment was ended in <DATE>1974</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> moved
to streamline the budget process.
   Using impoundment, a president could sign an appropriations bill
yet refuse to spend part of the money in what <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> called ``an
important tool of fiscal responsibility.''
   ``The anti-impoundment provisions in my opinion have been a
disaster,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said. The present system is ``no substitute for
strong action by the president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' he said.
   ``If we are irresponsible, if we blow it, there is no doubt in my
mind that we are gambling with the health and security of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>,'' he said.
   Allowing presidents to impound money would be a quick solution to
the present budget difficulties, since reinstating the process would
require only legislation rather than a constitutional amendment,
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Ford on <DATE>Monday</DATE> unveiled his portrait at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian
Institution</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of the Presidents, the first presidential
portrait painted explicitly for the collection.
   The portrait shows <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> dressed in a dark, pin-striped suit,
standing in a half-length pose, his right hand on his hip. It was
painted by <PERSON>Everett Raymond Kinstler</PERSON>.
   It will be on permanent exhibit in the <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of the Presidents,
which shows likenesses of every president from <LOCATION>George Washington</LOCATION> to
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>.
   Ford was the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Republican leader when he was appointed vice
president in <DATE>1973</DATE> after <PERSON>Spiro Agnew</PERSON> resigned from the office.
   Ford became president the next year with the resignation of
<PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, thus becoming the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president that had never
won a national election.
   The portrait was painted after <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> left office in <DATE>1980</DATE>. It was a
gift of the <ORGANIZATION>Gerald R. Ford Foundation of Grand Rapids</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, which
operates a museum and library dedicated to <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s term in office.
   Kinstler painted the official <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> portraits of both <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>

<HL> Who's News: Micron Technology Financial Chief And President Quit </HL>

<CO> DRAM WNEWS </CO>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Micron Technology Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Juan Benitez</PERSON>, president, chief operating officer and a director, and <PERSON>Leslie Gill</PERSON>, chief financial officer, resigned for personal reasons. 

   But though both executives of the <LOCATION>Boise</LOCATION>, Idaho-based microchip maker insisted it's just time to move on, their departures raised several questions among observers of the closely watched company, questions <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> officials refused to answer yesterday. 

   For example, it remains unclear why the two officers quit simultaneously. 
<PERSON>Ms. Gill</PERSON> called it a "coincidence." 
It also remains a mystery why the pair decided to resign just when <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> has returned to healthy profitability after two years of heavy losses. 
And nobody could say what the two executives will do next, including <PERSON>Mr. Benitez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ms. Gill</PERSON>, who said they don't have new jobs but don't plan to retire. 

   "I prefer not to make any further comments at this particular time because I want the focus to be on the transition" to <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION>'s next president, said <PERSON>Mr. Benitez</PERSON>, 39 years old, who declined to answer questions about his departure. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Randal Chance</PERSON>, 37, executive vice president and a director, to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Benitez</PERSON> as president and chief operating officer. 
The company named <PERSON>Reid Langrill</PERSON>, 28, to <PERSON>Ms. Gill</PERSON>'s posts as chief financial officer, treasurer and vice president, finance. 
<PERSON>Mr. Langrill</PERSON> had been controller. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>James Garrett</PERSON> to succeed <PERSON>Mr. Chance</PERSON> as executive vice president. 
<PERSON>Mr. Garrett</PERSON> had been vice president, sales and marketing. 

   When asked if <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> had requested her resignation, <PERSON>Ms. Gill</PERSON>, 33, responded: "This may sound arrogant, but <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> has been called a lot of things and one of them isn't dumb." 

   Both resigning officers joined <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> at its infancy in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and rose to senior positions within a year. 
They resigned their posts effective yesterday, but will remain with the company through the fall to assist their successors. 

   The timing of the two executives' departures surprised some observers, given <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION>'s robust turnaround of late. 
The company, which specializes in commodity memory chips, has been a major beneficiary of the U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade agreement signed in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
That agreement, meant to stop alleged dumping of Japanese chips, imposed floor prices on certain Japanese memory chips sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> market. 

   In <DATE>fiscal 1988</DATE>'s first nine months, ended <DATE>June 2</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Micron</ORGANIZATION> had net income of <MONEY>$54.7 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.88</MONEY> a share, compared with a loss of <MONEY>$24.4 million</MONEY> a year earlier. 
Revenue tripled to <MONEY>$187 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$61.7 million</MONEY>.

<HEAD>Carmaker Settles Dispute With 7 States, Will Have Safety Messages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> it has
agreed to put safety warnings in advertising for its
four-wheel-drive Samurai to settle a dispute with the attorneys
general of seven states.
   The company said the messages _ which warn against abrupt
maneuvers in the so-called ``sport utility vehicles'' _ are to be
included in all ads and promotional material.
   The dispute with the top law enforcement officials of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
stems from a controversy that erupted in <DATE>June</DATE> over a consumer
group's allegation the sporty cars were likely to roll over.
   The attorneys general had accused the company of violating laws
against false and deceptive advertising.
   Suzuki has heatedly disputed the allegations by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>,
the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, and the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>September</DATE> denied a petition to
order a safety recall.
   The agreement requires the Japanese carmaker to include in its
ads the following statement: ``This vehicle handles differently from
ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns
and abrupt maneuvers. Always wear your seat belt. For specific
details, please read your owner's manual.''
   The company also agreed to reimburse the states <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> for
legal costs.
   American Suzuki, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arm of the Japanese automaker, noted
the company hadn't acknowledged any safety problems with the cars.
   ``For <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and Samurai owners, this agreement with the
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false
allegations about the Samurai,'' <PERSON>N. Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, the company's
vice president and general manager, said in a news release from
<ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> offices.
   Consumers Union tests found that because of its short wheelbase
and high center of gravity, the Samurai is dangerously prone to roll
over under what the consumer group maintained are normal driving
conditions.
   Suzuki officials have said the car, classified for import as a
``sport utility vehicle,'' handles no differently than other
four-wheel-drive cars made in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and elsewhere.

<HL> Suzuki Revives Samurai Safety Ads As Consumer Magazine Urges Recall </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bradley A. Stertz and Melinda Grenier Guiles (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> AUT MKT </IN>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> has resurrected stark advertisements emphasizing the safety of its Samurai sport utility vehicle in the wake of criticism from Consumer Reports magazine that the Samurai is unsafe. 

   Suzuki hopes the ads, which started running on television <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, will quell consumer concerns about the Samurai. 
However, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> dealers said it is too soon for them to judge the effect on consumers of the magazine's criticism, disclosed in a <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> news conference. 

   <DATE>Saturday</DATE> customer traffic at <ORGANIZATION>Earnhardt Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, for example, was off about <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> from normal, said <PERSON>Dave Steinbrook</PERSON>, sales manager. 
He said some of that could be due to other factors, but there wasn't any question that the Consumer Reports criticism "took its toll . . . 
Today, I can do business one-handed and I usually need four arms." 

   Suzuki of <ORGANIZATION>America Automotive Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Suzuki</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm, first developed its somber ads in <DATE>March</DATE> after the Center for Auto Safety in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, claimed that the vehicle's high center of gravity makes it prone to rolling over. 
But <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> dropped the ads, which featured laudatory quotes from car-enthusiast magazines, about a month ago in favor of the light, fun approach of its original ad campaign. 

   The fun disappeared a few hours after Consumer Reports said its driving tests showed the Samurai has a "hazardous propensity" to roll over in emergency driving situations. 
<ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union of U.S. Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the magazine, said it supports a recall of the 150,000 Samurai models currently on the road and also called on Suzuki to buy them back from owners. 

   The magazine's news conference caught Suzuki by surprise. 
<PERSON>Ron Rogers</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the company learned about the event only 12 hours in advance. 
Suzuki dashed off a mailgram warning dealers about the expected negative publicity and telling them "that we stand behind this vehicle <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT>," <PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON> said. 

   Suzuki officials reiterated an earlier promise to aggressively refute critics, and possibly sue them. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Rogers</PERSON> declined to say specifically if legal action is likely against Consumer Reports. 
"We think the Consumer Reports study was unfair and inconsistent," he said. 
"We are going to take a very aggressive stance on this through any means available to us." 

   Defending Samurai's reputation is crucial to Suzuki because Samurai and <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> motorcycles are the mainstays of the Japanese company's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business. 
Samurai sales through late May were down about <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> from last year's levels, partly because of concerns about the possible rollover problem. 

   Dealers say they're worried that the latest round of criticism will damp sales further, but they add that it's too soon to tell by how much. 
"We had five people scheduled to pick up the vehicles they had purchased" last week, said <PERSON>Tom Lilly</PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON>George Ballas Suzuki</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. 
"All picked their vehicles up; no one said anything about the report." 

   But dealers say some prospective customers clearly are worried about the safety issue. 
Some past customers also are concerned. 
<PERSON>Dick Brahs</PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON>Stillman Suzuki</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Englewood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said he had received "quite a few calls" from owners on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, wondering whether <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> will recall the Samurai or buy the vehicles back. 
"There's just some long-term concern there."

SUZUKI DECIDES TO PUT ITS AD ACCOUNT UP FOR GRABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Suzuki has hit the road for a new advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto maker, which has still not recovered from year-old safety 
concerns over its Samurai sport utility vehicles, said on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that it was 
placing its estimated <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> advertising business up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki sales have nose-dived since <DATE>last June</DATE> when Consumer Reports harshly 
condemned the Samurai as being prone to roll-overs and asked for a recall of 
all Samurai vehicles. The federal government later found that the Samurai was 
no worse than the average utility vehicle in its class. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of recalling its vehicles, however, the Japanese importer is recalling 
its <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> ad agency, Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. The agency has created <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> 
ads -- such as billboards with the headline, "A Cure for the Car Sick" -- since 
Brea-based <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> began importing the vehicles into the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>four years ago</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"When Suzuki first entered the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>, it looked for an ad firm without automotive 
experience so they could bring a fresh perspective," said <PERSON>Laura Segal</PERSON>, a 
spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>. "But Suzuki is changing and expanding its product line, 
and that may require something different." 
</P>
<P>
Although Keye/Donna was asked to participate in the review, the agency has not 
responded to that request. "We want to take a few days to think about it," said 
<PERSON>Leonard Pearlstein</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Keye/Donna/Pearlstein</ORGANIZATION>. "I can tell you, we 
were surprised by their decision." 
</P>
<P>
It is not all that unusual, however, for troubled businesses to blame their ad 
agencies for their problems. And <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> has plenty of them. Sales of its 
Samurai dropped nearly <PERCENT>89%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>first quarter of 1989</DATE>, compared to the <DATE>first 
quarter 1988</DATE>. That's 1,914 Samurais sold during the period this year, compared 
to 16,783 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several ad industry executives said they now expect that beleaguered <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> 
will name a new agency by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzuki's problems are much larger than their ad agency," said <PERSON>Peter Stranger</PERSON>, 
president of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Della Femina</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>McNamee WCRS</ORGANIZATION>, which 
creates the "Joe Isuzu" ads for <ORGANIZATION>American Isuzu Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "To punish the ad 
agency for this is ludicrous."

<HL> U.S. Turns Down Petitions to Investigate And Order Recall of Suzuki's Samurai </HL>

   The <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> turned down petitions to investigate and recall the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION>, contending that the four-wheel-drive sports vehicle isn't any more dangerous than similar vehicles made by other manufacturers. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> vehicle has been mired in controversy since Consumer Reports magazine this <DATE>spring</DATE> called the vehicle unsafe and urged it be recalled. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> agency said it had found 113 reported rollovers involving the Samurai and related vehicles made by <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>, which involved 25 deaths and 120 injuries. 
But the agency attributed many of rollovers to risky driving habits, drinking and unfamiliarity with the vehicles. 

   Suzuki officials said the <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> ruling was a major victory and should "put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the vehicle." 

   A statement prepared by the company's outside public relations firm said "the company is particularly pleased that the unfounded and inaccurate accusations about the Samurai made by so-called consumer groups did not color <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>'s judgment on this matter." 

   The agency said the Samurai was involved in about six rollovers per 100,000 cars in which the rollovers weren't caused by crashes. 
That was about one-third the rollover rate of the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>. Bronco II, the agency said. 
The Samurai also had the same rollover rate as <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Chevy S10 Blazer</ORGANIZATION>, the agency reported. 
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jeep Cherokee</ORGANIZATION> had a rollover rate about half that of the Samurai, according to the agency. 

   The Center for <ORGANIZATION>Auto Safety</ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based consumer group, filed one of the petitions to recall the Samurai. 
A spokeswoman for the group said it would appeal the agency's ruling. 

   The agency did grant a petition by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Consumer Reports, requesting that the agency start a rule-making procedure to establish a "minimum standard" to protect against rollover. 
In a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, the agency cited a number of research projects it already has started concerning the rollover problem. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman applauded the action on the rule-making petition but criticized the agency for not launching an investigation into whether the Samurai was defective. 
She said the group still considered the vehicle "dangerous when doing maneuvers that any driver could be called upon to perform." 
For instance, she said tests by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> showed the Samurai could roll when a driver going less than 40 miles per hour swerved to avoid a child running into the street. 

   In a short report explaining why it turned down the recall request, the agency criticized rollover tests conducted by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> on the Samurai, contending they "do not have a scientific basis and cannot be linked to real-world crash avoidance needs." 
The <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman defended the group's tests, saying they were meant to replicate typical driving situations. 

   The agency, however, approvingly cited <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s tests of the Samurai, saying they demonstrated that the vehicle "satisfactorily completed industry accepted tests which might be used to assess a vehicle's rollover propensity." 
The agency concluded that because crash data didn't show that the Samurai has been involved in more frequent rollovers than comparable vehicles, it wouldn't investigate whether the vehicle was defective or should be recalled. 

   Suzuki sales dropped greatly immediately after the negative reports on the Samurai's safety. 
But sales quickly rebounded when <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> gave dealers <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> incentives on each Samurai sale. 
If the dealers passed along all of the incentive to consumers, the move cut a whopping <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> off the vehicle's base price. 

   Apparently the tactic worked. 
Suzuki vice president and general manager <PERSON>Doug Mazza</PERSON> said Samurai sales in <DATE>August</DATE> will exceed 9,000 vehicles, topping the monthly record of 8,365 set in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>. 

   "I don't know what more we can do," <PERSON>Mr. Mazza</PERSON> said. 
"We've gone to the government and they've decided against pursuing an investigation, we've gone to our buyers and they've come back. 
We'd like to get back to business."

<HL> Suzuki Urged to Recall Samurai Vehicles As Consumer Group Calls Them Unsafe </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine called on <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> to buy back its Samurai sports-utility vehicles, saying the model has a "hazardous propensity" to roll over when a driver attempts to avoid an accident. 

   In the <DATE>July</DATE> issue of the magazine, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union of U.S. Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will rate the Samurai "not acceptable," the first time in 10 years it has so classified a vehicle. 

   At a news conference here, the nonprofit testing group called the vehicle's design inherently dangerous and said it can't be modified to rectify the problems. 

   After testing three competing utility vehicles -- the Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee and the <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu</ORGANIZATION> Trooper -- as well as two versions of the Samurai, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said it supported a recall of the 150,000 Samurais on the road. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Mount Vernon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, also petitioned federal regulators to set performance standards requiring such sports-utility vehicles to pass a test measuring vehicle stability. 

   The Samurai "trips over its own feet," said <PERSON>R. David Pittle</PERSON>, technical director for <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>. 

   In a stinging and angry retort, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> asserted that "the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety, including stability and handling, prior to its introduction" into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
"We have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and stable vehicle." 

   Late in <DATE>February</DATE>, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> said it began investigating companies and organizations "making erroneous and inaccurate claims" about <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and the Samurai. 
Suzuki yesterday reiterated a threat to sue the sources of unfounded allegations about the company. 

   Also yesterday, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> cited some positive press that the Samurai has received regarding its design and handling. 
Earlier, the company had redesigned its ads away from a light approach of young and attractive people having fun with the Samurai. 
The new ads confront the safety issue directly and starkly in an attempt to counter critics' charges. 

   For years federal officials have been looking into the safety of these mixed-use vehicles. 
And <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> isn't the first to demand that Suzuki recall the Samurai: The Center for Auto Safety, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> watchdog group, has petitioned the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> to order such a move. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>, which declines to comment on <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>'s petition, in <DATE>December</DATE> turned down a petition filed by <PERSON>Sen. Timothy Wirth</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>) seeking a stability standard. 
<ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> said, among other things, that addressing a rollover problem "solely on the basis of a stability factor is too narrow and inappropriate an approach." 

   <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> has 120 days to respond to <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>'s petition. 

   These utility vehicles are strong sellers right now, with about <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> of the market, up from less than <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> <DATE>a decade ago</DATE>. 
About five million currently are on the road. 

   Utility vehicles have a high center of gravity because they need extra ground clearance for off-road use. 
They also are exempt from the standards passenger cars must meet in resisting a crushed roof and absorbing side impacts, the group said. 

   But the <ORGANIZATION>Samurai</ORGANIZATION> also is narrower and lighter than its rivals, and <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said the Samurai "presents an unreasonable risk of harm to the consumer." 

   In its testing, the group attempted to simulate a routine situation in which a driver would have to swerve sharply to avoid an obstacle and then re-enter the driving lane. 

   The two smaller vehicles, the Samurai and the Jeep Wrangler, carried outriggers in the tests to prevent the vehicles from either falling over to the side or rolling because of a swerve or sharp turn. 

   During the tests, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>'s drivers veered to the left 50 feet before an obstacle and moved back into the driving lane no more than 60 feet beyond the obstacle. 
Moving at about 40 miles an hour, the two Jeep models, made by <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>American Motors</ORGANIZATION> unit, and the Trooper, made by <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Motors Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, remained stable, <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said. 
But both Samurai models, including a so-called 1988 1/2 model with a softer suspension, went over on the outriggers and would have rolled, the group said. 

   Consumers Union last gave a "not acceptable" rating when it criticized <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dodge Omni</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Plymouth Horizon</LOCATION> for their steering performance during emergencies. 
Chrysler denied that a problem existed, and federal authorities didn't order a recall.

   Most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are ignoring President
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s order to pay taxes owed <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> into a <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION>
escrow account established to pressure strongman <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> to
resign, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials say.
   Reagan <DATE>last April</DATE> ordered <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies with offices in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
to withhold taxes they owe its government and instead pay them into
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> escrow account. The idea was that the money would be
turned over to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> once <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has resigned or been forced from
office.
   Six months later, that <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> account remains
nearly empty as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies routinely ignore the order to pay
into it, according to a member of the <ORGANIZATION>House Foreign Affairs
Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Rep. <PERSON>Sam Gejdenson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Conn.</LOCATION>, said senior <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>
officials told him they estimate that the escrow account is <MONEY>$65
million</MONEY> short of what it should be at this point.
   Gejdenson gave no figures on how much money is in the account.
But other congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said it contained only <MONEY>$3.9 million</MONEY>, a figure that one
administration official described as ``in the ballpark.''
   Some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businesses have told the administration they did not
want to pay into the account out of fears there were insufficient
accounting controls to keep track of how much each company paid,
said <PERSON>Peter Secor</PERSON>, a Panamanian specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Secor</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION>, not the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>,
keeps records on who pays and how much. <PERSON>Gejdenson</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Treasury
Department</ORGANIZATION> officials have refused his repeated requests for that
information.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s order was in two parts: the first that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies
do not pay the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> government and, second, that the money be
placed in the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> fund.
   ``Regardless of the second part, most if not all are complying
with the first,'' <PERSON>Secord</PERSON> said, adding that the administration had
put the most priority on keeping the money out of the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
regime's hands.
   That explanation has been greeted with skepticism on Capitol
Hill, partly because the Panamanian government is allowing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
companies to continue operating there.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if (the companies) continue to pay''
taxes to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Kathleen M. Bertelsen</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Gejdenson</LOCATION> foreign
policy adviser. ``I just doubt <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> lets them stay there without
paying.''
   But <PERSON>Secor</PERSON> said <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> simply cannot afford, politically or
economically, to throw American corporations out.
   ``They don't want business confidence to erode anymore,'' he
said. ``It's important for the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> government to create the
impression of normalcy.''
   Secor also rejected the notion that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is not applying
pressure on the American firms, saying that Panamanian officials
have used legal, financial and physical threats to try to get the
tax money.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businessmen have reported threats such as ```You're going
to be in trouble,' or even `You're family is going to be in trouble
if you don't pay you're company's taxes','' <PERSON>Secor</PERSON> said.
   Gejdenson, in an interview <DATE>Friday</DATE>, said administration officials
have refused repeated invitations to testify at subcommittee
hearings to discuss the escrow account because the revelations
would be an embarrassment to Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and his
presidential campaign.
   ``It's one more demonstration that they've blown it,'' the
Democratic lawmaker said.

   TOKYO -- Most Americans are used to seeing Japan's big
auto makers roll all over Detroit. But here's a surprise:
They're also running some of their smaller Japanese rivals
right off the road.
   "It's clear that Japan simply has too many auto
companies," says Paul Fraker, an analyst who tracks Japan's
11 car and truck companies for London-based Baring
Securities. "By the end of the decade, competition will thin
the ranks of Japanese auto makers to four or five groups."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first strong signal of this impending consolidation
comes from <ORGANIZATION>Fuji Heavy Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, best known for its
Subaru cars. Fuji recently forecast an operating loss of
nearly <MONEY>23 billion yen</MONEY> (<MONEY>$145.6 million</MONEY>) for the <DATE>fiscal year
ended March 31</DATE>. That's seven times the loss it was predicting
last fall. And earlier this month, the other shoe fell: Fuji
President <PERSON>Toshijiro Tajima</PERSON> said he will yield the reins to a
former high executive of <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   Officially, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> remains independent. In reality, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s largest holder with a <PERCENT>4.3%</PERCENT> stake, will step in to
ensure <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s survival and call the shots at its ailing
cousin. It's a Chrysler-type bailout, Japanese-style, without
legislative hearings or public controversy.
   As a group, the Japanese auto makers are still clearly
winners. They took an unprecedented <PERCENT>27.7%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> car sales
in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, and last year auto sales in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>
itself rose <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> to a record. But <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s car makers aren't all
alike. Consider what the big ones -- <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Honda Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- are doing to their smaller
Japanese rivals:
   -- <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle sales in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> dropped <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> last year, but
that was the good news. Sales of its Subaru of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>
affiliate tumbled <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> and then another <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1990 first
quarter</DATE>, just as <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> was gearing up its first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> factory.
Fuji's projected operating loss will be the company's first
since its shares were listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1960</DATE>.
   -- <ORGANIZATION>Daihatsu Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s domestic auto operations sustained
an <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> drop in earnings in the <DATE>fiscal year ended March 31</DATE>,
analysts estimate. The culprits: A decline in sales of
minicars, the company's main product, and an embarrassing
recall of the company's first family-sized compact, the
Applause. <ORGANIZATION>Daihatsu</ORGANIZATION>, already <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT>-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>, wants <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION>
to raise its stake to <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> and assist in product development.
   -- <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle sales in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> dipped a
modest <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> last year, but the company hit a buzzsaw in the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Consumer Reports Magazine labeled the Samurai, a tiny,
Jeep-like vehicle, unsafe. Suzuki's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales plunged <PERCENT>48%</PERCENT> in
<DATE>1989</DATE> and were down <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> in the <DATE>1990 first quarter</DATE>. Suzuki is
fighting back with new management, new advertising and new
models, but against heavy odds.
   All this makes <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s smaller car companies ripe for the
sort of consolidation sweeping the rest of the auto industry
world-wide. In recent years, some of the world's best-known
automotive marques have surrendered their independence:
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saab</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Last <DATE>February</DATE>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s AB <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Renault S.A.</ORGANIZATION>
announced a broad alliance that will be cemented by
cross-shareholdings and cooperation on a range of products.
   Only the Japanese companies remained unaffected by this
survival-driven urge to merge. Aided by their prosperity
during much of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, they were becoming more independent
of each other and of their foreign partners.
   Even though <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, for example, is <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s largest
shareholder, Fuji stopped assembling cars for <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>
and declared that in the future it wouldn't rely so heavily
on the larger company. Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
bought back a big chunk of its stock owned by <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
reducing the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company's stake to <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> from about <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>. <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>
recently trimmed its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Motors Ltd</ORGANIZATION>.
   Now, though, the pendulum may be swinging back toward
consolidation. "It's a return to the beginning," says <PERSON>Atsushi
Muramatsu</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for finance.
   The effects on consumers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> aren't
clear. Consolidation could take years, and well-known brand
names, such as <ORGANIZATION>Subaru</ORGANIZATION>, aren't likely to disappear. Fewer
independent competitors could lead to higher prices, but
plenty of competition is still left.
   The causes of consolidation are easier to pinpoint. The
Japanese yen nearly doubled in dollar value between <DATE>1985</DATE> and
<DATE>1989</DATE>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s auto makers raised prices sharply to
compensate, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> got more competitive, and suddenly the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stopped being a sure-fire growth market for the
Japanese. The yen has slumped about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> in recent months, but
no longer is selling Japanese cars in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> a cakewalk.
   Back in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, meanwhile, the government eased the tax
bite on large cars, and their sales surged at the expense of
minicars. Toyota and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> racked up sales gains exceeding
<PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> last year, while sales of minicars -- the core products
at <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> and Suzuki as well as <ORGANIZATION>Daihatsu</ORGANIZATION> -- fell <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>.
   Minicar sales may rebound this year because the government
now allows them to have bigger engines. Nonetheless, the
future for minicars isn't bright because the newly rich
Japanese want what Americans have wanted for decades: bigger,
plusher automobiles. The minicar specialists have to change.
   "Everyone has to expand their product lines, and they just
can't do it by themselves," says <PERSON>Takeo Fujii</PERSON>, a
research-department executive at <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s lender and second-largest shareholder. "One hit, and
you're safe for a while. But one flop, and you're out."
   Fuji prospered for years because it found a niche:
four-wheel drive. Most companies confined four-wheel drive to
pickups or utility vehicles, but <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> put it on cars and
station wagons, and won fans in snowy <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rocky
Mountain</LOCATION> states. Americans bought 183,000 Subarus in <DATE>1986</DATE>,
twice the level of a decade earlier.
   Then things went awry. Sport utility vehicles surged in
popularity in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, attracting Subaru buyers. More
companies started putting four-wheel drive on cars. Fuji was
slow to respond, especially in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, where it is the only
Japanese auto maker to import and market cars through an
independent distributor. (<ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> owns <PERCENT>49.6%</PERCENT> of Subaru of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, but coordination between them can be cumbersome.)
   Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> counterattacked by launching the <ORGANIZATION>Subaru
Legacy</ORGANIZATION>, a mainstream family car. "You could call the Legacy a
make-or-break car," says <PERSON>Stephen Usher</PERSON>, an analyst at
<ORGANIZATION>Kleinwort Benson International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. "So far, it
isn't really making it." Although the Legacy gets good marks
from car-enthusiast publications, it's aimed squarely at the
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota Camry</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION> Accord.
   "We sure wish {Legacy} sales had been higher," concedes
<PERSON>Thomas R. Gibson</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Subaru of America</ORGANIZATION>. "But
actually, they aren't as disappointing as some people think."
The most typical Legacy buyer, he says, is a prior <ORGANIZATION>Subaru</ORGANIZATION>
owner, but the second and third largest categories are Camry
and Accord owners. Subaru's problems were somewhat
predictable, <PERSON>Mr. Gibson</PERSON> adds, because "we spent 20 years in
subcompact market, and now we're suddenly moving into a
market that's a little more upscale."
   Nonetheless, dealers in both the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> are
moaning. In suburban <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, for example, <LOCATION>Culver City
Subaru</LOCATION> is selling only about six cars a month, down <DATE>from 26 a
month four years ago</DATE>. "There just isn't a keen interest in
Subaru products," complains <PERSON>Philip Miller</PERSON>, the sales manager.
"There's nothing I can do. Unfortunately, I'm handling a
product that isn't doing well."
   In <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s Ark Hills financial center, <PERSON>Tadashi Uematsu</PERSON> has
much the same complaint. "I wish more young people would come
in," says <PERSON>Mr. Uematsu</PERSON>, the general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Chuo Subaru
Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> dealership. "Things are pretty tough." His first
hour on the job one morning last week was interrupted by just
one shopper.
   Fuji's bankers at <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> saw the
problems deepening last <DATE>summer</DATE>. So they sent an <ORGANIZATION>IBJ</ORGANIZATION>
executive, <PERSON>Motomu Toshiya</PERSON>, to become a senior managing
director of <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>. But five months later, <PERSON>Mr. Toshiya</PERSON> died
unexpectedly. Since then, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> has been involved in corporate
power struggles of the sort that are rare in consensus-minded
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   First, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> bid <MONEY>$147 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$6</MONEY> a share, to buy the
rest of Subaru of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Subaru balked at the price and
hasn't budged. So now, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> and Subaru officials must keep at
arms' length in the board room while trying to work hand in
hand in the showroom.
   Then, with <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> angling for control of <ORGANIZATION>Subaru</ORGANIZATION>, officials
of <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBJ</ORGANIZATION> started haggling over control of <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>
itself. Both <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IBJ</ORGANIZATION>, longtime business partners,
wanted to install their own man at <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s helm. Much as it
often happens in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, the "car guys" were fighting the
finance people over control.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>, the car guys won, partly because <PERSON>Mr. Tajima</PERSON>, the
president who presided over <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION>'s decline, himself came from
<ORGANIZATION>IBJ</ORGANIZATION>. He will remain at <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> as the chairman, but in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> the
president is the top executive. Fuji's new president will be
<PERSON>Isamu Kawai</PERSON>, a 68-year-old former high executive of <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>.
As the current president of <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Diesel Co.</ORGANIZATION>, he is
well-regarded for pulling the <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> truck-making affiliate
out of a slump.
   Already, <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> has followed <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> by abolishing dress
codes for home-office employees and permitting flexible work
schedules. More substantive moves will follow: <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> is likely
to use its idle plant capacity in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to assemble cars for
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> again, and the two companies will cooperate in
developing and marketing cars. Some analysts expect an
eventual full merger.
   How will <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s other producers fare in the expected
consolidation? <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> will expand its role at <ORGANIZATION>Daihatsu</ORGANIZATION>,
experts predict. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s truck specialists, <ORGANIZATION>Hino Motors Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Nissan Diesel</ORGANIZATION>, will remain closely tied to <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>, respectively.
   <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> is pulling away from <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> but exploring
closer ties with <ORGANIZATION>Daimler-Benz AG</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>, as

   The wild card is <LOCATION>Suzuki</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT>-owned by <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> but the only small
Japanese car maker to remain truly independent. "Suzuki's

delicate." A <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> says that in the
future the company, like other auto makers, may need to put
more emphasis on cooperation. He adds, however, "We think we
have to continue on our own."
   In any case, the events at <ORGANIZATION>Fuji</ORGANIZATION> show that being Japanese
doesn't guarantee any car company immunity from global
competition. "Will all 11 Japanese vehicle manufacturers
remain independent? I don't think so," says <PERSON>Stephen E.

<HL> Suzuki Threatens Legal Actions to Halt Complaints About Samurai Sport Vehicles </HL>
<AUTHOR> Joseph B. White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> AUT </IN>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> doesn't want to hear any complaints that its Suzuki Samurai sport vehicle may be unsafe, and is threatening legal action to squelch them. 

   The Japanese auto maker's announcement, issued by its Brea, Calif.-based <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arm <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and again yesterday, came in reaction to a complaint filed with little fanfare last week by the Center for <ORGANIZATION>Auto Safety</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> D.C.-based consumer group. 

   The group said it has evidence of 11 accidents in which a Samurai rolled over after a skid or a sharp turn. 
The accidents resulted in three deaths and injuries to eight other people, the group said in a petition filed last week with the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Transportation Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>, in an unusually combative response, said the consumer group's charges that the Samurai's high center of gravity made it too easy to tip over were "instigated in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster public opinion against <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and perhaps the entire sport utility industry." 
The company said the Samurai is safe, and added that it will conduct an investigation to determine the source of the charges and "utilize every available means of halting the allegations, including any appropriate legal action." 

   Among the complaints lodged with the consumer group was one from <PERSON>John Moschetto</PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> motorcycle patrol officer. 
<PERSON>Mr. Moschetto</PERSON> said in an interview yesterday that a Samurai he rented on a vacation in <LOCATION>Aruba</LOCATION> <DATE>last July</DATE> tipped over on its side after he skidded on wet pavement and hit the curb in a traffic circle. 
<PERSON>Mr. Moschetto</PERSON> said that he was traveling at less than 25 miles an hour when the accident occurred, and that he hadn't been drinking. 
"I couldn't believe what was happening," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Moschetto</PERSON>'s daughter and another passenger were injured in the crash. 

   Complaints about rollovers aren't new to the sport utility vehicle industry. 
A number of lawsuits filed in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> charged that the Jeep CJ-5 vehicle was prone to rollovers because of its high center of gravity. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> ultimately stopped producing the CJ series at the end of <DATE>1984</DATE>. 

   Suzuki and its public relations agency, <ORGANIZATION>Rogers &amp; Associates of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION>, put "quite a bit of thought" into the pros and cons of reacting to the consumer group's petition, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Rogers &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION> said. 
"It was important for the company to make sure its point was well made, (and) I think it was," the spokeswoman said. 

   Suzuki said its investigation will seek to "determine the original source of the allegations and why the company is being singled out."

   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Sunday</DATE> it had
reached a tentative agreement with a Hungarian government-owned
automaker to jointly build cars and engines at a plant under
construction in the Eastern European nation.
   The deal makes <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automaker to invest in <LOCATION>Eastern
Europe</LOCATION>, which has undergone tremendous political and economic
liberalization in recent months, said <PERSON>R.L. Theis</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s
Detroit-based international spokesman. The company is to invest
<MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> in the dea.
   The agreement between <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Europe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RABA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s
state-owned manufacturer of trucks, diesel engines and axles, could
lead to a joint venture to build engines and cars at a plant in
<LOCATION>Szentgotthard</LOCATION>, near the Austrian border, beginning in <DATE>1992</DATE>, <PERSON>Theis</PERSON>
said.
   ``The tentative agreement spells out the full intent of the
joint venture. Now, both parties have to finalize all the details
and actually form the joint venture,'' <PERSON>Theis</PERSON> said.
   Although <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automaker to announce an
agreement, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it would
build a <MONEY>$138.9 million</MONEY> assembly plant near <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s
capital, to make Suzuki Swift subcompact cars beginning in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   GM <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Robert J. Eaton</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>RABA</ORGANIZATION> Managing Director
<PERSON>Ferenc Romvari</PERSON> signed the protocol <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION> before
Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON>Peter Medgyessy</PERSON>.
   ``As these markets continue to open up, investing in plants
there is becoming a more attractive business proposition,'' <PERSON>Eaton</PERSON>
said in a statement. ``This new strategic partnership would provide
us with better access to the growing car market in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and
elsewhere in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.''
   Under the tentative agreement, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would have a <PERCENT>67 percent</PERCENT>
interest in the <LOCATION>Szentgotthard</LOCATION> plant and would be allowed to appoint
management staff. The plant would create about 880 jobs in the
western Hungarian town, <PERSON>Theis</PERSON> said.
   The world's largest automaker said about 200,000 engines would
be turned out yearly, most of which would be exported for use in
<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION> cars. The rest would go into the <ORGANIZATION>Opel Kadett</ORGANIZATION>
model to be built at the Hungarian plant.
   <PERSON>Theis</PERSON> said current plans call for only one car-assembly shift
and an annual production of 15,000 vehicles for sale in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> and
other Eastern European markets.
   ``Market conditions will dictate whether an additional shift is
required,'' he said. Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION> sold 6,600 cars in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>.
   The profitable European branches of both <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>
have been bolstering sagging <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations recently. <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> also sells cars in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> but does not run independent
manufacturing plants there.
   Last month, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire half of the car business of
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania AB</ORGANIZATION> for about <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>. That announcement
came on the heels of rival <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>. Of the <ORGANIZATION>Big Three</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has the largest
presence in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Lin Cummins</PERSON> said the world's
second-largest automaker had no negotiations in the works involving
<LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, but was watching the market carefully.
   ``There would seem to be a good chance that multinational
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in
the course of the next several years,'' <PERSON>Cummins</PERSON> said.

<HL> Suzuki Takes Extraordinary Measures To Halt Sales Plunge of Samurai Model </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bradley A. Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> AUT </IN>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and some of its dealers are resorting to extraordinary measures -- including huge discounts and free life insurance -- to reverse the Samurai model's sales plunge. 

   This week, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> started giving dealers <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> incentives on sales of the sport-utility vehicle. 
The company isn't requiring dealers to cut the Samurai's prices with the incentive, but many dealers say they'll immediately lop a whopping <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> off the Samurai's <MONEY>$7,995</MONEY> base price. 

   The 12 Suzuki dealers in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> are taking matters a step further by giving Samurai buyers a free <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> life-insurance policy. 

   "If something as drastic as this doesn't sell the Samurais, then maybe I'll run a bowling alley next week," said <PERSON>Robert Reichert</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Kings Suzuki Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. 
"We have to do something to get people back in the showrooms again." 

   Samurai sales plunged <PERCENT>70.6%</PERCENT> in <DATE>June</DATE> to 2,199 vehicles in the worst decline since their <DATE>1985</DATE> U.S. introduction. 
The severe drop followed charges by <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, that the Samurai is unsafe and tends to roll over while taking sharp turns. 

   The <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> Samurai dealer-incentive plan ranks as one of the deepest discounts ever offered on a vehicle sold in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Yugo America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> cut <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> off the base prices of its slow-selling subcompact cars imported from <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>. 

   Also, <ORGANIZATION>Audi of America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is offering its former customers an <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> rebate on the purchase of a new <ORGANIZATION>Audi</ORGANIZATION> 5000 model, whose sales have plunged after allegations that the cars suddenly accelerate without the driver intending it. 
The 5000 model is being phased out. 

   Dealers who have watched showroom traffic dwindle away in the past month praised <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s incentive plan. 
"We had to get something that grabbed attention," said <PERSON>Phil Smith</PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON>Dick Smith Suzuki</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>. 
"If they would have come out with a <MONEY>$300</MONEY> rebate it would have been lost in the clutter of all the other incentive offers, but <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> makes these vehicles so incredibly inexpensive." 

   Suzuki officials confirmed the existence of a dealer-incentive program but wouldn't confirm the amount being offered on each vehicle. 
The program began <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and will last until <DATE>Sept. 2</DATE>. 
Company officials also declined to say whether they are considering other steps to spur Samurai sales. 

   But Suzuki dealers in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> said the company is thinking about using their free life-insurance offer nationwide. 
The <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> dealers are offering the insurance, underwritten by <ORGANIZATION>American International Group</ORGANIZATION>, until the end of <DATE>August</DATE>. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Reichert</PERSON> said they may extend the offer if demand picks up. 

   "We can't run enough ads to convince the public that our cars are safe," <PERSON>Mr. Reichert</PERSON> said. 
"But with the insurance we can draw attention by saying we're willing to pay <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to back up the Samurai's safety." 
The insurance policy lasts for one year after the vehicle is purchased and covers only the death of the driver in a rollover accident.

<HEAD>Customs Rules Samurai is Truck, Not Car; Seats Added After Import</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> ruled <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the
tiny <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> sport-utility vehicle will continue to be
counted as a truck since it enters the country without back seats,
which are added later.
   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s Samurais are imported into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
as trucks because Suzuki doesn't have a large enough allocation
under the Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship
them as cars or sport-utility vehicles.
   ``This decision doesn't make any sense when people see how these
vehicles are being used in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but in this case the
<ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner <PERSON>William
von Raab</PERSON>.
   ``These are `trucks' under the law when they enter this
country,'' he said.
   Instead of paying a <PERCENT>2.5 percent</PERCENT> car tariff, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> pays a <PERCENT>25
percent</PERCENT> truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped
without back seats to qualify as trucks.
   Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at
dealerships. Few, if any of the small sport vehicles actually are
sold without rear seats. Suzuki sold 81,349 Samurais in this
country in <DATE>1987</DATE> and said it plans to sell 100,000 in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House
Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION>, criticized von <ORGANIZATION>Raab</ORGANIZATION>'s decision.
   ``It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the
Japanese are shipping seats into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> separately, then
installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the (voluntary
export restraints),'' he said.
   ``We don't like illogical decisions any more than Commissioner
von <PERSON>Raab</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Dingell</PERSON> said in a statement.
   Von <PERSON>Raab</PERSON> said Customs soon will seek public comment on the
creation of additional criteria that would simplify the
classification process.
   Last year, Customs and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> officials said the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government had little interest in helping the Japanese
government enforce its export limits, particularly since the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government takes in more money when foreign carmakers opt to pay
the <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> tariff instead of the lower fee.
   Other Japanese companies following Suzuki's practice include
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the companies said last year.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government has safety and fuel economy standards, among
other criteria, used to classify a vehicle as a car or truck for
those purposes.
   For example, trucks are not yet subject to the same roof-crush,
side-strength and high-mounted brake-light standards as cars.
   But those criteria are not used by the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION>, which
instead looks at features such as number of seats to determine a
vehicle's apparent purpose when it is imported.
   The Japanese government voluntarily limits exports of Japanese
cars to this country to 2.3 million per year.
   Under a less-publicized quota that was designed to cover station
wagons, which are considered trucks in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> but cars in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, the Japanese government also limits exports of
sport-utility vehicles and minivans shipped to this country to
113,000 to 115,000 a year.
   Suzuki, which gives nearly all its car allocation to <ORGANIZATION>General
Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for the imported <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Sprint</ORGANIZATION>, built by <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, also has no sport-utility vehicle allocation.
   Earlier this year, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> it would be
forced to close its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dealerships if the Samurai were classified
as a car.
   But when that information became public, <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> denied it had
any intention of closing dealerships and said it instead was
aggressively expanding its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dealer network.

<HL> U.S. Says Car, Japanese Auto Makers Say Truck, Customs Isn't About to Call the Whole Thing Off </HL>

   It sounds like a joke from a comedy skit about pointy-headed bureaucrats: Government officials are trying to discern the difference between a truck and a car. 

   But the question is no joke to federal agencies currently wrestling with the problem. 
It's also no laughing matter to several Japanese auto makers whose shipments to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> are restricted by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s export quota. 

   Government and industry sources say the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> could shed some light on the controversy as early as today. 
The agency is expected to respond to Japanese manufacturers who complained when customs proposed reclassifying as cars the Jeeplike sport utility vehicles they have been exporting as trucks. 

   This latest round in U.S.-Japan trade tensions began last fall when Rep. <PERSON>John D. Dingell</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION>, decided some Japanese auto makers were trying to circumvent the auto export quota by classifying their sport utility models as trucks. 
Besides alerting customs of his concerns, <PERSON>Mr. Dingell</PERSON> also recently asked the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> to look into the matter. 

   A change in the classification would be more than just academic. 
It could create serious problems for such companies as <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Motors Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, who aren't allowed to export many cars here and who depend on sport utility vehicles in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 

   "These things represent a significant part of our sales, no question," says a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit. 

   The roots of the conflict go back seven years. 
When <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> adopted its 1,680,000-car quota (now 2.3 million) in <DATE>1981</DATE>, the question of how to classify sport utility vehicles wasn't a major issue. 
Most of the domestic and foreign-made models were spartan, truck-based, off-road buggies with no back seats and few amenities. 
Only one Japanese manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, exported them to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> anyway. 

   So <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> set up a small, separate quota of about 82,000 vehicles (now 100,000) to cover station wagons and the few sport utility "cars" shipped here with back seats. 
The sport utility models that entered the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> without back seats were classified as trucks. 
Truck exports haven't been restricted but face a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> U.S. tariff, compared with the <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT> tariff levied on cars. 

   Then sales of sport utility vehicles took off, as companies gussied them up to broaden their appeal. 
Sales of Japanese-made models nearly reached 200,000 here in <DATE>1987</DATE> -- stealing some sales from their U.S.-made cousins. 
Many of the Japanese vehicles, like their domestic counterparts, offer such carlike features as cut-pile carpeting and AM-FM stereo radio. 
Most also have back seats -- installed at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> port or the dealership after the vehicles clear customs as trucks. 

   "In a recent survey of <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> buyers, the majority of new owners who were replacing a vehicle were replacing a car, not a truck," crowed a <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki of America Automotive Corp.</ORGANIZATION> press release issued about a year after <ORGANIZATION>Samurai</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>November 1985</DATE> debut. 
"The fact that so many subcompact buyers are turning to the Samurai is evidence of the vehicle's appeal in that category." 

   That's precisely <PERSON>Mr. Dingell</PERSON>'s point. 
If people use sport utility vehicles as substitutes for cars, the vehicles should be considered cars for tariff and quota purposes. 
At his urging, the <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> last year ordered its field offices to take a closer look at the situation. 
"Absence of rear passenger seating is not conclusive evidence of classification," the department said in a message that ordered its agents to be on the lookout for such "passenger amenities" in the rear compartment as carpeting, insulation, "windows that open," ventilation ducts, audio speakers, ashtrays, armrests and "similar features typical of a vehicle designed for transport of persons rather than cargo." 

   The department's <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> district office promptly proposed reclassifying a number of sport utility vehicles. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arms of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Suzuki</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> separately protested. 
The companies insist that they comply with customs regulations, which assign a classification based on the vehicle's condition "as imported." 
Still, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> stopped most shipments of their sport utility "trucks." 

   <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> now plans to resume shipments <DATE>April 1</DATE>, says <PERSON>Richard D. Recchia</PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Toyota is "contemplating" a similar move, says a <ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Sales</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.A.</LOCATION> spokeswoman, who didn't indicate a target date. 
Both companies say they are changing their position because they expect customs to affirm the truck classification of the affected vehicles already shipped here. 
What they don't know is what customs "is going to say about the future," says <PERSON>Mr. Recchia</PERSON>. 

   Customs could decide to change the criteria for classification, a process that would likely take at least a few months. 
Customs also has to respond to the protests filed last year. 

   Suzuki and <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu</ORGANIZATION>, both partly owned by <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, would be hurt the most if a reclassification is ultimately approved. 
Both have tiny car quotas with little hope of expansion given <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s recent decision to hold the restraints at the current level. 
About <PERCENT>96%</PERCENT> of the vehicles Suzuki sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE> were brought into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as trucks. 
About a third of all <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu</ORGANIZATION> models sold here were sport utility "trucks." 

   The continuing slowdown in sales of Japanese cars could help untie the knot. 
Higher prices caused by the strength of the Japanese yen have made it difficult, if not impossible, for most of the Japanese companies to sell their car-quota allocations. 
Thus, some companies say it won't hurt as much now to call their sport utility vehicles cars. 
It also might be possible for <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu</ORGANIZATION> and Suzuki to get a bit of their competitors' "leftover" allocations. 

   Some news indicating what will finally happen should come "pretty quickly," says a <ORGANIZATION>Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
He and a spokesman for Rep. <PERSON>Dingell</PERSON> confirmed that the congressman and Customs Commissioner <PERSON>William von Rabb</PERSON> met late yesterday to discuss the classification issue, although neither would say exactly what the discussion covered. 

   The customs spokesman said the problem is particularly difficult because it involves "a significant revenue issue." 
One <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official estimated that the government takes in about <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> a year from the <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> tariff on the sport utility "trucks." 
Reclassifying these models as cars, with the <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT> tariff, would sharply cut that total. 
The lower tariff could mean lower prices as well, although the companies could choose to pocket the difference. 

   "But you also have to look at it in the spirit of the law and good trade relations," he added. 
"There's a lot of strong arguments here."

<HL> Matter of Honor: Japanese Top Managers
Quick to Resign When Trouble Hits Firm
---
By Christopher J. Chipello
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 07/10/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> JAPAN </IN>
<TEXT>
   When <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s top two executives resigned last week, it said a lot about how Japanese managers differ from their <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterparts. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> executives said they were taking responsibility for a subsidiary's sale of militarily sensitive technology to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
Most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> executives probably wouldn't even consider resigning over an issue like that; while both American and Japanese managers are responsible for the bottom line, the Japanese corporate chief is expected to make symbolic gestures and, at times, personal sacrifices that most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> executives aren't. 

   Ritualistic resignations by Japanese chief executives are "almost a feudal way of purging the community of dishonor," says <PERSON>George Lodge</PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>'s business school. 
"This is far different from the Anglo-Saxon legalistic tradition," he says, where an employee is bound by contract rather than as a member of a corporate community. 

   Toshiba itself noted that the resignations "may be hard to understand in American terms," but called it "the highest form of apology" in the Japanese business world. 

   The changes at <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> have their limits. 
The two executives, President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>Sugiichiro Watari</PERSON> and Chairman <PERSON>Shoichi Saba</PERSON>, will become consultants to the company-paid roles frequently assigned to past chairmen and presidents of Japanese corporations. 
As a result, there is "some element of theater" in the resignations, says <PERSON>Herbert Passin</PERSON>, a business consultant and emeritus professor of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>. 
But he says the resignations are "significant" because the executives are surrendering authority. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> has emphasized that the responsible subsidiary has a separate management. 
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Mr. Saba</PERSON> said, he and <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION>'s president "must take personal responsibility for not creating an atmosphere throughout the <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> group that would make such activity unthinkable, even in an independently run subsidiary." 

   The incident recalls the resignation in <DATE>1985</DATE> of the president of <ORGANIZATION>Kikkoman Corp.</ORGANIZATION> after a scandal over tainted wine. 
Or the resignation that same year of the president of <ORGANIZATION>Japan Air Lines</ORGANIZATION>, following a jet crash that cost over 500 lives. 
Then-president <PERSON>Yasumoto Takagi</PERSON> remained in office only long enough to see that arrangements had been made to bury the dead and assist the bereaved -- a process that included personal calls on victims' families. 

   By contrast, never was it seriously suggested in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> that top executives of <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Co.</ORGANIZATION> step down after the <ORGANIZATION>JAL</ORGANIZATION> crash, even though the accident has been linked to a faulty repair performed years earlier by <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> mechanics. 
No executives of <ORGANIZATION>Union Carbide Corp.</ORGANIZATION> resigned after the <DATE>1984</DATE> poison gas leak in <LOCATION>Bhopal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
Nor have any top officials resigned from <ORGANIZATION>Morton Thiokol Inc.</ORGANIZATION> over the company's involvement in the space-shuttle disaster. 

   "If we apply Western standards, (resignation) looks like the act of a coward," says <PERSON>Akira Yamashita</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> architect who has advised Japanese companies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
To most Japanese, he says, shouldering the blame for subordinates "looks honorable." 

   "Within Japanese corporate culture and social ethics, the whole notion is that the leader can delegate the authority to anyone he or she wishes, but not the responsibility," says <PERSON>Yoshi Tsurumi</PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION>City University of New York</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Baruch</PERSON> business school. 
"In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, (leaders) delegate authority and responsibility." 

   The assigning of institutional responsibility to top officials isn't confined to the business world. 
<PERSON>Peter Kamura</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> representative for the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Center for International Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, a private nonprofit organization, notes that Japanese school principals have resigned after major crimes were committed by students -- even when the crimes were committed outside of school and after school hours. 

   The willingness of some Japanese top executives to serve as a kind of scapegoat in extreme circumstances is more than just a curiosity, management experts say. 
It's one of the many ways that Japanese companies create a sense of community and employee loyalty, in a business culture that demands much of its workers. 
The assurance that a company will keep them on the payroll at almost any cost makes workers more willing to cooperate in the pursuit of long-term corporate goals. 

   "The messages that management sends are an important part of the relationship that gets built between management and labor," says <PERSON>Alan Webber</PERSON>, co-author of a recent <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business School</ORGANIZATION> study on global competition in the auto industry. 
Even seemingly trivial gestures, such as not reserving parking places for managers in factory lots, make workers more likely to cooperate in financially significant measures, he argues. 

   Admirers of the Japanese management style don't advocate that American executives begin resigning over subordinates' misdeeds. 
That isn't likely to correct a problem, they say. 
Beyond that, the departure of a chief executive in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is likely to be more disruptive than in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, notes <PERSON>Edward Lincoln</PERSON>, a Japanese economy specialist at the Brookings Institution. 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies tend to depend more on individual executives than those in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 

   Nevertheless, many argue that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies would be better off if top officials made it clear they are at least fighting the same battle as workers. 

   When times are hard, "The first thing a Japanese executive does is cut his own pay," says <PERSON>Vernon Alden</PERSON>, a director of several <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporations. 
"Here, the first thing is to close factories." 
While executive pay cuts may not do much to reduce a company's costs, they do demonstrate to workers that management is sharing the hardship, he says. 

   Some contend that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> executives in recent years too often have feathered their own nests while appearing insensitive to the security of employees. 
Studies have shown that executive salaries on average represent higher multiples of line workers' wages in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> than in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>; recent evidence suggests the gap is growing. 

   <PERSON>Herbert Glazer</PERSON>, associate dean of <ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION>'s business school, argues that so-called golden parachutes "are the worst abuse of the American management system, where the failures bail out with these multimillion-dollar packages."

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 27</DATE> (CNS) -- The Chinese Vice Premier 
and Foreign Minister <PERSON>Mr. Qian Qichen</PERSON> and other officials went to 
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> here this morning to express their condolences 
on the death of former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Mr. Richard M. Nixon</PERSON>. The 
Chinese President <PERSON>Mr. Jiang Zemin</PERSON>, the Premier <PERSON>Mr. Li Peng</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Mr. Qian</PERSON> as well as another vice premier <PERSON>Mr. Zhu Rongji</PERSON> sent 
wreaths there. 
  The Chinese government decided yesterday that it would 
dispatch Vice Premier <PERSON>Mr. Zou Jiahua</PERSON> who was now visiting the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to attend the funeral which would be held in <LOCATION>Yorba 
Linda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the hometown to the former president. 
  Several Chinese leaders including <PERSON>Mr. Jiang Zemin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Li 
Peng</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr. Zhu Rongji</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Qian Qichen</PERSON> sent condolence 
messages to mourn <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON>'s death the day after the former 
president died. They paid respects to this politician for his 
important role in international politics. 
  The Chinese leaders praised <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> for his strategic 
farsightedness and political bravery when in his capacity as 
37th <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President together with Chinese leaders <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Zhou Enlai</PERSON> he opened the era of diplomatic ties between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He visited <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on seven occasions 
after stepping down. The last two visits to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> in <DATE>October, 
1989</DATE>, and <DATE>April, 1993</DATE> were to deal with the Chinese leadership 
on solution to problems harming bilateral relations resulting 
from the "<DATE>June 4</DATE> incident" and the granting of Most <ORGANIZATION>Favoured 
Nation</ORGANIZATION> status. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Nixon</PERSON> was the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President after World War II to 
visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 22 years ago. He appeared at a welcoming banquet on 
the <TIME>evening</TIME> of <DATE>February 21, 1972</DATE>, and delivered a speech on 
behalf of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION> and the American people. He said 
in his speech that should the people of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> make enemies of each other, the future of the entire world 
would be very gloomy. He added that were the people of the two 
powers to find common ground for cooperation, the chances for 
peace for the entire world would increase immeasurably. <PERSON>Mr. 
Nixon</PERSON> said in his speech that the two countries were once 
enemies and they still harboured great differences. He, 
however, noted that mutual interest was the factor to help them 
join together and go beyond the differences.

   <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Caspar Weinberger</PERSON> is expected to resign soon and be succeeded by <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON>Frank Carlucci</PERSON>, according to sources close to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON>'s resignation had been rumored for weeks, amid reports that he was unhappy with the administration's pending arms control treaty with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
In addition, <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON> is believed to be concerned about the continued poor health of his wife, <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Carlucci</PERSON>, who served as <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON>'s deputy defense secretary for the first two years of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, is expected to be succeeded at the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> by his assistant, Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> news broadcasts <TIME>last night</TIME> that <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON> was going to resign. 
"We have not received any letter of resignation," <PERSON>Mr. Fitzwater</PERSON> said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON>, who is attending a <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, declined to comment. 
However, sources close to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION>defense</ORGANIZATION> secretary had indicated his plan to leave and his preference to be succeeded by <PERSON>Mr. Carlucci</PERSON> would be followed. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> reported that sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> approved the appointment in recent days, and it will be announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>AP</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Mr. Carlucci</PERSON> declined comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON>, 70 years old, is one of the longest-serving cabinet officers in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration and has maintained a hard-liner stance supporting <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON>'s more than <MONEY>$1 trillion</MONEY> military buildup despite pressures to compromise with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
While the <ORGANIZATION>defense</ORGANIZATION> secretary endorsed the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval activities in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, he lost an earlier battle in which he opposed sending <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Marines to <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON> was appointed secretary of health, education and welfare by President <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in <DATE>1973</DATE>, a position he held until <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
He then joined <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a major international engineering concern, where he became a vice president, director and general counsel and worked with <PERSON>George Shultz</PERSON>, now secretary of state. 

   The resignation of <PERSON>Mr. Weinberger</PERSON> would be the latest of recent departures from the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> cabinet. 
In the past few weeks, <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON> and <PERSON>William Brock</PERSON> resigned as transportation secretary and labor secretary to help with <PERSON>Sen. Robert Dole</PERSON>'s presidential campaign.

<HL> Samurai Owners File Suit Against Suzuki for Refunds </HL>

<DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, already battling consumer groups critical of its Samurai sport utility vehicles, now faces a class action suit demanding that Samurai owners get their money back. 

   The suit, filed <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> state court here, contends that all 150,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Samurai owners should get refunds in the wake of charges that the vehicles are dangerously unstable. 
The suit also charges that Suzuki fraudulently withheld information about alleged design defects that give the Samurai a propensity to roll over in certain abrupt maneuvers. 
<PERSON>Robert Holstein</PERSON>, attorney for the three named plaintiffs, couldn't be reached for comment. 

   A spokeswoman for the Japanese company's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the company is aware of the suit, but had no comment on it. 
Suzuki has denied charges that the Samurai is unsafe, and has threatened to launch a legal counterattack against critics. 

   The battle over the Samurai intensified last week when Consumer Reports magazine announced that its tests showed the Samurai rolled over during sharp turns even at relatively low speeds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union of U.S. Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the magazine's publishers, said <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> should buy back all models sold in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
In <DATE>March</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, D.C.-based Center for Auto Safety made similar charges, and says now that it knows of 29 Samurai roll-over accidents that left eight people dead and 29 injured.

<HEAD>Incentives Help Samurai Sales To Set Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> broke a monthly
sales record by <PERCENT>45.9 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>August</DATE> as sharp price cuts helped
it stage a comeback from the damage done by allegations that it was
an unsafe vehicle.
   Samurai sales plunged by <PERCENT>70.6 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>June</DATE> after <ORGANIZATION>Consumers
Union</ORGANIZATION> charged that the small, boxy, four-wheel-drive vehicle was
dangerously top-heavy and prone to rolling over.
   <DATE>August</DATE> sales totaled 12,208, up from the 2,199 sold in <DATE>June</DATE>. The
sales were <PERCENT>54.4 percent</PERCENT> ahead of the 7,905 sold in <DATE>August 1987</DATE> and
<PERCENT>45.9 percent</PERCENT> ahead of the previous-record 8,365 sold in <DATE>July 1987</DATE>.
   ``Certainly consumer confidence is back in the Samurai,'' said
<PERSON>Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, general manager of the automotive division of
<ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, stood by its
criticism of the Samurai, which it has rated `not acceptable.'
   ``In essence, deep discounts and advertisements for fun and
excitement do not make this a safe car,'' <PERSON>Marnie Goodman</PERSON>, a
spokeswoman, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The swift turnaround restored <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON>'s winning image just in
time for the fall introduction of two new vehicles, a bigger
four-wheel-drive vehicle named the Sidekick and a small hatchback
named the Swift.
   Suzuki is predicting Samurai sales will drop off now that the
dealer incentives have ended, but it is counting on the Sidekick
and Swift to more than pick up the slack.
   Analysts said <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arm of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki
Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> _ is in a much better position than it was three months
ago.
   ``Momentum tends to feed on itself,'' said <PERSON>Scott Merlis</PERSON>, an
analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Merlis</PERSON> said he could not comment on the Samurai's safety, but
said it was obvious that customers were willing to shed any
lingering doubts raised by television news clips of the Samurai
tipping over while zigzagging on a <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> test course.
   ``It's sometimes quite ironic how cash rebates can be the
antidote to safety concerns,'' <PERSON>Merlis</PERSON> said. ``Occasionally you see
sales incentives work like magic.''
   On <DATE>July 13</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> announced <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> incentives to dealers that
made it possible for them to slash <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> from the Samurai's
<MONEY>$7,995</MONEY> base price. That helped <DATE>July</DATE> sales to rebound somehwat, to
6,327.
   Suzuki had piqued curiosity about its <DATE>August</DATE> results by saying
they would be a record, but kept its estimates low to enhance the
surprise.
   Mazza told the Wall Street Journal on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <DATE>August</DATE> sales
would top 9,000. He told the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> he hoped
sales would exceed 10,000, but did not want to predict they would
be as high as 11,000. ``It was better than even we forecast, and
we're pretty optimistic,'' he said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Suzuki steadfastly has defended the Samurai's safety, and its
contentions were supported last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> turned down petitions to investigate
and recall the vehicle. The agency said the Samurai was no more
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies.
   The Samurai's success was mirrored by the success of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Jeep Wrangler, a competitor, whose sales rose <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> to
2,465 from 2,114. The Jeep line as a whole had record sales in
<DATE>August</DATE>.
   In another sense, the Samurai's experience is similar to the
rebound experienced by <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dodge Omni</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Plymouth Horizon</LOCATION>,
which were rated not acceptable by Consumer Reports in <DATE>June 1978</DATE>.
Their sales fell by a third, but began to rebound after the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and Canadian governments said the charges of unsafe handling
could not be substantiated. Both cars are still on the market.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has settled
lawsuits brought by seven states by agreeing to publicize that its
Samurai model may roll over in sharp turns.
   The company, which is based in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, also will pay
<MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> to cover what it cost <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to brings suits accusing
Suzuki of false and deceptive advertising. The agreement was
announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   In the settlement, which took effect <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the company made no
admission of guilt or safety problems.
   Safety of the Samurai came into question <DATE>last June</DATE> after Consumer
Reports magazine gave the four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle a
rating of ``not acceptable.'' It said the Samurai was too short,
narrow, light and high-riding to be safe and that it rolled over in
a routine obstacle-avoidance test.
   Consumers Union, publisher of the magazine, asked the <ORGANIZATION>National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> to recall the more than
150,000 Samurais sold in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since its introduction in
<DATE>November 1985</DATE>.
   The federal safety agency declined to recall the car, saying in
<DATE>September</DATE> that the Samurai rollover rate was ``within the range of
most other light utility vehicles.''
   <PERSON>N. Douglas Mazza</PERSON>, vice president of the car company, issued a
statement that said the agreement with the seven states ``affirms
that the Samurai is a safe vehicle and strongly supports the federal
government decision that there is no reason to investigate the
safety of the Samurai.''
   While <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> is bound, under the settlement, to include the
warning in ads shown or published only in the seven states involved
in the case, the company said it would be included in all national
advertising.
   New York Attorney General <PERSON>Robert Abrams</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the
states took action because ``the federal government has, once again,
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.''
   He said that under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION>'s print ads will have
to include the statement: ``This vehicle handles differently from
ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns
and abrupt maneuvers which can cause vehicles of this type to roll
over. Always wear your seatbelt. For specific details, please read
your owner's manual.''
   A shorter version of the statement is required for television and
radio ads, <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>GM May Be First U.S. Automaker Into Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>General Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> says it is in the final leg
of talks with <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> to establish a joint venture, possibly making
it the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carmaker to enter the recently liberalized
markets of <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
   If <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> completes the deal, which company spokesman <PERSON>John Pekarek</PERSON>
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> was in ``advanced stages,'' it could represent one of
the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> projects in the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> bloc.
   Pekarek declined to give details of the talks, other than to say
a decision about the project should be reached soon. He would not
confirm or deny a report from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s Wall Street
Journal saying the negotiations centered on a <MONEY>$180-million</MONEY> project
to build cars and engines in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Pekarek</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> had no other negotiations under way involving
any other Eastern European project.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> would not be the first automaker to announce a deal with
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it would build a
<MONEY>$138.9</MONEY>.million assembly plant near <LOCATION>Budapest</LOCATION>, the Hungarian capital,
to make Suzuki Swift subcompact cars beginning in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   A potential GM-Hungarian deal was news to auto analyst <PERSON>Kathleen
Heaney</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Nikko Securities Co</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>International Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   ``I'm just surprised at how quickly they (<ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION>) moved because of
their nature,'' she said. ``<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is a whole 'nother world for
them. Their (European) products look good and they're profitable.''
   However, she said, establishing a factory in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> would be
good for <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> by giving it needed capacity.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> each have profitable businesses in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,
which recently have been bolstering sagging <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations.
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Corp.</ORGANIZATION> markets some of its cars on the Continent, but has
no independent manufacturing plants there.
   Last month, <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire half of the car business of
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Saab-Scania AB</ORGANIZATION> for about <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>. That announcement
came on the heels of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the British luxury
carmaker <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar PLC</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> already makes and sells <ORGANIZATION>Opel</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Vauxhall</ORGANIZATION> vehicles in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
It also owns all of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Group Lotus PLC</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>, which has the
largest European presence of any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> automaker, makes cars and
vans there carrying the <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> nameplate.
   Ford has no active negotiations involving Eastern European
production, said spokeswoman <PERSON>Lin Cummins</PERSON>. She said, however, that
the world's second-largest automaker behind <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> is watching
developments closely.
   ``There would seem to be a good chance that multinational
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in
the course of the next several years,'' she said.
   Chrysler officials also have said they have been surprised at
the speed of change in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and that later it would
provide a large market for vehicles.
   Heaney speculated it would be five years before any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
automaker could begin making cars in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, partly because
of difficulties in converting the communist nations' currency into
dollars and partly because of the lack of personal wealth in
<LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
   ``The consumers just don't have the money,'' she said.
   Other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporations also have moved to take advantage of the
rapid changes in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>November</DATE>
agreed to pay <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> for a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION>Tungsram</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s state-owned lighting manufacturer.

<HEAD>Customs Rules Samurai is Truck, Not Car; Seats Added After Import</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> may continue to import its tiny
Samurai sport-utility vehicle as a truck rather than a car because
it enters the country without back seats, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Customs Service</ORGANIZATION>
has ruled.
   ``I don't like making any decision which seems illogical. This
decision doesn't make any sense when people see how these vehicles
are being used in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but in this case the <ORGANIZATION>Customs
Service</ORGANIZATION> has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner <PERSON>William von Raab</PERSON>.
   ``These are `trucks' under the law when they enter this
country,'' he said in announcing the decision <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Suzuki's Samurais are imported into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as trucks
because Suzuki doesn't have a large enough allocation under the
Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship them as
cars or sport-utility vehicles.
   Instead of paying a <PERCENT>2.5 percent</PERCENT> car tariff, <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki</ORGANIZATION> pays a <PERCENT>25
percent</PERCENT> truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped
without back seats to qualify as trucks.
   Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at
dealerships. Few of the small, Jeep-like vehicles are sold without
rear seats. Suzuki sold 81,349 Samurais in this country in <DATE>1987</DATE> and
said it plans to sell 100,000 this year.
   Rep. <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mich.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House Energy
and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION>, criticized von <ORGANIZATION>Raab</ORGANIZATION>'s decision.
   ``It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the
Japanese are shipping seats into the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> separately, then
installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the (voluntary
export restraints),'' he said.
   Last year, Customs and <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> officials said the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government had little interest in helping the Japanese
government enforce its export limits, particularly since federal
government takes in more money when a maker opts to pay the <PERCENT>25
percent</PERCENT> tariff instead of the lower fee.
   Other Japanese companies that follow Suzuki's practice include
<ORGANIZATION>Nissan Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Isuzu Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Toyota Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the companies said last year.

Forget the Lessons;
What Firm Was It?

   This whistle-blower has his limits. 

   A <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> public-relations executive, <PERSON>Don Rosendale</PERSON>, told readers of <DATE>last Sunday</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>New York Times Magazine</ORGANIZATION> about the grim aftermath of his discovering financial irregularities at a former employer. 
Instead of being congratulated for "stanching a torrent of cash pouring from a corporation that could ill afford to lose it," <PERSON>Mr. Rosendale</PERSON> was forced out from his vice presidency. 
"The path I chose was brutal on my family and cost me tens of thousands in lost income," he wrote. 

   Which company allegedly forced out <PERSON>Mr. Rosendale</PERSON>? 
He won't say. 
"It doesn't matter which company was involved," <PERSON>Mr. Rosendale</PERSON> says. 
"What was important was my observations and reactions and the value they may have to others faced with the choice of to whistle-blow or not." 

   Still, <PERSON>Mr. Rosendale</PERSON> will say that he has only worked for <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Norton Simon Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AMF Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Norton Simon</PERSON> has, after several mergers, become part of <ORGANIZATION>BCI Holdings Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 
"I never heard of him," a <ORGANIZATION>BCI</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says of <PERSON>Mr. Rosendale</PERSON>. 
A <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says, "I have no idea whether it's <ORGANIZATION>TWA</ORGANIZATION>." 
<ORGANIZATION>AMF</ORGANIZATION> now is a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Minstar Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>; its attorney hadn't any comment. 
And <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo</ORGANIZATION> says that <PERSON>Mr. Rosendale</PERSON> was never a vice president of the firm, and therefore he wasn't writing about <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo</ORGANIZATION>. 

   When Good Is Bad
   Most companies want to hide their bad news. 
<ORGANIZATION>Suzuki of America Automotive Corp.</ORGANIZATION> apparently wants to hide the good. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales arm of Japanese auto maker <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION> told reporters last week that it won't give out monthly sales figures "for the forseeable future." 
Companies routinely release these numbers for use by the press, government and interested customers, dealers and other firms. 

   Suzuki would only say that it doesn't "want our potential competition to measure the level of consumer interest" in the Samurai -- the company's inexpensive, four-wheel-drive Jeep-like vehicle. 

   But <PERSON>John Hammond</PERSON>, an auto-industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION>J. D. Power and Associates</ORGANIZATION>, has a theory. 
He thinks Suzuki may feel Samurai sales -- which rose more than <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> for the first four months of this year from the year earlier -- have been too good. 
He says several foreign companies plan to sell Samurai-like vehicles in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> doesn't "want people to understand the market potential for these vehicles." 

   What a Perk! 

   <ORGANIZATION>Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shareholders get benefits that other shareholders can only dream about. 

   At its recent annual meeting, <ORGANIZATION>Occidental</ORGANIZATION> promised to rebate <MONEY>$10</MONEY> to each shareholder who buys a copy of <ORGANIZATION>Armand Hammer</ORGANIZATION>'s recently published autobiography. 
Coupons for the rebates were distributed at a large booth plastered with accolades for the venerable chairman and chief executive officer's book, which lists for <MONEY>$22.95</MONEY>. 

   "We did it for shareholder interest," says a company spokesman. 
And indeed shareholders have a right to be interested. 
<ORGANIZATION>Occidental</ORGANIZATION> already has committed more than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> to publish the autobiography and a companion publication, a glossy collection of photos of Dr. Hammer. 

   What Price Glory:
   To hear People magazine tell it, <PERSON>Lynn Armandt</PERSON> was hounded by reporters until she had to tell all to People. 
The "story would never be laid to rest and my life would never return to normal until I made a statement," <PERSON>Ms. Armandt</PERSON> explains in People's current cover story, "Chronicle of a Ruinous Affair." 

   <PERSON>Ms. Armandt</PERSON>, of course, was <PERSON>Donna Rice</PERSON>'s companion on the now infamous weekends on the yacht <ORGANIZATION>Monkey Business</ORGANIZATION> and in <PERSON>Gary Hart</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> townhouse. 
Her article fails to mention, however, another small reason she may have broken her silence -- and why she chose People as the forum in which to do it. 
That is: People paid her <MONEY>$125,000</MONEY> for the interview on which the story was based, according to People staffers. (That's a lot, but less than the <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> cited by <PERSON>Donna Rice</PERSON>'s lawyer. 
A spokeswoman for <PERSON>Ms. Rice</PERSON> says that the <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> was "speculation.") 

   <PERSON>Elizabeth Wagner</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for People, declined to comment on whether <PERSON>Ms. Armandt</PERSON> had been paid at all. 
<PERSON>Ms. Armandt</PERSON>, the proprietor of a bikini boutique near <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, couldn't be reached. 

   Meanwhile, although it's still too soon to get sales figures for the issue, which went on sale at newsstands <DATE>Monday</DATE>, "the early word we're getting is that it's selling extremely well," says <PERSON>Ms. Wagner</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses Suzuki Of RICO Violations with Samurai Trucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit filed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> accused <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki
Motors Co.</ORGANIZATION> of violating federal racketeering laws by fraudulently
promoting its sporty Samurai vehicles as safe.
   The class-action suit alleged <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and the firms handling the
company's public relations and advertising routinely committed mail
and wire fraud and conspiracy to conceal the Samurai's dangers,
violating the federal Racketeering Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   The suit filed by <PERSON>Dr. Harold Kay</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Wynnewood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, on behalf
of all Samurai owners not employed by Suzuki seeks unspecified
punitive and compensatory damages from the defendants.
   Suzuki has been defending itself vehemently against a call by
<ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, for a ban
of the vehicles on the grounds that they tend to roll over in
sudden turns.
   The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION>, contended the defendants
were ``aware the vehicles were not safe but instead were by design
and construction dangerous and unsuitable for on- or off-road use
and that advertising and other sales representations were false and
misleading.''
   <PERSON>Laura Segall</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> and an employee of the
defendant public relations firm <ORGANIZATION>Rogers and Associates</ORGANIZATION>, would not
comment on the suit because she had not seen it.
   ``The bottom line we've said for the <DATE>last 10 days</DATE> is that it's
safe and stable,'' <PERSON>Ms. Segall</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>June 2</DATE> that the <MONEY>$8,500</MONEY> Samurai was the
first car out of 349 it had tested in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> to roll over
during a routine accident-avoidance test, in which cars swerve to
avoid a road obstacle.
   Suzuki said 300-pound outriggers attached to the trucks to
prevent them from rolling over completely during the tests had
contributed to the results. The company also partially blamed the
driver's actions for causing the vehicle to tip up on two wheels
during the test.
   Suzuki says the Samurai was tested thoroughly for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> in <DATE>November 1985</DATE>. Suzuki sold 154,675 Samurais through <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The lawsuit cites <ORGANIZATION>National Traffic Highway Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION>
figures indicating at least 44 Samurai rollover accidents resulted
in at least 53 injuries and 16 deaths.
   In addition to the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION> claims, the suit cites the
Center for Auto Safety's <DATE>February</DATE> petition to the federal
government to order a Samurai recall.
   <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Motors Co</ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp</ORGANIZATION>, of
<LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Rogers and Associates</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; and
Keye-Donna-Pearlstein, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> advertising firm, are named as
defendants.

4539 1795): "Nixon: A Statesman With Strategic Insight"] 
  [Text] At <DATE>2108</DATE> on 22 <DATE>April 1994</DATE>, <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, a 
contemporary <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> statesman with deep strategic insight and a 
former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President, passed away at <ORGANIZATION>New York Hospital</ORGANIZATION>--<ORGANIZATION>Cornell 
Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, after suffering a stroke. President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 
announced the news in person at the <ORGANIZATION>White House Rose Garden</ORGANIZATION> two 
hours later, and ordered that flags over the whole country 
should fly at half-mast for 30 days to express mourning. 
  <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> was born on 9 <DATE>January 1913</DATE> in <LOCATION>Yorba Linda</LOCATION>, a 
small town near <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. He graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Duke 
University Law School</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1937</DATE>. During World War II, he served 
in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> and was sent on missions in the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> 
region. 
  From <DATE>1946</DATE> onward, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> held the office of representative 
and 
senator, ran for governor, and was twice nominated Republican 
presidential candidate. For eight years, from <DATE>1952</DATE> to <DATE>1960</DATE>, 
<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> held the post of vice president under <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>. He ran 
for president in <DATE>1960</DATE>, but was narrowly defeated by the Democrat 
candidate <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION>. 
  In <DATE>1968</DATE>, he was elected 37th <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president. He was 
reelected president in <DATE>1972</DATE>, but was forced to resign and leave 
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1974</DATE> because of his involvement in the 
"Watergate Affair." 
  During his six-year presidency, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> fully displayed his 
deep insight as an international strategist and his courage and 
resourcefulness as a statesman. His historic visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>1972</DATE> must be the most eye-catching event. In <DATE>February 1972</DATE>, he 
and Premier <PERSON>Zhou Enlai</PERSON> signed a joint communique in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>, 
thus opening the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. 
  <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> had great respect for <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON>. Addressing a banquet 
during his first visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, he said: "Chairman Mao once 
wrote: `So many deeds brook no delay! The globe spins on, and 
time will not stay. Ten thousand years would be too long; let 
us seize the hour, and seize the day.' Now it is time for us to 
seize the hour, and it is time for our peoples to scale new 
heights." 
  After that, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> many times. In the last book 
he wrote, he said: "Today, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s economic power makes <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it will 
make them rude [wu li 2477 4409] [<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s original wording is 
"irrelevant"]. Within two decades, it will make them laughable. 
By then the Chinese may threaten to withhold <ORGANIZATION>MFN</ORGANIZATION> status from the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." 
  The "Watergate Affair" occurred in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> when 
<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> was playing an influential role in the international 
arena. So he became the first incumbent president in history to 
resign during his term of office. This was no doubt a 
formidable blow to <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>. 
  However, step by step he finally returned to the political 
arena. In <DATE>February 1976</DATE>, he revisited <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as an ordinary 
citizen. In <DATE>1977</DATE>, he was interviewed by television reporters. 
In <DATE>1978</DATE>, he started writing his memoirs. In <DATE>1981</DATE>, he attended 
the funeral of assassinated Egyptian President <PERSON>Sadat</PERSON>, in the 
capacity of a member of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegation. This was the first 
time he had attended an international function in an official 
capacity since leaving the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. In the last few years, 
he paid special attention to international developments. Less 
than a month before his death, he braved severe cold to visit 
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. 
  Several days before he was hospitalized, he received a copy 
of his last work, "After Peace," and he planned to read it over 
once again. Even before he fell ill, he was writing a speech 
which he was to deliver to raise funds for the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>. 
  <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s death has shocked the world. Many national leaders, 
including Chinese leaders, have sent messages of condolence, 
praising this statesman's strategic insight and political 
courage. 
  Four living former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presidents were highly appreciative 
of <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s political life. <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> said: "<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> was, if 
not the best, at least one of the best presidents in terms of 
foreign policy." <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> said: "His accomplishments in 
foreign policy will reserve him a high standing in history." 
<PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> said: "His historic visits to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the 
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> paved the way for <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON>'s visit in person 
to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>; and for the normalization of 
Sino-U.S.-USSR relations as well." <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> said: "The 
difficulties he was faced with during his presidency may have 
shortened his term of office. But what we must remember are the 
many outstanding achievements he scored in both domestic and 
foreign affairs." 
  Former <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger</ORGANIZATION> had the following 
comments: <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> was in fact an idealist, but at the same time 
he was also a realist. He believed that idealism does not 
hinder, but rather, indeed, needs an understanding of the world 
with its true face. The analysis that lets ideals serve the 
world rendered him a man always full of vitality. 
  From 27 <DATE>April</DATE>, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> will forever rest at his place of 
birth, 
<PERSON>Yorba Linda</PERSON>. Four years ago, in the same place, when attending 
the inaugural ceremony for a library named after him, he 
summarized his philosophy of life as follows: "Failure is 
certainly sorrowful, but the greatest sorrow is the absence of 
both victory and failure in one's life."

   Critics of the <ORGANIZATION>Suzuki Samurai</ORGANIZATION> have failed to
demonstrate the sport-utility vehicle has an excessive tendency to
roll over, federal regulators said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in denying a recall
petition.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> did, however,
begin proceedings to establish standards to protect drivers of all
light-duty vehicles ``against unreasonable risk of rollover.''
   Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine,
called for a ban on the Samurai in <DATE>June</DATE>, saying the vehicle
``literally trips over its own feet.''
   More than 150,000 of the vehicles have been sold in th <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> rejected a petition by the Center for <ORGANIZATION>Auto Safety</ORGANIZATION>, a
public-interest group often at odds with the auto industry and its
regulators, asking for a safety recall of the Samurai.
   ``The rollover crash involvement of the Samurai appears to be
within the range of most other light utility vehicles,'' the agency
said. ``Rollovers where they have occurred often appear to have
been influenced by adverse driver and environmental factors, such
as high-risk driving maneuvers, drinking, low ambient light and
lack of driver familiarity (with) either the vehicle or the road.''
   The Samurai's rollover rate, based on a study of <DATE>1986</DATE>- and
1987-model vehicles, was six per 100,000 vehicles, <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> said. The
<ORGANIZATION>Ford Bronco II</ORGANIZATION>, by comparison, had a rollover rate of about 19 per
100,000 vehicles. The <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> S-10 Blazer and S-15 <PERSON>Jimmy</PERSON> had
a rollover rate identical to the Samurai's.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese automaker's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
subsidiary, said it ``claimed victory in its defense of the
4-wheel-drive Suzuki Samurai.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>'s decision ``supports claims the Samurai is safe and
should put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the
vehicle,'' <PERSON>Suzuki</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. It said it was pleased
``that the unfounded and inaccurate accusations about the Samurai
made by so-called consumer groups did not color <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>'s judgement
on this matter.''
   The Center for <ORGANIZATION>Auto Safety</ORGANIZATION> said it would file a petition asking
<ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its decision.
   ``Despite 113 rollovers, 120 injuries and 25 deaths, <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION>
refuses to order a recall because it finds other utility vehicles
... are also hazardous,'' the center said. ``If this were the law,
then the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> would refuse to prosecute one mass
murderer because there are other mass murderers.''
   A telephone recording said <ORGANIZATION>Consumer Union</ORGANIZATION>'s offices in <LOCATION>Mount
Vernon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, were closed.
   The highway safety agency granted a petition by the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers
Union</ORGANIZATION> to start research aimed at drafting regulations to guard
against rollovers.
   The petition ``does not purport to isolate a single cause of
rollover,'' <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> said. ``In fact, it acknowledges that there are
`factors other than a vehicle's stability factor (which) play a
role in rollover causation.'''
   The agency listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it
had completed or planned to complete.
   <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> cautioned that granting the <ORGANIZATION>Consumers Union</ORGANIZATION>'s petition
``does not necessarily mean that a rule will be issued.''

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp.'s top manufacturing
executive is leaving the company after prolonged friction
with the man who is most likely to succeed Lee A. Iacocca as
the auto maker's chairman.
   Richard E. Dauch, 48 years old, who led improvements in
Chrysler's assembly operations, is departing after a
difficult relationship with Chrysler President Robert A.
Lutz. Mr. Lutz, age 59, is campaigning hard to succeed Mr.
Iacocca, and Mr. Dauch's departure is a sign that Mr. Lutz's
position inside the company is gathering strength. Mr.
Iacocca has never publicly stated his retirement plans, but
many at Chrysler expect him to retire sometime next year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> also said it is reorganizing its <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION> auto
parts subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION>'s engine, transmission and auto
trim businesses are being blended into <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s
manufacturing operations, leaving <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION> with businesses
that <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> has been trying to sell or run with outside
partners.
   <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> has been <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president in
charge of manufacturing for the past six years. Many of his
duties, but not his corporate rank, will go to <PERSON>Dennis K.
Pawley</PERSON> who has been with <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> for two years. <PERSON>Mr. Pawley</PERSON>
previously was at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda Motor Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> factory in
Flat Rock, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, and before that he ran a <ORGANIZATION>General Motors
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> assembly plant. <PERSON>Mr. Pawley</PERSON> will become vice president
of manufacturing for <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> leaves on <DATE>May
31</DATE>.
   A former football player at <ORGANIZATION>Purdue University</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON>
conducted business with a rah-rah tone and an iron handshake
kept firm by the frequent use of grip-building exercise
devices during meetings. When <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> jumped to <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1980</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen AG</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operations, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> was
struggling to avoid insolvency and improve the quality of its
products. In his first autobiography, <PERSON>Mr. Iacocca</PERSON> credited
<PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> with helping to implement changes that "brought
integrity to our manufacturing system."
   <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> had rapport with blue-collar workers, and was
instrumental in sharply boosting productivity and quality at
the Jeep assembly plant in <LOCATION>Toledo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, after <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>
purchased <ORGANIZATION>American Motors Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   His style earned him the nickname of "Coach," but it
wasn't always used with respect. While many of <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON>'s
subordinates responded to his aggressive methods, with many
of them following him in jobs, several in <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s
executive ranks found them irritating.
   One was <PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON>, the heir-apparent, whose strained
relationship with <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> stood in sharp contrast to the
manufacturing chief's close ties to <PERSON>Mr. Iacocca</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON>
hinted at the situation in a telephone interview yesterday by
saying, "I have immense respect for <PERSON>Mr. Iacocca</PERSON>, but there is
an end of an era coming and it is time to move on."
   <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> declined to say what he'll do after leaving
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>. Rumors have surfaced that he may take a job with
<ORGANIZATION>TRW Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s automotive operations. However, a <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> spokesman
said the speculation is "unequivocally not true."
   <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> said he'd been trying to expand his
responsibilities inside <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> for the <DATE>past two years</DATE>, but
was repeatedly rebuffed. The two executives that preceded him
as the head of manufacturing had seats on <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s board,
but the company never made <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> a director.
   <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON>'s opportunities seemed particularly limited as
<PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON> climbed the auto maker's ranks. A former executive
vice president with <ORGANIZATION>Ford Motor Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON> found his own
advancement there blocked and jumped to <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> five years
ago. Since then, he has made no secret of his ambition to
eventually run the company, and has moved to the forefront as
other, higher-ranking contenders have departed.
   The resignation of <PERSON>Mr. Dauch</PERSON> is only the latest sign that
<PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON> is confident that he's closer than ever to succeed
<PERSON>Mr. Iacocca</PERSON>. One sign of the developing pecking order:
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s proxy report, which is scheduled to be released
<DATE>today</DATE> -- is expected to show that <PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON>'s compensation is
higher than that of <PERSON>Robert S. Miller Jr.</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s
49-year-old vice chairman, and second only to <PERSON>Mr. Iacocca</PERSON>'s.
   Also, <PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON> isn't being shy about insisting that his
No. 2 status be recognized. When the company's just-released
annual report listed his name beneath <PERSON>Mr. Miller</PERSON>'s, <PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON>
was said to have expressed indignation. And <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>
underlings who send memos to both men are told that it's
politically correct to list <PERSON>Mr. Lutz</PERSON>'s name first.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION> move formalizes steps <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> has recently
taken to shed assets and find joint venture partners in order
to relieve its cost burden. Chrysler officials, however,
insisted that the changes aren't an effort to dismantle
<ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION>. An attempt to sell all of <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION> three years ago
met fierce union resistance.
   Altogether, <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION> had revenue of <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY> last year.
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> has started seeking buyers for at least three of
<ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiaries. Until they are sold, each of the
three will stay under the <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION> umbrella, which comprises
the electronics, wiring harness, glass and plastics
divisions. The reorganization also means that <ORGANIZATION>Acustar</ORGANIZATION>'s
finance, legal and production control operations will be
handled by the parent company.
