<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell over parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> today, while fair weather
prevailed across much of the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast calls for rain over the <ORGANIZATION>Upper and Lower

<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. Rain also fell over the <LOCATION>northern Plains</LOCATION> and
the southern Rockies.
   Storms over the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Panhandle</ORGANIZATION> spawned a tornado and produced
golf ball- size hail south of the town of <ORGANIZATION>McLean</ORGANIZATION>.
   Forecasters said more severe weather was likely today in
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> after a tornado caused extensive property damage in
<LOCATION>Shattuck</LOCATION>.
   Fair skies prevailed from the <LOCATION>Southeastern</LOCATION> states into the <LOCATION>Ohio
Valley</LOCATION> and the mid-Atlantic coast.
   The high temperature for the nation <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was 94 at <LOCATION>Presidio</LOCATION>,

<TEXT>
   A blast of frigid air continued to move through the nation's
midsection today, as thunderstorms were pushing out the warm
weather that the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> has had since the <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
   Tornadoes in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Carolinas</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> caused hundreds of injuries and many deaths <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Wintery weather swept into <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, bringing snow that put a
chill on the opening day of deer season and was a factor in an auto
accident in which four teen-agers were killed.
   Temperatures early <TIME>this morning</TIME> fell to freezing in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION>, 30 in <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION> and 33 in <LOCATION>Decatur</LOCATION> as a light snow dusted
central <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, temperatures dipped into the teens and single
digits from eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> through the <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION> to northwestern
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> by <TIME>early evening</TIME>. Winds gusting to 40 mph produced wind
chill readings colder than 25 degrees below zero.
   There were dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds in
<LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, while thunderstorms
produced heavy rain across parts of the <LOCATION>Ohio Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and
the central <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION> states.
   In <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, thunderstorms produced an inch of rain in half an hour
in <LOCATION>Fairfield</LOCATION>, 1.75 inches of rain in 20 minutes at <LOCATION>Wayne</LOCATION>, and 1.7
inches of rain in 20 minutes at <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION>.
   Snow fell across the upper <LOCATION>Mississippi Valley</LOCATION> and western
sections of the <LOCATION>Great Lakes</LOCATION> region <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, with heavy snow
today along the southern shore of Lake Superior and <LOCATION>Lake Michigan</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rain Falls in East, Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell in the eastern half of the nation and in the <LOCATION>Upper
Plains</LOCATION> <DATE>early today</DATE>, flooding portions of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   Rain and showers extended from <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION>Casper</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash</LOCATION>. Thunderstorms looped
down from <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> coast and up to <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, wet, stormy weather advanced across the southeastern
quarter of the nation, spinning off at least four tornados.
Lightning killed one person in <LOCATION>Galveston Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Heavy rain overnight flooded parts of eastern and south-central
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, leaving many roads impassable.
   Floodwaters up to 6 feet deep swamped <LOCATION>Murray City</LOCATION>, forcing the
evacuation of at least 50 residents, authorities said. The flooding
shoved one building off its foundations, caved in a hillside and
swept equipment out of a firehouse.
   ``The streets are a mess. In <DATE>1968</DATE> we had a flood, but it was
nothing like this,'' said firefighter <PERSON>Bob Koon</PERSON>. ``We got the trucks
out, but a lot of the other stuff is gone.''
   Tornadoes touched down near <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION>Houma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>,
and west of <LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va</LOCATION>.
   At <LOCATION>Morehead</LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, a twister overturned several
light aircraft and a small hangar at <LOCATION>Morehead-Rowan County Airport</LOCATION>
and apparently carried off two other planes, state police said. It

<HEAD>Rain Spreads Across East; Clear and Cooler Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> residents awakened to a rainy Thanksgiving
Day, with the precipitation expected to spread as far south as
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, while most of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> basked in clear but
cooler weather.
   The rain, spreading from the Great Lakes region, along the
inland edges of several <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> states and into the South, was
caused by an unusually cold front of air from the north colliding

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo ripped into <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> today and rain and
thunderstorms that spun off of the storm were scattered across much
of the eastern <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, while an arctic cold front bore down
on the <ORGANIZATION>Great Lakes</ORGANIZATION>.
   Skies were clear over most of the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   Showers and thundershowers were reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf
Coast</ORGANIZATION> north into the <LOCATION>Ohio River Valley</LOCATION> and into <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>.
Thunderstorms also struck the lower <LOCATION>Rio Grande Valley</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   The Great Lakes region was expected to usher in autumn <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
with a chill. A cold front approaching the area today could drop the
mercury 20 degrees overnight, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather
Service</ORGANIZATION>, and frost is likely.
   Hurricane winds over 100 mph knocked out power to the entire city
of <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> and cracked the roof at <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>. The storm
ripped off roofs and snapped and uprooted trees in parts of the
state.
   Temperatures elsewhere <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> climbed into the 90s
in much of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the 80s across the south, the 90s in southern

   Freezing temperatures settled on the Northern states and the
<LOCATION>Rockies</LOCATION> <TIME>this morning</TIME> after several days of record high temperatures
around the country.
   A cold air mass over <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> was nosing its way into <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> today, and sharply colder temperatures were expected
by week's end in much of the nation east of the Rockies.
   Warm and moist air ahead of the arctic mass was expected to
bring severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and even tornadoes from
the <LOCATION>Mississippi Valley</LOCATION> into the Southeast.
   Snowfall totals of 3 to 8 inches were expected today in
<LOCATION>northwest Wisconsin</LOCATION>, with winds blowing and drifting the snow. More
than a foot of snow was possible in upper <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing this morning across the
<LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION> and 40 mph winds produced wind chill readings of 15 to 35
degrees below zero.
   Light snow fell <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> over <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION>North
Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>northwest Wisconsin</LOCATION>, and parts of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. Up to 4{ inches
of new snow blanketed some ski areas, with winds of up to 50 mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the lower and
middle <LOCATION>Mississippi Valley</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Temperatures warmed above 70 degrees <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> across the <LOCATION>Atlantic
Coast</LOCATION>, with highs in the 80s across <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Nineteen cities _ including <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Tulsa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> _ reported new record high temperatures for the
date.
   Temperatures also warmed into the 70s and 80s in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION>
but were in the 30s across much of the <LOCATION>northern Plains</LOCATION>, the upper

<TEXT>
   Unseasonably warm weather swept across the eastern third of the
nation today, breaking records set nearly 100 years ago, and snow
fell in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   A strong cold front moving eastward pushed rain ahead of it and
brought cold in its wake.
   Rain fell in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>.
   Just after <TIME>midnight</TIME> <LOCATION>Buffalo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, hit 70 degrees, breaking the
old record for the date by 2 degrees. That record was established
94 years ago.
   The forecast in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> called for temperatures to climb
well into the 60s and likely top 70 degrees in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and as
far north as <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Ohio Valley</LOCATION> had temperatures in the high 60s <DATE>today</DATE>, and
forecasters said temperatures would plunge about 20 degrees as the
day progressed.
   In the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, temperatures dropped in the 20s. Snow was
falling today in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>.
   Snow also fell in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>.
   Rain was likely in the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rain Subsiding in Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   After a final spell of rain in the <ORGANIZATION>Cascade Range</ORGANIZATION> today, clearing
skies and colder temperatures were expected to ease flooding that
caused property damage and prompted evacuations in <LOCATION>northwest
Washington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>British Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Days of heavy rains and melting snow in the mountains caused
rivers and streams to overflow, and flood warnings remained in
effect <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
   The worst property damage was along the <LOCATION>Nooksack River</LOCATION> east of
<LOCATION>Bellingham</LOCATION>, where a house and two trailers, a highway bridge and a
minor railroad span were swept away.
   Rain slackened overnight <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather
Service</ORGANIZATION> said heavy rains in the central Cascade mountains today
could raise river levels again.
   High winds, meanwhile, continued along the eastern slopes of the
<LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, winds were 35 to 50 mph,
with gusts of more than 100 mph along the front range west of
<LOCATION>Choteau</LOCATION>.
   Rain showers extended from the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. In
the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> showers were also scattered across <LOCATION>New York state</LOCATION>,
southern <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>.
   Thunderstorms were over extreme southeastern <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>. A
thunderstorm at <LOCATION>Nantucket Island</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> produced wind
gusts to 58 mph.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation <DATE>Friday</DATE>, with
fair skies in much of the southern and western <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   But high temperatures were only in the 30s in the upper
<LOCATION>Mississippi Valley</LOCATION> and the upper Great Lakes region.
   Temperatures warmed into the 60s and 70s <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>northern
Plains</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION> and into the 80s across much of
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> and across the <LOCATION>Florida
Peninsula</LOCATION>. Temperatures soared into the 80s and 90s in the
southwestern deserts.
   The high <DATE>Friday</DATE> was 96 degrees at Thermal and <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
