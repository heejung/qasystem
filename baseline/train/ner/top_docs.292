   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP.</ORGANIZATION>, which sold its television interests in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> just <DATE>two weeks ago</DATE> so it could take over the country's biggest media company, is returning to the television business there. 

   Transactions announced yesterday would give <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> a <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> holding in television stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> -- the country's two biggest cities -- and in the smaller cities of <LOCATION>Lismore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Coffs Harbor</LOCATION>. 

   Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> sold its television stations in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, plus some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording concern, to <ORGANIZATION>Westfield Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for the equivalent of <MONEY>$561.3 million</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION>, in turn, plans to sell the media interests to a company controlled by its <ORGANIZATION>Northern Star Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Northern Star plans to put its current television operations in <LOCATION>Lismore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Coffs Harbor</LOCATION> into this unit, keep a <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> stake, and sell <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of the unit to <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for an undisclosed sum. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.</ORGANIZATION> unit will "enjoy a close association" with <ORGANIZATION>Northern Star</ORGANIZATION>'s television company. 

   In order to buy <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> was forced to sell his television stations in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> because foreigners aren't allowed to own more than <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of an Australian television station. 
<ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest media group, owned television and radio stations, as well as newspapers and magazines.

   <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s third national commercial-television network was formed when <ORGANIZATION>QINTEX LTD.</ORGANIZATION> acquired TV stations in the nation's three biggest cities from <ORGANIZATION>JOHN FAIRFAX LTD.</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>780 million Australian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$554 million</MONEY>). 

   <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest publishers, will retain an interest in the network by acquiring as much as <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Qintex</ORGANIZATION>, a media, resorts and property concern, already owned some smaller TV stations. 

   The agreement, in which <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> is selling its stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, follows an accord earlier this year in which <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> sold its TV stations to <ORGANIZATION>Northern Star Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and acquired <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Northern Star</ORGANIZATION>. 
Also this year, the entrepreneur Alan Bond formed the country's first commercial network by acquiring several stations from <PERSON>Kerry Packer</PERSON>, another Australian businessman. 

   The transactions followed a liberalization of government curbs on media ownership.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: IEL sells undertaker business

<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Equity (IEL), the Australian investment group, has sold <LOCATION>Pine
Grove</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest undertaker, for ADollars 102m (USDollars 69.3m).
The buyer is <ORGANIZATION>Service Corp</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> funeral company.
<ORGANIZATION>IEL</ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION>Adsteam</ORGANIZATION> group, said the sale would yield a book
profit of about ADollars 25m, and the proceeds could be used for payments to
shareholders.
The purchase is the first outside <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Service Corp</ORGANIZATION>, estimated
to be the world's largest funeral company. It will add about ADollars 47m to
its revenue. Pine Grove controls between 13 and 16 per cent of the
Australian funeral market.
<PERSON>Mr R. Waltrip</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Service Corp</ORGANIZATION>, said the acquisition represented
the beginning of a truly global company. The deal is subject to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Foreign Investment Review Board</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>IEL</ORGANIZATION> is also in the throes of selling its <ORGANIZATION>Woolworths</ORGANIZATION> supermarket chain, which
is the subject of a planned ADollars 2.45bn public flotation.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking</ORGANIZATION>, the big Australian bank, plans to sack 12 per cent of the
staff at its head office for <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> operations, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from
<LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. Westpac currently employs 700 people at the <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> office.
The decision to make staff redundant follows a review of the bank's
operations by an independent consultant.
The review 'identified a number of activities and structures that are no
longer necessary for the current market environment and have been dispensed
with', the bank said.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Australia's banks reveal
diverse results - The ripples from Westpac's property write-offs are
spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom has an Australian bank reporting season produced such a diversity of
results. In the space of a few days, six-month results have cast <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> as
the poor relation, ANZ as the battling improver and the <ORGANIZATION>National Australia
Bank</ORGANIZATION> as a comfortable top performer.
The banks' experiences with <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s crop of failed entrepreneurs have
been well-chronicled. The big banks, including the 70 per cent federal
government-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>, were naturally the most injured by
corporate failures and falling asset values.
But the stock market did not begin to suspect until a few months ago that
one bank out of the big four had performed substantially worse than its
rivals. Its worst fears were confirmed last week when <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> reported a
thumping ADollars 2.65bn (USDollars 2bn) bad debt write-off.
That pushed <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> into the first loss in its 175-year history, a ADollars
2.3bn pre-tax deficit and forced the bank to turn to shareholders with
potentially <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest share issue, aimed at raising ADollars
1.2bn.
Worse still, it appears the bank needs the funds to avoid falling below the
<ORGANIZATION>Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s prescribed capital adequacy ratios later this year when about
ADollars 700m in future tax benefits can no longer be counted as assets for
prudential purposes.
The drama of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s losses, which mainly reflected an overhaul of its
extensive property portfolio, is likely to place the bank at a competitive
disadvantage against its peers for some time to come.
It was a drama singularly lacking from the National and <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> earnings
reports, which had a strong 'business as usual' flavour. The <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION> did however appear to react to the <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shocks by making a point
of detailing their own more modest property exposures.
The ripples have spread quickly from <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s property write-offs, with
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest home builder <ORGANIZATION>Jennings Industries</ORGANIZATION> effectively placing
itself at the mercy of its bankers earlier this week following a total
write-off of its stake in a ADollars 650m <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> property development.
Ownership of the project has reverted 100 per cent to <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, but the
<PERSON>Jennings</PERSON> write-offs, among other factors have caused its major shareholder,
<LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s biggest company <ORGANIZATION>Fletcher Challenge</ORGANIZATION>, to foreshadow a NZDollars
400m (USDollars 215m) property write-down in the current year.
And yesterday, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s second biggest life office, the <ORGANIZATION>National Mutual</ORGANIZATION>,
had the long-term rating of its finance company lowered from A1 to A3 by
<ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investor Services</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> credit rating agency.
'The oversupply of commercial real estate throughout <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> will likely
result in additional property write-downs, further affecting <ORGANIZATION>National
Mutual</ORGANIZATION>'s reserve position,' <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s analysts said.
While <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> remains <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest bank measured by total assets, the
accompanying table indicates its position is far inferior to its rivals on
almost all important counts.
Most notably, the bank's large ADollars 8.19bn problem loan portfolio - more
than the <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION> combined - poses the danger that its
write-offs will remain larger for the next few years.
The <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>'s superior position has resulted largely from its ability to
control its finance offshoot. The National was the only bank whose finance
arm was in the black for the half-year, with its Custom Credit operation
turning a ADollars 68m loss into a ADollars 6.4m profit.
Finance offshoots are where much of the big banks' problems have resided.
Witness <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s ADollars 850m capital injection into its <ORGANIZATION>Australian
Guarantee Corporation</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary which lost ADollars 719m. ANZ's <ORGANIZATION>Esanda</ORGANIZATION>
operation lost almost ADollars 34m.

FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Westpac facing new uncertainty
as MD is fired
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday
facing further uncertainty after the board fired <PERSON>Mr Frank Conroy</PERSON>, managing
director, after only 14 months in the job.
<PERSON>Mr John Uhrig</PERSON>, who took over as chairman following an earlier board
reshuffle in <DATE>October</DATE>, said a new managing director would be appointed from
outside the bank within a month.
<PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> had resigned following agreement among
directors that the bank's restructuring programme needed to be controlled by
'someone who comes fresh to the task'.
This contrasts starkly with the strong support for <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> expressed by <PERSON>Mr
Uhrig</PERSON> and the rest of the board when the bank's restructuring plan was
announced last month.
Yesterday's board meeting was the first attended by <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>, the
publishing entrepreneur, who acquired a 10 per cent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>November</DATE> through <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Press Holdings</ORGANIZATION> (ConsPress), his private
company.
Analysts said it was clear that <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> had refused to bow to pressure
from <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Al Dunlap</PERSON>, ConsPress managing director, for bigger
cuts in staffing and assets.
Similar suggestions have been made by the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest
financial institution, which owns <MONEY>15 per cent</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> and also has two
seats on the board.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, once <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest bank, has faced growing problems over the
<DATE>last two years</DATE> as a result of bad debts which culminated in a loss of
ADollars 1.56bn (USDollars 1.07bn) for the year to the end of <DATE>September</DATE>.
The bank was humiliated by the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue in
<DATE>October</DATE>, which closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving nearly 300m
unwanted shares in the hands of sub-underwriters.
Five directors resigned shortly after the rights issue debacle, including
Sir <PERSON>Eric Neal</PERSON>, chairman.
<PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON>'s frank approach to the bank's problems appeared to have won the
support of the markets, reflected in an improvement in the share price from
a low of ADollars 2.39 in <DATE>November</DATE> to ADollars 3.03 on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
However, the shares rose <MONEY>1 cent</MONEY> to ADollars 3.04 after the announcement of
<PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON>'s resignation, suggesting that investors share <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s view
that restructuring could be accelerated.
The programme announced by <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> included cutting costs and increasing
revenue by ADollars 300m this year; cutting the expenses-to-income ratio
from <MONEY>70 per cent</MONEY> to <MONEY>58 per cent</MONEY> over three years; and reducing corporate
risk assets by ADollars 10bn by <DATE>1995</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has confirmed that the cost-cutting programme could include a
reduction of up to 60 per cent in head office staff.
The bank is also reviewing its regional operations in the south <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Kmart acquires stake in
Australian grocer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES and NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KMART, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> retailer, has put itself into the forefront of the battle to
rationalise the Australian grocery industry by paying ADollars 20.5m
(USDollars 13.7m) for a 10.8 per cent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Independent Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, the
South Australian wholesaler.
<ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION>, which controls just over 20 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Coles Myer</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
biggest retailer, revealed itself yesterday as the buyer of a parcel of 3.2m
Independent shares traded at ADollars 6.45 earlier this week.
The <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION> move follows the recent purchase of a 19.9 per cent stake in
Independent by <ORGANIZATION>Davids Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, the privately-controlled Australian grocery
wholesaler. <ORGANIZATION>Foodland Associated</ORGANIZATION>, another big Australian grocery group, also
controls 18.5 per cent of Independent.
The <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION> purchase was seen yesterday by analysts as a move friendly to
<ORGANIZATION>Coles Myer</ORGANIZATION>, which has recently moved to block acquisitions in the grocery
industry which is one of its major supply sources.
Earlier this year, <PERSON>Coles</PERSON> acquired a <MONEY>15 per cent</MONEY> stake in <ORGANIZATION>QIW</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>
grocery group, helping to thwart a hostile take over attempt by <ORGANIZATION>Davids
Holdings</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices Commission</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday it would hold an
inquiry into <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of Independent shares.
At its <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> headquarters, <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION> remained tight-lipped about the share
purchase. Although the company has been putting increased emphasis on
international opportunities recently, and purchased stores in the <LOCATION>Czech
Republic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, it described the Independent stake was a
'non-strategic investment'.
Kmart declined to say whether it had discussed the share purchase with <ORGANIZATION>Coles
Myer</ORGANIZATION>.
In the context of <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest retailers in sales terms in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, the funds involved in the purchase are extremely modest. <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION>'s assets
at end-January, for example, were put at almost Dollars 19bn.

   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION>, whose takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> faces a higher offer from <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court, is likely to either sweeten his bid or negotiate with <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court to divide the assets of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest media group, analysts said. 

   Moreover, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> apparently can block <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s bid in its current form. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s bid, which is being made through his <ORGANIZATION>J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, is contingent on receiving acceptances representing <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>'s stock. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> already holds <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> of the media concern. 

   As previously reported, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> offered the equivalent of <MONEY>$8.58</MONEY> a share, or a total of <MONEY>$1.32 billion</MONEY>, converting the Australian dollar at its current rate, for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>. 
That topped an offer made earlier this month by <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> that at the current exchange rate is valued at <MONEY>$7.92</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$1.19 billion</MONEY>. 

   Both men, who are two of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s best-known takeover specialists, have failed in earlier bids for the media group, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court in <DATE>1982</DATE>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> officials said they hadn't yet decided whether to recommend the Holmes a Court bid to shareholders. 
<ORGANIZATION>J.N. Taylor Holdings</ORGANIZATION> said its bid won't proceed unless the <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> board recommends it. 
It added that any material changes in the structure or assets of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> would make its offer invalid. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> board recommended the <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> bid on the day it was announced, but only on the condition that a higher offer didn't materialize. 
Officials of <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said that they were studying the Holmes a Court offer and that it was too early to comment. 
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it would respond in a week or two. 

   But in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>David Fayle</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s company secretary, noted that the <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> holds in <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> would prevent <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court from proceeding under the <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> requirement that his bid includes, unless <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> chose to tender its stock to <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> acquired the <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> stake on <DATE>Dec. 12</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Equity Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a New Zealand-controlled investment company. 

   If <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> does sweeten his bid, analysts said, he might raise it to as much as <MONEY>$9.24</MONEY> a share. 
On the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> rose as high as <MONEY>$8.58</MONEY> -- matching <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's offer -- before closing at <MONEY>$8.51</MONEY>, up <MONEY>26.4 cents</MONEY> on the day. 
The exchange was closed yesterday for <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. 

   In addition to a cash offer, the Holmes a Court bid includes two alternatives. 
Under one, <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> holders may exchange every four of their shares for seven <ORGANIZATION>J.N. Taylor Holdings</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> convertible notes. 
Under the other, they may exchange every four shares for seven <ORGANIZATION>J.N. Taylor Holdings</ORGANIZATION> convertible preference shares. 
The preference shares are convertible into ordinary shares five years after they are issued but don't carry voting rights. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s bid also contains alternatives to his cash offer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> holders may choose to receive two <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> shares for every three <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> shares held. 
Alternatively, they can exchange every three <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> shares for two <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> five-year notes that are convertible into <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s offer marks the first time that he is willing to dilute his hold on <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to make an acquisition. 
If all the <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> holders opted for the share portion of the offer, his stake in <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> would be diluted to <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> from the current <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT>. 

   If <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s takeover succeeds, he will control about <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of daily newspaper circulation in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and, if regulators don't intervene, will have a monopoly on daily papers in several major cities. 
Although <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has legislation regulating broadcast holdings, including recently proposed laws prohibiting cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in the same market, it doesn't have any laws specifically governing print media ownership. 

   Under broadcasting rules, television stations can't be controlled by a foreign national. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Court</ORGANIZATION> already is looking at ownership of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s two stations in light of the Australian-born <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s change to American citizenship last year to comply with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media-ownership regulations. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> also will have to sell the two <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> TV stations if his takeover bid is successful, because he will own newspapers in the same market. 

   By contrast, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s Australian media interests are modest. 
They include a weekly newspaper and a television station in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, another television station in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, some radio stations, and some suburban and regional papers.

   Two large Australian banks confirmed they purchased stakes in one another's stock but denied that merger talks are under way. 

   <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> said it acquired "several parcels" of shares in rival <ORGANIZATION>Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>ANZ Bank</ORGANIZATION> said it acquired "one package" of shares in <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Trading in the two Melbourne-based banks' shares surged on the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> last week on merger rumors. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Adelaide Steamship Co.</ORGANIZATION>, an investment company that owned an estimated <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION>, <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, recently sold some of its holdings. 

   Some analysts said those sales might have sparked the cross-buying by <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some analysts say they expect <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> eventually to merge. 
There also is speculation that Sydney-based <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> could merge with government-owned <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION> if the government decides to sell it. 

   ANZ, <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> are the four dominant banks in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.

   SYDNEY -- Australian Mutual Provident Society, the biggest
insurance and investment concern in Australasia, announced a
"long-term strategic alliance" with Westpac Banking Corp.
   Among the arrangements, AMP will buy Westpac Life Ltd.,
Westpac's life insurance unit. In turn, Westpac will buy the
consumer-banking business of Chase AMP Bank Ltd., a
commercial bank owned by AMP and Chase Manhattan Bank of the
U.S. The Chase Manhattan Corp. unit eventually will acquire
full ownership of Chase AMP's wholesale banking operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exact prices haven't been set, but preliminary indications
are that the two major elements of the agreement will involve
the payment by <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> of <MONEY>200 million Australian
dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$152.2 million</MONEY>) for <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Life</ORGANIZATION> and the payment
by <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Chase AMP</ORGANIZATION> of about <MONEY>A$30 million</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Chase AMP</ORGANIZATION>'s
consumer-banking business.
   Separately, the government declined to permit AMP to
increase its shareholding in <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT>. Australian
government regulations limit shareholdings in banks to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>,
although the treasurer can give an exemption to go as high as
<PERCENT>15%</PERCENT>. AMP, a mutual concern owned by policyholders, now has a
stake of about <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> in <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>.
   The link between <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> is part of a trend for
Australian banks and insurance companies to form alliances
amid a tough, recessionary Australian market.

A Likely Delay

   The duel between <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest media company, <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, is likely to be delayed by a combination of regulators' demands and the year-end holidays. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s Christmas Eve bid, equivalent to <MONEY>$8.65</MONEY> a share, or a total of <MONEY>$1.33 billion</MONEY>, converting the Australian dollar at its current rate, was announced just before the nation's stock market closed for the rest of the week. 
It has triggered a fresh inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which has been scrutinizing the <MONEY>$7.98-a-share</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.19 billion</MONEY>, offer by <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court is thought to be more interested in the television assets of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> than its newspapers. 
Before he made the bid, he unsuccessfully approached <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> about buying <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>'s TV stations. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s bid, through his <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> unit's <ORGANIZATION>J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, won't proceed unless the <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> board recommends it. 
The board earlier recommended the <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> bid, provided a higher offer didn't emerge. 

   Both bids also are conditional on <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> acceptance. 
However, <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Equity Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a New Zealand-controlled investment concern, agreed to sell its stake of about <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> to <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s bid. 
But <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court has said he might waive the <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> condition if that stake were the only obstacle to his winning the company. 

   A <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said directors will meet "in due course" for the purposes of making a recommendation, "but such a meeting would be delayed by the difficulty of getting all the directors together during the holiday period." 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Australian Journalists Association</ORGANIZATION> has called for an independent inquiry into the bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>. 
The government, however, has signaled its reluctance to intervene in the battle. 

   Although <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s existing Australian media interests aren't as extensive as <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s, they pose potential problems under the government's recently proposed restrictions on the holding of broadcast and newspaper interests in the same market. 
It is likely <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court would have to restructure the holdings of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> if his bid is successful.

<HL> Bond Increases Stake to 11.08% Of Allied-Lyons </HL>

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> raised its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons PLC</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>11.08%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT>, and <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> said Bond's intentions appear "questionable." 

   Bond, a <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, Australia-based group that has become the world's fifth-largest brewer through acquisitions, declined to comment. 
Allied-Lyons, a big British food and drink maker, said it regarded further purchases as "unfriendly," and added that it "regrets that <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has decided to take this action without explanation of its intentions." 

   Allied-Lyons made its announcement late yesterday. 
Its shares were quoted in late <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> trading at <MONEY>468 pence</MONEY> (<MONEY>$7.88</MONEY>), up four pence. 

   The verbal jousting could signal yet another battle for control of valuable food and drink brand names. 
Alan Bond, the entrepreneur who controls about <PERCENT>53%</PERCENT> of the Australian company, has said he wants <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to be at least the No. 2 brewer in the world within five years. 

   But a takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> would be a big bite. 
The British company is valued at <MONEY>#3.41 billion</MONEY> (<MONEY>$5.74 billion</MONEY>) at its current stock price, and the company has aggressively promoted its image and operations to the public and shareholders since <ORGANIZATION>Elders IXL Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, Bond's big Australian brewing rival, made an unsuccessful bid for <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   Allied-Lyons also said yesterday that it had proposed "and brought close to conclusion" a joint venture with Bond -- which would be <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> owned by <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> by the Australian company -- to buy certain Bond brands and develop their sales in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
It didn't say what <PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON>'s response had been, or what would happen now that he had raised his holding in <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westpac running out of time to
get its act together - The difficulties still facing the troubled Australian
bank after the latest upheavals

<TEXT>
WESTPAC, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest bank, is not known for its sense of irony. But
there must have been a few wry grins in the bank's <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> headquarters on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> (NAB) announced it had completed
precautionary checks on the books of <ORGANIZATION>Bank of New Zealand</ORGANIZATION>.
The announcement confirmed <ORGANIZATION>NAB</ORGANIZATION> will proceed with its proposed NZDollars
1.48bn (Dollars 796m) acquisition of BNZ, which will propel it past <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>
as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest bank in terms of global assets. Westpac directors,
meanwhile, were wondering how many of them would have to fall on their
swords to satisfy the markets' lust for boardroom blood.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has a special place in Australian banking history as the country's
oldest bank. But it has paid a heavier price than the other leading banks
for the ill-considered dash for growth in which they indulged in the mid to
late <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s problems came to a head in <DATE>May</DATE>, when it wrote off ADollars 2.65bn
(Dollars 1.91bn) against bad debts, of which ADollars 2.1bn reflected a
revaluation of its ADollars 6.3bn property portfolio. The write-offs left
the bank with pre-tax losses of ADollars 2.2bn for the six months to <DATE>March</DATE>,
compared with profits of ADollars 313m a year earlier.
Mr <PERSON>Frank Conroy</PERSON>, managing director, expected the substantial write-off to
ease investors' fears about <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s exposure to corporate failures and the
weak property market. At the same time, <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> sought to strengthen the
bank's balance sheet by raising ADollars 1.2bn through a 3-for-10 rights
issue at ADollars 3 per share.
However, the rights issue merely compounded <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s difficulties.
Executives watched in horror as the bank's share price slid from ADollars
3.87 on the day it was announced to ADollars 2.99 on the day it closed. Not
surprisingly, the issue fell ADollars 880m short of target after investors
took up rights to only 111m of 405m shares on offer, leaving <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston</ORGANIZATION>
and its sub-underwriters to take up the shortfall.
On a wider front, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has been taking a public relations beating as
Australian newspapers and television stations have relentlessly pursued
allegations of fraud by bank officials in connection with a controversial
foreign exchange loans scheme which left many borrowers heavily indebted
after the Australian dollar collapsed in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
Westpac strongly denies criminal activity by any of its staff in relation to
foreign loans. But the bank has also been identified by the <ORGANIZATION>New South Wales
Independent Commission Against Corruption</ORGANIZATION> as one of a number of banks and
insurance companies which illegally trafficked in confidential government
information on customers.
Against this background, <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> admitted earlier this week that the bank
was aware of concern among institutional investors about the composition of
the board. But until mid-morning yesterday, both <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> and Sir <PERSON>Eric
Neal</PERSON>, chairman, resolutely refused to say whether resignations could be
expected.
Sir <PERSON>Eric</PERSON>, deputy chairman since <DATE>1987</DATE> and chairman since <DATE>1990</DATE>, was the main
target for a dissident shareholders' group led by <PERSON>Mr Gavin Solomon</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
solicitor, which has gained credibility as <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s problems have worsened.
The group also sought the departure of Sir <PERSON>Neil Currie</PERSON>, a director since
<DATE>1987</DATE> and deputy chairman since <DATE>1991</DATE>, and several other long-serving
directors. However, there was no pressure for the departure of <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON>.
In the event, the board surprised the markets by announcing the resignation
of five directors, a third of the total, including both Sir <PERSON>Eric</PERSON> and Sir
<PERSON>Neil</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares rose <MONEY>1 cent</MONEY> on the announcement, to close at ADollars 2.86.
However, few observers expect a significant improvement in the short term
because of the large volume of shares overhanging the market and continuing
worries about the bank's exposure to the deteriorating commercial property
market.
<PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> has forecast improved profits in the <DATE>second half</DATE>, and conceded
that the markets will need to see at least three successive good half-year
results from <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> before the crisis of confidence in the bank can be said
to be over. However, analysts say there is still a chance that <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> may
be forced into further large write-offs.
<PERSON>Mr Scott Hawker</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, says: 'There is a
view emerging that while <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> was conservative in <DATE>May</DATE> when it made those
big write-offs, market conditions have undoubtedly deteriorated since then.
'There is at least a chance (of further major write-offs) because they will
look very bad, having said they have taken all the pain, if ANZ or another
bank comes out with further write-offs. At the least, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s solid level
of provisioning will have to continue. There is little room for them to cut
back.'
<PERSON>Mr John Uhrig</PERSON>, who replaces Sir <PERSON>Eric</PERSON> as chairman, had little to say about
future strategy yesterday, preferring to concentrate his fire on the media,
which many <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> officials blame for precipitating the crisis. <PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON>
also had no answer to awkward questions about why other long-serving
directors were remaining on the board.
However, <PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON> has built a solid reputation as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>CRA</ORGANIZATION>, the
largely British-owned mining group, and the consensus among analysts was
that he and <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> should be able to convince investors that enough blood
has been shed to demonstrate the board's contrition for past mistakes.
That will not be good enough for <PERSON>Mr Solomon</PERSON>, who made clear that he would
continue his campaign for a vote on the continued incumbency of all
directors at the next annual meeting, due in <DATE>January</DATE>. However, he is
unlikely to persuade the institutions who own most of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s shares to
support a further upheaval.
The only other bright spot for <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> is that federal government
regulations prevent any other financial institution mounting a takeover
attempt to take advantage of its weakness. But that will change if, as
expected, the conservative opposition parties win the next federal election,
due by mid-1993.
If that happens, <ORGANIZATION>NAB</ORGANIZATION> may be sorely tempted to double its asset base by
bidding for its erstwhile big brother. Which gives <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> about a year to
get its house in order.

   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION>'s takeover offer for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest media group, encountered potential obstacles from another possible bidder and the Australian government. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> directors met with the Australian takeover specialist <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court on <DATE>Friday</DATE> amid speculation that he would launch a counteroffer, even through the board of the Melbourne-based media group <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> approved a bid, equivalent to <MONEY>$1.18 billion</MONEY>, by <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Meanwhile, the government's <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices Commission</ORGANIZATION> said it is investigating the ramifications of a successful takeover by <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>, which would make <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> by far the largest media group in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Bob McComas</PERSON>, the commission chairman, said that if the bid succeeds, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> may have to sell some of his newspaper interests in the states of <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> has said he will sell <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> television stations in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> to satisfy government regulations if his bid succeeds. 

   But the threat of an offer by <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court seems the more formidable opposition to <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, who failed in a <DATE>1982</DATE> takeover effort for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>, said the talks were preliminary and would continue. 
He wouldn't rule out a counteroffer but said he agreed with the board to keep the talks confidential. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, who is known for his long-runnning pursuit of <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest concern, recently sold a stake in <ORGANIZATION>USX Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> after fueling heavy trading in the company's shares. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, "We'd heard rumors of an impending offer and we'll have to see what our position will be if the offer materializes." 
He noted that while the <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> board accepted <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s bid, the acceptance was contingent on no better offer for the company coming forward. 

   In another development, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Equity Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian company that holds an <PERCENT>11.6%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s offer of <MONEY>$7.85</MONEY> a share appeared inadequate. 
Industrial Equity has also been considered a possible contender for the company. 

   <PERSON>Ron Brierly</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Equity</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said: "A bid is always an option, but we are not going to rush into an offer of that magnitude." 

   Separately, in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said it is considering downgrading its Ba-2 ratings on two <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> issues, citing the bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>. 
One issue under review is <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> of exchangeable redeemable preference shares of <ORGANIZATION>Newscorp Finance N.V.</ORGANIZATION> 
The other is the increasing-rate exchangeable guaranteed preferred stock of <ORGANIZATION>Fox Television Stations Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Moody's</ORGANIZATION> is examining the mix of debt and equity that would be used to make the acquisition, as well as the company's plan to sell assets for regulatory reasons. 

   <PERSON>Richard Sarazen</PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, said the company believes a downgrading isn't in order. 
He noted that the purchase would be made with stock and notes convertible into <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stock. 
"This transaction will be funded in the final analysis with equity, and should in fact strengthen the company rather than weaken it," he said.

   <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, attempting to establish a second television network in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, offered the equivalent of <MONEY>$239.8 million</MONEY> for the television interests of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> paid <MONEY>$666.1 million</MONEY> for the television operations of privately owned <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, making it the first company to set up a network covering most major Australian cities. 

   <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>'s offer is the second it has made to <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, which is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest media company, with interests in newspapers, magazines, television and radio. 
Fairfax earlier offered <MONEY>$1.67 billion</MONEY> for all of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, in competition with <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which is offering <MONEY>$1.53 billion</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has made provisional agreements to sell <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s television stations if its bid succeeds. 

   The separate <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> offer for the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> television stations was viewed by analysts as an attempt by <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> to ensure that it comes out of the battle with at least some of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s assets. 

   The moves have been sparked in part by a proposed liberalization in government regulations that up to now have restricted a single company from owning more than two television stations. 
The government proposes instead to limit the ability of companies to own both newspaper and television operations in any major city. 
The proposals haven't been approved by parliament and might be changed before they become law. 

   <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, which already owns television stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION> as well as newspapers and magazines in several states, said it is prepared to pay <MONEY>$179.8 million</MONEY> for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station and <MONEY>$59.9 million</MONEY> for its <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> station. 
As an alternative to the offer for the <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> station, <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> said it would pay <MONEY>$76.6 million</MONEY> for that station plus <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> radio operations in the states of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON>John Dahlsen</PERSON>, said after the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> offer was received that the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> board decided to call for tenders for its radio and television operations, and that an additional offer from a company he didn't identify already had been received for the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> station. 

   Fairfax's group general manager, <PERSON>G.J. Gardiner</PERSON>, said the company would be prepared to reconsider its offers for the television operations if other companies make higher bids.

   <ORGANIZATION>Adelaide Steamship Co.</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian investment and trading concern, joined the fight over the assets of financier <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s former corporate empire. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Adelaide Steamship</ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> late yesterday it has acquired an <PERCENT>11.4%</PERCENT> holding in <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> through stock-market purchases. 
It didn't disclose the price it paid or the reasons for the investment, and company officials weren't available for comment. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> is <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT>-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's former flagship that is the target of a takeover bid by Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Holdings bought <PERCENT>19.9%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> and last month announced it was bidding for the rest of the company, except for a <PERCENT>19.9%</PERCENT> stake held by the <ORGANIZATION>State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia</ORGANIZATION>. 
It estimated the cost of the offer at <MONEY>$520 million Australian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$417 million</MONEY>). 

   Also last month, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> disclosed plans to merge <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> companies to form <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s second-biggest stock-exchange-listed company, which could control assets of more than <MONEY>A$11 billion</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$8.82 billion</MONEY>). 

   Early yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it has acquired slightly more than <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>, mainly through stock-market purchases, and had won two seats on the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> board. 

   Analysts say <ORGANIZATION>Adelaide Steamship Managing</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>John Spalvins</PERSON>, one of the country's most active entrepreneurs, wants to be dealt into the split-up of <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s assets. 

   His move conceivably could block <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed merger with the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> companies, analysts say. 
Speculating on possible outcomes of <PERSON>Mr. Spalvins</PERSON>'s move, they say <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> might opt to buy <ORGANIZATION>Adelaide Steamship</ORGANIZATION> out of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
Or, <ORGANIZATION>Adelaide Steamship</ORGANIZATION> might try to negotiate to acquire some <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> assets, such as its <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> stake in British bank <ORGANIZATION>Standard Chartered PLC</ORGANIZATION>, or its shares in <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest company, they say. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s plans for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>, which must be approved by shareholders in the companies, also have run into resistance among institutional investors. 
They want a cash offer rather than stock in <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> that they would get through a share-exchange proposal. 

   <PERSON>Kerry Packer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s richest man, and Sir <PERSON>Ronald Brierley</PERSON>, a millionaire <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> investor, already have made a joint run at <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> and been bought out by <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> at a large profit.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Westpac chairman and four directors quit after criticism
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman and four directors of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
biggest bank, resigned yesterday in the face of criticism from the markets
and financial institutions.
Sir <PERSON>Eric Neal</PERSON>, chairman, Sir <PERSON>Neil Currie</PERSON>, deputy chairman, and three other
long-serving directors had accepted responsibility for heavy losses and bad
debts which had halved the bank's share price.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s problems came to a head last week when a ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds
488m) rights issue closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, forcing the
underwriters to take up shares worth about ADollars 860m. This followed a
disastrous first half in which the bank incurred pre-tax losses of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts, including a
ADollars 2.1bn write-down of its property portfolio.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> said Sir <PERSON>Eric</PERSON> would be replaced by <PERSON>Mr John Uhrig</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>CRA</ORGANIZATION>,
the mining group 49 per cent owned by <ORGANIZATION>RTZ</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>. Sir <PERSON>James Balderstone</PERSON>,
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest financial institution, was
appointed deputy chairman.
None of the departing directors was available for comment. <PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON> said
they had resigned voluntarily 'on the basis of the need to demonstrate board
responsibility'. He would not comment on why a number of other long serving
directors had not resigned.
<PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON> said there would be no immediate change in the bank's strategy of
cutting costs, improving efficiency and resuscitating its battered public
image.
Analysts said the resignations would help stimulate market support for
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, which have collapsed from ADollars 3.87 in <DATE>August</DATE> to less
than ADollars 3, about half the level of two years ago.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has suffered deteriorating losses for the last two years as falling
asset prices have exposed the poor quality of many loans and property
investments made during a period of rapid expansion in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
The mass resignation follows strong private pressure for tough action from
institutional investors, and a campaign against the bank by dissident
shareholders and much of the media.
The <ORGANIZATION>Australian Financial Review</ORGANIZATION> yesterday called for the resignation of the
entire board.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares closed one cent higher at ADollars 2.86 on the <ORGANIZATION>Australian
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's wooed in ADollars 5.7bn
merger

<TEXT>
SA BREWING, the Australian drinks and manufacturing group, yesterday
proposed an ADollars 5.7bn (USDollars 4.3bn) merger with <ORGANIZATION>Foster's Brewing</ORGANIZATION>,
the brewing, pastoral and finance group formerly controlled by <PERSON>Mr John
Elliott</PERSON>.
The merger would create <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s fifth biggest company, and largely
resolve the financial problems of <PERSON>Mr Elliott</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>International Brewing
Holdings</ORGANIZATION> (IBH), a private company which owns 38 per cent of Foster's.
<PERSON>Mr Ross Wilson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION> chief executive, said he had 'initiated and
developed' the proposal, which is conditional on the appointment of <ORGANIZATION>SA
Brewing</ORGANIZATION> nominees as chairman and chief executive of the merged group.
However, the merger also forms the central element of a debt rescheduling
plan presented yesterday by <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION> to its banks. <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION> has debts of about
ADollars 2.5bn, acquired to finance the purchase of Foster's shares now
worth ADollars 1.6bn.
The board of Foster's said it would consider the offer, but is almost
certain to reject it. The board is understood to have turned down a similar
approach from <ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>March</DATE>.
The offer will also face scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which
indicated that it was concerned about the possibility of a further reduction
of competition in the highly concentrated beer market.
The plan provides for a new holding company to issue one share for each <ORGANIZATION>SA
Brewing</ORGANIZATION> share, and one for each 1.5 shares in Foster's. There would be no
cash alternative.
The offer values Foster's shares at a premium of <MONEY>three cents</MONEY> to <TIME>last night</TIME>'s
closing price of ADollars 1.90. <ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION> shares would be worth ADollars
2.90, compared to the market price of ADollars 3.07.
However, <ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION> believes the deal would unlock substantial extra value
for shareholders by removing the uncertainty about <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION>'s financial position,
which has depressed Foster's share price for the <DATE>last two years</DATE>.
This would be achieved through the reduction of the <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION> stake in the merged
company from an initial <MONEY>28 per cent</MONEY> to 7.5 per cent.
<ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION> would exchange its rights to about 14.5 per cent of the merged group for
perpetual convertible notes, exchangeable for shares after two years. The
merged group would then underwrite the sale by <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION> of about 6 per of its
remaining holding.
If its bankers approve, the deal would provide <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION> with about ADollars 345m
in cash for immediate payment of overdue interest, and allow it to secure
the bulk of its debt against the convertible notes and remaining shares. <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION>
would also gain a reliable stream of dividend and interest payments.
<ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION> said the 'significant financial strength' of the merged group
would provide 'substantial benefits' to shareholders of both companies. <PERSON>Mr
Wilson</PERSON> said the deal was expected to take at least five months to conclude.
The merger is dependent on the approval of the directors and shareholders of
both companies, and the creditors of <ORGANIZATION>IBH</ORGANIZATION>, led by <ORGANIZATION>Hongkong Bank Australia</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>BHP</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest company.
<ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing</ORGANIZATION> is a diversified Adelaide-based company, which dominates the
south Australian beer market, and has substantial interests in home
appliances and packaging.
Foster's, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest brewer, owns Courage in the UK and half of
<ORGANIZATION>Molson Breweries</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The group has been in turmoil since losing a record ADollars 1.3bn in
<DATE>1989/90</DATE>, largely as a result of write-offs connected with non-brewing
activities acquired during <PERSON>Mr Elliott</PERSON>'s reign as chairman and chief
executive.
The group has since sought to refocus itself as a pure brewing operation,
but has been unable to dispose of non-core assets worth about ADollars
2.8bn. The board warned last week it may be forced to write-down the value
of non-core assets again this year, which could affect its ability to pay a
dividend.

<HL> Australia's Holmes a Court Might Face
Cash Squeeze as Result of Global Crash

<TEXT>
   The global stock-market crash could be pushing <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s richest man, international takeover artist <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court, into a cash bind. 
Despite his troubles, though, the usually tight-lipped <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court is hinting he is more inclined to buy than sell. 

   The price collapse has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars off the market capitalization of <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's major listed companies, <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
An announcement early last week that <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> was withdrawing as lead manager of a one <MONEY>billion-Australian-dollar</MONEY> (<MONEY>$679 million</MONEY>) bond issue for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>, which was to have reduced the company's interest bill, has further shaken investor confidence. 

   Though prices of both <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> companies recovered slightly this week in a stronger Australian stock market, the two are significantly below their <DATE>1987</DATE> peaks. 
Moreover, prices have fallen far more than the market average and than several other high-flying entrepreneurial stocks. 
Alan Bond's <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>John Elliott</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Elders IXL Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, Australian-born <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Larry Adler</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>FAI Insurances Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, haven't been hit nearly as hard. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, who earlier this year became <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s first billionaire, has watched his personal wealth sag; some estimates put his paper losses at more than <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court controls about <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>, which, in turn, owns <PERCENT>42.5%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> closed yesterday at <MONEY>3.05 Australian dollars</MONEY>, down <PERCENT>73%</PERCENT> from its <DATE>1987</DATE> peak of <MONEY>11.30 dollars</MONEY>. 
Since <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE>, when the world stock crash began, the price of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> stock has plunged <PERCENT>69%</PERCENT>, nearly twice as fast as the <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> decline in the All Ordinaries index. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> shares have also tumbled, closing yesterday at <MONEY>1.67 dollars</MONEY> -- <PERCENT>79%</PERCENT> below the year's high of <MONEY>eight dollars</MONEY> and <PERCENT>67%</PERCENT> below on its pre-crash price. 

   Investor speculation has focused on <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>, and its biggest assets -- a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> in <ORGANIZATION>Texaco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>BHP</ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest company in terms of market capitalization; the big <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> oil concern is currently in bankruptcy proceedings.) 

   Because many of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>' assets are stakes in other listed companies, which provide dividends but no access to cash flow, investors are speculating that the Great Acquirer, as <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court is known, is heading for a cash squeeze in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
"The group is asset-rich but isn't obtaining a high operating cash flow from its assets," said <PERSON>John Bartley</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Potter Partners</ORGANIZATION>, a Melbourne-based brokerage. 

   While <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>1987</DATE> pretax earnings of about <MONEY>400 million dollars</MONEY> should be enough to cover this year's interest bill, which some analysts expect to exceed <MONEY>200 million dollars</MONEY> on debt of more than <MONEY>3.6 billion dollars</MONEY>, next year could tell a different story. 
If share prices remain depressed, profits from stock-trading operations -- a big contributor to earnings -- aren't likely to be as buoyant. 
That is putting pressure on <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court either to reduce his debt load through sales of assets or to acquire a cash cow. 

   Ian Story, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>BZW Meares</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, estimated <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>1988</DATE> interest bill at <MONEY>300 million dollars</MONEY> and the company's earnings, based on its current structure without any share-trading profits, at <MONEY>248 million dollars</MONEY>. 
He said the proposed <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> bond issue would have trimmed the <DATE>1988</DATE> interest bill by about <MONEY>80 million dollars</MONEY> before tax. 

   Despite all this, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court has indicated he will use his ample access to credit to shop around for yet more acquisitions. 
In the just-released <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> annual report, written after the <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE> crash, he seeks to reassure shareholders that he is still on the prowl. 
Bell has "held substantial lines of credit in place over the <DATE>last 12 months</DATE> which will allow us to actively pursue our goals," he says. 

   Already, rumors are swirling in the stock market about what <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court may go after next. 
Speculation is that <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>, whose holdings include media, gold and insurance interests, will seek the rest of <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an Australian building-products and resources group in which <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> acquired a <PERCENT>17%</PERCENT> interest in <DATE>August</DATE>. 
A cash bid probably would have to be made at <MONEY>four dollars</MONEY> a share and would cost <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> about <MONEY>two billion dollars</MONEY>. 

   As for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>, some analysts think it unlikely <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court will put up the <MONEY>eight billion dollars</MONEY> needed to acquire the remaining shares. 

   Abroad, <ORGANIZATION>BZW Meares</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Story</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court may shed some British holdings. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Standard Chartered PLC</ORGANIZATION> may be put on the block, providing <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court could recoup his investment, originally <MONEY>340 million dollars</MONEY>. 

   But he might bid for the British retailer <ORGANIZATION>Sears PLC</ORGANIZATION> -- paying an estimated <MONEY>three billion dollars</MONEY> to acquire the <PERCENT>92%</PERCENT> he doesn't already own -- and sell <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>'s low-yielding property interests, some analysts said. 
A full bid for <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Grenfell Group PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the British investment bank, could also be in the wings. 
Mr. Story also said <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court might be looking for a buyer for his <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> stake, though he doesn't think the Australian investor would take a loss. 
He paid an average <MONEY>$37</MONEY> a share; <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> fell <MONEY>$3.25</MONEY> on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday to close at <MONEY>$31</MONEY>, one day after the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> affirmed <ORGANIZATION>Pennzoil Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$10.3 billion</MONEY> judgment against the company. 

   Those who have been on the other side of transactions with <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, however, warn of red herrings. 
"The only thing predictable about <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is when he's normally trying to indicate one thing, he's going to do another," said an investment banker.

FT  05 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Australian bulls pay for misplaced
hopes - The economy let them down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good year for bulls in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Time and again, brokers
have forecast a sustained rally, only to retreat hurriedly as the <ORGANIZATION>All
Ordinaries</ORGANIZATION> index resumed its downward trend.
At yesterday's close of 1,435.2, the index was 13.1 per cent lower than at
the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>, and down more than 37 per cent since the all-time high
of 2,300 in <DATE>October 1987</DATE>.
The bulls have reason to feel hard done by. Most of the misplaced optimism
was based on slowly improving economic fundamentals following <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
emergence from recession in the <DATE>last quarter of 1991</DATE>.
As the federal government keeps pointing out, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s economic cycle is
ahead of most of the rest of the world, and its annualised GDP growth rate
of 2.1 per cent is now one of the fastest in the <ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION>.
But the market has remained stubbornly unmoved, in spite of three cuts in
official interest rates and a substantial fiscal boost delivered in two
expansionary economic statements earlier this year.
With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of response suggests that the market
had fully discounted the prospects of a return to economic growth by the end
of last year.
Investors may have been disappointed by the slower-than-forecast pace of
recovery, and disturbed by the signs of impending currency and current
account difficulties which have accompanied it.
They may also have been put off by the sea of red ink which has spilled from
the books of most of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s big companies as the impact of the 18-month
recession works its way through the accounts.
Hardly a corner of the economy has emerged unscathed. Of the 24 sectoral
indices quoted by the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, only three are higher than
at the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>. And two of those - chemicals and property trusts -
have barely moved.
The only real success story has been the media index, which is up more than
50 per cent, mainly because of a spectacular improvement in the share price
of <ORGANIZATION>News Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>'s newspapers, film and broadcasting
group.
The media index has also been helped by the performance of <PERSON>John Fairfax</PERSON>, the
newspaper group controlled by <PERSON>Mr Conrad Black</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> group, and
Nine Network, the television group controlled by <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>.
Significantly all three groups are recovering from earlier reverses.
However, the media index makes up only about 9 per cent of the <ORGANIZATION>All
Ordinaries</ORGANIZATION> index, and its performance has been overshadowed by the collapse
elsewhere in the market.
The gold index is down more than 11 per cent, diversified resources 26 per
cent, developers and contractors 26 per cent, building materials 23 per
cent, transport 23 per cent, banking and finance 25 per cent, and alcohol
and tobacco 37 per cent.
There are some hopeful signs for the future. The Australian dollar has
declined by more than 13 per cent this year on a trade weighted basis, which
makes local stocks cheaper for overseas buyers.
Corporate net profits increased by 26 per cent in the <DATE>three months to the
end of September</DATE>, to a level 37 per cent above the low point of the
recession in mid-1990.
However, earnings before interest, tax and depreciation rose by only 6.4 per
cent, suggesting that most of the improvement in net profits flowed from
lower interest rates and cost cutting, rather than higher sales or margins.
Apart from the media groups, few major companies made an unambiguous return
to the good financial health in the full-year reporting season which ended
last month.
Exceptions included <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest company;
<ORGANIZATION>Amcor</ORGANIZATION>, the packaging and paper group; <ORGANIZATION>CSR</ORGANIZATION>, the sugar and building materials
producer; and <ORGANIZATION>Mayne Nickless</ORGANIZATION>, the transport, security and health group.
But many big companies continued to disappoint, including <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Brambles</ORGANIZATION>,
the transport groups; the miners <ORGANIZATION>CRA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>North Broken Hill Peko</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Goodman
Fielder Wattie</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australasia</LOCATION>'s largest food producer; and <LOCATION>Pacific Dunlop</LOCATION>, the
diversified manufacturer.
Worst of all, the banking sector is still showing the strains of recession
and falling property prices. The conservatively-managed <ORGANIZATION>National Australia
Bank</ORGANIZATION> produced an improvement, but <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> all reported
disappointing or disastrous results.
The market was also badly hit in <DATE>October</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s ADollars 1.2bn
fully-underwritten rights issue, which closed 72 per cent undersubscribed,
leaving millions of unwanted shares overhanging the market.
In the absence of an unexpected acceleration of economic recovery, the
market is likely to mark time over the next few months in the hope of
improved results in the interim reporting season beginning in <DATE>February</DATE>.
The more optimistic bulls are still forecasting the long-delayed rally,
which some claim could take the index to 1,800 by the middle of next year.
But nervous investors should be aware that bears are tipping a floor of
1,250 before a sustained recovery begins.

NATIONAL <LOCATION>Australia Bank</LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s four major national trading
banks, has reversed two years of falling earnings to achieve a 12.3 per cent
increase in net profits to ADollars 405.6m (USDollars 307.2m) for the six
months ended <DATE>March, 1992</DATE>.
The Melbourne-based group, which is holding its interim dividend at <MONEY>22 cents</MONEY>
a share, says doubtful debt charges fell from ADollars 455.7m to ADollars
412.6m.
<PERSON>Mr Don Argus</PERSON> managing director, points to 'some tentative signs of economic
recovery'.
National's report was in marked contrast to <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s half-year results
from <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest trading bank, which declared a ADollars
1.67bn loss following huge property portfolio write-offs.
The major point of contrast was the performance of the two banks' finance
offshoots. National's Custom Credit turned a ADollars 68.7m loss into a
ADollars 6.4m profit, but <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Australian Guarantee Corporation</ORGANIZATION>
incurred a ADollars 719m loss, mainly as a result of property exposure.
National's UK and Irish banking operations acted as the main brake on
earnings with a contribution declining by almost 28 per cent to ADollars
120.1m. The operations include the <ORGANIZATION>Clydesdale</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Northern Yorkshire</LOCATION> and
National Irish groups.
National's Australian trading and savings banks incurred a modest 0.3 per
cent earnings fall to ADollars 279.8m following a 3.1 per cent rise in bad
loan charges to ADollars 212.1m.
The UK and Irish banks bore the brunt of the bad loans with write-offs
rising from ADollars 97.5m to ADollars 201.4m. The biggest contributor was
<ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire Bank</ORGANIZATION> where charges jumped from ADollars 62.9m to ADollars 156.2m.
The most tangible sign of pessimism in <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>'s result was an increase in
problem loan provisions from ADollars 3.86bn to ADollars 4.25bn on the
widest definition.
But <PERSON>Mr Argus</PERSON> did address the matter of property valuations in the wake of
the <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shock. He said the continued decline in property values in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> remained a major influence on the group's provisioning and
write-offs.
<PERSON>Mr Argus</PERSON> indicated that <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION>'s Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 7.9 per
cent at <DATE>March</DATE>, against a reserve bank minimum requirement of 4 per cent.

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, two of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest commercial
banks, yesterday reported interim figures which emphasised the continuing
improvement in bad debt experience. They also demonstrated some pick-up in
the business lending market.
NAB, reckoned to be the strongest of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s big four banks, announced a
profit of ADollars 868.8m (USDollars 634.2m) after tax for the six months
until the end of <DATE>March</DATE>. This included a ADollars 63.8m abnormal item
relating to a disposal, but still represented a sharp increase on last
time's ADollars 507.3m, which also included a ADollars 32.9m abnormal
surplus.
NAB attributed the improvement to a higher level of business loan demand in
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, a decline in operating expenses, and a further
'significant' reduction in the charge for bad and doubtful debts.
The two biggest geographical divisions - Australian operations and
businesses in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> (which include the Clydesdale, <ORGANIZATION>Northern</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> and National Irish banks) - posted net profits of ADollars 509.9m,
against ADollars 325.9m last time, and ADollars 233.6m against ADollars
157.2m, respectively. The <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> group made ADollars 37.9m.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> reported a ADollars 320.9m profit after tax, against a loss of
ADollars 204.6m a year earlier. In its case, the drop in the bad and
doubtful debts charge was more marked, although the figure remains much
higher than at <ORGANIZATION>NAB</ORGANIZATION>. The charge in the half-year was ADollars 379m compared
with ADollars 799.7m.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s gross problem assets stood at ADollars 5.5bn at the end of <DATE>March</DATE>,
compared with ADollars 8.57bn a year earlier.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> said restructuring at the bank had helped to push its expense/income
ratio down to 60 per cent in the six months. It said it was 'well-placed' to
achieve its target of 58 per cent in the <DATE>1995</DATE> financial year.
Westpac is increasing the interim dividend by <MONEY>33 per cent</MONEY> to <MONEY>8 cents</MONEY> a
share. NAB has declared a full-franked interim dividend of <MONEY>35 cents</MONEY> a share,
up from <MONEY>24 cents</MONEY>.

Westpac Banking

CONSOLIDATED <ORGANIZATION>Press Holdings</ORGANIZATION> (ConsPress), <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>'s privately-owned
publishing group, yesterday emerged as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake
in <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, the troubled Australian bank.
The shareholding, worth ADollars 434m (USDollars 299.3m) at <TIME>last night</TIME>'s
closing price of ADollars 2.99, is close to the 10 per cent ceiling placed
on individual shareholdings by <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s deed of settlement and federal
banking law. ConsPress could move to 15 per cent ownership of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, but
only with the approval of both the board and <PERSON>Mr John Dawkins</PERSON>, the treasurer
(finance minister).
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>, who is travelling abroad, was not available for comment. <PERSON>Mr Al
Dunlap</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>ConsPress</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> was 'a very good
company, with great potential'. <PERSON>Mr John Uhrig</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the
bank was very pleased to have <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> as a shareholder. He said the
ConsPress holding would add stability to the share register.
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> was also welcomed by the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest
financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr Ian Salmon</PERSON>,
managing director, said <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> was 'a strong company with an excellent
future, and it is pleasing that <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> shares that view'.
ConsPress said it had acquired the rights to 145.16m <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares since it
began buying in <DATE>mid-October</DATE>. The stake comprises 4.61 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s
ordinary shares and 3.66 per cent in the form of options.
Buying by <ORGANIZATION>ConsPress</ORGANIZATION> pushed <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares briefly above ADollars 3
yesterday, for the first time in two months. The shares fell back in later
trading to close <MONEY>1 cent</MONEY> higher on the day.
ConsPress has been rumoured to be acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares since the failure
in <DATE>October</DATE> of the bank's ADollars 1.72bn rights issue. The issue closed 72
per cent undersubscribed, leaving many sub-underwriters holding unwanted
shares.
Analysts said <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s investment was likely to provide a significant
lift for the shares, which fell to a low of about ADollars 2.65 last week
after the group announced a record net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year
to <DATE>September</DATE>. The shares were trading at about ADollars 4.50 at the start of
the year.
ConsPress gave no indication of its motives in buying <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares.
Analysts said <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> would probably seek a seat on the board, but would
be prevented from seeking control by the law and the bank's deed of
settlement.
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> may be counting on a takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> by one of the other
three Australian banks, <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> (NAB), <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Zealand</LOCATION> banking Group (ANZ) and <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
The banks are excluded from the legal restriction on bank shareholdings, but
are prevented from bidding for each other by a separate government policy
which bans mergers between the six largest financial institutions.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Westpac Banking Corp., as part of a
strategic alliance formed last year, said it will allot
Australian Mutual Provident Society 73,146,000 new Westpac
common shares.
   The move will expand AMP's share in Westpac to about 15%
from 10%. The allotment to AMP, Australia's biggest insurance
and investment concern, is valued at A$4.13 (US$3.09) a
share, or A$302 million for the entire parcel. The allotment
is expected to be completed in about two weeks.

   CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia is producing nearly 90%
of its oil needs and, despite the Middle East conflict, is
"well placed" to meet its requirements, the government said.
   Alan Griffiths, minister for resources, said Australia's
oil self-sufficiency rate is up from 65% in 1983, when the
Labor Party government took office. He contended that
government deregulation of crude-oil marketing and strategies
to increase exploration have helped improve self-sufficiency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Production from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest fields in <LOCATION>Bass Strait</LOCATION>
is declining, while output from northern offshore fields is
rising. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> imports some oil, but overall is a net
exporter of energy, because it is the world's biggest coal
exporter and sells liquefied natural gas, uranium and
light-crude oil.
   The price of domestically produced crude is kept close to
international levels. <PERSON>Mr. Griffiths</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> can't
artificially restrict prices for crude, because such controls
would cause producers to export more crude, reduce
exploration and force up oil imports.
   But <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> has insisted that oil companies slow the rise
in retail prices of gasoline since the <ORGANIZATION>Gulf</ORGANIZATION> conflict boosted
world prices. Yet gasoline prices could rise four <MONEY>Australian
cents</MONEY> a liter next week, the <ORGANIZATION>Service Station Association</ORGANIZATION>
said. Gasoline already costs more than <MONEY>80 cents</MONEY> (66 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
cents) a liter in some parts of the country. A liter is equal
to 0.26 gallon.
   <PERSON>Mr. Griffiths</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has relatively low taxes on
gasoline, and cited data showing Australian gasoline users
have been paying about <MONEY>74 Australian cents</MONEY> a liter, compared
with the equivalent of <MONEY>1.62 Australian dollars</MONEY> (US$1.34) in
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and A$1.31 in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Takeover drive puts TNT on road
to profit - The Australian transport group is winning back investors'
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR <PERSON>Peter Abeles</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>, the Australian transport and
express mail group, has a message to the markets: after a year of hectic
deal-making, the group has sorted out its problems and is on track for a
return to profit.
Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, 68, flew back to <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> headquarters from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> this week
with three deals in his pocket. He believes these will put an end to
investors' concerns about the group's profitability and liquidity.
He also made clear his intention to go on managing the company, which he
transformed during the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and <DATE>1980s</DATE> from a small haulier into an
international shipping, aviation and trucking conglomerate.
'I have no plans to retire; I have not got time for it,' he said in response
to rumours that he intended to hand over management to one of <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s younger
executives.
Under Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>'s guidance, <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> expanded rapidly through the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, from
revenues of ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.29bn) in <DATE>1984</DATE> to ADollars 4.5bn in
<DATE>1990</DATE>. At their peak, the shares were worth well over ADollars 4 on the
<ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
However, the group ran into trouble early last year when institutional
investors began to worry about the high level of debt incurred to finance
growth.
With bank debt and subordinated loans totalling ADollars 2.2bn, compared
with shareholders' funds of ADollars 1.1bn, <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> looked vulnerable to the
growing recession in its main markets in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>.
There were also worries about the group's entrepreneurial nature and its
close relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, which was then
struggling to cope with severe financial problems.
Like <PERSON>Mr Murdoch</PERSON>, Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> had shown himself willing to take big risks. In
the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, for example, <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s big breakthrough came when its trucks carried <PERSON>Mr
Murdoch</PERSON>'s newspapers through the picket lines at <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s non-union
printing plant in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s Docklands.
Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> has also been noted for dramatic moves into new markets, usually
in an attempt to establish domination as a precursor to improving margins
through economies of scale.
In one spectacular deal, he bought five years' production of the British
Aerospace 146 Quiet Trader, amounting to 72 aircraft at about ADollars 30m
each. Only 24 were destined for <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s own transport activities - the rest
were to be leased to other users.
Investors were also specifically concerned about <ORGANIZATION>Ansett Transport
Industries</ORGANIZATION>, which runs <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest domestic airline, and <ORGANIZATION>Ansett
Worldwide Aviation Services</ORGANIZATION>, an aircraft leasing company.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ansett</ORGANIZATION> companies are jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>, and both looked
likely to suffer falling revenue as the recession and an over-supply of
aircraft reduced demand.
Concern about the group was triggered by declining profits in <DATE>1989</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>
as European losses and the onset of recession squeezed margins. But it was
not until the shares fell to a low of <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY> in <DATE>January last year</DATE> that the
board reassesed its growth strategy.
Since then, <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> has simplified its structure by refocusing on its three core
areas of international express, domestic express, and commercial
distribution.
It has sold holdings in non-core businesses such as <ORGANIZATION>Foster's Brewing Group</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Normandy Poseidon</LOCATION>, the Australian resources group, and substantially
allayed fears about the exposure of the <ORGANIZATION>Ansett</ORGANIZATION> companies.
The group made a net loss of ADollars 197m in the 12 months to <DATE>June 1991</DATE> and
a further ADollars 51m loss in the six months to appears to be over, and
investors have begun buying the stock again, propelling it to nearly
ADollars 2 in recent trading.
The key to <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s revived confidence is four big deals, three of which were
concluded last week. The deals are:
The flotation of 70 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>TNT Freightways</ORGANIZATION>, the group's <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trucking
business, to raise ADollars 400m;
The acquisition of Chronoservice, a leading French express carrier, which
fills a gap in <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>'s network of domestic express businesses in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>;
A sub-contracting agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> carrier, for the
delivery of inbound packages to 10 European countries;
The setting up of GD Net, a Dutch-based joint venture which will merge the
express mail and parcel activities of <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> and the post offices of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>,
the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The FedEx deal, which cost less than USDollars 18m, removes a big competitor
from the European market and gives <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> access to additional revenues of up
to USDollars 100m, although the group says it does not expect to retain the
whole of FedEx's business.
However, the most significant deal is the formation of GD Net, which is
expected to generate additional revenue of USDollars 120m in the first year.
That will, in <DATE>1992-1993</DATE>, help propel the European business into profits for
the first time.
In addition, the deal allows <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> to remove ADollars 600m in long-term debt
from its balance sheet, helping reduce the ratio of long-term debt to
shareholders' equity to about 1.3 or 1.4 to 1 from from 2.2:1 in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
'We are on the way to a 1:1 debt to equity ratio by <DATE>1993</DATE>. The majority of it
has been done, and there is no question but that we will meet that target.
Our debt has come down tremendously,' Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> puts much blame for the group's problems on the 'unsophisticated'
Australian market, which executives believe failed to understand the express
business.
'The way we were perceived in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had a major impact on us overseas -
the post office deal nearly collapsed three times because of the perception
which built up, and other deals were also affected,' Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> said. 'It did
not matter how many times we said we could pay our bills, people just did
not believe it.'
<ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> says it sees no indications that the recession in its main markets is
easing, but hopes for a rapid return to profitability once the European
international activities move out of losses. 'That will remove the biggest
drag on our profits,' Sir <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> said.
He refused to say when profits might return to the record level of ADollars
274m, achieved in <DATE>1988</DATE>. But he suggested the improvement might be more rapid
than expected. 'We don't want to wait five years. We want to do it fast,' he
said.

   Australia's Commonwealth Bank to Sell
   Shares, Acquire State Bank of Victoria

<LP>
   CANBERRA -- Commonwealth Bank Corp. of Australia,
currently 100% owned by the federal government, will issue
shares to selected investors and use the funds to acquire
State Bank of Victoria, the government announced.
   It said the acquisition of State Bank of Victoria for 1.6
billion Australian dollars (US$1.33 billion) will make
Commonwealth Bank the third-biggest in Australia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>State Bank of Victoria</ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON>
state government, was offered for sale because its investment
banking unit, <ORGANIZATION>Tricontinental Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, incurred losses
and huge bad debts over recent years. The state government
couldn't afford to cover the losses and settle
<ORGANIZATION>Tricontinental</ORGANIZATION>'s debts without selling the bank.
   <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition doesn't include
<ORGANIZATION>Tricontinental</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s treasurer, said <ORGANIZATION>State Bank of
Victoria</ORGANIZATION>'s debt of <MONEY>A$2.7 billion</MONEY> would have extinguished its
entire capital base of <MONEY>$A1.6 billion</MONEY>. That could have had
implications for the stability of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s financial
system unless <ORGANIZATION>State Bank of Victoria</ORGANIZATION> was acquired by a
stronger bank, he suggested at a news conference.
   <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> took the opportunity presented by the bank's
problem to pursue his aim of selling at least parts of
government businesses to reduce public-sector debt. Partial
privatization of government businesses is supported by some
members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> and
Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON>, but bitterly opposed by the party's
left-wing faction, in particular.
   Labor Party officials already had called a meeting for
<DATE>Sept. 24</DATE> to decide whether the government can privatize parts
of its telecommunications concerns and airlines, which need
capital injections.
   <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> "cannot
finance the acquisition from its existing capital base, and
the (federal) government isn't in a position to augment that
capital base from its budget.
   "Therefore, the equity base of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> will need
to be augmented with private capital roughly equivalent to
about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s existing capital base,"
he said.
   The federal government will retain control of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth
Bank</ORGANIZATION>. Australian investment institutions such as pension
funds are likely to invest in <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>, but other
banks can't buy shares in the bank.
   <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> said the acquisition doesn't have any
implications for the federal government's budget, announced
last week, or the overall public-sector borrowing requirement
that he plans to keep in balance this <DATE>fiscal year ending June
30, 1991</DATE>.
   The Victoria state government, also run by the <ORGANIZATION>Labor
Party</ORGANIZATION>, was under pressure from its members to sell <ORGANIZATION>State Bank</ORGANIZATION>
only to government-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>, rather than
to an investor-controlled institution. The state government
rejected a slightly higher offer for <ORGANIZATION>State Bank</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Westpac
Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, contending that the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> offer
was better because it includes certain federal tax benefits
for the state.
   <PERSON>Don Sanders</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>, said
the merger "will create the strongest financial-services
group in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>."
   The move wouldn't be possible without the federal
government's giving the bank the ability to issue equity
capital, <PERSON>Mr. Sanders</PERSON> said in a statement.
   The federal government will maintain its guarantee of
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s liabilities, including deposits. The
acquisition is subject to due-diligence checks by
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>, as well as government and central bank
approvals and certain legislation.
   <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s most-recent published accounts for the
<DATE>fiscal year ended June 30, 1989</DATE> show total assets at <MONEY>A$60.66
billion</MONEY> and group capital and reserves totaling <MONEY>A$3.98
billion</MONEY>. Operating profit after tax rose <PERCENT>74%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>A$475.9
million</MONEY> from <MONEY>A$273.4 million</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>State Bank of Victoria</ORGANIZATION> dominates retail banking in that
state, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s second-biggest, so the acquisition greatly
strengthens <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s competitive position in
<LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>. Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>State Bank</ORGANIZATION> is the fifth-biggest bank in the
country, with more than 500 branches and <MONEY>A$24 billion</MONEY> of
assets.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Boardroom imports down under - A wave of
American executive appointments in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has often been called the 51st state - a lighthearted reference to
the proliferation of Hollywood films, fast-food restaurants and baseball
caps. But now, at a rather more fundamental level, is American management
culture infiltrating Australian boardrooms?
The thought has been prompted by a spate of top executive appointments at
some of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest companies. Last month, for example, the
Australian Mutual Provident, the nation's largest life insurer and a pillar
of its institutional investment community, named <PERSON>George Trumbull</PERSON> as its new
chief executive. Trumbull comes to the <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Cigna</ORGANIZATION>, the giant
Philadelphia-based insurer, where he was president of the individual
financial services division and former investment chief.
Last year <PERSON>Bob Joss</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo</ORGANIZATION> executive, was appointed to head
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, the oldest of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s 'big four' commercial banks. In <DATE>1992</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Telecom</ORGANIZATION>, the large state-owned telecommunications company, recruited <PERSON>Frank
Blount</PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> telecoms group, as chief executive.
This importation has seeped down to lower management levels, too. Last
month, for example, <PERSON>Coles Myer</PERSON>, one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest retailers,
appointed <PERSON>Dennis Eck</PERSON> to run its supermarkets division. Eck is a former
executive vice-president of <ORGANIZATION>American Stores</ORGANIZATION> and, more recently, worked for
California-based <ORGANIZATION>Vons</ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets.
But despite these eye-catching moves, executive search firms and management
consultants remain divided about how pervasive the importation of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> talent
actually is. <PERSON>Geoff Morgan</PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan &amp; Banks</ORGANIZATION>, the executive recruitment
specialist, describes the development as 'a definite trend', pointing out
that the Trumbull/Joss/Blount appointments were all the results of
full-blown searches conducted outside <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
He thinks the pattern stems partly from a desire for the general management
skills and objectivity which <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> executives can offer, and partly from the
need for sector-specific experience. The latter element, he predicts, will
mean that the influx continues, especially in service industries where
'Australian companies don't have a great reputation', and in high-tech
fields.
This view seems well supported by Coles: it lists four specific skills where
it reckoned Eck had an edge, ranging from inventory management to
technological expertise, especially in supplier relationships. The
Australian retailer notes, too, that it has a major refurbishment programme
getting under way, and that Eck has handled more than 1,000 store overhauls.
But <PERSON>David Benn</PERSON>, managing director of consultants <ORGANIZATION>Korn/Ferry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> -
whose strong American accent belies 20 years in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> - reckons that the
development 'is not nearly as pervasive as the headline-grabbing stuff
suggests'.
For the most part, he suggests, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> executives are being used as
trouble-shooters. 'I don't think anyone has had the brief: 'Go find an
American'. It (such appointments) tends to happen in situations where there
is a well-defined problem, and all other bets are off,' he says.
Telecom, he points out, was (and is) facing the loss of its protected
monopoly position. <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, having called itself <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s world bank, had
strayed badly at home and shareholder disgruntlement was swelling.
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s insurance sector faces major issues like the merits of
demutualisation and increased competition.
But at least some board directors, who have the formal say over such
appointments, seem to have been wooed by the promise of broad management
objectivity. One <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> director notes that the insurer did first consider an
internal promotion, but eventually shortlisted two candidates from outside
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 'We decided it was better to select someone who was unencumbered
by <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> baggage', he says.
So if these are the expectations, are they realistic? Where US executives
have already been installed, there are some clear signs that international
perspective has quickly come into play.
Most of the recent <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> appointments, for example, have put a major emphasis
on raising service levels. Joss wants the bank to take <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION>'s as its
management model, and emulate the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> hamburger chain's route to consistent
quality. Reaching such a target, he has acknowledged, implies a strong
training focus. He has also stressed the need for a more targeted rewarding
of performance.
Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Telecom</ORGANIZATION>, which remains state-owned and therefore hugely
political, says that greater use is now being made of techniques like
international 'benchmarking', especially in finance.
But there also are some signs that cultural differences - notably,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s strong egalitarian beliefs - may not make for the easiest
transition of ideas. Already, executive remuneration is in the spotlight,
and the packages offered to the new breed of executives - whether
home-grown, like <PERSON>Tony Berg</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Boral</ORGANIZATION>, or imported, like <PERSON>Joss</PERSON> - have been
much-debated.
On the plus side, institutional shareholders, anxious to lift their profile
in the wake of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> 'entrepreneurial' excesses, say they are
supportive, provided the structure of an option package is 'appropriate'.
The <ORGANIZATION>Australian Investment Managers Group</ORGANIZATION> is currently drawing up guidelines
on the subject and on corporate governance matters generally.
The throwaway remark of one mining industry manager, asked about a recent
non-Australian appointment in his own company, seems to summarise the
attitudes which the stepped-up executive culture has yet to alter. 'We
haven't caught the <PERSON>Bob Joss</PERSON> syndrome if that's what you mean,' he comments.
'My family has been shareholders of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> for years and all I can say is
he'd better be worth it.'

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese win coal price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN COAL exporters have been forced, for the second year in
succession, to accept a price cut for steam coal shipments to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. The new
price - for deliveries in the 1992-1993 financial year - is USDollars 38.90
a tonne, fob <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <MONEY>95 cents</MONEY> down from the current year.
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is the key supplier of both steam coal, largely used for
electricity generation, as well as coking coal for the Japanese steel mills.
The contract was set up by <ORGANIZATION>Chubu Electric Power</ORGANIZATION>, the lead negotiator for the
Japanese utilities, with the <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> coal producer <ORGANIZATION>MIM</ORGANIZATION> and Ulan and
<PERSON>Drayton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>. While the Australians may express some
disappointment with the price fall, it could have been much worse. A recent
spot tender from Scottish Power was awarded for Australian coal of this
quality at Dollars 31, fob.
These prices will flow on to some 17m tonnes of Australian coal burned in
Japanese power stations as well as setting the Australian price for <ORGANIZATION>Taipower</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Kepco</ORGANIZATION>.
The one small gain claimed by one of the major steam coal producers last
week was that the price reduction was less - albeit marginally - than the
Dollars 1 cut for semi-soft coking coal. It is from excess coking coal,
however, that the steam coal market is now threatened.
This year's Japanese steel mill settlements saw a 10 per cent cut in tonnage
from Australian and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for hard coking coal and much bigger cuts for
soft coking coal. As these coals can readily double up as very high quality
steam coals and as many existing mines are planning extensive expansions in
output (for example, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest producer, BHP-Utah, alone is
lifting production by 7m tonned to 38m tonnes over the next few years),
there is a danger that unbought coking coals, combined with expanding steam
coal production, could swamp the market.
UK coal imports in <DATE>1991</DATE> rose to 19.5m tonnes from 14.7m tonnes in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
Steam coal imports - mainly for power generation - rose by 69 per cent to
9.2m tonnes. Of this 6.3m tonnes went into <LOCATION>Liverpool</LOCATION>, largely for <ORGANIZATION>PowerGen</ORGANIZATION>'s
Fiddlers Ferry station (1.3m tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes the
previous year) and the Thames power stations of <LOCATION>West Thurrock</LOCATION> and Tilbury
(both <ORGANIZATION>National Power</ORGANIZATION>) and <PERSON>Kingsnorth</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>PowerGen</ORGANIZATION>).

   SYDNEY, Australia -- The government's planned float of
part of Commonwealth Banking Corp. will be by far the biggest
ever initial public offering in Australia -- and a litmus
test for the ruling Labor Party's controversial program to
sell a clutch of government assets.
   The listing of about a 30% stake of the bank could raise
as much as 1.6 billion Australian dollars (US$1.24 billion),
though industry analysts are betting that figure probably
will be scaled down to just over A$1 billion. By comparison,
the amount of capital raised from new listings on the
Australian Stock Exchange has averaged A$2 billion a year
during the past four years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While bank officials are tight-lipped on details of the
planned new listing, they do say that they aim to have a
prospectus available around mid-May, in time for the shares
to be traded on the stock market by the end of <DATE>June</DATE>.
   Foreign investors, though, will have to bide their time.
The company's <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> unit, a big housing lender,
is one of the <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>'s most sacred cows, and party
stalwarts were reluctant to let even a portion of it go. The
reluctance is reflected in several of the rules governing the
partial privatization, one of which bars non-Australians from
taking up shares in the initial offering. They will be free
to trade in the shares once they are listed, however.
   The success of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> issue is crucial to
the <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to make the country more efficient
by selling off parts of government-owned assets.
   "If the first one gets off the ground with a bad start, it
makes all the others even more difficult," says <PERSON>Bryan Madden</PERSON>,
research director at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s Australian
office.
   That, in turn, would deal a blow to the stock market,
which is counting on the government's privatization program
to bolster its standing. Selling government assets to the
public "would have a positive impact on the liquidity of our
stock market," says <PERSON>Laurence Cox</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian
Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
   Several bank analysts believe that the government, in
order to reduce the chances of the float fizzling, will pitch
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> shares to the public at a lower price than
they otherwise might.
   <PERSON>Philip Leslie</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s chief manager of
finance, won't comment on the amount to be raised or the
proposed price of the shares. But he does say that rules
governing the float prevent the bank from raising more than
<MONEY>A$1.6 billion</MONEY> from the <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> stake. That arrangement grew out
of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s bailout last <DATE>August</DATE> of troubled <ORGANIZATION>State
Bank of Victoria</ORGANIZATION>, which was owned by the cash-strapped state
government of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>.
   To pay for the takeover -- which cost <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>
<MONEY>A$1.6 billion</MONEY> -- Federal Treasurer <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> said the bank
would have to raise funds from investors, because <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>
couldn't afford to foot the bill.
   The takeover made <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank Australia</ORGANIZATION>'s largest in
terms of domestic assets.
   At home, <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> claims about <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of the
nation's bank deposits. It leads the country in housing loans
with about a third of the market in its portfolio, which bank
analysts consider virtually risk-free.
   Unlike the three other big Australian banks -- <ORGANIZATION>National
Australia Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Australia &amp;
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> has few
assets abroad. It did acquire a <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>ASB Bank Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, and it has two small investments in
<ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Solomon Islands Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Resources &amp;
Investment Finance Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Leslie</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> says that up to <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of the
new issue is likely to be reserved for bank employees. And
while details still are being worked out, he says that "it's
reasonable to assume" that a certain portion of shares also
will be earmarked for the bank's customers.
   Besides barring foreign investors from the initial offer,
the <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> has laid down other long-term guidelines for
the new issue. For instance, although other Australian banks
are allowed to have cross-holdings in each other, no bank,
foreign or domestic, will be permitted to hold shares in
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>. In addition, while legislation permits a
single investor to own as much as <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of an Australian bank
(except for <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, which stipulates a cap of <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> on
ownership of its shares), the ceiling for <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>
is <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT>.
   Another peculiarity, <PERSON>Mr. Leslie</PERSON> notes, is that unlike
other Australian banks, deposits and other liabilities of
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> carry an explicit government guarantee.
"That guarantee will stay" even after the bank is publicly
traded, he says. And that gives the bank a competitive
advantage by reducing its cost of funds.
   Industry analysts say investors considering a stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> will use <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> as a
benchmark, mainly because of the similarity in perceived
quality and spread of assets and the bank's risk profile, or
relatively low level of nonperforming loans.
   Consequently, says <PERSON>Stephen Cleugh</PERSON>, who tracks banks for <ORGANIZATION>CS
First Boston Australia Equities Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>
shares will have to be pitched close to the price-earnings
ratio of <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> to make them an attractive
alternative for local investment institutions. The shares
also will have to give a prospective dividend yield of <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> to
<PERCENT>9%</PERCENT>, fully franked, which means tax-free in the hands of
investors, he says. <PERSON>Mr. Cleugh</PERSON> expects the bank to try to
raise between <MONEY>A$1.3 billion</MONEY> and <MONEY>A$1.6 billion</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Given National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s strong capital-adequacy
position, particularly in the wake of a proposed <MONEY>A$1 billion</MONEY>
capital raising through a one-for-five share-rights issue
recently announced, <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION> will be under pressure
to show a strong capital base. The rights issue will boost
<ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s so-called Tier 1 capital to nearly
<PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> from <PERCENT>5.4%</PERCENT>. That means <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Bank</ORGANIZATION>, incorporating
<ORGANIZATION>State Bank of Victoria</ORGANIZATION>, will have to show at least <PERCENT>5.5%</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Mr.
Cleugh</PERSON> says, well above the mininum <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> stipulated by the
<ORGANIZATION>Reserve Bank of Australia</ORGANIZATION>, the country's central bank.

   <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court withdrew from his bidding war with <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch for Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> in return for certain <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> assets. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION> also agreed to drop all legal proceedings against the bid by <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
The agreement apparently ends the battle for control of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest media group. 

   A joint statement said <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and associated companies will sell their shares in <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> to Murdoch companies at their latest offer prices. 
Those prices are established by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s formal takeover offer, equivalent to <MONEY>$9.64</MONEY> for each <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> share, and a verbal offer made last <DATE>Friday</DATE> by <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> of <MONEY>$14.78</MONEY> a share for <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION> is the largest single holder of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> shares, with a <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> stake. 
<ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, in turn, owns <PERCENT>48%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION> holds <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION>. 

   In return, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> agreed to sell two <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> assets -- <ORGANIZATION>Western Australian Newspapers Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station HSV7 -- to <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court for a total of <MONEY>$295.6 million</MONEY>. 

   The arrangement reached yesterday is "commercially sensible on both sides," said <PERSON>Peter Chegwyn</PERSON>, finance director at <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Analysts added that <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court came out of the fight with the assets he most wanted. 

   With <ORGANIZATION>Western Australian Newspapers</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court will gain control of the major <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> daily, the West Australian, which he will be able to merge with his weekly paper, the <ORGANIZATION>Western Mail</ORGANIZATION>. 
The combination of the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station and his stations in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> creates a major network with big advantages for program distribution and advertising sales. 

   Analysts also estimate that <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's companies stand to make a gross profit of about <MONEY>$69.4 million</MONEY> on the sale of their shares in <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> and its associated companies to <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>, meanwhile, may have to sell some assets to comply with Australian regulations against concentration of media holdings. 
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> spokesman noted that <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> assets that would be acquired by <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> include a television station and a newspaper in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>. 
Because <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> already owns a newspaper in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, he may have to sell the television station and one of the newspapers, the spokesman said. 

   The tussle for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> began <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION>, when <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's <ORGANIZATION>J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> bid <MONEY>$8.35</MONEY> a share for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>, topping the <MONEY>$7.71-a-share</MONEY> bid by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> early in <DATE>December</DATE>. 
On New Year's Eve, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court raised his offer to <MONEY>$8.68</MONEY> a share. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in turn bettered that offer with a <MONEY>$9.64-a-share</MONEY> bid that now carries the recommendation of the <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> board. 

   "It was a question of how much pressure each could exert on the other," said <PERSON>John Poynton</PERSON>, director of a <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> brokerage, <ORGANIZATION>Hartley Poynton Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 
"They couldn't come to an agreement early on, so <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court made his first bid, and every action since then has been calculated to produce leverage." 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court couldn't be reached for comment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> had raised his stake in <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> to <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT>, and <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court had put the <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> bid under pressure through a series of legal moves. 

   In the supreme court of the state of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court had challenged <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s right as an American citizen to own more than <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION> under the provisions of Australian broadcast legislation limiting foreign ownership. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court also had initiated action against <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION>, to prevent it from accepting <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s offer for its <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> shares without a special shareholders' meeting to consider the proposal. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION> had been the subject of a bid by the Sydney-based media group, <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. Fairfax had offered <MONEY>$9.50</MONEY> a share for <ORGANIZATION>Queensland Press</ORGANIZATION> conditional on the <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> media company's acceptance of <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s offer for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</ORGANIZATION>. 
A <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> spokesman said the company didn't have any immediate comment on the agreement between Messrs. 
<PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> a Court.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Packer's Westpac purchase keeps
the markets guessing - The Australian bank was an obvious target, but what
is Kerry Packer's strategy?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE question was reverberating around <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s business community
yesterday: what is <PERSON>Kerry Packer</PERSON> up to? It is a question which has been asked
many times before. As usual, it prompted plenty of speculation, but few
answers.
There was little surprise when <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>, the entrepreneurial owner of the
<ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Press Holdings</ORGANIZATION> (ConsPress) publishing group, emerged on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking
Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, the troubled Australian bank.
Market gossip had linked <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>October</DATE>, when the
bank's ADollars 3-a-share, ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 825m) rights issue had
closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving dozens of sub-underwriters
holding some 290m shares.
The shares, representing about 19 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s expanded share
capital, were worth significantly less than ADollars 3 in the stock market,
and were ripe for acquisition by a buyer with plenty of cash.
But why was <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> willing to bail out the underwriters when so many
other shareholders, including many of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s institutional buyers, were
unwilling to take up their rights only a few weeks earlier?
Is he simply spending some of his cash on an undervalued recovery stock? Is
he hoping to pick up windfall profits if a rival bidder appears? Or does he
want to run <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>?
Only three people know the answer: <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>, who is believed to be playing
polo in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Mr Al Dunlap</PERSON>, the irascible American chief executive of
ConsPress; and <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s son <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON>, who is being groomed to inherit the
company.
None are likely to explain the strategy unless forced to do so. As <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>
told a parliamentary committee last year, the affairs of ConsPress are no
business of anyone but the sole shareholder - himself.
However, <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> has clearly been poised to make a major investment since
<DATE>March</DATE>, when he completed a reconstruction of ConsPress which left the group
debt-free with assets of about ADollars 3bn, including ADollars 1bn in cash.
He spelt out his long-term strategy in broad terms in a rare interview in
<DATE>April</DATE> with Australian Business Monthly, one of his own magazines.
'I believe that over the <DATE>next two or three years</DATE> there are going to be
terrific opportunities, and that anyone in a position such as ours will be
able to take advantage of anything that comes up,' he said.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s problems made it an obvious target. Shortly after the rights issue
debacle, five directors resigned, including the then chairman, and the bank
subsequently reported a net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year ended
<DATE>September</DATE>, after writing off more than ADollars 2.6bn against bad and
doubtful loans.
The bank's problems were reflected in its share price, which fell from
ADollars 4.52 in <DATE>January</DATE> to a low of ADollars 2.39 earlier this month,
presenting a rare opportunity to acquire a significant stake cheaply.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at ADollars 2.99 yesterday, suggesting that <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>
has already made a small profit on his holding, which was acquired at prices
of between ADollars 2.52 and ADollars 2.93.
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> may expect the shares to continue to rise as the bank returns to
profitability over the coming year. He may also be positioning himself for
the possibility of a victory by the opposition conservative coalition in
next year's federal election. That would probably lead to an easing of
restrictions on bank takeovers and open the way for a bid for <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> from
one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s stronger banks.
However, <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> is rarely a passive investor. His strategy is to buy
undervalued companies, and add value to his holding by restoring
profitability as quickly as possible. To do that, he needs control, and the
key question is what level of control he thinks he will be able to exercise
over <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>.
By <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>ConsPress</ORGANIZATION> is believed to have expanded its shareholding
to the 10 per cent ceiling on individual limit on shareholdings imposed by
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s deed of settlement and the federal Bank Shareholdings Act.
The act allows a maximum individual shareholding of 15 per cent, with the
approval of <PERSON>Mr John Dawkins</PERSON>, the federal treasurer (finance minister), who
would have to rule that the increased stake was not against the national
interest.
<PERSON>Mr Dawkins</PERSON>' office said yesterday that <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> had not requested
permission to exceed 10 per cent. However, a <DATE>1986</DATE> precedent involving <PERSON>Mr
John Spalvins</PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION>Adsteam</ORGANIZATION> group suggests he will be allowed to increase his
stake if he wishes.
A 15 per cent holding would not give <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> control. But it would
probably give him two board seats, and a level of influence comparable with
that wielded by the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest financial institution,
which also owns 15 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>.
Given his record, <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s goal would probably be to speed the bank's
return to profitability by accelerating the recovery programme announced
recently by <PERSON>Mr Frank Conroy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> managing director.
Analysts say it is not clear how that might be done. But <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s views
appear remarkably similar to those of the <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION>, which recently gave <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> a
six-month deadline to deliver a significant improvement in performance.
<PERSON>Mr Ian Salmon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> managing director, was enthusiastic about <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s
investment yesterday, suggesting that there may be a degree of common
ground. If that were so, <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s influence could be much greater than
his limited shareholding would suggest.
For the time being, however, there are still no real answers to what
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s most enigmatic businessman is up to. But, barring an unexpected
collapse in the share price, he seems likely to make a healthy profit
whatever happens.

<TEXT>
SENIOR management of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday
given a year to solve the bank's problems before facing pressure for changes
from institutional shareholders.
<PERSON>Mr Ian Salmon</PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest
financial institution, said it had been made clear to <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> management
that the bank's operational performance must be improved quickly.
'They will do it in the course of the next six to 12 months or I guess the
board will decide they can't do it and make some alternative arrangements,'
he said.
The <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder with just under 15 per cent of the
stock and two seats on the board. It has supported the bank's board and
senior managers over the past two years in spite of a series of poor
results.
<PERSON>Mr Salmon</PERSON> said there was no need for further board changes following the
resignations last month of five directors, including Sir <PERSON>Eric Neal</PERSON>, the
former chairman.
However, he said the <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> would 'have something to say' if <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> were not
moving in the right direction within six months. 'We can apply a little bit
of leverage. We have a fair shareholding. I think we would get a lot of
support,' he said.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares fell to a low of ADollars 2.42 on the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock
Exchange</ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON>Mr Salmon</PERSON>'s comments, but recovered to close at ADollars
2.50, down <MONEY>one cent</MONEY> on the day. The shares fell <MONEY>24 cents</MONEY> to a nine-year low
of ADollars 2.51 on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, following the announcement of an unexpected
ADollars 115m (USDollars 80m) tax charge in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
The US tax problem followed a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue and a
disastrous first half, in which the bank incurred a pre-tax loss of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts.

WESTPAC Banking Corpor-ation yesterday announced net losses of ADollars
1.56bn (USDollars 1.07bn) after abnormal items for the year to the end of
<DATE>September</DATE>, a record for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s four national trading banks.
The result contrasted sharply with a ADollars 675m net profit announced by
the more conservatively managed <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this week,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>New Zealand Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION> revealed a net loss of
ADollars 579m.
Westpac reported net profits of ADollars 104m for the <DATE>second half</DATE>, but the
return to profitability was swamped by the bank's first-half loss of
ADollars 1.66bn, which followed a ADollars 2.65bn write-off against bad
loans.
The bank said second-half net profits were ADollars 268m before abnormal
losses of ADollars 106m relating to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> tax, a ADollars 51m pension fund
writedown, and a ADollars 7m writedown of its 6.2 per cent shareholding in
the <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> bank.
The directors cut the final dividend from <MONEY>12 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>6 cents</MONEY>, making a
total of <MONEY>18 cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>24 cents</MONEY>. The board maintained full
franking, but said future increases in dividends would depend on
performance.
The result ends a year during which five directors resigned and the bank was
given six months to improve performance by the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, its biggest
shareholder.
Westpac strengthened its balance sheet after the first half through a
ADollars 1.2bn fully underwritten rights issue, but was embarrassed when
shareholder scepticism left the issue 72 per cent undersubscribed.
Mr <PERSON>Frank Conroy</PERSON>, managing director, acknowledged that the bank would be
vulnerable to a takeover if the federal government relaxed its ban on
mergers between <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s big six financial institutions.
<PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> said shareholders were likely to be 'not very happy' with the
result. However, he said there was 'some evidence' that the bank's
profitability was starting to improve.
Profitability before tax, bad debts and abnormal items had been stable for
18 months at an annualised level of about ADollars 1.3bn. The capital ratio,
which reflects balance sheet strength, had improved from <MONEY>8.4 per cent</MONEY> to 9.7
per cent following the rights issue. And problem assets had fallen to
ADollars 7.6bn from ADollars 8.2bn before specific provisions.
'Taken together . . . we have the foundation from which to recover our
financial performance over time, and reposition the bank to its rightful
place in the market,' <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> said.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> said it intended to reinforce the recovery in profitability by
cutting costs and increasing revenue by ADollars 300m by next <DATE>September</DATE>;
cutting its expense to income ratio from <MONEY>70 per cent</MONEY> to <MONEY>58 per cent</MONEY> over
three years; and reducing its corporate lending assets by ADollars 10bn by
<DATE>1995</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares closed <MONEY>3 cents</MONEY> higher on the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> at
ADollars 2.65, still <MONEY>35 cents</MONEY> below the offer price for the recent rights
issue.

A ADollars 445m (USDollars 324m) break-up bid was launched <TIME>last night</TIME> for

<PERSON>Mr Graeme Hart</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> entrepreneur, is joining forces with
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Coles Myer</PERSON> to acquire and then divide the company.
The bid is being made by Rank Commercial, <PERSON>Mr Hart</PERSON>'s private company, and is
pitched at ADollars 5.27 a share. It is conditional on a minimum acceptance
level of 75 per cent, and on approvals from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Investment
Review Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the competition watchdog.
The <ORGANIZATION>TPC</ORGANIZATION> said it would 'closely examine' the offer, paying particular
attention to the role of <ORGANIZATION>Coles Myer</ORGANIZATION>. Coles is one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest
retail groups.
<PERSON>Mr Hart</PERSON>, a former truck-driver who has built his fortune by buying a series
of companies at knock-down prices, is believed to be one of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s
wealthiest individuals. His Rank company already owns a 14.9 per cent
interest in <LOCATION>Foodland</LOCATION>, most of which was acquired from a single institutional
shareholder last month.
If the offer is successful, <PERSON>Rank</PERSON> says its aim is to spin off <LOCATION>Foodland</LOCATION>'s
substantial <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> assets - which include the <ORGANIZATION>Farmers Deka</ORGANIZATION> discount and
department store group, and a 57.4 per cent interest in the Progressive
supermarkets group - as a separate company, distributing shares in this
entity to <ORGANIZATION>Foodland</ORGANIZATION>'s remaining shareholders.
Rank, which by then would own at least 75 per cent of <LOCATION>Foodland</LOCATION>, would pass
its shares in this new company to <ORGANIZATION>Whitcoulls</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> bookseller and
stationery group.
Rank would offer its remaining stake in <LOCATION>Foodland</LOCATION>, which would be reduced to
its Australian assets only, to <PERSON>Coles</PERSON>. Rank said the break-up bid was being
financed by bank borrowings, to be supplied by <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Credit Suisse</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bank of America</ORGANIZATION>.
The bank facilities were still subject to 'satisfaction of a number of
conditions (including completion of documentation)'.

<HL> Holmes a Court Agreement to Buy Assets From Fairfax Ended by Mutual Consent </HL>

<DATELINE> SYDNEY, Australia  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION>Court</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> ended by mutual consent an agreement under which <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> was to have sold to <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> assets including national daily business newspapers in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> said events beyond both parties' control frustrated their contract, which had called for the payment of about <MONEY>475 million Australian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>$338.7 million</MONEY>) to <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court had been pressing <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> to lower the price, according to sources close to the negotiations, especially after the <DATE>October</DATE> stock-market crash, which has prompted asset sales by the Australian financier's companies. 

   After studying the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> media operations, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court wanted to drop the ones incurring losses. 
Fairfax and <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> also couldn't agree on details of printing and distribution arrangements for the newspapers. 
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> doesn't have a national newspaper network and needed <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> to help with production. 

   Since <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's companies have been shedding assets to raise money for debt payments. 
The sales have raised more than <MONEY>four billion dollars</MONEY>, though they have resulted in losses estimated at <MONEY>512 million dollars</MONEY> for <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court's companies. 

   Fairfax also has been selling assets to cut the borrowing costs of its takeover last year by a member of the founding family, <PERSON>Warwick Fairfax</PERSON>. 
<LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest publisher after <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, has sold its magazine division and some smaller newspapers, but it hasn't been able to complete plans to sell other assets to <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court and <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> had agreed <DATE>last September</DATE> to buy from <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> the daily <ORGANIZATION>Australian Financial Review</ORGANIZATION>, the Australian paper Times on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION>National Business Review</ORGANIZATION> and other media interests. 
Late last year, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court exercised an option to sell the Australian Macquarie radio network back to <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> for <MONEY>158 million dollars</MONEY>. 

   <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> said it is studying ways to keep all or part of the business newspapers and the Times on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
A <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> official said a foreign partner, such as the British publisher <ORGANIZATION>Pearson PLC</ORGANIZATION>, might be sought for the business newspapers. 
Pearson was negotiating with <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court to acquire at least half the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Financial Review</ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> was ended. 

   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Frank Barlow</PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Pearson's Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> unit, said: "We have been informed that the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> do not intend to proceed with the transfer of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Financial Review Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
This does not diminish our interest in this title and we shall now be contacting <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> directly."

   Directors of ELDERS <ORGANIZATION>IXL LTD.</ORGANIZATION> today will consider a major shareholder's restructuring proposals, which analysts said could include selling some of the concern's Australian and British operations to its shareholders and the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Elders</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest company. 

   A restructuring was proposed by <ORGANIZATION>AFP Investment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which controls <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Elders</ORGANIZATION>'s shares and <DATE>Friday</DATE> said it obtained options for another <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT> from <ORGANIZATION>Goodman Fielder Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> from <ORGANIZATION>SA Brewing Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   AFP, which said it won't exercise those options unless <ORGANIZATION>Elders</ORGANIZATION>'s directors agree to a restructuring, didn't give details of its proposals. 

   Analysts said a merger of Elders and <ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION> also is possible. 

   AFP is an investment company with stakes in <LOCATION>Elders</LOCATION>, the textiles company <ORGANIZATION>Linter Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Gestetner Holdings PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, among others. 

   Elders is one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest companies.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Refitted Bond flagship nears
relaunch - Kevin Brown examines the new-look, slimmed-down, renamed Southern
Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond <ORGANIZATION>Corporation Holdings</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Alan Bond</PERSON>'s quoted flagship, is likely to be
relaunched later this year following approval from the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Securities
Commission</ORGANIZATION> (ASC) for a change of name to <ORGANIZATION>Southern Equities</ORGANIZATION>.
The company's impending re-emergence contrasts starkly with the fate of <PERSON>Mr
Bond</PERSON>, the best known of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1980s</DATE> entrepreneurs, who was declared
bankrupt last month after losing a year-long court battle.
<PERSON>Mr Peter Lucas</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>September 1990</DATE> until last month,
says <ORGANIZATION>Southern Equities</ORGANIZATION> will bear little resemblance to <PERSON>Mr Bond</PERSON>'s company.
'We have sold many of the assets to repay debts, and the group is obviously
much smaller than it was, but the really important thing is that despite all
the things that happened, we are still here,' he says.
'Sure, it is with the good grace of our creditors, but nevertheless we were
able to convince them that this was the best way forward. That is very
different to what happened to some of the other entrepreneurial groups.'
<PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> lawyer, resigned last month after steering the group
through the traumatic 18 months since <PERSON>Mr Bond</PERSON> quit under pressure from
shareholders and creditors.
<PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON>'s resignation clears the way for a new management team to take over
after the completion of a financial reconstruction which will transfer 90
per cent of the company's equity to creditors and bondholders.
The distribution of shares is expected to take place as soon as the
administrators of the company's scheme of arrangement finish investigating
claims from creditors, probably by the end of <DATE>June</DATE>.
The principal shareholder is expected to be Australian Consolidated
Investments (Acil), formerly <PERSON>Mr Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court's <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>,
which will emerge with 11 per cent of the expanded equity. Mr Bond's
shareholding will fall from 52 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Shortly after the redistribution, the company will be renamed and its
ADollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.43bn) debt burden will be written off in return
for a payment of ADollars 190m to creditors - an effective payout of <MONEY>10
cents</MONEY> in the dollar.
<PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON>, who remains a consultant to <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> and a member of the
management committee which has run the company for the last year, says
completion of the reconstruction will be the trigger for a fresh start,
following the disposal of much of the group's former ADollars 10bn in
assets.
The disposals included Bond Media, the group's television and radio arm
which was sold to <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Bond Brewing</ORGANIZATION>, once <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s
biggest brewer, which is now controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Lion Nathan of New Zealand</ORGANIZATION>.
The value of the group's remaining assets will remain unclear until the
1991/92 accounts are published, probably in the <DATE>second half of the year</DATE>. But
its main assets are:
A 1.5 per cent shareholding in <ORGANIZATION>BSkyB</ORGANIZATION>, the UK satellite television business,
and convertible loan stock worth Pounds 350m (USDollars 619m). The
shareholding is mortgaged, but <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> says it hopes for some return as
<ORGANIZATION>BSkyB</ORGANIZATION> moves into profit.
A 5.3 per cent stake in <PERSON>G. Heileman</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> brewery once owned by <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>,
which was placed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable
to service its debts.
About ADollars 25m in cash, mostly held by <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries, which the
group is unable to access until the redistribution of shares has taken
place.
Land in <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Queensland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, some of which
could be sub-divided for property development. The group also retains small
investments in a handful of public companies.
Potential tax losses of <MONEY>several hundred millions of dollars</MONEY> as a result of
its ADollars 2.2bn loss in <DATE>1990</DATE>, although it is unclear how the losses will
be treated by the taxation office.
A ADollars 500m claim for damages against the Western Australian government
and two local politicians over a failed attempt to establish a petrochemical
industry in the state.
<PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> remains interested in the petrochemical project,
which collapsed in <DATE>September 1989</DATE> when the state government withdrew its
support following local criticism of the deal.
<ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>, which paid ADollars 400m to buy <ORGANIZATION>Petrochemical Industries</ORGANIZATION> (Picl)
from the Western Australian entrepreneurs <PERSON>Mr Laurie Connell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Dallas
Dempster</PERSON>, claims the government acted in bad faith.
However, <PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON> says the group believes the project remains viable, and
wants to help the state tap the strong demand expected to develop in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>
for the caustic soda, ethylene di-chloride and PVC the plant would produce.
'I believe <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has got a window of opportunity in the next five years
to get this thing up and away. Sooner or later, industrial expansion in
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> will create a huge demand for these products,' <PERSON>Mr
Lucas</PERSON> says.
'Whether <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corporation Holdings</ORGANIZATION> could be involved would depend on the
Western Australian government and the other joint venture partners. But our
discussions with potential investors indicate it could be viable.'
<PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> has substantial expertise which could be made
available to the Western Australian government, together with 'the capacity
to influence the potential participants'.
The state government is also believed to be considering a revival of the
project, but is unlikely to want <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> to play any part unless an
out-of-court settlement of the damages claim can be reached.
Both sides deny suggestions a settlement is being prepared. <PERSON>Mr Lucas</PERSON> says
<ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION> is 'open to compromise, but will not retire without proper
compensation'.

<HL> Bid Is Launched For Bell Group By Bond Corp. --- Offer Seeks to Increase Stake Beyond 19.9% Purchased From Holmes a Court </HL>

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Holdings, which bought a <PERCENT>19.9%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court in late <DATE>April</DATE>, announced a takeover offer valuing <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>860 million Australian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$690.2 million</MONEY>). 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> -- a brewing, media, property and mining concern controlled by Australian financier Alan Bond -- is offering A$2.70 (<MONEY>US$2.17</MONEY>) a share for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>, compared with <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s stock-market price of A$2.10. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>'s holdings include a <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT> interest in <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which in turn owns <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a steel, mining and oil concern that is <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest company. 
Before selling most of his <PERCENT>46%</PERCENT> controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court had used the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> concerns to buy and sell stakes in dozens of companies world-wide in recent years. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s offer is made on condition that <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> not sell any significant assets, and that a <MONEY>A$1.04 billion</MONEY> takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> by two other financiers not succeed. 
In addition to its stake in <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> owns nearly <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The bid for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION> was announced in <DATE>March</DATE> by a joint venture of Sir <PERSON>Ronald Brierley</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> financier, and <PERSON>Kerry Packer</PERSON>, an Australian publisher and investor. 
They own nearly <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Resources</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> is part of a fight for control of the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> companies that started <DATE>April 29</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court sold <PERCENT>19.9%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group to Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>A$2.70</MONEY> a share and another <PERCENT>19.9%</PERCENT> to the <ORGANIZATION>State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>A$2.50</MONEY> a share. 
Those sales sparked an investigation, still under way, by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Companies and Securities Commission</ORGANIZATION>. 
The regulators are concerned that control of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> might have changed hands without minority shareholders being offered a chance to sell at the prices received by <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that after discussions with the regulators, it decided to offer <MONEY>A$2.70</MONEY> a share for all of <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>, other than the <PERCENT>19.9%</PERCENT> held by the state government insurance concern. 
The insurance concern later indicated that it plans to sell its <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION> shares to <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 
An official of the regulatory commission said it approves of <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s offer for <ORGANIZATION>Bell Group</ORGANIZATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP.</ORGANIZATION> sold its two Australian television stations to <ORGANIZATION>WESTFIELD CAPITAL CORP.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION> paid <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> the equivalent of <MONEY>$555 million</MONEY> for the stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, as well as some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording business. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had said it would sell the television stations and concentrate in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> on the print media. 
The sale partially offsets the cost of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which leaves <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s company with about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the total newspaper circulation in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s major cities. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Westfield Capital</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, enters the scramble among Australian companies to set up television networks. 
<ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION> will hold its newly acquired media interests through its <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>-owned <ORGANIZATION>Northern Star Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, which already owns newspapers, radio stations and two television stations in smaller cities. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, <PERSON>David Gonski</PERSON>, said: "Our No. 1 priority will be to go nationwide, either by linking with other networks or by acquisition." 
Analysts said one possibility would be a link with businessman <PERSON>Kerry Stokes</PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s television station in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION> and also owns a station in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> and a license for a station in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> last month became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, and <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> is in position to establish a second network after adding <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> station to its television operations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>WESTPAC Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION> had achieved 'encouraging' operating results for
the <DATE>1991-92 first quarter</DATE>, chairman, Sir <PERSON>Eric Neal</PERSON>, told a long and, at
times, fiery annual meeting in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> yesterday.
Facing a barrage of questions from shareholders dissatisfied with the bank's
performance, Sir <PERSON>Eric</PERSON> said an uncertain economic outlook precluded more
specific profit predictions.
However, he expected the group's troubled finance arm, <ORGANIZATION>Australian Guarantee
Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, to perform this year in line with the year ended <DATE>September,
1991</DATE>, when it made a loss of about ADollars 220m (USDollars 164m).
'<ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has already taken the hard decisions affecting its operations,' Sir
<PERSON>Eric</PERSON> said. 'This will allow the bank to focus on better business
opportunities and to build upon its inherent market strengths.'
'Despite the continuing poor economic conditions, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s operating
results for the <DATE>first quarter of 1991-92</DATE> are encouraging and, if sustained,
offer tangible proof that the worst is behind us.'
Sir <PERSON>Eric</PERSON> received some much-needed public support from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest
investor, the AMP Society, whose managing director, <PERSON>Mr Ian Salmon</PERSON>, told the
meeting the society would immediately purchase 74m <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> shares.
<PERSON>Mr Salmon</PERSON> said the purchase would cost about ADollars 300m. It followed
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s approval from <ORGANIZATION>Federal Treasurer</ORGANIZATION> (chancellor), <PERSON>Mr John

<ORGANIZATION>MACQUARIE Bank</ORGANIZATION>, the privately-owned Australian banking and corporate
advisory group, yesterday announced a 13.6 per cent increase in interim net
profits to a record ADollars 26.6m (USDollars 18.2m) for the six months to
the end of <DATE>September</DATE>.
The result contrasts sharply with big full-year losses announced last week
by <ORGANIZATION>Westpac Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>New Zealand Banking Group</ORGANIZATION>,
two of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest banks.
<ORGANIZATION>Macquarie</ORGANIZATION> said the improved result reflected better trading conditions,
innovative products, and a reduction in write-offs against bad and doubtful
debts to ADollars 1.5m from ADollars 2.7m in the comparable period of the
previous year.
<PERSON>Mr Tony Berg</PERSON>, managing director, said the bank was confident the improved
result would be repeated in the <DATE>second half</DATE>. 'I am confident the economy is
going through a slow recovery,' he said.
<ORGANIZATION>Macquarie</ORGANIZATION> said total assets increased by 28.6 per cent to ADollars 3.04bn,
while group shareholders' funds rose to ADollars 299m from ADollars 272m at
the end of the last full year in <DATE>March</DATE>. The bank said its emphasis on
service and tailored banking products helped expand the branch-banking
business. The property, capital markets, money market and corporate services
divisions also performed well, although fixed interest profits were hit by
difficult conditions in the government and semi-government bond market.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an international media
company controlled by publisher <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it
had arranged to buy nearly all the shares of <ORGANIZATION>Australian Associated
Press Pty</ORGANIZATION>.
   That company, which is no relation to the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, distributes news and photographs throughout
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. It owns a <PERCENT>7.75 percent</PERCENT> voting stake in <ORGANIZATION>Reuters Holdings
PLC</ORGANIZATION>, the large British news and information service.
   If <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON>'s acquisition succeeds, his company would become the
biggest single shareholder in <ORGANIZATION>Reuters because News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> already
owns a <PERCENT>6.8 percent</PERCENT> voting stake in <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which had owned <PERCENT>44.65 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, said it had acquired another <PERCENT>8.3 percent</PERCENT> from
<ORGANIZATION>Bell Group Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a concern controlled by Australian investor <PERSON>Robert
Holmes</PERSON> a Court.
   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it also had agreed to acquire a <PERCENT>44.65 percent</PERCENT>
stake from <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s major media
companies.
   Prices weren't disclosed.
   Murdoch, a native Australian who became a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen in <DATE>1985</DATE>,
already controls about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s press and has
encountered government resistance to an expansion from government
antitrust officials.
   It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON>Murdoch</PERSON>'s arrangement to
effectively acquire the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> would be
blocked by the government. But an official of the <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, which regulates such transactions, said it would
investigate.
   The official, who declined to be identified by name, said
elements of the sale appeared to conflict with an order issued last
year that prevented Murdoch from acquiring the parent company of
the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Associated Press

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings of ADollars 36m for
Fairfax at halfway

JOHN <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, the Australian newspaper group controlled by <PERSON>Mr Conrad Black</PERSON>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> group, has announced interim net profits of ADollars 36m
(USDollars 24.4m) for the six months to end-December.
<LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, which was floated on the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>May</DATE>, said the
figures were not comparable with the first half of the previous year, when
the group was in receivership.
However, the group earned net profits of ADollars 27m in the six months to
<DATE>June</DATE>, after offsetting an income-tax liability of ADollars 11.5m against tax
credits carried over from the receivership. Sales were ADollars 388.5m
compared with ADollars 357.4m in the <DATE>second half of last year</DATE>.
<LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> said it benefited from higher advertising revenue and lower net
interest costs, reflecting <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s falling interest rates and gradual
recovery from recession.
Sales of the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION> and The (<LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>) Age increased, but
the group said the difficult business environment was responsible for a <MONEY>3
per cent</MONEY> fall in the circulation of the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Financial Review</ORGANIZATION>.
The board said it had decided in principle to build a ADollars 300m printing
plant in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>, which is intended to match the improved printing facilities
installed by <ORGANIZATION>News Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest publishing group.
The group said the plant would be operational by <DATE>1996</DATE>, allowing improved
presentation of its newspapers and reducing production costs. 'These factors
are expected to have a significant positive impact on the long term
competitive strength of the company,' the board said.
The directors said there would be no dividend, in line with forecasts in the
flotation prospectus.
The <ORGANIZATION>Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> owns 15 per cent of <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, but has applied to the
federal government for permission to lift its stake to 20 per cent.

The <ORGANIZATION>Trade Practices Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s competition watchdog, expects to
'look very closely' at the ADollars 500m (USDollars 365m) break-up bid
launched on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for <ORGANIZATION>Foodland Associated</ORGANIZATION>, the Perth-based retail and
wholesale group.
The bidder, <ORGANIZATION>Rank Commercial</ORGANIZATION>, a privately-owned <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> company, intends
to divide and sell on <ORGANIZATION>Foodland</ORGANIZATION>'s assets if the offer gains 75 per cent
acceptance.
Its NZ interests would be sold to <ORGANIZATION>Whitcoulls</ORGANIZATION>, a stationery and bookshop
group, while its Australian assets would pass to <PERSON>Coles Myer</PERSON>, one of
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest retailers.
<PERSON>Mr Alan Fels</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>TPC</ORGANIZATION> chairman, said a major area of concern was that <PERSON>Coles</PERSON>
might find it easier to raise prices if it took control of <LOCATION>Foodland</LOCATION>'s
Australian assets. It would move to a very strong position in West
Australian grocery retailing and already has non-controlling interests in
independent wholesalers in other states.
However, the bidding group, which met <ORGANIZATION>TPC</ORGANIZATION> officials yesterday, said it had
no reason to think the commission would block the bid, which is being
contested by <ORGANIZATION>Foodland</ORGANIZATION>.
TPC concerns, meanwhile, failed to halt a <MONEY>76 cent</MONEY> rise in the <LOCATION>Foodland</LOCATION> share
price, to ADollars 5.51 - well in excess of the ADollars 5.27 a share bid
price.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, has filed its
defence documents in the ADollars 4bn environmental lawsuit brought against
it by some 6,000 villagers living around the Ok Tedi copper mine in <LOCATION>Papua
New Guinea</LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION>BHP</ORGANIZATION> manages. It said its defence overall did not vary from
its previous position; that Ok Tedi operates in compliance with <ORGANIZATION>PNG</ORGANIZATION> law and
with the support of its government.
Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewer, has extended its licensed
production and distribution agreement with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Holsten Breweries</ORGANIZATION> to a
national basis. It claimed the arrangements should allow it to become the
top-selling foreign beer in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. It is currently in the number two spot.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Joss takes the hot seat at
Westpac - The problems facing the bank's new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>WESTPAC Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, the troubled Australian bank, has a rule that
only the chairman can be questioned by shareholders at its annual meeting.
It is a convention that will be welcomed by <PERSON>Mr Robert Joss</PERSON>, the Californian
banker appointed last week to <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s vacant chief executive's chair.
<PERSON>Mr Joss</PERSON>, a vice-chairman of <PERSON>Wells Fargo</PERSON>, the San Francisco-based regional
bank, was not present at <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s vitriolic annual meeting, which ended
last week after more than 16 argumentative hours spread over two days. But
after studying <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> over several weeks, he will know for certain what
many shareholders already suspect: that things are likely to get worse
before they get better.
<PERSON>Mr John Uhrig</PERSON>, the no-nonsense miner who took over as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>October</DATE>, gave much the same message to shareholders at the annual meeting,
warning that it would be 'unwise to assume that we will not have to contend
with further setbacks.'
Westpac shareholders have become all too familiar with bad news over the
last year as the bank has been hit by a catalogue of disasters which reads
like the script for a banker's nightmare.
The year started with bad publicity about risky foreign currency loans and
embarrassing leaked letters; it continued with a failed ADollars 1.2bn
rights issue; and it ended with net losses of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars
810.3m) for the year to <DATE>September</DATE>, after writing off bad debts of ADollars
2.6bn.
Five directors quit in <DATE>October</DATE>, including Sir <PERSON>Eric Neal</PERSON>, chairman, followed
in <DATE>December</DATE> by <PERSON>Mr Frank Conroy</PERSON>, chief executive, after a boardroom row over
his recovery plan. Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr Kerry Packer</PERSON> and an associate joined the
board after acquiring 10 per cent of the shares, and promptly walked out of
their first board meeting after another row.
<PERSON>Mr Joss</PERSON>, who will inherit the mess when he arrives in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> later this
month, will be uncomfortably aware of the giant shadows cast over <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> by
the enigmatic <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest financial
institution, which owns 15 per cent of the bank.
Both <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Ian Salmon</PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION>, have made clear
that they want to see a rapid improvement in the bank's fortunes. But there
seems to be little agreement about how the new chief executive should go
about it.
<PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON>, a long-time <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> executive who had held the top job for just
14 months, produced a recovery plan which initially commanded the support of
the entire board.
Under the <PERSON>Conroy</PERSON> plan, the bank would have cut costs and increased revenue
by ADollars 300m by <DATE>September</DATE>; cut its non-interest expense to total income
ratio from <MONEY>70 per cent</MONEY> to <MONEY>58 per cent</MONEY> over three years; and reduced gross
assets by about ADollars 10bn from ADollars 110bn.
<PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> quit because the board, under pressure from <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>, wanted him
to speed up the restructuring. But the board balked at <PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s plans to
put the shake-up in the hands of his American lieutenant, <PERSON>Mr Al Dunlap</PERSON>, who
has acquired the sobriquet 'chainsaw' for his zeal in slashing the costs of
<PERSON>Mr Packer</PERSON>'s private companies.
<PERSON>Mr Joss</PERSON> says his broad strategy is to refocus the bank on its Australian
retail operations, which he believes can be sharpened up sufficiently to
close the gap between <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National Australia Bank</ORGANIZATION> (NAB), which has
an expense-to-income ratio of 57.5 per cent. US analysts say he is highly
regarded for the part he played in guiding <LOCATION>Wells</LOCATION> to recovery from similar
problems to those that face <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>.
'It was a team effort, but he certainly played a big part in it, and that
will stand him in good stead when he takes over at <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>,' says <PERSON>Mr Ray
Soifer</PERSON>, banking analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Brown Brothers Harriman</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
But with no clear guidance from the board, it is not clear how <PERSON>Mr Joss</PERSON> will
approach <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s three main problems:
Poorly-performing international assets. <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has about 48 per cent of
gross assets outside <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, split fairly evenly between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. The worst performing assets are in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,
where <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s inferior credit-rating, caused by its bad debt problems,
makes it impossible to compete with domestic banks.
'They need to run these assets down as quickly as they can,' says <PERSON>Mr Craig
Drummond</PERSON>, banking analyst at JB Were in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>.
'But it is no good just sticking all the capital back in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> because
of the competition from <ORGANIZATION>NAB</ORGANIZATION>. So it has to be handled very carefully.'
Poor return on assets and higher-than-average expenses. Since <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON>'s
departure, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> has indicated that it is considering reducing staff by up
to 20 per cent, or 4,000 people, to help drive down its expenses-to-income
ratio. Redundancies on this scale would bring the bank's staffing into line
with NAB, but if it is done too quickly it could damage the bank's core
retail activities.
'In spite of all its problems, <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s share of the domestic loans and
bills market has remained unchanged at about 17 per cent,' says <PERSON>Mr Drummond</PERSON>.
'The bank has to move quickly to protect that market share, but if it moves
too quickly it will damage the retail franchise, and that is the heart of
the business.'
Bad debts. The key problem is the weak Australian commercial property
market, which has significantly reduced the underlying assets against which
many bad debts are secured. <PERSON>Mr Conroy</PERSON> tried to clear the decks last year.
But <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION> is due to revalue its property portfolio in <DATE>March</DATE>, and analysts
say the crucial <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> market has fallen by more than 10 per cent since the
last revaluation in <DATE>March 1992</DATE>.
The revaluation, one of the 'further setbacks' feared by <PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON>, is likely
to cut a further ADollars 600m from <ORGANIZATION>Westpac</ORGANIZATION>'s property portfolio.
Westpac shareholders went away from last week's annual meeting less than
convinced that the worst is over, but ready to give the new chief executive
a chance.
Can he deliver? '<ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo</ORGANIZATION> managers are among the best the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> has,' says
<PERSON>Mr Campbell Chaney</PERSON>, banking analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Sutro and Co</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
'Several have gone on to clean up other banks, and <PERSON>Joss</PERSON> is equally capable
of doing that.'
Westpac shareholders will be waiting anxiously to see whether this judgment
is correct. If it is not, <PERSON>Mr Uhrig</PERSON> can expect another rough ride at next
year's annual meeting.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell gains 53.6% of Arnotts
with AMP stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> food group, <TIME>last night</TIME> claimed victory over <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION>,
the Australian biscuit maker, after its hostile takeover offer was accepted
by the <ORGANIZATION>AMP Society</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest financial institution.
AMP said it had sold a 6.3 per cent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION>, reducing its stake to
2.2 per cent. This reversed <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION>'s earlier decision to reject <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s
ADollars 9.50-a-share offer, which values <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> at ADollars 1.3bn
(USDollars 870m).
The society's change of heart increases <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s stake in <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> to 53.6
per cent, comfortably in excess of the group's target of 50.1 per cent.
Further acceptances are expected before the bid closes today.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> will be prevented from taking control of <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> by a
shareholding agreement which prevents the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> group from appointing a
majority of board members unless it acquires 85.1 per cent of the shares.
The agreement was drawn up when <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> took a friendly 33 per cent stake
in <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> as part of the company's defence against a hostile bid by
<PERSON>Mr Alan Bond</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corporation Holdings</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr David Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said the group would encourage
<ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> to expand its presence in the growing Asian biscuit market, which it
claims the Australian company has neglected.
<PERSON>Mr Johnson</PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION>'s change of mind was 'wise
and responsible'. He said it would serve the national interest by assisting
<ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> to grow.
<PERSON>Mr Bill Purdy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION>' chairman, said he was 'disappointed' by the <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION>'s
decision, but claimed it was 'out of the question' <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> would gain
control of the board.
The <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> move was criticised by family shareholders, who have campaigned
strongly against <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s offer on the grounds that it would transfer
control of important Australian consumer products to foreign owners.
Ms <PERSON>Alice Oppen</PERSON>, chairman of a shareholder lobby group and a descendant of
one of <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION>' founders, said <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> must have offered 'inducements' to
<ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> to change its decision.
She said family shareholders, who account for more than 20 per cent of the
stock, would try to ensure that <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> was unable to achieve control of
the board.
<PERSON>Mr Leigh Hall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION>'s investment manager, said the society had accepted the
offer because it believed that the bid would not be increased or extended.
AMP was 'sympathetic' to calls for <ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> to remain Australian-owned. But
he said '<ORGANIZATION>Arnotts</ORGANIZATION> is now more than one-half foreign-owned and. . . <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>
will in any event have a considerable input into its operation.
'Given this position, <ORGANIZATION>AMP</ORGANIZATION> considers that the size of the minority Australian
element is no longer a relevant issue.' Arnotts shares closed <MONEY>1 cent</MONEY> lower
at ADollars 9.51.

<HL> Herald Apparently Is Won by Murdoch;
Other Firms Scramble for TV Networks

   <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> apparently won the battle for <ORGANIZATION>Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s largest media group. 
But the reshaping of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s media industry will continue, as the scramble to set up television networks intensifies with the sale of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s stations and the impending sale of those owned by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement <DATE>Friday</DATE> under which <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station for the equivalent of <MONEY>$214.3 million</MONEY>. 
Fairfax also acquired most of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s smaller newspapers in the state of <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Tamworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New South Wales</LOCATION>, paper, for a total of <MONEY>$30.1 million</MONEY>. 
In return, <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> withdrew its bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> and dropped all legal action against <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s competing <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> offer. 

   The agreement paves the way for <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to take control of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s company has acquired nearly <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s shares, and the end of legal actions means he can step in to control the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> board. 

   Fairfax also will ask the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</ORGANIZATION> to stop an investigation into <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 
The tribunal still might continue its investigation, which is based on <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizenship and Australian regulations prohibiting control of television stations here by foreigners. 
But analysts believe such a move isn't likely now that <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> has sold its television operations and <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will sell its two television stations as well. 

   <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> emerged from the transactions as the biggest newspaper publisher in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, with about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the total newspaper circulation in the major cities. 
In addition to its own publications, which already cover most of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s company will retain <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> newspapers in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hobart</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, as well as a string of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> suburban newspapers, several magazines and printing and distribution operations. 

   Analysts said the price paid by <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, while difficult to determine exactly, makes the complicated transactions a bargain for the Murdoch-controlled company. 
After selling the television operations of <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON> might end up paying about <MONEY>$536 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$670 million</MONEY> to greatly expand his newspaper-publishing empire. 

   The active bidding for the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> broadcasting operations pushed their prices well above earlier offers for the stations. 
That effectively reduces the cost to <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>, because it gives <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> additional cash that will go to <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> when it takes control of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, meanwhile, is in position to lead <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s second television network with its acquisition of the <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> station. 
It already owns television stations in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>. 
Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Bond Corp.</ORGANIZATION> became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, when it acquired the television operations of privately owned <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Robert Holmes</PERSON> a Court, a businessman with television stations in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, might join with <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> to establish a national network, analysts speculate. 
<PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, under a previous agreement, is to get the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> newspaper business in his home state of <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, but failed in his bid for <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> television station. 

   But the carving-up of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> also strengthened a competitor of <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> in the race to establish television networks. 
Herald will sell its other television station, in <LOCATION>Adelaide</LOCATION>, plus radio stations in the states of <LOCATION>Victoria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Australia</LOCATION>, to businessman <PERSON>Kerry Stokes</PERSON> for <MONEY>$87.1 million</MONEY>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Stokes</PERSON> owns a television station in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> and a license for a station in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>. 
He also is expected to be a bidder for <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s two television stations, which could make him the leader in a third national network. 

   The buyer of the <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stations is likely to be announced today. 
If another company wins the race for <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s television stations, that bidder is expected to team with <PERSON>Mr. Stokes</PERSON> to form the third network. 
The two <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stations are expected to be sold for a total of about <MONEY>$502.4 million</MONEY>. 

   The carving up of <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> was sparked in part by a government proposal to liberalize laws that currently limit a company to owning only two television stations. 
That liberalization, if approved by parliament, would encourage creation of national networks, which would boost profitability for station owners. 

   The government also proposes to reduce the ability of one company to own both a television station and a major newspaper in any city. 
Such a change could present problems for <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>, which now will own a television station and a newspaper in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. 

   Some further redistribution of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s media business therefore is likely as the television networks are established and rulings are made on newspaper-television cross ownership. 
Owners of the few independent television stations that remain might sell those businesses if they bid for the <ORGANIZATION>News Corp.</ORGANIZATION> stations but fail in those offers. 
And <PERSON>Mr. Holmes</PERSON> a Court, who comes out of the <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> carve-up with few of the spoils, still might fight to improve his position, analysts say.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- The closing of bids last week for
Australia's debt-burdened Fairfax newspapers touched off an
even more contentious debate over the expected sale of some
of the country's most prestigious media assets and fanned
speculation the sale could involve an initial public stock
offering.
   John Fairfax Group Pty. Ltd. has been on the auction block
since December 1990, when bank creditors -- mainly Australia
&amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., ANZ, and Citibank of the
U.S., a unit of Citicorp, who were owed about 1.2 billion
Australian dollars (US$954 million) -- forced the heavily
indebted publisher into receivership.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since then, various foreign and domestic consortia have
been jockeying to gain control of the string of newspapers.
   Together the papers account for about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of newspaper
circulation in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and form the second-largest
publishing group. They are the main opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which controls about <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> of the
nation's newspapers.
   Public debate has raged for months over what is in the
national interest and, therefore, who should control the
<LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> newspapers. In an apparent effort to have a say in
picking the winner, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> government
has tried to avoid setting a firm ceiling on the level of
foreign ownership of newspapers. Prime Minister <PERSON>Bob Hawke</PERSON> has
said the government wants to maintain "flexibility" regarding
the ownership of <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>.
   The ultimate decision on that front will rest with
Treasurer <PERSON>John Kerin</PERSON>, who generally is the final arbiter of
foreign investment in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. He has said he will favor
proposals that restrict foreign control of voting equity to
around <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>.
   The ownership debate became particularly intense last week
as <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> journalists staged a 24-hour strike to picket <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION>.
They called on Australians to close their bank accounts at
ANZ if the bank sold <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Group</ORGANIZATION> to a consortium that
includes <PERSON>Kerry Packer</PERSON>, who owns a national television network
and is the dominant magazine publisher as well as the
country's only billionaire.
   The journalists say they fear that <PERSON>Mr. Packer</PERSON> -- who has
been known to intervene in editorial matters -- might
interfere at <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>. A spokesman for <PERSON>Mr. Packer</PERSON>'s bid says
these fears are unfounded.
   <ORGANIZATION>Baring Brothers Burrows &amp; Partners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION>
investment bank advising the bank creditors on the sale,
didn't return telephone calls for comment. But <PERSON>Mr. Murdoch</PERSON>'s
national paper, The Australian, ran a front-page story
outlining details of a proposed initial public offering of
<ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Group</ORGANIZATION>, which would be partly underwritten by
investment bank <ORGANIZATION>CS First Boston Australia Equities Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. The
proposed listing would raise <MONEY>A$1.5 billion</MONEY>.
   People familiar with <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>'s current financial situation
estimated that amount would pitch the offer at more than 11
times the publisher's <DATE>1992</DATE> cash flow.
   News of the 11th-hour prospective listing, which would be
attractive to bank creditors because they might reap a higher
price than through a private sale, didn't surprise some of
the other bidders. "You don't have to be a genius to work
that out," said <PERSON>Neville Miles</PERSON>, an investment banker advising
<PERSON>Mr. Packer</PERSON>'s consortium. It is designed, he contended, to
keep the bidders "on their toes."
   <ORGANIZATION>Baring Brothers Burrows</ORGANIZATION> hasn't given any indication when
it will name the winning bid, participants involved in the
bidding said.
   According to participants, only three groups have made
offers for <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Group</ORGANIZATION>. The secret bids are widely
believed to be around <MONEY>A$1.3 billion</MONEY> -- just enough to repay
the bankers, but insufficient to pay off approximately <MONEY>A$500
million</MONEY> owed to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors who bought <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION>'s
high-yield junk bonds. Separately, some of those bond holders
are suing <ORGANIZATION>Citibank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>ANZ</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>John Fairfax Group</ORGANIZATION> over the
purchase of those securities.
   <PERSON>Mr. Packer</PERSON> is part of a group headed by Canadian publisher
<PERSON>Conrad Black</PERSON>, who publishes the <ORGANIZATION>London Daily Telegraph</ORGANIZATION>, among
other publications. The BlackPacker consortium is known as
<ORGANIZATION>Tourang Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, and would see <PERSON>Mr. Black</PERSON> holding <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>, <PERSON>Mr.</PERSON> Packer
<PERCENT>14.9%</PERCENT> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investment group <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION> <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT>. The
rest would go to Australian investment institutions and the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> junk bond holders in lieu of their debt claims.
   Because of <PERSON>Mr. Packer</PERSON>'s involvement, <ORGANIZATION>Tourang</ORGANIZATION>'s bid also
faces the scrutiny of antitrust regulators and those
responsible for cross-media ownership rules.
   Another bidder is a consortium headed by <PERSON>Tony O'Reilly</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>H.J. Heinz Co.</ORGANIZATION> chief executive officer who also has
publishing interests in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>. And the third
bidder is an all-Australian group known as <ORGANIZATION>Australian
Independent Newspapers</ORGANIZATION> that was formed to bid for <ORGANIZATION>John
Fairfax Group</ORGANIZATION>. That group has won the financial backing of
most of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s biggest fund managers.
