<DESCRIPT>  SAN-FRANCISCO; MUSIC; SHOW; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  COMPOSER John Adams' "El Dorado" ("The Golden One") was unveiled in a
shimmering world premiere Wednesday night at the San Francisco Symphony, with
Adams conducting.;    This was, in effect, the Berkeley composer's Christopher
Columbus piece, coming just before the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival
in the New World. Instead of focusing on the controversial discoverer,
however, Adams explored the dream of finding a gilded paradise here,
implicitly contrasting that dream with the current ravaging of our planet, one
of Adams' stated concerns.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  REVIEW;  PERFORMANCE;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 11/16/91, pg. 2C); 
Because of an editor's error, a caption in Friday's eye was incorrect. It
should have stated that John Adams' 29-minute "El Dorado" received a standing
ovation from the San Francisco Symphony audience.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His 29-minute work got a standing ovation from many of the <ORGANIZATION>Davies Hall</ORGANIZATION>
patrons. It is so beautifully crafted in a style that is both familiar and
monumental that it likely will be performed and recorded often.;    Snobs may
scoff at <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' tried-and-true writing. There's the familiar crescendoing
pulse in the opening movement ("Bolero," anyone?), and the closing movement
forays into Sibelius-tinged orchestration, New Age sounds, and the <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>
style of phase-shift music begun a generation ago.;    But <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>, 44, remains
one of the champion colorists of the <DATE>late 20th century</DATE>. His minimalism for
maximum orchestra is awe- inspiring, and in "El Dorado" he creates gilded
pyramids of thoroughly consonant sound.;    While most symphonic composers are
still uncomfortable with electronic music, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> is as much at ease with it as
with the full instrumental array on stage, which, for "El Dorado," included an
army of eight percussionists and heavy brass.;    His signal breakthrough in
this piece is the idiomatic integration of two synthesizers into the
orchestral texture. They spray their fine mist of exotic timbres and pitches
through the hall via 10 loudspeakers.;    Clearly <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> has broken through the
computer-phobia rampant at symphonies around the country, and it is high time.
Now any young symphonic composer who doesn't learn to use the synthesizer will
be ill prepared to create 21st-century music.;    The rest of the program
consisted of an Adams orchestration of a piece by <ORGANIZATION>Liszt</ORGANIZATION>, and two Stravinsky
works. I was far more impressed with <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' version of Liszt's "The Black
Gondola" this week than in hearing it at the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> three
months ago. The funereal piece shone <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, illuminated by the expert
players and a more vibrant hall.;    The original Liszt composition was for
cello and piano. Adams' orchestration incorporates a lot of low instruments --
English horn, violas and bass clarinet -- and does so exquisitely. Toward the
end, it employs a celestial choir of cellos. This highly sophisticated,
pictorial piece contrasts markedly with some vacuous Liszt works heard all too
often. It was deliciously chromatic -- and moving, too.;    As a conductor,
<PERSON>Adams</PERSON> has his strong and weak points. "El Dorado" seemed by far the most
successful effort <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. In the two Stravinsky pieces, he blunted the
accents and sapped much of their energy.;    In the prickly <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky Violin
Concerto</ORGANIZATION>, however, soloist <PERSON>Stephanie Chase</PERSON>, formerly of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, gave a
more exciting reading than I have ever heard. I'm baffled why Chase has not
soloed with more of our major orchestras. After melting the hall with the
soulful "Aria II," she gave a masterful version of the tricky finale.;    The
hall needed all the melting it could get. Apparently cool to contemporary
music this <DATE>fall</DATE>, patrons stayed away in droves, just as they did for the
"Pulcinella" program conducted by visiting <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Symphony music director
<PERSON>David Zinman</PERSON> two weeks ago.;    The other Stravinsky work, the whimsical opera
excerpt "The Song of the Nightingale," opened the program. But this time the
nightingale was sedate, with no punch.;    The concert will be broadcast <DATE>Nov.

<LEADPARA>  THE Cabrillo Music Festival is off and running again with what sounds like a
broken record: a new hall, expressive premieres, impressive symphonic music
and depressing acoustics.;    The festival's chancy firsts in soloists,
composer-in-residence, conductor and repertory came off resoundingly at the
prelude concert Thursday, though the new symphony hall is anything but
resounding.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IMPRESSIVE WORKS, DEPRESSIVE ACOUSTICS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Composer-conductor <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' docu-operas "Nixon in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>" (<DATE>1987</DATE>) and "The
Death of Klinghoffer" (<DATE>1991</DATE>) rank as the most talked-about in decades. He
changed styles between them, from a synthesizer-led minimalism in the first to
a diaphanous, non-synthesized orchestration prevalent in the second. In both,
the vocal lyricism, the unambiguous tonality and the importance of understood
text were hallmarks.;    <DATE>Thursday</DATE> provided the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> premieres of two arias
from "Klinghoffer," featuring the title-role protagonist <PERSON>Sanford Sylvan</PERSON>
repeating his triumph. Baritone Sylvan soared with a voice that dripped
honeyed richness in nonpareil abundance; he sounds like this generation's
<ORGANIZATION>Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</ORGANIZATION>, but one with an unmistakable made-in-the-USA stamp,
once again signaling our American singers' coming of age.;    The pieces
offered a modern-day surrealism, whether in the soliloquy of the dying <PERSON>Leon
Klinghoffer</PERSON> during his slow-motion fall from the hijacked cruise ship, or the
strangely poetic "Bird Aria" of the Palestinian killer-terrorist Mamoud,
wistfully reflecting on the beauty of birds overhead.;    In both arias, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>
laid out a spacious, comfortable vocal line for <ORGANIZATION>Sylvan</ORGANIZATION>'s adagios with the
simplicity of a <PERSON>Purcell</PERSON>, committed to spotlighting the text's content rather
than any musical elaborations. Often the orchestra offered little more than
violin-dominated "halos" to encircle and embrace the voice, neatly rendered by
<PERSON>Adams</PERSON> himself on the podium. No hint of his earlier minimalism was evident.;  
 The conclusion is that <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> has again defied pigeonholing. He has entered
many styles with gusto, from chugging chordal repetition to modality to
near-Wagnerian romanticism to honky-tonk to a new post-minimalist
American-folk-like clarity. This versatility is a characteristic of a
tremendously inventive mind having many worlds yet left to conquer at the age
of 44, not all of them operatic.;    One non-operatic foray was his own
orchestration of Liszt's "La lugubre gondola" No. 2 ("The Black Gondola"),
which received its <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> premiere <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Writing late in life, Liszt
prophetically foresaw the death and funerary gondola trip of his son-in-law
<PERSON>Richard Wagner</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> and wrote programmatic music to fit. Though there are
Wagnerian harmonies, and glints of themes recalling the chillingly haunting
<ORGANIZATION>Shepherd</ORGANIZATION>'s Horn solo from "Tristan und Isolde," <ORGANIZATION>Liszt</ORGANIZATION>'s treatment was almost
skeletal, whether in the piano version or in the alternate cello-piano version
played movingly beforehand by cellist <PERSON>Lee Duckles</PERSON> and pianist <PERSON>Emily
Wong-George.</PERSON>;    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> transferred it, I think, too literally to orchestra,
with the string section taking most of the cello part, using almost no
harmonic filling out. The effect was too understated. Apart from Liszt
himself, no one short of <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> should have carried out the orchestration. And
<PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> would have colored it so powerfully, so richly, that he'd have been
denounced as vehemently as <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON> is for his colorized movie classics.;   
The <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> Cruz Civic Auditorium, looking like a near-clone of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s, is a
Spartan half-century-old site better known for basketball than <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Brahms</PERSON>. It lacks warmth on all fronts, but it offers capacity (900 seats for
this festival configuration), visibility and proximity. The most distant seat
sold is less than 80 feet from the podium, which is near center court on the
raised temporary stage.;    The auditorium sound for orchestra is pale and
distant. Future pressure will certainly come to amplify the orchestra as in
years past, despite all the (justified) kicking and screaming about sound
systems that have hardly proven state-of-the-art.;    The auditorium's big
plus is for chamber music, when the acoustic shell is drawn close to the
audience. The results then are downright gratifying, and no microphones need
to intrude.;    In addition, this 29th reprise of the fest born in <LOCATION>Aptos</LOCATION> is
offering pre-concert festivities out in the blocked-off street, with al fresco
dinners along with free local musical groups playing 75 minutes before curtain
time.;    There's even a booth selling numerous recordings made by Music
Director <PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON> (who is on sabbatical), but so far none of the
many CDs of his internationally toasted <DATE>1991</DATE> fill-in, <LOCATION>Adams.</LOCATION>;    That should
change quickly if <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' impressive opening concert is any guide.;    CABRILLO
NOTES -- Tickets remain for all festival concerts except for the two San <PERSON>Juan
Bautista</PERSON> "run-out" concerts <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. . . . <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' "Klinghoffer" opera makes its

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Sizzler in the concert hall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Paul Driver</ORGANIZATION> reviews <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' new concerto conducted by <ORGANIZATION>Ken Nagano
The London Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>'s concert under <PERSON>Kent Nagano</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Barbican Hall</ORGANIZATION>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> was designed to be sizzling and balletic: <ORGANIZATION>Ravel's La Valse</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Prokofiev</ORGANIZATION>'s Romeo and <PERSON>Juliet</PERSON> ballet suite and the European premiere of the
Violin Concerto by the American <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> (born <DATE>1947</DATE>), a composer renowned
for heady minimalist rhythmic intensities. <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> is a leading exponent of
<ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>'s work, having launched (and latterly recorded) his opera The Death of
<PERSON>Klinghoffer</PERSON> and performed many of his other pieces.
He is also a guaranteed sizzler in the concert hall. His account of <ORGANIZATION>Ravel</ORGANIZATION>'s
bewitching yet brutally vivid 'choreographic poem', that strangely extrovert
threnody for the old <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, which begins in the ballroom to end on the
battlefield, made one feel the truth of all those epithets and brought home
the sheer sonorous power of the <ORGANIZATION>LSO</ORGANIZATION>, especially in the lower and darkly
rumbling registers. No matter how dark and rumbling the sounds, they were
always precisely focussed: little curling counterpoints took on chilling
force.
Adams's concerto, written in <DATE>1993</DATE> and premiered in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE>
(with soloist <PERSON>Jorja Fleezanis</PERSON>) is also a kind of choreographic poem, having
been jointly commissioned not only by two orchestras (<LOCATION>Minnesota Orchestra</LOCATION>;
LSO) but by the <LOCATION>New York City Ballet</LOCATION>. Adams's strict, often motoric rhythmic
manner and colourful (but often inwardly complex) imagery lend themselves
readily to dance.
His <DATE>1988</DATE> score Fearful Symmetries has been choreographed no less than six
times, most recently by <PERSON>Ashley Page</PERSON>, whose Royal Ballet version opened at
Covent Garden last week.
But it was out of the experience of opera composing, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> writes, that the
present concerto sprang. To him it illustrates a melodic and harmonic
flexibility and a contrapuntal richness alien to the minimalist rigour of
his earlier work but called for by <ORGANIZATION>The Death of Klinghoffer</ORGANIZATION> and now the
basis of what he calls a 'post-Klinghoffer', or post-minimalist, language.
Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific <ORGANIZATION>Philip Glass</ORGANIZATION> have
tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking
the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if
the part-writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the
rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes.
The orchestra used is small (double winds), but a large assortment of
percussion and a pair of synthesisers make up the odds. When the latter are
not spending time perversely imitating the harp, they contribute some novel,
ethereal effects. There are the three movements, fast-slow-fast, traditional
to a concerto: the second a gently musing and attractive Chaconne with the
curious subtitle 'Body through which the dream flows'; the third an
exceptionally lively Toccata with extra bite supplied by claves and cowbell.
The solo part, brilliantly despatched by <PERSON>Gidon Kremer</PERSON>, is full of
traditional figurations and devices. With likeable impunity and verve, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>
has produced a virtuoso vehicle in something like the grand romantic manner.

<LEADPARA>  IN THE heyday of Verdi, Rossini and Puccini, opera houses vied to perform the
star composers' latest works before the clamoring public.;    One man commands

<MEMO>  PERFORMANCE  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Earlier this month the low-key, local-boy-turned-star <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> was back home
briefly between conducting the <LOCATION>Cleveland Orchestra</LOCATION> and recording his opera
with the <ORGANIZATION>Opera de Lyon</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. It's that kind of life now: commissions,
major engagements, jet commutes, 15-hour days.;    At 44, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> still manages
the aw-shucks, pebble-kicking quality that has endeared him to the Bay Area
musical community since joining the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Conservatory of Music</ORGANIZATION>
faculty in <DATE>1972.</DATE>;    Music macabre;  Now it's Cabrillo's turn. In the biggest
coup since engaging Music Director <PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music
Festival</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> has <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> on the podium for two weeks during <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>'
sabbatical year.;    The kind of audacity marking <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' guest-conducting
programs around the country is being carried over to <LOCATION>Cabrillo</LOCATION>. Few
composer-conductors have the panache to open their festival with such morbid
morsels as their own "Aria of the Falling Body," and close with <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>'s
"Songs on the Death of Children" and <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Sinfonia da requiem," after
several equally lugubrious selections.;    The edge of the new;  While <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mahler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Britten</PERSON> all get attention, the Cabrillo focus is on newer music, in
which the composer-conductor offers special insights, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> points out.;   
"It's helpful on both sides. My composing informs my conducting. When doing
music of other composers, I have a different intuition.;    "Also my
conducting informs my composing -- I'm aware of necessities, of what
instruments can and cannot do, and what can be done in limited rehearsal
time.";    The <DATE>1991</DATE> Cabrillo sojourn getting into full swing tonight could be
termed a season of mystical horizons. It offers <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s songs on <PERSON>William
Blake</PERSON>, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' stunning vocal concert piece "The Wound-Dresser," his own
orchestration of Liszt's "The Black Gondola" (a preview of his
premiere-studded <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Symphony program in the fall), part of
<PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Kingdom of the Pagodas," and <PERSON>Milhaud</PERSON>'s "The Creation of the World"
(danced by <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Beal &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>).;    Overriding it all is the shadow of <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>'
opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer," a work based on the Palestinian hijacking
of the "Achille Lauro" cruise ship in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. The work will
not reach the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> until <DATE>November 1992</DATE>, but Cabrillo scheduled
excerpts and offers performances by its title-role singer, baritone <PERSON>Sanford
Sylvan.</PERSON>;    Because of the opera, a <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> theme overlays the concerts
the <DATE>second weekend</DATE>, with <PERSON>Nazim Ozel</PERSON> on Turkish flute and "semi-civilized tree"
(a custom-made, plucked musical instrument) <DATE>Aug. 3</DATE>, and a collaboration by
<ORGANIZATION>Group Parvaneh</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ballet Afsaneh</ORGANIZATION> with Turkish and Persian music and dance
<DATE>Aug. 4.</DATE>;    Modern melodies;  But nothing is a one-man show, not even with
<PERSON>Adams</PERSON> around. Music Director <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> collaborated via long distance in the
programming decisions. <PERSON>JoAnn Falletta</PERSON> leads the juried concert of music by
living <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> composers <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, with pieces by <PERSON>Ross Bauer</PERSON>,
<PERSON>David Jaffe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Stefan Carow</PERSON>, <PERSON>Allen Shearer</PERSON> and "the other" <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, <PERSON>John
Luther</PERSON> Adams.;    This Cabrillo season features prominent soloists such as
violinist <PERSON>Stephanie Chase</PERSON> and pianist <PERSON>Richard Goode</PERSON>, and finally what may be
an end to the nomadic Cabrillo life: an entry into the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Civic
Auditorium</ORGANIZATION>, thanks to a <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> renovation. The face-lift instantly converts
the 1,950-seat hall into a 970-seat concert site with new lighting, sound

FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: American symphonists - Andrew Porter reviews much
noisy, angry, well meaning music and has to cover his ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to a recent survey by the <ORGANIZATION>American Symphony Orchestra League</ORGANIZATION>,
covering five years of programmes by the leading orchestras, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> (the
composer of the operas <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and The Death of Klinghoffer) is the
living American composer most often played. <PERSON>Kurt Masur</PERSON> began his
directorship of the <LOCATION>New York Philharmonic</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>'s Short Ride in a Fast
Machine and <PERSON>Tromba Lontana</PERSON>, two short works, one loud and one soft. El
Dorado, <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>'s latest orchestra piece, was given its premiere recently by
the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>, which commissioned it. It's about 'the greed of
the eighties', we are told, with a first movement, angry and violent, that
is 'my own response to the Gulf War'.
I've not heard <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION>, but last month in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> there were two
symphonies containing much angry, noisy music. <PERSON>John Corigliano</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>First
Symphony</ORGANIZATION> was inspired by the sight of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, those
thousands of commemorative panels for those who have died. Each movement
recalls a lost musician friend. The first, 'Of Rage and Remembrance', begins
'ferociously' and includes pages on end of slashing chords marked 'tutti as
loud as possible', but in a quiet episode a distant piano is heard playing
the <ORGANIZATION>Albeniz Tango</ORGANIZATION>, a favourite piece of the pianist friend remembered.
The central movement, a <LOCATION>Tarantella</LOCATION>, recalls a friend in the music business,
famed for his wit, who became mad; a trivial tarantella tune is put through
increasingly horrible distortions. Corigliano found the motto theme of the
finale, 'Giulio's Song', while listening to 30-year-old tapes of himself and
a cellist friend improvising. Played by a solo cello, it begins with the
whole-tone ascent that in <ORGANIZATION>Berg</ORGANIZATION>'s Violin Concerto spells 'Es ist genug'.
Other themes join it; in the score they are named, and the names are those
of musician friends who have died. The music mounts to a battering funeral
march, with the clash and clamour of bells; in a quiet coda earlier themes
are recalled.
The work was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, which gave the first
performance, under <PERSON>Barenboim</PERSON>. It was recorded (<ORGANIZATION>Erato</ORGANIZATION>); the disc has stayed
for months in Billboard's Classical Top Ten; <PERSON>Corigliano</PERSON> won the Grawemeyer
Award, music's 'Nobel Prize'. (<PERSON>Birtwistle</PERSON>, for The Mask of Orpheus; <PERSON>Ligeti</PERSON>,
for the piano Preludes; and <ORGANIZATION>Chinary Ung</ORGANIZATION>, for <ORGANIZATION>Spiral</ORGANIZATION>, were earlier winners.)
At the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> premiere, which was given by the <ORGANIZATION>Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON>Leonard
Slatkin</PERSON>, panels of the Quilt hung in the lobby of <PERSON>Fisher Hall</PERSON>, and the
audience was invited to inscribe the names of dead loved ones on a new
panel. The emotional charge was high. The critic must steel his heart to say
that, for all the pain and grief and love that it expresses, the musical
means of expression are undistinguished, conventional, obvious. The <ORGANIZATION>New York
Times</ORGANIZATION> went so far as to call the result 'vulgar'.
Aaron <PERSON>Jay Kernis</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Second Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, which was given its first performance by
the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey Symphony</ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON>Hugh Wolff</PERSON>, addresses even more 'the endless
violence of the Gulf War, the subtle and unsubtle encroachment upon women's
and minority rights, the hovering threat of censorship of artists along with
the economic, social, and medical disasters that plague us daily'. Adams is
45, <PERSON>Corigliano</PERSON> is 54; <PERSON>Kernis</PERSON> is a younger composer, born in <DATE>1960</DATE>, who has
become very prominent. He wrote some good, exuberantly inventive works in
his youth: Dream of the Morning Sky (<DATE>1983</DATE>), for soprano and orchestra; Love
Scenes (<DATE>1987</DATE>), for soprano (Dawn Upshaw) and cello. But now, as work after
work after work pours out, he seems content to press the conventional
response triggers.
His first symphony, Symphony in Waves, had its premiere earlier this season
from the <ORGANIZATION>New York Chamber Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, and has been recorded. It included
Adams-like passages of minimalism. The movements of the <ORGANIZATION>Second Symphony</ORGANIZATION> are
entitled 'Alarm' 'Air/Ground', and 'Barricade'. The first, marked
'aggressively', contains wave upon wave of noisy climax underpinned by
ostinato. In the second, simple melodies wander over 'grounded' harmonies.
While writing the third, <PERSON>Kernis</PERSON> says, 'a recurring image was the building
full of innocent Iraqi civilians under siege which was mistakenly bombed and
obliterated nearly a year ago'; it ends with the loudest noise I have ever
heard in a concert hall - four tam-tams whacked 'at maximum volume' for five
long seconds. Audience and orchestra players covered their ears.
Crash-bang - alternating (but not always) with episodes soft, sentimental,
and soupy - has become the mode of the successful American orchestra works
taken up in city after city. <ORGANIZATION>Del Tredici</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> screams at the top of her
voice; he himself describes his Steps, composed for the <LOCATION>Philharmonic</LOCATION>, as
'violent and raucous . . . clattering . . . Godzilla battling Megalon'. This
is music for people already half-deafened, responsive only to high-decibel
assault. And he is not the only composer who writes it.
Poster-art is in vogue. American orchestras (and their conductors) -
shunning <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, Sessions, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> - embrace it. When not strident, it's
'nostalgic'. In the programme that brought the <PERSON>Kernis</PERSON>, there was a 'new'
Flute Concerto, by <PERSON>Joseph Turrin</PERSON>, in sub-Prokofiev vein. In the <ORGANIZATION>Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION>
programme after the one that brought the <PERSON>Corigliano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Slatkin</PERSON> championed
<PERSON>Claude Baker</PERSON>'s Shadows, a 'Japanese' piece such as many composers have
written: a flower arrangement of exquisite sounds - scratch, patter, tinkle
and ting - based on four haiku but also (with full acknowledgement and
near-quotation) on movements by <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>. Dainty
working, no harm it in at all - and no sustenance. We might as well have
been listening to <PERSON>Takemitsu</PERSON>.

<LEADPARA>  HAS any performance in Mission San Juan Bautista ever started on time?;    The
mission is still a working church, and its calendar of weddings and
christenings bumps up against the Cabrillo Music Festival, El Teatro Campesino
and other users. On Sunday afternoon, Cabrillo's concert was delayed about 20
minutes by an annual ceremony in which local Indians forgive the church for
crimes committed against them in the name of Christianity. (Pretty generous of

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The concert was a beauty, despite being upset by the abrupt departure of
its Franco-Romanian concertmaster, <PERSON>Romuald Tecco</PERSON>, to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> for his mother's
funeral.;    'Klinghoffer' aria substituted; Instead of the <PERSON>Shostakovich</PERSON>
violin concerto he was to have played, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, guest music director for
the <DATE>1991</DATE> season, substituted "The Bird Aria" from his own opera, "The Death of
Klinghoffer." (It is scheduled for <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1992</DATE> season.);    The
aria is sung by the Palestinian Mamoud as he watches the birds from the deck
of the doomed ship <PERSON>Achille Lauro</PERSON>: "Messengers of God . . . angels free to
marry and die," he calls them (in <PERSON>Alice Goodman</PERSON>'s lovely text).;    Its winged
imagery was complemented by "The Black Gondola," a barcarolle for piano (1882)
by <PERSON>Franz Liszt</PERSON>, transcribed by <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> in the dark colors of French and English
horns and massed cellos.;    Civil War horrors;  The second half grew even
darker with "The Wound-Dresser," a tableau for baritone and orchestra by
<ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>, to a text by <PERSON>Walt Whitman</PERSON>. This prose-poem, based on <ORGANIZATION>Whitman</ORGANIZATION>'s
experiences as a medical orderly during the Civil War, describes the horrors
of war's aftermath in unflinching terms. Whitman faced gangrene and amputated
limbs, infected wounds and unstoppable bleeding as bravely as any more
celebrated war hero, and his compassion for the dying soldiers makes the poem
bearable.;    It's not a likely subject for the concert hall, but <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> has
made it into a powerful piece of musical painting. It was written for <PERSON>Sanford
Sylvan</PERSON>, an American baritone with an exceptionally resonant and lustrous
voice. (He also sang the "Klinghoffer" excerpt.) He's so compelling that even
depressing sentiments became things of beauty in his voice. He sings again at
<TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>: a cycle of songs by <PERSON>Benjamin Britten</PERSON>, to poems of <LOCATION>William
Blake.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> filled out the program with <PERSON>Haydn</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Symphony No.</ORGANIZATION> 83, subtitled
"La Poule" or "The Hen" because of an oboe tune that supposedly sounds like
clucking) and <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> (Symphony No. 39). These were performed with zest and
even brilliance, despite a few orchestral slips. The <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> got a big,
generous performance, making one appreciate <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' gifts as a legit (as
opposed to a strictly new music) conductor.;    Amplified gospel suffers; 
With its thick adobe walls and plain box shape, the mission is kind to
classical music. The Cabrillo orchestra sounds like the <LOCATION>Vienna Philharmonic</LOCATION>
here, yet preserves the agility of a chamber ensemble.;    The Elements of
Praise, a contemporary gospel choir from <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, were not so fortunate. These
lively acoustics took their amplified arrangements, chewed them up and spit
them out as gibberish. However, the evangelical arm-twisting that connected
their songs came through loud and clear and offensive.;    The festival moves
back to <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> for its second weekend of performances.;  
  <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music Festival</ORGANIZATION>; Through: <DATE>Sunday</DATE>; Where: Civic Auditorium, 301

<TEXT>
In the <DATE>1970s</DATE> <PERSON>George Crumb</PERSON> was the most performed of contemporary American
composers, a success founded on his knack of offering all the exotic
textural trappings of the avant garde within a friendly sugar-coated shell.
Twenty years on it is <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> who occupies a similar position of eminence
in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. Adams's confections may be sugar-free yet they have their own
surface allure, even if in keeping with the spirit of the <DATE>1990s</DATE> it is a far
more astringent one.
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> Adams himself conducted the <LOCATION>London Sinfonietta</LOCATION> in a programme of
contemporary American works, three of them UK premieres, which ended with
<ORGANIZATION>Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children</ORGANIZATION>. The song cycle was beautifully delivered
by the mezzosoprano <PERSON>Christine Whittlesey</PERSON> and treble <PERSON>Sam Pay</PERSON>, yet sounds now
a museum piece, the thin musical substance sustained only by its web of
cultural references and the undimmed beauty of the <LOCATION>Lorca</LOCATION> text.
There just might be more magic left in the sounds than was obvious here, for
<ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION> conducts rather as he composes, with bold poster colours and bracing
rhythmic energy which leave precious little room for subtlety or magic.
Certainly <PERSON>Peter Lieberson</PERSON>'s nimble Raising the Gaze would have benefitted
from more air and awareness of light and shade than <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and the
Sinfonietta instrumentalists suggested, while <PERSON>Tod Machover</PERSON>'s Song of Penance
seemed over-insistently eloquent.
<PERSON>Machover</PERSON>'s was, though, an intriguing construction, with a solo
computer-linked 'hyperviola' (played by <PERSON>Paul Silverstone</PERSON>) set against dense
textures which combined live and pre-recorded instruments and voices. A
specially commissioned poem serves as thematic backbone; it appears in both
spoken and sung form throughout the work, usually embedded deep in the
textures, while the hyperviola alternates keening chromaticism with ripe
romantic harmonies. The mixture is beguiling and repellent by turns like
latter day Skryabin; the sheer density of the sound world is seductive in
itself.
There was some new Adams too, a Chamber Symphony completed <DATE>last year</DATE> which
was receiving its first British performance. The Schoenbergian echoes of the
title belie the musical substance. There are three movements with
calculatedly memorable titles  - '<ORGANIZATION>Mongrel Airs</ORGANIZATION>', 'Aria with Walking Bass',
'Roadrunner'  - and plenty of spiky stylistic allusions along the way.
The first movement jumbles Soldier's Tale Stravinsky with <PERSON>Threepenny Opera
Weill</PERSON>, the second unfolds an increasing elaborate skein of lyrical lines
over a constantly mobile bass, while the finale is an extrovert romp, highly
virtuosic (brilliantly played by the Sinfonietta) and propelled by a
rock-like rhythmic pulse. It is artfully put together, undeniably attractive
and ultimately, I suspect, totally specious.

<LEADPARA>  CANDIDATES for San Jose Symphony's music directorship are being aggressively
courted by rival organizations, just as though they were the most eligible
bachelors at the prom.;    Leonid Grin, the Soviet emigre who scored such a
vibrant success with critics and audiences when he was guest conductor in
February, looked like the front-runner for a similar vacancy at the Spokane,
Wash., Symphony. Spokane reps even traveled to hear him in San Jose, and Grin
went to Spokane to conduct some audition rehearsals.;    But now, amid great
sighs of relief by local symphony-watchers, Spokane has named another Soviet
emigre -- Vakhtang Jordania -- as its music director. So Grin remains in the
running for San Jose -- at least until the next offer pops up on his fax

opera may be too political for its own good. Even with the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war

resulted in the death of one passenger, an escape by air, an interception by

"The Marriage of Figaro," "Rigoletto" and "Un ballo in maschera.";    Next

between composer <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and stage director <PERSON>Peter Sellars</PERSON> is being orchestrated
with a news brownout. There are no interviews, and, until two weeks before the

Slatkin</PERSON>. The Philharmonic was to make an Easter tour, while the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>
orchestra was to have gone in February.;    THE COMPUTER-MUSIC studio at

  "That (high a sound level) is utterly against my philosophy, but I can't be
tyrannical," says studio director <PERSON>John Chowning</PERSON>. The concert also features
composers from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and Stanford.;    On a more harmonious note, <PERSON>Chowning</PERSON>
is working to bring over from the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> the legendary <PERSON>Leon Theremin</PERSON>, who

<DESCRIPT>  DANCE; REVIEW; SANTA-CRUZ  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE 29th annual Cabrillo Music Festival finally engaged Santa Cruz's own Tandy
Beal &amp; Company to present a program Saturday afternoon. Banding with Beal
produced a world premiere choreography, as well as that marvelous
Genesis-in-rewind-mode dance called "La creation du monde" (The Creation of
the Earth).;    The pairing was a congenial one, echoed by a ballet-inspired
orchestral program given Friday night, also under John Adams' baton.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TANDY BEAL'S CHOREOGRAPHY BRINGS QUIRKINESS
TO CABRILLO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Concert Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Dancer-choreographer <PERSON>Beal</PERSON> is bursting in quirky moves and instant
Chaplin-like humor, mixing mimic fun with sight-gag theater, using the arms
more than legs for the center of attention.;    In her new piece "Sequenza V,"
named after <PERSON>Berio</PERSON>'s solo-trombone avant-garde composition, she turned musician
<PERSON>Daniel Livesay</PERSON> into an actor, and surrounded him with masked figures hidden in
Picasso-like cubisms -- cone shapes, zany paste-on eyes and "wrong-place"
facial features.;    She feeds the creative furnaces by putting musical notes
into a giant music machine, and ends it all with an action-painting sequence
leaving the scene as wildly color-splotched as the music itself. I think
<PERSON>Luciano Berio</PERSON> would enjoy <PERSON>Beal</PERSON>'s responsiveness to his music and like the
novelty of those paste-on noses, mouths and ears.;    An imaginative Beal; 
We've already had do-it-yourself. It took <ORGANIZATION>Beal</ORGANIZATION> to dream up glue-it-yourself.; 
  <ORGANIZATION>Beal</ORGANIZATION> tore up the original scenario for "La creation du monde," the
pioneering <DATE>1923</DATE> dance score by composer <PERSON>Darius Milhaud</PERSON>. Her view now has the
Creation in reverse -- an idea very appealing philosophically to us troubled
modern urban-dwellers. The couples dancing in ballrooms undergo a transition
of decay and disruption. Plant life runs amok, supplants the architecture, and
creates an <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION> with the dancers becoming restored <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and Eves. The piece
is a marvelous reflection on our civilization, further allowing set designer
<PERSON>Kevin</PERSON> Constant to produce verdant vines as if out of a Rousseau primitive
painting.;    <PERSON>Beal</PERSON>'s six dancers stood aside for her rapid-fire solo
"Mysterious Barricades," a funny invention of limbs turning into mirrors, of
twitches, of snaky undulations, and of hands that grab where they shouldn't,
all at such a wild pace that it's almost over before it starts.;    Live music
was used throughout -- a welcome luxury for <ORGANIZATION>Beal</ORGANIZATION>, allowing <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' festival
orchestra to shine in the <LOCATION>Milhaud</LOCATION> piece. <PERSON>William Trimble</PERSON>'s alto sax solo
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> was delicious.;    <PERSON>Milhaud</PERSON> always insisted this was the first jazz
used in serious concert music. Its recurrent oboe solo also apparently
inspired a major theme of <PERSON>George Gershwin</PERSON>'s "Three Preludes" (<DATE>1926</DATE>) for solo
piano.;    "I don't really like new music," composer-conductor <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>
insists publicly. He made an exception for <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when he programmed
"Eros Piano" (<DATE>1989</DATE>) by -- surprise! -- <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> himself. The orchestral part
is almost non-existent. The piano part <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> was turned over to <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>'
longtime friend <PERSON>Mack McCray</PERSON>, who recreated this tribute to that new-age
classicist among composers, the late <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> Feldman.;    This is a nostalgic
mood piece, conjuring up visions of late-night clouds of cigarette smoke, as
wispy as the limpid jazz harmonies clinging around the keyboard during this
14-minute <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> premiere.;    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' concert programming was effective. Two
ballet scores complemented each other with their sonic zing and percussive
sparkle. Adams unearthed a long swatch of act-two music from <PERSON>Benjamin
Britten</PERSON>'s exotic fairy tale "The Prince of Pagodas" (<DATE>1957</DATE>). Most of it follows
the soft-focus Holst-Delius strain common in English music. But one magical
number has the most astute orchestral-percussion simulation of the highly
volatile Balinese gamelan (traditional percussion orchestra) that you'll ever
hear.;    <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s effect;  The short gamelan section rings with the "beats"
of nearly attuned pairings, with the serene tootling of high flute, and with
the highly agitated explosions of metallic sounds. This was all a result of a
single <DATE>1956</DATE> Balinese visit by the brilliantly adventurous <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>, who
assimilated one of the richest and most complex musical traditions in that
brief exposure.;    His uneven story ballet -- all about a Cinderella in an
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> land of magic -- offers several instrumental solos, and a bracing
musical "collision" of orchestra with off-stage trumpets doing their own
thing.;    <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>'s revolutionary <DATE>1911</DATE> ballet score "Petrouchka" was an
apt companion piece, even with <ORGANIZATION>Conductor Adams</ORGANIZATION> whittling down its exclamation
points and irreverent outbursts in his interpretation.;    Once again the
orchestra under <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> showed indifferent polish and accuracy. But these two
opuses offered some colossal solo work by principal players like <PERSON>William
Winant</PERSON> (percussion), <PERSON>Adam Gordon</PERSON> (trumpet), <PERSON>Emily Wong-George</PERSON> (piano) and the
remarkable concertmaster <PERSON>Elizabeth Baker</PERSON>. <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was subbing superbly on
emergency basis for <PERSON>Romuald Tecco</PERSON>, who had a death in the family.  </TEXT>

   Cabrillo Festival: New Music in Garlic Land

<LP>
   Santa Cruz, Calif. -- The most dramatic way to approach
Santa Cruz is by driving west, entering the coastal region
through Gilroy, the garlic capital of the world. The aroma of
a dozen Little Italys penetrates a car's closed windows. The
radio suddenly seems overrun by new-age music stations and
earnest '60s-style Berkeley radicals. When the ocean appears,
its spectacular beauty takes your breath away.
   It's a particularly appropriate route to take if you
happen to be headed for the Cabrillo Music Festival, where
pre-concert pastries include such local specialties as
garlic-bread pudding, where a Saturday-night concert can pair
a fine performance of a Benjamin Britten song cycle with the
work of a tedious new-age Turk, and where a pervasive '60s
informality can be both endearing and infuriating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Cabrillo festival was begun 29 years ago by the dean
of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> composers, the wonderfully lyric and
unpredictably multicultural <PERSON>Lou Harrison</PERSON>, as a quirky
chamber-music series in a coffee-house hangout for <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo
College</ORGANIZATION> students in nearby <LOCATION>Aptos</LOCATION>. It grew quickly, moving to
the college itself and later to a convivial circus tent on a
thrilling site at the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, overlooking the sparkling bay.
   In <DATE>1974</DATE>, it hired an up-and-coming young conductor, <PERSON>Dennis
Russell Davies</PERSON>, then music director of the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul Chamber
Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> put together a first-rate small
orchestra, invited world-class composers each year,
commissioned and premiered important work and created
arresting programs. One year, for instance, he featured works
in every concert by <ORGANIZATION>Ravel</ORGANIZATION>, the American eclecticist <PERSON>William
Bolcom</PERSON> and the eccentric Estonian minimalist Arvo Part.
   Meanwhile, however, the festival has fallen on leaner
times. For the first time in 17 years, <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> -- who is
now music director of the city of <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, as well as of the
<LOCATION>Brooklyn Philharmonic</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>American Composers Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> --
took a sabbatical, leaving his future involvement with the
festival uncertain.
   The festival itself has the same economic troubles every
small-scale arts organization has these days, and it has
hired new management to address the situation. No longer able
to afford its sensational site, it has moved to the unwieldy
and acoustically unflattering Civic Auditorium in depressing
downtown <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION>.
   But the festival's spirit survives, and it continues to
offer two of the most thoughtful and original <DATE>summer</DATE> musical
weekends anywhere in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   Actually, this year's festival looked, on paper,
considerably more conventional than it generally does when
<PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> programs it. But, thanks to a brilliant stroke, it
wasn't. By inviting the composer <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> as guest
director, <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION> ensured that however common the
repertoire, it would be filtered through the sensibility of a
controversial composer who is also proving to be an
interesting conductor. He is best known for his operas "Nixon
in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>" and the new "The Death of Klinghoffer," which
reaches the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> next month at the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Academy of Music</ORGANIZATION>.
Often cast as a minimalist, <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> employs minimalist
repetition as only one facet of his multistylistic approach,
which can include everything from American swing to
Schoenbergian dissonance. At <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION>, he showed himself to
be simply uncategorizable.
   He began the festival's second and more elaborate weekend,
the one I attended, with the American premiere of his "Eros
Piano," a moving short elegiac score for piano and chamber
orchestra that sounds a little bit like the '50s jazz of <PERSON>Bill
Evans</PERSON> meeting the mystical sweetness of <PERSON>Olivier Messiaen</PERSON>. He
followed that with the ravishing second act of <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s
seldom-played ballet, "The Prince of the Pagodas," with its
glamorous orchestral imitation of Balinese gamelan. He wound
up the program with a performance of <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>'s
"Petroushka" that emphasized the music's rhythmic bite and
brash orchestral colors, unlike most glossy modern orchestral
accounts.
   It was a canny Cabrillo evening. <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> bowed toward
the multicultural impulses that have always characterized the
festival -- much of <PERSON>Mr. Harrison</PERSON>'s music is inspired by the
gamelan. He offered a fresh look at <LOCATION>Britten</LOCATION>, a composer who,
like <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>, spent his career coming to his own individual
terms with modernism. And he presented some insight into his
own striking musical personality, which vacillates from the
gloomy to the glitzy in fascinating ways.
   Occasionally <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>'s instincts went awry, however, as
they did in a big way on his weirdly devised Saturday-night
program. The first half consisted of a terrific performance
of <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s stern, seldom-heard "Songs and Proverbs of
<PERSON>William Blake</PERSON>," sung with a riveting sensitivity to every
word by the baritone <PERSON>Sanford Sylvan</PERSON> and accompanied with
wondrous fluidity by the pianist <PERSON>Richard Goode</PERSON>. But it was
followed by nearly an hour's worth of needless noodling from
the Turkish-born <PERSON>Nazim Ozel</PERSON>, who plucks away on all 400
strings he has strung on a branch of a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> live oak he
calls the "Semi-Civilized Tree."
   Earlier that day there was a delightfully noncondescending
family concert featuring the witty <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Beal &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the
local choreographer collaborating with <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> for a
mysterious and mildly risque version of <ORGANIZATION>Milhaud</ORGANIZATION>'s "La
Creation du Monde." The next evening was mixed: <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> led
a driving, properly disturbing account of <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Sinfonia
da Requiem"; <PERSON>Mr. Sylvan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> became emotionally
overwrought in Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder"; <PERSON>Mr. Goode</PERSON>
offered one of his typically nuanced renditions of <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s
Piano Concerto No. 25, with <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> accompanying solidly.
   Missing, for the first time in memory, was anything by <PERSON>Mr.
Harrison</PERSON>, who still reigns as the informal paterfamilias of
the festival. But a CD of <PERSON>Mr. Harrison</PERSON>'s gorgeous <ORGANIZATION>Third
Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, performed by <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music
Festival Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>, was just released on <ORGANIZATION>Music Masters</ORGANIZATION>. No
one else today writes orchestral music as rapturous as this,
or combines musical cultures as effectively. And no place is
better for producing such music as <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION>.

COMPOSER GETS 1 SHOT TO WIN OVER LISTENERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Composer <PERSON>Charles Wuorinen</PERSON> is confident that avant-garde music only needs 
adequate exposure to win over reluctant listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of acceptance depends on familiarity," he said. "After all, <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Beethoven</PERSON> wrote demanding music, but because it is played by devoted 
performers and taught in schools that value the music, ultimately, the complex 
and demanding becomes familiar. Their music is loved, even if it may not be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> has but a single opportunity, however, to make his case to the <LOCATION>San 
Diego Symphony</LOCATION> audience <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mandeville 
Auditorium</LOCATION>. In the inaugural concert of the symphony's Pulitzer Series, the 
51-year-old <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> composer will conduct a pair of his recent works as well 
as two Stravinsky compositions. 
</P>
<P>
At the expense of cultivating an adoring and understanding public, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON>, 
who is often described as a second-generation 12-tone composer, has made 
"complex and demanding" his musical credo. Despite a prolific output -- about 
160 works in almost every musical medium -- he has never attracted the 
attention of such minimalist media darlings as <ORGANIZATION>Philip Glass</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who write real music do not do it for the immediate satisfaction, 
but in the hope that it will last. That which is wildly popular will not last 
-- the more popular they are, the shorter their works will be around," <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he wishes to be known as a minimalist basher. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the issue," he said. "My problem is this: A lot of music 
that is essentially pop music is now being declared to be serious music and 
played on programs with <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> and yours truly. Entertainment is 
healthy in its place, but I object to confusing it with the higher arts." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON>'s non-stop flow of awards and prizes, starting at 
age 16 with the <ORGANIZATION>New York Philharmonic Young Composers Award</ORGANIZATION>, has forged such 
unwavering self-confidence. In <DATE>1970</DATE>, while in his early 30s, he was the 
youngest composer to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize (and the first to receive one 
for a composition of electronic music), and in <DATE>1986</DATE> he won a megabuck <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur 
Foundation Fellowship</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> has been loathe to cultivate a personal following, he has regularly 
collaborated with major orchestras to keep his music before the public. Last 
year, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> completed a four-year residency with the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>, 
where he also served as the orchestra's new-music adviser. He showered music 
director <PERSON>Herbert Blomstedt</PERSON> with praise for giving his compositions thorough 
preparation and first-rate performances. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra also made a compact disc of <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON>'s "The Golden Dance" and 
<ORGANIZATION>Third Piano Concerto</ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON>Garrick Ohlsson</PERSON> as soloist. In <DATE>January, 1989</DATE>, the 
composer's only opera, "The W. of Babylon," was given its sole performance in a 
concert setting by the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>. Subtitled a "Baroque Burlesque," 
the lascivious (according to local music critics) and satirical opera had been 
sitting on the shelf since its completion in <DATE>1975</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy relationship. I had a very good time while I was there, and our 
relationship will continue. I'm putting the final touches on a work for chorus 
and orchestra that <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> will be playing in <DATE>March</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the time spent in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> working with the symphony, the <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> native did not discover a distinctly <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> school of composition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many different approaches -- the range of compositional style is 
so great. How would you put, say, <PERSON>Lou Harrison</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> and a <PERSON>Roger Reynolds</PERSON> 
in the same category? The cultural scene is so adrift, you begin to ask, 'Does 
anything mean anything?' " 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> ascends the <LOCATION>Mandeville Auditorium</LOCATION> podium to conduct "Bamboola 
Squared" for orchestra and quadraphonic tape, the piece will finally have come 
home. 
</P>
<P>

<LEADPARA>  THE signature of a music festival is its echo in the mind -- the sonic

last soloist.;    By that criterion, the Cabrillo Music Festival went out with
flying colors on Sunday night.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CABRILLO'S ECHO WILL BE A PLEASANT ONE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Forget the unsuccessful new compositions heard in its two-week run. Forget
the deficits. Forget the peccadilloes of the orchestra. Forget the worries
about whether the festival's in absentia music director, <PERSON>Dennis Russell
Davies</PERSON>, will keep his word and return in <DATE>1992.</DATE>;    <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s finale was
brilliant. Everything came together to tie up the season with a golden bow.;  
 <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>'s eloquence on the theme of death and <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s eloquence
on life furnished music with provocative polarities.;    <PERSON>Pianist Richard Goode</PERSON>
was exceptional in his articulate, propulsive reading of <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s Piano
Concerto No. 25 in C Major (K. 503), one of the finest readings I've
encountered in this <DATE>Mozart-saturated year.</DATE>;    The long, grandiose concerto,
which anticipates <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>, is a marvel of architecture, articulation,
allusion and affection. The main piano theme of the opening, for instance, is
an upbeat reworking of <ORGANIZATION>Papageno</ORGANIZATION>'s coda of lament from the end of <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s
opera "The Magic Flute.";    <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> left only a couple of cadenzas (solo
display segments) for his late concertos, and none for No. 25. So <PERSON>Goode</PERSON> wrote
his own, and it comes as close to <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s style as any I've encountered,
including <PERSON>Daniel Barenboim</PERSON>'s likable recorded one.;    Even more to my liking
were <PERSON>Goode</PERSON>'s seamless lines, his way of caressing the notes, and his singing
tone.;    <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> conducted capably, keying closely to <PERSON>Goode</PERSON>'s reading.;   
This was the hit-or-miss Cabrillo orchestra's finest evening of the season.
The group was more responsive and richer texturally than in other
performances.;    In <PERSON>Britten</PERSON>'s "Sinfonia da Requiem" and <PERSON>Mahler</PERSON>'s
tragic-romantic "Kindertotenlieder" ("Songs on the Death of Children"), the
renditions were often stirring and the solos in the latter work often stellar,
thanks to <ORGANIZATION>Yvonne Powers</ORGANIZATION> (oboe), <PERSON>Patricia Barry</PERSON> (English horn) and <PERSON>Fred
Bergstone</PERSON> (horn).;    In the Mahler work -- the saddest piece I ever hope to
hear -- baritone <PERSON>Sanford Sylvan</PERSON> was not at his best vocally, and his lyric
instrument is too light for this song cycle. But his musical intelligence and
his command of German are so refined that the poems were devastating in their
understatement.;    The "Sinfonia da Requiem" (<DATE>1940</DATE>) is a piece of fire and
ice, in which composer Britten meets the dual tragedies of a death in the
family and the growing devastation of World War II with a stiff upper lip.;   
Composer-conductor <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> offers engaging program annotations, but this year's
festival seemed fixated on death, with nine performances over two weekends
presenting death-related music.;    <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' own compositions were welcome,
though they barely hinted at his stylistic versatility.;    The acoustic
limitations of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> are something <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> and music
director <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> simply have to bear. The <DATE>Sunday</DATE> concert benefited from removal
of the hall's sound-absorbent curtains.;    Despite the problems, the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo
Festival</ORGANIZATION> is an asset to be cherished. The friendliness at <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION> is
legendary, from the crowd around the tostada stand in the street to the folks
schmoozing (and not snoozing) in the hall.;    There's a jaunty reveling here
in symphonic programs of 20th-century music that would terrify marketing
directors at many big-city orchestras. There's a bucolic informality, with
musicians in rehearsal togs and conductor <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> in clothes that had a rumpled,
slept-in look. But all were totally engaged in their music-making. It's the
ambiance that opens the door to musical adventurousness.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The Cabrillo Music Festival's opening weekend took its listeners through
adventurous modern terrain, with JoAnn Falletta conducting two programs at the
Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.;    The modern scores dealt out in saturation to
the music stands reached a climax at the Saturday matinee, and it proved too
much for some. One fast-wilting out-of-town music critic dashed out to the
intermission refreshment stand gasping, "Double espresso!"  </LEADPARA>

MODERN GROUND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The recession also dampened the impact, with attendance far below past
norms. The biggest of the first three concert crowds was 400 -- less than half
a house.;    But there was recurrent excitement and renewal, especially in
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s new music by emerging <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> composers born between <DATE>1943</DATE> and
<DATE>1957</DATE>, selected by a six-member jury.;    Imaginative use of ritual;  Upstaging
all the Californians was the Alaskan composer <PERSON>John Luther Adams</PERSON> -- no relation
to the <PERSON>John</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Coolidge</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> conducting other parts of the festival. Adams had
a flair for timeless ritual, with bass-drum tattoos suggesting Inouit
ceremonies. Brass stationed around the higher echelons of the auditorium
played an insistent, mystical music using the ambiguous notes and chords from
the string players' so-called open strings. The hypnotic spatial music
entitled "The Far Country of Sleep" at a quarter-hour was the matinee's
longest, yet it seemed the shortest on the program.;    Two of the five
composers were associated with <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Ross Bauer</PERSON> showed a
complex organization in his "Neon" (<DATE>1988</DATE>), yet it was very easy to listen to,
with its sonic brilliance and soothing textures. The busy piece was like a
platter with a lot of good seasonings. The work was an ebullient
curtain-raiser, with many solos and uncommon sounds in bass clarinet, tuba,
piccolo and other exotica.;    <PERSON>David Jaffe</PERSON>'s "Whoop for Your Life!" (<DATE>1987</DATE>)
struck me as a bundle of shards trying to find their place within some
structural whole. Jaffe seemed to make a conscious attempt to avoid idiomatic
gestures of orchestral writing, and he showed some of the uninhibited nature
of an action painter, but without all the glue needed to make his eclectic
piece stick together. He seemed uncomfortable with string writing, and he got
his best effects with haunting, heavily muted low brass outpourings.;    Two
others showed an extra-serious bent, such as you'd expect to find around
university composers. The German immigrant <PERSON>Stefan Carow</PERSON>'s "Five Pieces for
Orchestra" (world premiere) was an austere, atonal, post-Schoenbergian work of
sparse ingredients, like a Kandinsky painting. The <PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON> clue lay not
just in the texture, but in the title, which <PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON> himself had used in
<DATE>1909.</DATE>;    <PERSON>Allen Shearer</PERSON>'s Fantasy for Piano and <ORGANIZATION>Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> was a stoical
eight-minute opus, with <PERSON>Barbara Shearer</PERSON> providing the pristine structures of
the solo part.;    Inspired by traditional songs; The night before, <PERSON>Falletta</PERSON>
-- a conductor more notable for her diplomatic, no-nonsense efficiency than
moving performances -- had introduced "Due Ye No. 2" (<DATE>1987</DATE>) by the <ORGANIZATION>Cantonese
Chen Yi</ORGANIZATION>. Chen Yi had been inspired by the traditional songs and dances of
<LOCATION>Guangxi Province</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, and harnessed them into a tremendous, uplifting
outburst of both power and sophistication, offering both changes of meter as
well as musical "gates" adroitly separating segments of the seven-minute
span.;    <LOCATION>The East Coast</LOCATION> violinist <PERSON>Stephanie Chase</PERSON> had made a forceful impact
playing "Serenade," the most platonic of <PERSON>Leonard Bernstein</PERSON>'s creations.
<PERSON>Bernstein</PERSON> tied his unusually neoclassical score to <PERSON>Plato</PERSON>'s "Symposium," each
of the five sections making allusions to the many faces of love.;   
Considering the theme of love, <ORGANIZATION>Chase</ORGANIZATION>'s approach, like that of conductor
<PERSON>Falletta</PERSON>, was needlessly severe, meeting the considerable rhythmic obligations
with technique and virtuosity. They managed the syncopated jazzy finale well,
but more heart from all the forces, including the unusual orchestra of strings
and percussion, would have been welcome.;    Splashy ending;  <PERSON>Falletta</PERSON> closed
that concert with the splashy Mussorgsky-Ravel "Pictures at an Exhibition,"
indifferently played apart from <PERSON>Tony Clements</PERSON>' marvelously squishy tuba solo.;
   Despite able conductors and some of the most imaginative programs on the
coast, the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> remains below its potential. The orchestra
is widely recruited -- only 30 of the 67 players are from <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>
-- but it remains short of national-festival norms in its responsiveness,
rhythmic acuity and pitch. I have not heard a really good ensemble here,
commensurate with the festival's high national repute, since <DATE>1988.</DATE>;    For
future hirings, the festival would be well advised to hold musician auditions,
even in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> if necessary, and forget word-of-mouth from current
players, which is the commonest hiring method currently used.;  <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo Music
Festival</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> guest conductor.; Where: <ORGANIZATION>Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium</ORGANIZATION>, at
<ORGANIZATION>Center and Church Streets.</ORGANIZATION>; When: Nightly Thursdays-Sundays through <DATE>Aug. 4</DATE>,

<LEADPARA>  LIKE "Nixon in China" but in more incendiary fashion, "The Death of
Klinghoffer" transmutes contemporary history into operatic poetry.;    Unlike
the earlier work by composer John Adams, librettist Alice Goodman, director
Peter Sellars and choreographer Mark Morris, the new opera, which received its
world premiere Tuesday at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie, needs some
refinement. But the potential for eventual triumph is there.  </LEADPARA>

ACHILLE LAURO TRAGEDY IS SOURCE OF POETIC
OPERA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Opera Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     After seven performances in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, it will travel over the next year to
<LOCATION>Lyons</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> (for its American premiere Sept. 5); <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>; and <LOCATION>Glyndebourne</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England.</LOCATION>;    The subject of "The Death
of Klinghoffer" is the seizure of the Italian cruise ship <ORGANIZATION>Achille Lauro</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>October 1985</DATE> by four Palestinian terrorists and the murder of a
wheelchair-bound <ORGANIZATION>American Jew</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Leon Klinghoffer.</PERSON>;    The hatreds of Jews and
Palestinians surface here and there, sometimes violently. But the opera, laid
out in two acts of approximately 80 minutes each, deliberately cools passions
into meditations from afar.;    The action, which alternates choruses and solo
declamations, sets the events into a cosmic context inspired by Greek tragedy,
<PERSON>Bach</PERSON>'s Passions and the large-scale dance-dramas of the Orient.;   
Introspective beauty;  <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' music, conducted by <PERSON>Kent Nagano</PERSON>, incorporates
Minimalist mannerisms, neo-Romantic lyricism and sometimes pointed harmonic
acerbity. The solo narrations, like those of most modern operas, cede
principal melodic interest to the instruments. But they possess an
introspective beauty, particularly when enunciated by such sensitive singers
as <PERSON>James Maddalena</PERSON> (the Captain), <PERSON>Sanford Sylvan</PERSON> (Klinghoffer) and <PERSON>Sheila
Nadler</PERSON> (<PERSON>Marilyn Klinghoffer</PERSON>).;    More unusual than <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' score is his blend
of conventional and electronic instruments and the amplification of all the
singers and instruments. Microphones and loudspeakers are embedded in the set
and the balances constantly modified by sound engineer <PERSON>Jonathan Deans</PERSON>. At its
best, this creates fascinating new sound-colors and invests the climaxes with
powerful energy. At its worst, it muddles and harshens the texture.;    The
production took a considerable time to gather momentum. The prologue and first
act are predominantly contemplative, except for a more animated scene of
everyday life with the <ORGANIZATION>Klinghoffers</ORGANIZATION>' friends in <LOCATION>New Jersey.</LOCATION>;    What was
intended as meditative and dreamy turns static and dreary. Everything in the
first act looked and sounded unsure, from the cluttered constructivism of
<PERSON>George Tsypin</PERSON>'s unit set, steel girders and pipes ascending on high, to <PERSON>James
F. Ingalls</PERSON>' glaring lighting to <ORGANIZATION>Dunya Ramicova</ORGANIZATION>'s stubbornly workaday
costumes.;    <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON>, his head as usual buzzing with half-realized ideas,
sought to reinforce the deliberate obfuscation of identity in the <PERSON>Goodman</PERSON>
text, in which the laments of the Palestinians and Jews sound poignantly
alike. <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>' choreography looked incongruously formalistic: neat little rows
of dancers doing their balletic turns with little sense of emotional
connection to the drama.;    Concert projections;  The second act, however,
restored one's faith in this team's creative capabilities. The use of
rock-style concert projections, expanding every intimate expression on the
protagonists' faces, enhanced the already vivid acting of Sylvan and of <PERSON>Eugene
Perry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas Hammons</PERSON> as two of the terrorists.;    The opera attained its
finest depths of feeling in the two final scenes for <PERSON>Mrs. Klinghoffer</PERSON> -- the
first in which she heartbreakingly doesn't yet know that her husband has been
shot and the second a bitter denunciation of what she sees as the Captain's
complicity -- and <PERSON>Klinghoffer</PERSON>'s farewell, an astonishing "aria of the fallen
body" set in the score as a slow, hypnotic dance.  </TEXT>

<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>'s Prom concert may have had a 'safe' programme, reasonable
enough for the family-slot in a Bank <DATE>Holiday weekend</DATE>, but it never sounded
like mere routine. Conducting the <ORGANIZATION>BBC Welsh Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Tadaki Otaka</PERSON> was
freshly attentive to everything.
The longest piece was <PERSON>Max Bruch</PERSON>'s G minor violin concerto, which has been
fading from the repertoire since the Second World War. <PERSON>Raphael Oleg</PERSON>
delivered it with searching affection, and complete command of its virtuoso
writing - in which he always found good musical sense; <PERSON>Otaka</PERSON> built up the
orchestral music to a grand Brahmsian scale. The central Adagio was both
poignant and imposing, as it should be. A worthy performance of this
concerto always makes one think that we ought to hear much more <PERSON>Bruch</PERSON>: it is
a pity that not much more <PERSON>Bruch</PERSON> actually lives up to this elevated standard.
Even the choice of concert-opener, <ORGANIZATION>Mendelssohn</ORGANIZATION>'s familiar overture Calm Sea
and Prosperous Voyage, had an extra point here, for <ORGANIZATION>Elgar</ORGANIZATION> quotes it in the
penultimate variation of his 'Enigma' set which ended the concert.
There was another, more languishing seascape after the interval, when <PERSON>Ann
Murray</PERSON> sang <PERSON>Chausson</PERSON>'s Poeme l'amour et de la mer+. She captured a sharp
sense of loss beyond well-bred feeling, almost persuading me that the darker
mezzo voice usually assigned to the piece is not strictly necessary;
meanwhile <PERSON>Otaka</PERSON> - and particularly his cellos - drew out <ORGANIZATION>Chausson</ORGANIZATION>'s svelte
lines with assured poise.
Finally, the 'Enigma' Variations got a properly idiomatic performance,
emphasising both continuity and contrast: no sense of an old war-horse being
exercised, but rather of respectful, sympathetic rediscovery. Clearly, the
<ORGANIZATION>BBC Welsh</ORGANIZATION> orchestra is prospering with <PERSON>Otaka</PERSON>.
*****
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s concert in the <PERSON>Albert Hall</PERSON> was given over to the music of <PERSON>John
Adams</PERSON>. In the hierarchy of the proms such honours do not come the way of
many contemporary composers; that <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> was favoured is a measure of the
insidious popularity of his works and the brouhaha that has surrounded his
two operas, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and The Death of Klinghoffer. Adams himself
conducted the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Sinfonietta whose director, <PERSON>Paul Crossley</PERSON>, was the
soloist in <ORGANIZATION>Eros Piano</ORGANIZATION>.
That piece, sandwiched between <ORGANIZATION>Shaker Loops and Grand Pianola Music</ORGANIZATION>, proved
the low point. Inspired by the music of Takemitsu it shows <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' powers of
construction at their weakest, and its language of Skryabin, <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> and
Messiaen rechauffe at his flabbiest. At least <ORGANIZATION>Shaker Loops</ORGANIZATION>, which
established <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> as a distinctive voice in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, has stylistic
consistency and strength. There's a convincing integrity about the musical
material and a carefully plotted structure which owes more than a little to
<ORGANIZATION>Sibelius</ORGANIZATION>.
At least <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> is pleasantly unabashed about all these magpie tendencies,
consciously absorbing all the influences and allowing them to ferment. In
<ORGANIZATION>Grand Pianola Music</ORGANIZATION> they burst out in glorious profusion, throwing
19th-century triumphalism into the mix as well. The result is coarse-grained
 -there's nothing subtle about the scoring, and the big tune that caps the
second movement is irredeemably banal. But in this case it is done with some
panache and tongue firmly wedged into cheek; when <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> doesn't take himself
too seriously his music seems all the better for it.

Kent <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>, chief conductor-designate of the <PERSON>Halle Orchestra</PERSON>, has been
touring the country with his new orchestra. On <DATE>Sunday</DATE> they arrived home at
the Free Trade <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, for a concert (broadcast on Radio 3) which
was terrifically exhilarating not just in itself but for what it portends.
It was an ambitious programme  - works by <PERSON>Messiaen</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> (composers
with whose music the young American conductor has become closely associated)
which had been given their British premieres earlier on the tour, plus a
lightly glittering account of the complete <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky Firebird</ORGANIZATION> score. All
the pieces were executed with exactly the cool confidence and flair that
have been missing in the portfolio of Halle attributes recently. <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>, as
he told radio listeners in an interval talk, has discerned a pressing need
to re-create the quality of imagination in this orchestra's programming; it
is to this end that his opening series, under the sub-title 'New
Beginnings', has been directed.
The first half, its two offerings, each an attractive contrast with the
other, certainly proved the point. Un Sourire (<DATE>1989</DATE>) is the penultimate
composition to have been completed before <PERSON>Messiaen</PERSON>'s death earlier this
year. It is a tiny (5-minute) marvel of 'late-music' economy and radiance.
Two strands of Messiaenic thought, the hymnally lyrical and the
birdsong-percussive, are set in block alternation, then brought to repose.
Adams, composer of <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and The Death of Klinghoffer, approaches
his big projects with big confidence; the huge orchestra for <LOCATION>Eldorado</LOCATION>
(<DATE>1991</DATE>), including two synthesisers, wastes no colour-device. This
two-movement symphony  - self-proclaimed rather than immediately evident as
such  - treats with disquieted irony, as well as picturesqueness, two
aspects of <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> existence.
The movements are two different sound-landscapes: the first, called 'The
Dream of Gold', builds up baleful neo-Shostakovich sonorities; the second,
'Soledades', gradually fills its empty space with tingling, desert-inspired
patterns. Adams, now firmly into his post-minimalist phase, layers his
much-repeated rhythmic and colouristic figures in the manner that appears to
draw on Baroque and various 20th-century (including rock) modes of
articulation equally: his musical language proceeds in cells of activity
forming foundation pillars to support spans of lyrical line.
The idiom is unfailingly appealing, easy to absorb. What troubles me  - here
as in the past  - is the arrival of climactic gestures produced less out of
the heat of argument than through mechanical assembly. <LOCATION>Eldorado</LOCATION> is a superb
concatenation of applique effects announcing itself up as something
altogether weightier.
Meanwhile, last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>Festival Hall</ORGANIZATION> there were also <LOCATION>New
Beginnings</LOCATION>  - of a rather less confidence-inducing kind. The <ORGANIZATION>London
Philharmonic Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> celebrated its newly achieved position as resident
orchestra of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>South Bank Centre</ORGANIZATION> with two concerts of triple-decker
form and three-hour length. If the aim of their programme was to suggest the
different kinds of promise for the future that the orchestra now holds under
its chief conductor, <PERSON>Franz Welser-Most</PERSON>, its damp-squib impact must already
be raising anxious eyebrows. To put it bluntly, the concert was either
absurdly ill-planned or all too deftly designed to demonstrate Welser-Most's
interpretative immaturity.
The centrepiece, the <ORGANIZATION>Schumann Second Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, received a glaring
performance, loveless, lumpy and driven. Unsparkling, bandmasterly accounts
of <ORGANIZATION>Prokofiev's Three Oranges Suite</ORGANIZATION> and (as encore) the Fledermaus Overture
sank spirits ever lower. The message, alas, seems to be that a highly
talented young conductor learning on the job is not well placed to lead an
orchestra many people still consider <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s top-class ensemble into its
much-vaunted New Era.

   Adamsweek: Klinghoffer Dies Again
   ----

<LP>
   New York -- They didn't give John Adams the keys to the
city. Which is just as well, since the composer would have
found the locks jimmied and the cupboards bare at City Hall
and especially at cultural organizations rocked by Mayor
David Dinkins's budget squeeze. But we did our best here last
week for Mr. Adams.
   The Philharmonic played two of his Fanfares in the opening
concert of its first season under Music Director Kurt Masur.
And the Brooklyn Academy of Music played host to the first
U.S. run of the Adams opera "The Death of Klinghoffer," which
is based on the assassination of an American-Jewish tourist
in the Middle East by Palestinian terrorists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>, who has built a career mostly in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> and lately in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION>, this double welcome here
looked in advance like a kind of coming-out party.
   But in the end the man of the hour was not the
Romantically inclined minimalist composer but the newly
appointed head music critic of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Edward
Rothstein</PERSON>. Indeed, the most memorable moment of Adams-week
was the sight of a poker-faced <PERSON>Mr. Rothstein</PERSON> striding from
the front of <PERSON>Avery Fisher Hall</PERSON> up the center aisle, ignoring
the cheers from <LOCATION>Philharmonic</LOCATION> supporters on both sides of him,
as he rushed to his computer on 43rd Street to pour tepid
water on their Masur-fest.
   He didn't much like "Klinghoffer" either, which should
help to feed <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>'s paranoia about critics. But perhaps
<PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> should pay more attention in the future to picking
his friends than to picking fights with his presumed enemies
in the glossy pages of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Magazine</ORGANIZATION>. At <ORGANIZATION>Fisher Hall</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr.
Masur</PERSON>, late of <LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION> and a long, apparently happy career as
a conductor and communist, began his debut with some brief
and light American works by <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aaron Copland</PERSON>,
matched in inequal symbolism by the weighty Seventh Symphony
of <PERSON>Anton Bruckner</PERSON>, first performed in <LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION> in <DATE>1884</DATE> and
dedicated to <LOCATION>Mad Ludwig</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Bavaria</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Masur</PERSON> produced a rather tentative, almost soporific
evening of mostly loud music. One hoped for better as the
season progresses but couldn't help wondering why the
Philharmonic had gone in <PERSON>Mr. Masur</PERSON>'s direction -- to a
foreigner of mature years from one of the most entrenched
bastions of tradition in musical performance -- if it was
indeed looking for a fresh approach, a broadened repertory
and a stronger appeal to a younger audience. Why, for
example, had <PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON> -- American, younger but
widely experienced in new and old music, and a superb
conductor -- been allowed to escape the talent search?
   The curious can seek out <PERSON>Mr. Davies</PERSON> across the <LOCATION>East River</LOCATION>,
where he will shortly inaugurate his first season as
principal conductor of the <LOCATION>Brooklyn Philharmonic</LOCATION>. In the
meantime, the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Academy</ORGANIZATION> has had to suffer the
indignity of several "Klinghoffers," one of them on the
Jewish New Year. This is the so-called opera cobbled together
by the terrible infant of the contemporary stage, <PERSON>Peter
Sellars</PERSON>, from an Adams score, a libretto by the so-called
poet <PERSON>Alice Goodman</PERSON> and choreography by <PERSON>Mark Morris</PERSON> -- much of
the package having been assembled by fax before the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>
premiere last <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   Reviewing that production on this page, <PERSON>Manuela
Hoelterhoff</PERSON> found little to love and was especially
unconvinced by the libretto's supposedly even-handed
treatment of Arabs and Israelis: ". . . when both groups
appear on stage wearing identical clothes, the production has
graphically equalized victims and their assassins." One could
go further.
   The real-life death of <PERSON>Leon Klinghoffer</PERSON> was a revolting
piece of thuggery against an innocent old man. So it is
thoroughly obnoxious that <PERSON>Ms. Goodman</PERSON>'s libretto matches
scenes of aggrieved Palestinians with a piece of <PERSON>Neil Simon
Jewish</PERSON> domestic comedy. Obviously we are meant to conclude
that the Klinghoffers were trivial suburbanites, sheltered
from want and danger, while his assassins were acting out the
righteous anger of their oppressed brethren.
   A truly even-handed treatment would have included a scene
of wealthy robed Saudis in a gaudy palace in the desert,
nattering on about their latest limo or Learjet paid for by a
loan from <ORGANIZATION>BCCI</ORGANIZATION>.
   Surely there is nothing in the libretto in an anti-Arab
vein to match the repulsive anti-Semitism that drools from
the mouth of a character called "Rambo": ". . . wherever poor
men/Are gathered they can/Find Jews getting fat./You know how
to cheat/The simple, exploit/The virgin, pollute/Where you
have exploited . . . America/Is one big Jew. . . ."
   Could it be that <PERSON>Mr. Sellars</PERSON> encouraged <PERSON>Ms. Goodman</PERSON> in
this in order to distract audiences from thinking about
"Klinghoffer" with the same musical judgment they would
ordinarily apply to an opera? By almost forcing us into a
posture of moral outrage, they would keep us from noticing
that there is not much here for the voice.
   <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON> has said he wasn't basically interested in
opera. He should have listened to himself, instead of heeding
the temptations of that giggling Mephisto, <PERSON>Mr. Sellars</PERSON>. Much
of the orchestral work is rich and appealing, but I doubt
anyone came out of <ORGANIZATION>BAM</ORGANIZATION> whistling an aria.

These are powerful days for Kent <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>. A decade after arriving in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
as an unknown Japanese-American conductor, he cuts one of the most glamorous
profiles in today's image-conscious music world.
As music director of the Opera de <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION> since <DATE>1989</DATE>, he has played a key role
in developing its international reputation and progressive repertoire. He is
also revitalising <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s oldest symphony orchestra, the <LOCATION>Halle</LOCATION>, which he
conducts on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in his first Manchester concert of the season.
Appointed principal conductor two years ago, he has only just begun to make
an imprint on its programmes. In 18 months, he hopes to lead the <PERSON>Halle</PERSON> into
<ORGANIZATION>Manchester</ORGANIZATION>'s new Pounds 42m concert hall.
In a profession where fools rush in, <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> has trodden carefully. He has
avoided the core classical repertoire, exposing himself only in <DATE>20th century</DATE>
scores which show his analytical grasp and communication skills to
advantage. For his <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> debut a decade ago, he conducted <PERSON>Frank Zappa</PERSON>. In
<LOCATION>Salzburg</LOCATION>, he has given lucid performances of Messiaen and <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>. He
champions <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' minimalist music on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. But he
has yet to convince large sections of the music business. 'There's too much
plastic,' says one agent, pointing out that <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> has yet to conduct major
works by <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Verdi</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>. 'I think the shine from outside is better
than what is inside.'
Nagano is certainly an image-maker's dream. With his oriental features and
shoulder-length hair, he wows audiences wherever he goes. In <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, he
introduces complex modern scores in his soft Californian accent. In
interviews he talks like a campus guru, articulating artistic goals as
'visions and dreams'. 'Music is a sharing experience', he says.
But with <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> music is rarely a great emotional experience, or one of
spontaneous inspiration. Some orchestral musicians have likened him to a
machine: he rehearses and re-rehearses, demands clockwork precision and
leaves nothing to chance. 'He's a recording producer's dream - he conducts
it exactly the same way every time,' says a member of the <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION> orchestra.
<LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>, 42, whose Japanese grandparents emigrated to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 70 years
ago, carries many traits of his mixed cultural background. He practises the
martial art of Shintaido and married a Japanese pianist. He is a modernist
who speaks of his regard for tradition, an artist with an understanding of
market value, a man with big long-term ambitions who has calculated every
step of his career.
His introduction to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> came through the French composer <PERSON>Olivier
Messiaen</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>, who grew up on a Californian artichoke farm, was
conducting <PERSON>Messiaen</PERSON>'s music at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, and invited the composer to work
with his orchestra. Messiaen was impressed. He brought the young conductor
to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> to help prepare the world premiere of his opera <PERSON>Saint
Francois d'Assise</PERSON>. Messiaen introduced <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> to artists' agent, <PERSON>Sylvio
Samama</PERSON>, who saw in him a talent worth nurturing. Once his reputation was
established, <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> walked out on the agency and has never looked back. He
is now said to command around Pounds 15,000 per concert.
Lyon and the <PERSON>Halle</PERSON> were shrewdly chosen. In both cases, <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> could be
guaranteed a certain amount of limelight, without the competitive
environment of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Both had secure artistic foundations and
vast untapped potential.
In <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>, the Opera was in the midst of a seven-year nomadic existence while
its home was rebuilt. The situation was a godsend for an operatic ingenu
like <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>. He was able to rehearse and record extensively, choosing the
kind of exotic repertoire which would generate publicity but no unfavourable
comparisons.
Louis Erlo and <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Brossmann</PERSON>, the Opera's co-directors, offered
experience, media introductions and a handsome budget. <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> was their
conduit to high musical standards and a younger audience. In terms of
personality, <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> was perfect for <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION>'s new high-tech Opera building,
which opened in <DATE>May last year</DATE>. His <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION> recordings have won international
awards, and he has now been invited to take the company on tour to <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, too, <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> invested in an organisation at a low point in its
fortunes. The <PERSON>Halle</PERSON> had a worldwide reputation, but was not of worldwide
quality. Eclipsed by orchestras in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Liverpool</LOCATION>, it needed
awakening from the sleepy conservatism into which it had lapsed since the
death of Sir <PERSON>John Barbirolli</PERSON> in <DATE>1970</DATE>.
At first sight, <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> was a strange choice. He was barely known in
<LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, and his repertoire had little in common with the <ORGANIZATION>Halle's</ORGANIZATION>. The
two have taken time to adjust to each other. Nagano plunged in with <PERSON>Boulez</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Stockhausen</PERSON>, which did not go down well in <LOCATION>Bradford</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sheffield</LOCATION>. He
tampered with the money-spinning formula for <ORGANIZATION>Manchester</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>summer</DATE> Proms,
which then made a loss. He made disparaging comments about the orchestra's
recent past, denting the musicians' pride.
He also clashed with <PERSON>David Richardson</PERSON>, the chief executive who recruited
him. The <PERSON>Halle</PERSON>'s board of directors sided with <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> left
two months ago. The orchestra is now being run by <PERSON>Alan Dean</PERSON>, a Mancunian
businessman with fund-raising experience, who says his priorities are to
raise <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>'s profile in the community, increase corporate sponsorship and
reduce the <PERSON>Halle</PERSON>'s Pounds 400,000 deficit.
No-one doubts that <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> was the right man to shake up the <LOCATION>Halle</LOCATION>. His
predecessor, <PERSON>Stanislaw Skrowaczewski</PERSON>, improved playing standards, but had no
public face. <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>, by contrast, is a crowd-puller - a key factor in the
orchestra's move to the new hall. Nagano talks knowledgeably of the Halle
tradition, which he summarises as 'excellence, innovation and courage. We
have to redefine the tradition, renourish it, refocus it toward the future.'
Critics say the orchestra is sounding refreshed. <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION> has worked hard on
technical aspects - 'almost to the point of putting the players off,' says
<PERSON>Gerald Larner</PERSON>, who has followed the <PERSON>Halle</PERSON>'s fortunes since the <PERSON>Barbirolli</PERSON>
era. 'The sound has become smoother, softer - the kind of thing you need for
<PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>. But there hasn't been the same degree of artistic illumination
and inspiration.'
Nagano says there should be no hasty judgments. 'We all agreed from the
beginning that this was a long-term commitment, something with roots that
are going to bring benefits far into the future, and will require patience.
I really feel I'm laying the bricks, assembling the structure.'
The conservative programmes for the current season - plugging important gaps
in both <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>'s and the <PERSON>Halle</PERSON>'s repertoire - suggest he recognises the need
for consolidation. Next <DATE>March</DATE> and <DATE>April</DATE>, they will make the first of a
projected series of recordings. There will be a festival to open the new
hall in <DATE>May 1996</DATE>, before <LOCATION>Nagano</LOCATION>'s contract comes up for renewal. 'I've no
doubt he'll use the <PERSON>Halle</PERSON> as a stepping stone - he's a clever operator',
says <PERSON>Larner</PERSON>. 'He's not going to spend a lifetime here, and he would be well
advised not to. But if he can pull the orchestra round, it sets him up for
life for other things.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Vale of Glamorgan festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Proms and <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> may overshadow <DATE>August</DATE>, but there are some idyllic
outlying festivals. You could do worse than sample the charms of Presteigne,
a small town astride the picturesque mid-Wales border, where a modest,
friendly bank holiday chamber music event has taken off during the last few
years. But for the charged atmosphere of live contemporary music-making,
make for coastal <ORGANIZATION>St Donat's</ORGANIZATION>.
This <DATE>summer</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>Vale of Glamorgan</ORGANIZATION> festival is a minimalist's paradise. <PERSON>David
Williams</PERSON>, the festival chairman, who, with another hat on, helped sway a
healthy Pounds 25,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION>Welsh Arts Council</ORGANIZATION>, explains: 'We felt
we should do something constructive, not just for new music in broader
terms, but for living composers. It seemed more positive to concentrate
resources rather than dissipate them, and promote a worthwhile series
focusing on the diversity of contemporary works in particular,
post-modernist music since the '70s.'
The principal sponsors, <ORGANIZATION>Allied Steel</ORGANIZATION> and Wire (ASW), have proved an added
lifeline, injecting several thousands and, no less important, setting up
gatherings to help widen the sponsorship net.
At <ORGANIZATION>Cardiff</ORGANIZATION>'s unspoiled <ORGANIZATION>Victorian Coal Exchange</ORGANIZATION> on Bute Square (the city's
former commercial heart), <PERSON>John Metcalf</PERSON>'s decidedly adventurous programme was
launched last week with a mesmerising, sold-out evening by the American
composer <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>, fresh from his <ORGANIZATION>South Bank</ORGANIZATION> triumph with The Cave.
Llandaff Cathedral offers an ampler venue tonight for a full-scale <PERSON>John
Adams</PERSON> concert, climaxing with his celebrated Whitman Civil War setting The
Wound <PERSON>Dresser</PERSON> - like his operas <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and The Death of Klinghoffer,
something of a cult piece.
Getting to the outside-Cardiff events is easiest - be warned - by car. But
it's well worth the effort. These attractive smaller venues bring their own
rewards, be it the atmospheric oak-rafted fourteenth century <PERSON>Bradenstoke
Hall</PERSON>, part of <ORGANIZATION>St Donat</ORGANIZATION>'s Castle within the <LOCATION>Atlantic College</LOCATION> campus, or the
medieval wall-painted <ORGANIZATION>St Illtud</ORGANIZATION>'s Church in Llanylltud Faur (Llantwit
Major), an early Celtic Christian site with the added merits of an adjacent
pub-studded square and a good surfing beach a mere two miles' distance.
Minimalist the diet may have been - but by no means monochrome. The <ORGANIZATION>Smith
Quartet</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s answers to the Kronos, made appearances at both
venues, the hall marginally the better for sound and paradoxically more
intimate, thanks largely to the players being raised on a dais.
Like the 'modernism' it purports to replace, postmodern and minimalist fare
is a mixed bag. The <ORGANIZATION>Smiths</ORGANIZATION>' reading of the now legendary Different Trains
was somewhat differently balanced from <PERSON>Reich</PERSON>'s own - not quite as haunted,
perhaps, but clear and forceful. The South African-born,
Princeton-associated <PERSON>Kevin Volans</PERSON>' Second Quartet, Hunting/Gathering, seemed
to be questing for a style as much as anything. Its repeating motifs and
unfinished paragraphs have all the intensity of a short-running sitcom.
Bones stick out balefully, rather as <PERSON>Steve Martland</PERSON>'s Patrol is all sinew -
laborious invention, oddly conventional and quintessentially dull.
But nothing can take away from the dedication of these players. Volans'
Third Quartet, <LOCATION>Songlines</LOCATION>, like his Rimbaud (and <PERSON>Bruce Chatwin</PERSON>) inspired
Almeida chamber opera The Man who strides the wind (L'Homme aux Semelles de
Vent), was a revelation: riddled with imaginative ideas, well teased out, an
array of string sounds that 'delight the ear and hurt not', that constantly
challenge, dazzle and amaze. And <PERSON>Graham Fitkin</PERSON>'s quartet Servant, like the
<PERSON>Michael Nyman</PERSON> encore the following night, gave clear evidence of how
minimalism can successfully subsume native and wider traditions.
You can still catch <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> tonight at 7.30. Next <DATE>summer</DATE>'s festival
includes Australian <PERSON>Peter Sculthorpe</PERSON> and - yes - <PERSON>Gorecki</PERSON>. So book early
(Tel. 0446 794848 792151).

<LEADPARA>  AMONG the face lifts created for tonight's San Francisco Symphony gala opener
is that of Davies Symphony Hall, which looks suspiciously like the cosmetic
surgery attempted unsuccessfully for San Jose's Center for the Performing
Arts.;   The symphony's black-tie concert, priced as high as $275 a ticket for
just 65 minutes of concert music (and including a post-concert party), will
feature not so much deja vu as deja entendu -- already heard.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DAVIES HALL'S NEW LOOK GETS A HEARING TONIGHT
S.F. SYMPHONY TO TRY OUT THE HIGHER RISERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The most visible features of the renovation are the much higher, steeper
risers for the musicians, which acousticians <ORGANIZATION>Lawrence Kirkegaard &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>
also had introduced at the <LOCATION>San Jose Symphony</LOCATION> before Music Director <PERSON>George
Cleve</PERSON> threw them out in disgust.;   Apart from that, you may need binoculars
to spot the labors that shut down the hall for the whole <DATE>summer</DATE>. The
see-through overhead plastic panels have gone from round to square, each of
them on a computer-controlled winch allowing fine-tuning.;   The new acoustics
will get their baptism under fire in two weeks when <LOCATION>London Records</LOCATION> moves in to
record <PERSON>Schubert</PERSON>'s "Great C Major" Symphony and <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>'s "Siegfried Idyll,"
with Music Director <PERSON>Herbert Blomstedt</PERSON> again on the podium.;   <DATE>This week</DATE>'s
mostly <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> repertory is capped by a salute to the crescendoing freedom
movement in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> via <ORGANIZATION>Berlioz</ORGANIZATION>'s rousing "Rakoczy" March for a grand
finale, commemorating a hero of the <DATE>1848</DATE> revolutions.;   The program also
offers paired treats via the coloratura-soprano vocalist, and for once <ORGANIZATION>Flint
Center</ORGANIZATION>'s repeat concert (<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>) is getting far more than a fill-in
substitute. Tonight it's the popular star <PERSON>Kathleen Battle</PERSON>, while at <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> it
will be the up-and-coming <PERSON>Harolyn Blackwell</PERSON>, making her Bay Area debut before
her "<PERSON>Don Giovanni</PERSON>" Zerlina at the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> later this month.;   ALL
IN THE FAMILY -- The leadership of the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>'s three biggest
performing-arts organizations sounds like a lunch group at the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>
corporate-counseling firm of <ORGANIZATION>Hellman &amp; Friedman</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Tully Friedman</PERSON> was president
of the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Opera until last year, while partner <PERSON>F. Warren Hellman</PERSON>'s
sister, <PERSON>Nancy Hellman Bechtle</PERSON>, is in her fifth year as president of the <LOCATION>San
Francisco Symphony.</LOCATION>;   Now the likeliest heir apparent for the board
chairmanship of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Ballet</LOCATION> this fall is Chris (<PERSON>Mrs. F. Warren</PERSON>)
<PERSON>Hellman</PERSON>, according to sources around town.;   Says one arts board insider, "It
looks like a takeover, but it isn't, because all three of them donate very
generously to the groups.";   <LOCATION>SANTA CRUZ PODIUM</LOCATION> HARMONY -- Two of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
brightest conducting stars may become a tandem in conducting the <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo
Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> through the 1990s.;   <PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON> and
composer-conductor <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> are integrating their heavy international
schedules to work in <ORGANIZATION>Cabrillo</ORGANIZATION> compatibly.;   "We're talking to <PERSON>Dennis</PERSON>, he's
talking to <PERSON>John</PERSON>, and they're talking to each other," says Cabrillo Executive
Director <PERSON>Tom Fredericks</PERSON>, who is trying to firm up the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> County-based
<DATE>summer</DATE> fest's conducting commitments for years to come.;   The likeliest
scenario: <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> returning to conduct in <DATE>1992</DATE>. If and when <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> resident
<PERSON>Davies</PERSON> decides to move on (and <DATE>1993</DATE> is a good guess), <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> will become the
successor.;   Meanwhile, Cabrillo wrestles with a <DATE>1991</DATE> deficit of <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>,
piled atop the hangover <MONEY>$14,900</MONEY> from the year before, with recession-related
contribution shortfalls blamed.;   CHANGES -- <PERSON>Marilyn Horne</PERSON> canceled her five
performances as <PERSON>Carmen</PERSON> with the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> because of knee surgery,
but not to worry -- two other American mezzos will replace her into the title
role. <PERSON>Kathleen Kuhlmann</PERSON> will do the opener <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and six other performances
of the Bizet favorite, while <ORGANIZATION>Denyce Graves</ORGANIZATION> will sing <DATE>Oct. 25</DATE> through <DATE>Nov. 1.</DATE>; 
 Before the first note of the season is sounded, the <LOCATION>San Jose Symphony</LOCATION> has
already changed its opening work from <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s "La Clemenza di Tito" Overture
to <PERSON>Berlioz</PERSON>'s "<PERSON>Benvenuto Cellini</PERSON>" Overture for <DATE>Sept. 13-15</DATE>. The conductor,
<PERSON>Michael Palmer</PERSON>, is the latest candidate for <PERSON>George Cleve</PERSON>'s job.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  CLASSICAL MUSIC PRESENTERS are going all out for the 1991-92 season, a
development that's about the last thing one might have expected in this year
of tight budgets.;   Sergei Prokofiev turned Tolstoy's epic novel, War and
Peace, into an epic opera. San Francisco Opera's production, its first of this
spectacle opera and its homage to Prokofiev in his centenary year, had at last
count nine singers from Leningrad's Kirov Opera, brought over with the help of
star conductor Valery Gergiev. The production, scheduled to open last night,
will have just seven performances, closing Oct. 2.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  CLASSICAL MUSIC; PAUL HERTELENDY is music writer for the Mercury News.;
Classical Music schedule attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Opera <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> is mounting The Turn of the Screw, a <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON> ghost story
made deftly musical by <PERSON>Benjamin Britten</PERSON>, at the much-maligned <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery
Theater</ORGANIZATION>. Later in the season comes something I thought impossible to stage at
the <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION>Verdi</ORGANIZATION>'s large-scale <PERSON>Un Ballo</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Maschera</LOCATION>, in a production
directed by <PERSON>Michael Edwards</PERSON> of Shakespeare/Santa Cruz.;   Das verratene Meer
(The Sea Betrayed) at <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> is based on a Japanese novella,
<PERSON>Yukio Mishima</PERSON>'s The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. Composer <PERSON>Hans
Werner Henze</PERSON>, the leading German opera composer since <PERSON>Richard Strauss</PERSON>, will
make a rare <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> appearance on opening night, <DATE>Nov. 7.</DATE>;   AT THE TOP OF
THE SYMPHONYlist is an imaginative collaboration by three <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> presenters,
exploring music in the turbulent transition years 1911-13 in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. British
conductor <PERSON>Simon Rattle</PERSON> will lead "The Rite of <DATE>Spring</DATE>," among other works, with
his <ORGANIZATION>City of Birmingham Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>April 24-26</DATE> at <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Flint Center</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Zellerbach Hall</PERSON> and <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Davies Symphony Hall.</ORGANIZATION>;   At the
<LOCATION>San Jose Symphony</LOCATION>, guest conductors are vying for outgoing conductor <PERSON>George
Cleve</PERSON>'s job, with the best resume coming from Israeli conductor <PERSON>Gabriel Chmura</PERSON>
(<DATE>Nov. 15-17</DATE>). In the remainder of the season, <PERSON>Cleve</PERSON> will play all four
symphonies of <PERSON>Brahms</PERSON> as well as the second piano concerto and the violin
concerto with <PERSON>Rudolf Firkusny</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Abel</PERSON>, respectively, as soloists. He'll
close his term in <DATE>June</DATE> with <PERSON>Haydn</PERSON>'s "Farewell" Symphony and <PERSON>Mahler</PERSON>'s
"Resurrection" Symphony.;   The <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>'s enticing season
includes guest appearances by composer-conductor <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> in the premiere of
his "El Dorado" (<DATE>Nov. 13-17</DATE>). <PERSON>Michael Tilson Thomas</PERSON> is back in <DATE>November</DATE>,
leading <PERSON>Charles Ives</PERSON>' Symphony No. 4. Among the symphony soloists, I'd
recommend soprano <PERSON>Jessye Norman</PERSON>, pianists <PERSON>Radu Lupu</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mitsuko Uchida</PERSON>, and
violinist Cho-Liang Lin.;   Among orchestras elsewhere, the <LOCATION>Bay Area Women</LOCATION>'s
Philharmonic under <PERSON>JoAnn Falletta</PERSON> will present a premiere-studded night <DATE>Feb. 1</DATE>
at <LOCATION>Zellerbach Hall</LOCATION>. The program includes <PERSON>Darius Milhaud</PERSON> ("Le Boeuf sur le
Toit") and <PERSON>Libby Larsen</PERSON>, whose "Ghosts of an Old Ceremony," a ballet score,
will be danced by the troupe for which it was written, ODC/San Francisco.;  
In a class by itself is the superb Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra under
<PERSON>Nicholas McGegan</PERSON>. The season's pick may just be the opening concert later this
month: <ORGANIZATION>Handel</ORGANIZATION>'s favorite oratorio, "Theodora," in its <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> premiere.;  
Leading the choral offerings are the Tallis Scholars, singing early music from
<LOCATION>MexiCo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in a <DATE>March 1</DATE> concert at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>First
Congregational Church.</ORGANIZATION>;   In the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>, we look forward to the <DATE>March 30-31</DATE>
world premiere of <PERSON>Libby Larsen</PERSON>'s "Missa Gaia" ("Mass for the Earth"),
commissioned by <LOCATION>Schola Cantorum.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>San Jose Symphonic Choir</PERSON> under <PERSON>LeRoy G.
Kromm</PERSON> will present <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>'s "St. Matthew Passion" <DATE>April 4</DATE> and <PERSON>Brahms</PERSON>' "German
Requiem" <DATE>May 30.</DATE>;   Classical choruses this year are also exploring African
roots: Schola Cantorum with the "Missa Luba" on its <DATE>Dec. 13-14</DATE> slate and <ORGANIZATION>San
Jose Symphonic Choir</ORGANIZATION> with its <DATE>Nov. 9</DATE> concert featuring the "African Sanctus"
and <PERSON>Robert Ray</PERSON>'s "Gospel <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>";   <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s renowned a cappella male
chorus Chanticleer travels southward this season. Its Christmas program -- a
certified gem -- will play the <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> Mission <DATE>Dec. 17</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Carmel</LOCATION>
Mission <DATE>Dec. 18.</DATE>;   IN SOUTH BAY CHAMBER MUSIC, YOU could get by remembering
just two names: Stanford String Quartet and the <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Chamber Music
Society</ORGANIZATION>. The society hosts the quartet <DATE>Sept. 29</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>First Unitarian Church</ORGANIZATION>,
where you can check out the newly reconstituted ensemble in <LOCATION>Mozart</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Elgar</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Quincy Porter.</PERSON>;   The society also plays host to Magnificat <DATE>Oct. 13</DATE> in a
concert version of the <DATE>1624</DATE> Monteverdi rarity, "Il Combattimento di Tancredi e
Clorinda.";   <ORGANIZATION>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma</ORGANIZATION> and pianist <PERSON>Jeffrey Kahane</PERSON> top the recital
list, though their <DATE>April 6</DATE> program in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s cavernous War <ORGANIZATION>Memorial
Opera House</ORGANIZATION> may be barely audible. <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Performances' remaining
lineup includes pianists <PERSON>Evgeny Kissin</PERSON> (<DATE>Oct. 14</DATE>) and <PERSON>Andre Watts</PERSON> (<DATE>March 31</DATE>),
and baritone <PERSON>Thomas Hampson</PERSON>, the Met's and <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION>'s newest star
(<DATE>Jan. 17</DATE>).;   <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION> will play host (<DATE>Oct. 11</DATE>) to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
best-known musician of the century -- <PERSON>Ravi Shankar</PERSON>, sitar -- who is a
71-year-old <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> resident.;   And for a slice of history: <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s
computer-music studio, at its <DATE>Sept. 27</DATE> Frost Amphitheater concert, will honor
<PERSON>Leon Theremin</PERSON>, 95, the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> resident who invented the electronic instrument
named after him -- one of the last of the grand old men of modern music.;

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- In Concert:
Bigness Reigns at BAM

   "This is gigantic," said <PERSON>Joe Melillo</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Next Wave Festival</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Academy of Music</ORGANIZATION>. 
"This is monumental. 
This is jumbo economy-size concert-making!" 
This is composer <PERSON>William Bolcom</PERSON>'s setting of <PERSON>William Blake</PERSON>'s "Songs of Innocence and Experience," for three choruses, 10 soloists, three conductors and an orchestra, 234 performers in all, and nearly three hours of music. 
For its three performances of the work <DATE>last weekend</DATE>, the festival built BAM's opera-house stage out into the audience and removed the acoustical stage shell, but parts of the <LOCATION>Brooklyn Philharmonic</LOCATION>, including the extra percussionists, still got pushed into the stage's right wing. 
<PERSON>Lukas Foss</PERSON>, the conductor, got an extra-tall podium to stand on, and <PERSON>Harry Salzman</PERSON>, the choral conductor, periodically popped up out of the violas to cue the singers. 
The production required 27 hours of rehearsal and cost <MONEY>$140,000</MONEY>. 

   Symphonic gigantism has a distinguished history: Consider <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven's Ninth</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>'s Symphony of a Thousand and 19th-century performances of <ORGANIZATION>Handel</ORGANIZATION>'s Messiah with choruses of a thousand and orchestras of hundreds. 
Contemporary composers, however, have had trouble getting even their string trios performed, let alone full orchestral works with choruses. 
But lately the tide seems to have turned. 
In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>BAM</ORGANIZATION> put on <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>'s orchestral version of "The Desert Music" for full orchestra and chorus; <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> set poems of <PERSON>Emily Dickinson</PERSON> for large orchestra and chorus in "Harmonium," and <PERSON>David Del Tredici</PERSON> has written scores of several hours' duration for augmented orchestra. 
<PERSON>William Bolcom</PERSON> is obviously part of this trend to bigness, and he has a typically offhand explanation for it all: "A lot of us feel the orchestra's days are numbered, and we want to get our licks in while we can." 

   Not really as blase as he sounds, <PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> is actually pretty amazed that his "Songs of Innocence" has just been produced for the fourth time here. (<PERSON>Dennis Russell Davies</PERSON> did the world premiere with the <ORGANIZATION>Stuttgart Opera</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, which was followed by a performance at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> teaches, and another last <DATE>summer</DATE> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.) 
He wrote the piece as a kind of celebration of school spirit: a way to bring together all the music departments at <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, and enable as many people to perform as possible. 
He never expected it to be performed "commercially," but has found that orchestras are interested in the work because of its size: "It's a blockbuster, good for gala affairs." 

   Commercial performances seem like a corruption of the work's intent, because it really is a celebration of school (or community) spirit, rather than a professional concert piece. 
"Songs of Innocence" harks back to the days of community music making, when everybody sang or played something, before music was turned over to professionals. 
The fun of the piece is for the people who are in it, and for their friends and family in the audience. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> also has another theory about the New Bigness: "Maybe big pieces are a way to generate an audience. 
If you have a big chorus, at least you know their families will be there." 

   As a concert piece, however, presented in a major hall, "Songs of Innocence and Experience" doesn't hang together. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> set the songs piecemeal over 25 years, after being captivated by <PERSON>Blake</PERSON> at the age of 17. 
Although he is an academic composer, he is enamored of popular styles -- folk, rock, jazz, reggae -- and has incorporated them into the work, with varying degrees of success. 
<PERSON>Blake</PERSON>'s "The Shepherd," for example, is rendered as an expressive country western ballad, and was sung convincingly by baritone <PERSON>Leslie Guinn</PERSON>. 
"The Little Black Boy" is astonishing proof of how an 18th-century poem can fit together comfortably with a 20th-century rock rhythm, although <PERSON>David Caldwell</PERSON> was an insipid exponent of that vocal style. 
The two "Nurse's Songs" were Bolcomized into simple folk melodies accompanied by acoustic guitar. 
Both were sung by mezzo-soprano <PERSON>Joan Morris</PERSON>, the composer's wife, his partner in a highly successful touring act of vintage American songs for voice and piano, and the best soloist in the show. 
"The Little Vagabond," also sung by <PERSON>Ms. Morris</PERSON>, was pure American music hall. 
<PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> knows his styles, and he knows how to set text. 

   He can also write in more conventionally "classical" idioms: the heavy, dragging, close harmonies for chorus in "Ah, Sunflower" (performed jointly by the excellent <ORGANIZATION>Sine Nomine Singers</ORGANIZATION> as "madrigal chorus" and the full, if muddy, <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn College Choir</ORGANIZATION>); and the fluid soprano leaps in "The Blossom" and "The Angel." 
Unfortunately, <PERSON>Blake</PERSON>'s poems are short, and the styles shift dramatically from poem to poem, without giving the music a chance to build and create any kind of emotional impact. 
This is particularly true in "Songs of Innocence." (Perhaps innocence is inherently less interesting?) 
In the "Experience" sections, some of the poems are paired, which gave <PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> more of a chance for dramatic shaping. 
But ultimately, this piece really is the sum of its parts, and while some are very fine, there are too many of them. 
The overall effect is one of surfeit, not unity. 

   This is a pity, because <PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON> is really a fine composer. 
On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, while the third performance of "Songs of Innocence" was going on at <LOCATION>BAM</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sergiu Luca</PERSON> was playing <PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON>'s "Violin Concerto" with the <ORGANIZATION>American Composers Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Carnegie Hall</LOCATION>. 
This is a true concert piece that any orchestra should be delighted to program: with its heart-on-the-sleeve adagio movement and with the influence of <PERSON>Joe Venuti</PERSON>'s jazz violin in the finale, it makes a statement, speaks for its time and captures its audience. 
It's not gigantic. 
It's not jumbo economy-size concert-making, but it is probably a worthier candidate for the standard repertory than "Songs of Innocence." 
<PERSON>Mr. Bolcom</PERSON>'s wicked "Cabaret Songs," performed by him and <PERSON>Ms. Morris</PERSON> on an <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION> recording, also show off the composer to better advantage. 

   The Next Wave's presentation of "Songs of Innocence," as part of a heavily trendy festival, hyping its size and touting it as a timeless musical achievement, probably did the work a disservice. 
Listeners could only be disappointed. 
In his defense, <PERSON>Mr. Melillo</PERSON> says: "The Next Wave is chartered, mandated, to be a showcase for large-scale work. 
This production stands as a model of why the Next Wave Festival exists." 
Too bad. 
Perhaps other criteria should have more weight.

<LEADPARA>  NEW classical compact discs keep tumbling out to the stores in record numbers.
Haven't those labels heard about the recession? If so, there's no sign of it
yet.;    Some of the best releases in the last month range from German
romantic music to modern works, and flamenco, too. They include the following:  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FLAMENCO GIVES INTRIGUING TURN TO MASS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Recordings  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Misa Flamenca," by <PERSON>Paco Pena</PERSON> (Nimbus 5288; 41 minutes) --
<PERSON>Guitarist-composer Pena</PERSON> has created a rousing and deeply felt version of the
<LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION> in Spanish, using the flamenco idiom of singers, guitarists and
percussion. The most remarkable facet of this new recording is the guttural
flamenco singing, as in the powerful soul-searching "Our Father." Also of
note: the "Kyrie" guitar solo by <PERSON>Pena</PERSON>, the insistent thumping of an anguished
heart in "Lamb of God" and the catchy choral singing in the "Santo.";   
<PERSON>Pena</PERSON>'s work represents a new Hispanic dimension of the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Mass</ORGANIZATION> and a new
liturgical use of timeless flamenco. One of the year's most intriguing
innovations.;    Works by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> composers; "American Elegies," Orchestra of <ORGANIZATION>St.
Luke</ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, conductor (Nonesuch 979249; 48 minutes, CD) -- The keenly
sensitive renditions here of works by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> composers add up to an elegant and
important record.;    Sweet-voiced soprano <PERSON>Dawn Upshaw</PERSON> could make grown men
melt with her tender group of <PERSON>Charles Ives</PERSON> songs, wistfully rendered in
conductor <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' own arrangements.;    <PERSON>Ives</PERSON>' great orchestral enigma "The
Unanswered Question" is also here, followed by <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>' similarly meandering
"Eros Music," performed by pianist <PERSON>Paul Crossley</PERSON> and the orchestra.;    <PERSON>San
Franciscan Ingram Marshall</PERSON>'s environmental "Fog Tropes" includes taped marine
sounds of gaunt beauty. Here, too, are <PERSON>Morton Feldman</PERSON>'s minimalist "Madame
Press Died Last Week at Ninety" and <PERSON>David Diamond</PERSON>'s old-fashioned "Elegy in
Memory of <PERSON>Maurice Ravel</PERSON>.";    Anti-symphony; <PERSON>ANTON BRUCKNER</PERSON>: Symphony No. 0,
<ORGANIZATION>Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>, Eliahu Inbal conducting, (<ORGANIZATION>Teldec</ORGANIZATION>
2292-46330; 44 minutes) -- I have a profound weakness for Austrian composer
<PERSON>Bruckner</PERSON>, whose romanticism, built on massive organ-like chords, can be
overwhelming. Symphonically he went at least one up on <LOCATION>Beethoven</LOCATION>; in addition
to <PERSON>Bruckner</PERSON>'s nine regularly numbered symphonies, he created the early and
little-played Symphony No. 0 in D Minor. The number was his own choice, by way
of rejecting the whole idea.;    Modern scholarship has shown its origins to
postdate the <ORGANIZATION>Symphony No. 1</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>1869</DATE>, coming at least five years after the
date once considered valid.;    To me, it's the first minimalist symphony,
with repetitive phrases producing nearly perpetual motion.;    The recording
is dreadful, the program notes almost incomprehensible. But the piece is
monumental, the melodiousness seductive. The youthful style and conciseness
are refreshing, a whole new dimension for those knowing only later Bruckner.
But for a better zero, go for <PERSON>Riccardo Chailly</PERSON>'s recording on London.;   
'<LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION>' version; <PERSON>ROBERT SCHUMANN</PERSON>: Symphonies Nos. 1, 4. <PERSON>Kurt Masur</PERSON> leads the
<LOCATION>London Philharmonic</LOCATION>. (<ORGANIZATION>Teldec</ORGANIZATION> 2292-46445; 56 minutes) -- <PERSON>Masur</PERSON> is on his home
turf with <PERSON>Schumann</PERSON>, propelling these works with an inexorable forcefulness, an
attention to structure and no frills.;    For the Fourth -- <PERSON>Schumann</PERSON>'s last --
<LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Masur</PERSON> opts for the first ("<LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION>") version, perhaps out of
chauvinism but more likely in concurrence with <PERSON>Brahms</PERSON> that it was the fresher
and tighter alternative. The orchestra plays with fine attention to detail.;  
 20th-century repertory;  <ORGANIZATION>American Piano Sonatas</ORGANIZATION>, Vol. 1: <LOCATION>Copland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ives</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Barber</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Peter Lawson</PERSON>, piano (Virgin Classics 7 91163; 76 minutes) --
This release is very welcome, indeed, promising a whole series on timely
20th-century repertory.;    <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> does wonders with <PERSON>Ives</PERSON>' rhythmically
unusual "Three-Page Sonata" (<DATE>1905</DATE>), in some ways the most modern work in the
group. The amiable and energetic <PERSON>Carter Sonata</PERSON> -- the longest on the CD --
helps frame the well-known <ORGANIZATION>Barber Op</ORGANIZATION>. 26 showpiece and <ORGANIZATION>Copland</ORGANIZATION>'s sensitive
Sonata of 1939-41.;    Sonically, this is a very attractive album. Look for
more to come. (Can we hope for an <PERSON>Ives</PERSON> "Concord" Sonata in Volume 2?)  </TEXT>

OJAI FESTIVAL KEEPS CUTTING-EDGE TRADITION -- WITH A TWIST;

<P>
MUSIC: NEW DIRECTOR STEPHEN MOSKO WILL REPLACE THE OLD AND EUROPEAN STANDARDS

<P>
There's a change of direction for the <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION> Festival this year. In the past, the 
annual outdoor event has built a reputation for blending lesser-known music by 
<PERSON>Bach</PERSON>, <PERSON>Beethoven</PERSON> and other established masters with the work of cutting edge 
20th-Century personalities such as <PERSON>Igor Stravinsky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pierre Boulez</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lukas Foss</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Peter Maxwell Davies</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Stephen Mosko</PERSON>, the festival's new music director, plans to maintain the 
cutting-edge tradition, but add a pronounced twist. This <DATE>weekend</DATE>, the music of 
<PERSON>Frederic Rzewski</PERSON>, <PERSON>Morton Subotnick</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elliott Carter</PERSON> (who will all 
attend) dominates the agenda, replacing any old and European fare with music 
exclusively new and American. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a celebration of the vitality of American music," insisted <PERSON>Mosko</PERSON> by 
telephone from the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, where he serves as music director of the <ORGANIZATION>San 
Francisco Contemporary Players</ORGANIZATION>. "The emphasis is not about being academic. It's 
more a fun festival than anything." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mosko</PERSON> (also known by his lifelong nickname, "Lucky") speaks at a rapid-fire 
pace about the return of tonality, and influences from rock and pop music that 
have helped shape the direction he is trying to emphasize. The conductor, 
composer and teacher, who was born the same year the first official <ORGANIZATION>Ojai 
Festival</ORGANIZATION> was held in <DATE>1947</DATE>, has also included the works of younger composers 
such as <PERSON>Rand Steiger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Steven Mackey</PERSON> and Art <PERSON>Jarvinen</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any of us from my generation and younger weren't influenced 
by pop culture," <PERSON>Mosko</PERSON> observed. "And world music has also been an enormous 
influence on composers of our era. I owned my first <PERSON>Ravi Shankar</PERSON> record when I 
was 12." 
</P>
<P>
The annual weekend festival in the <LOCATION>Ojai Valley</LOCATION> -- 90 minutes northwest of <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> -- will present eight concerts in three days, ranging in duration from 
one to three hours. The <ORGANIZATION>Ojai Festival Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> will be appended by two other 
performance ensembles: <PERSON>Mosko</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Contemporary Music Players</ORGANIZATION> and the 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> E.A.R. Unit. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe more specifically what listeners might expect, <PERSON>Mosko</PERSON> 
pointed to the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>'70s</DATE>, when composers began to rediscover tonality. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a feeling to get back to the immediacy that music can make," he 
explained. "Back in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> when the Fluxus movement was going on, the word 
'minimalism' referred to pieces like those by <ORGANIZATION>La Monte Young</ORGANIZATION> where a cello 
would play one chord for an hour. I don't know when things got turned around 
with that word. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction by critics to what they now call 'minimalism,' or 'the new 
simplicity,' is more sociological than musical. The music simply tries to 
incorporate methods outside the longstanding European tradition." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mosko</PERSON>, who holds teaching posts at the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of the Arts</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>, has also changed his composition style since early in his 
career when outrageous avant-garde theater and music were going through a 
heyday. He defends the return of tonality in new music. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth with this type of music is that intellectualism goes away if the 
music becomes more intuitive," he said. "But if you examine the canons in <PERSON>Steve 
Reich</PERSON>'s 'Desert Music' or the intricacies in the scores of <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> or <PERSON>Morton 
Subotnick</PERSON>, the complexity is there, even if the music sounds simpler than 
something by <PERSON>Elliot Carter</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Executive director <PERSON>Jeanette O'Conner</PERSON>, who has served in some capacity with the 
festival for the <DATE>last 11 years</DATE>, admits that the subscription rate this year is 
lower than in the past -- down <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> from last year. But she says she has no 
regrets as she leaves the <ORGANIZATION>Ojai Festival</ORGANIZATION> to become the director of development 
for <ORGANIZATION>Chamber Music America</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> next year. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, traditions are made to be broken," she said. "In <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION>, the locals 
have tended to view the event as crazy music plus <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>. This year, 
the strong element will be the crazy music." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are availble by calling (800) 554-OJAI. Single ticket prices range from 
<MONEY>$10</MONEY>-<MONEY>$27.50</MONEY> per concert, <MONEY>$50</MONEY>-<MONEY>$125</MONEY> for the entire series of five concerts. Three 
special concerts are not included in the series price.

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; RECORD; HISTORY; REVIEW; NAME; LIST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE lists of "best serious music of the 20th century" are many. But in most of
them the emphasis falls heavily on the first 50 years, and the second half
gets short shrift.;    One of the victims of such selections is Polish
composer Witold Lutoslawski, who was well received conducting his own works at
the San Francisco Symphony recently, including one I'd include on my own
best-pieces list: his "Concerto for Orchestra." (It will be performed by the
San Jose Symphony in February).  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A CRITIC'S TOP PICKS FROM THE LAST 40 YEARS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     With the century rushing toward its end, this seems to be an apt time for a
critic to present a best-works list for the second half. So here goes -- with
the hope that readers who find something else more arresting will let me know
their choices. (Most of these pieces are available on audio recordings, either
CDs or LPs.);    <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' "<PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>" is part of a new breed of opera
combining a versatile kind of minimalism with a documentary approach to plot.
The work is based on <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s historic breakthrough in <LOCATION>U.S.-China</LOCATION>
relations, with <PERSON>Mao Tse-tung</PERSON> in a major role. Another <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> work -- "Phrygian
Gates," an appealing piece for solo piano -- almost makes my list, too, for
its demonstration that minimalism can be varied and virtuosic.;    <PERSON>Philip
Glass</PERSON>' "Satyagraha" is another docu-opera, dealing with <PERSON>Mohandas Gandhi</PERSON>'s
early work to free the Indian masses from exploitation and discrimination.
Glass' Eastern-inspired minimalism is more doctrinaire than <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>', but it
fits the Indian theme hand-in-glove. Glass uses innovative approaches in both
his operas and concert pieces, making the electronic synthesizer a dominant
accompaniment.;    A third opera, <PERSON>Thea Musgrave</PERSON>'s "<PERSON>Mary Queen</PERSON> of Scots,"
demonstrates that an honest historical opera built around a stunning lead
soprano need not revert to derivative music. Her music is fresh, vital and
mildly dissonant.;    <PERSON>Kzrysztof Penderecki</PERSON>'s "St. Luke's Passion" is a
choral-orchestral work that embodies new techniques of tone clusters and
microtones to eerie, spine-tingling effect. The texts predate <PERSON>J.S. Bach.</PERSON>;   
<PERSON>Hans-Werner Henze</PERSON>'s "El Cimarron," for a male singer-narrator and small
percussion-dominated ensemble, is a brilliant setting for the memoirs of a
freed Cuban slave. This piece -- one of the most memorable works done in
Spanish -- came from a German who lives in <LOCATION>Italy.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Luciano Berio</PERSON>'s
"Sinfonia," from the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, was a trailblazer, using the <ORGANIZATION>Swingle Singers</ORGANIZATION>
alongside the orchestra to voice evocations of <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> and
wordless song. The vocal textures are well integrated into this lengthy
orchestral work.;    <PERSON>Olivier Messiaen</PERSON>'s "From the Canyons to the Stars" was
inspired by the American prairie, even though <ORGANIZATION>Messiaen</ORGANIZATION> is French. Maybe it's
an American chauvinism that draws me to this work, but I can't overlook
<ORGANIZATION>Messiaen</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in bird calls, his powerful Christian bent, and his
massive canvas, all realized in music.;    <PERSON>Tod Machover</PERSON>'s "Spectres Parisiens"
is the best amalgam yet of live orchestra with real-time electronic sounds --
a provocative medium whose surface has barely been scratched, even though the
technology is all in place. The impatient <PERSON>Machover</PERSON> has moved from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and is now composing electronic operas.;    <PERSON>Michael McNabb</PERSON>'s
"DreamSong," created at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University</ORGANIZATION>'s computer-music studios in the
early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, is a piece I'd take to a desert island to restore frazzled
nerves. It conjures up fantastic, restful images in its ultra-sophisticated
soundscape. I lament that the recording is out of print.;    <PERSON>George Crumb</PERSON>'s
"Black Angels" was a response to the apocalyptic side of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War. It's
a hyperactive, quote-filled string quartet, in which the players also
contribute chants, percussion and whispers. The anguish is palpable. The
string instruments are amplified in this work, perhaps presaging the quartets
of the 21st century.;    Some late symphony of Shostakovich belongs on the
list, but which? Various people will lean toward No. 10 (heard this season at
the San Jose Symphony) or No. 13 (framing the anti-persecution poem "Babi
Yar"). My own favorite, however, is <PERSON>Dmitri Shostakovich</PERSON>'s Symphony No. 14.
This is an inordinately compact work, which audaciously introduced to the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> poems from <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, sung hauntingly by a soprano and a
bass over a chamber orchestra. It is to <PERSON>Shostakovich</PERSON> what the "Four Last
Songs" are to <PERSON>Richard Strauss</PERSON>, a summing up of an entire career as an artist.
A professional <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> performance of this work is long overdue.;    <PERSON>Igor
Stravinsky</PERSON>'s "Variations" is a brief, brilliant orchestral foray into jagged
12-tone music. It comes and goes in the time it takes to cook an egg, but it
offers a lot of appealing seasoning.;    <PERSON>Gyorgy Ligeti</PERSON>'s "Aventures" creates
brilliant otherworldly effects. About a half-hour of this choral work was used
for the ape sequence in the sound track of the film "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Ligeti's tone clusters are chilling and unforgettable.;    <PERSON>Pierre Boulez</PERSON>'s
"Pli selon pli" (which translates roughly as "Folded Accordingly"), a work for
soprano and orchestra, is the musical pinnacle of this composer, who
epitomizes the austere, complex style dominant in the <DATE>'50s</DATE> and <DATE>'60s</DATE>. It has
been revised so often I've lost track, but its constant metamorphosis is part
of the appeal.;    <PERSON>Benjamin Britten</PERSON>'s "The Turn of the Screw," a ghost opera
based on the <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON> novel, is a gem of conciseness from a master of
economy and lyricism. A close second on my list of Britten favorites is his
"War Requiem," which speaks with eloquence about the futility and profound
loss of war, while linking soldiers on opposite sides of the front through the
words of British poet <PERSON>Wilfred Owen</PERSON>, who died in World War I.;    For a variety
of reasons, other works warrant mention.;    Some are significant for their
historical importance. Among them:;    (box) <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>'s "Clapping Music"
and <PERSON>Terry Riley</PERSON>'s "In C," for launching minimalism in the mid-1960s.;    (box)
<PERSON>David Del Tredici</PERSON>'s "Alice" series of nearly a dozen big orchestral pieces,
for taking us to a comfy wonderland of rediscovered romanticism, with a
soprano whimsically voicing <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON> on a bullhorn.;    (box) <PERSON>George
Rochberg</PERSON>'s String Quartet No. 3, for signaling an emphatic return to tonality
-- now the dominant style -- in the early '70s.;    Also, <PERSON>Morton Feldman</PERSON> made
a virtue of ultra-slow music; <PERSON>Conlon Nancarrow</PERSON> did incredible rhythmic
juxtapositions with hand-punched piano rolls; and <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>John Chowning</PERSON>
developed both frequency-modulated synthesized sound and a phenomenal
electronic simulation of the human voice.;    But my last choice is straight
out of Zen -- a work that comments simultaneously on others' music, on
excessive ritual, on musical theater and on the sonic overload of our age:
<PERSON>John Cage</PERSON>'s "4<DATE>'33</DATE>," " for one or more instruments. This piece calls for
exactly four minutes and 33 seconds of silence, with the "performer"
theatrically simulating performance in any way desired.;    The 20th has been
a great, crazy, inventive century. I wouldn't trade it for any other -- except
the 21st. (box)  </TEXT>

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: A conductor with a vision - The man behind the the
rising fortunes of the San Francisco Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY in the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Festival Hall</ORGANIZATION> and the following evening in the
<LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> <PERSON>Symphony Hall</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Symphony</ORGANIZATION> will be winding up its
latest European tour: ten concerts in eight cities in 14 days. Nothing
special in that: American orchestras regularly cross the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> these days
 -not just the Famous Five (<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>) but several other bands (such as <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>St Louis</LOCATION>) risen to international prominence in recent decades, in equal part
because of their own improved standards and increased 'visibility' via
records.
There is now a widely shared perception that, of all those formerly
second-rank orchestras, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>'s has achieved the most remarkable
advances; and since this is most plausibly attributable to the seven-year
partnership forged with the conductor who is leading the European tour, the
American-born <PERSON>Swede Herbert Blomstedt</PERSON>, a special interest must attach to the
latest British encounters with the orchestra.
In the <DATE>summer of 1990</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Edinburgh Festival</ORGANIZATION> formed the sole British
stopping-point of another European tour, the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>'s two
concerts provided perhaps the purely musical high point of the whole
three-week programme. As I wrote at the time, 'Under <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON> the orchestra
has developed into a first-rate ensemble, (and) should be regarded as a
prize catch (for <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>). The first concert was an occasion for broadly
authoritative music-making - not splashy or show-off (<PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON>, a
restrained, rather sober figure on the podium, would hardly countenance
that) but honestly and powerfully guided by musical concerns'.
Since then, the orchestra's star has continued to rise internationally -
aided by its output of uniformly fine recordings, mainly but not exclusively
on <ORGANIZATION>Decca</ORGANIZATION>, of <DATE>19th-century</DATE> and late-Romantic symphonies, choral and
orchestral showpieces, and new works by such important American figures as
<PERSON>Charles Wuorinen</PERSON>.
All are made in the <PERSON>Davies Hall</PERSON>, the orchestra's specially built (in <DATE>1980</DATE>)
concert hall, whose acoustics, problematical at first, have recently been
improved by a Dollars 10m programme of overhaul. Serious programme-building,
which the range of <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION> recordings reflects, has been a
hallmark of concerts during the <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON> years. A <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sibelius</PERSON>
specialist, he has also concentrated on <PERSON>Bruckner</PERSON>, in spite of (as he says
himself) a tendency of American audiences to lose concentration during those
spacious long movements.
In addition, new American music has been assiduously promoted - not just
<LOCATION>West Coast Minimalists</LOCATION> like <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> but such 'tough nuts' as <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and
Sessions (whom he cracks himself). Yet <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON> has maintained not just the
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> orchestra but <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> concert-goers in step with his
vision of what an orchestra should be and do.
Down the <LOCATION>Pacific Coast</LOCATION>, the youth and good looks of <ORGANIZATION>Esa-Pekka Salonen</ORGANIZATION> are
hugely magnified on a Sunset Boulevard billboard advertising the <ORGANIZATION>LA
Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Music Director cuts an altogether different
and, on the face of it, less likely <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> figure - a lean, Nordically
sharp-featured 65-year-old whose conversation resonates with dry wit and
quiet, cast-iron conviction (he is a devout Seventh Day Adventist).
It was, initially, something of a long-shot appointment. Blomstedt came to
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> highly respected in the profession for his association with
(inter alia) the Danish Radio Symphony and, particularly, for the ten years
(1975-85) he spent with the <ORGANIZATION>Dresden Staatskapelle</ORGANIZATION>. (A mid-'70s Festival Hall
concert by the <LOCATION>Dresden</LOCATION> orchestra under <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON>, with <PERSON>Strauss</PERSON> first and a
naturally-flowing, magnificently solid <LOCATION>Eroica</LOCATION> afterwards, has stayed
intensely vivid in my memory.) But he exuded no PR-heightened 'glamour', and
brandished no recording contracts (those came after the partnership was
already launched).
Success came in the most rewarding way - in terms of steadily enriched
orchestral sound, profile and personality. The healthy artistic situation is
economically mirrored: at a time when many American cultural institutions,
and certainly the majority of orchestral ones, are struggling to balance
their books, the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION> has kept its consistently in the
black.
I visited the orchestra at its home base at the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>, catching
at the same time the premiere of the Oboe Concerto (coolly lyrical, catchily
percussive, more complex and interesting than first impressions suggest) by
<PERSON>John Harbison</PERSON> which - characteristically - <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON> is including in one of
his European tour programmes. (It will be heard in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, alongside the
<ORGANIZATION>Bruckner Fourth</ORGANIZATION>.) I found that pride in the achievement of the <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON>
years runs, unshowily but insistently, through every level of the
organisation. And yet, prior to the <DATE>December</DATE> concerts, the conductor had
just shocked everyone by announcing his intention to quit the music
director's post in <DATE>1995</DATE>. The loss will be soothed by his occupation
thereafter of the Conductor Laureate title. But why the departure?
'It is time. I have had a very good period with the orchestra. The quality
of all the sections has improved. The orchestra is now full of fantastic
players. It needed building up, and we have worked on that together. In some
senses an American orchestra finds the great Classical symphonic repertory
harder than the modern music they play: they are very quick in learning the
notes, but there is perhaps a shorter interest span than we are used to in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.'
He has felt cut off from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Artistic connections from the past have had
to be loosened or even put aside for <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. As the fine print of his
work so plainly testifies, <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON> is not a conductor for whistle-stop,
minimum-rehearsal guest engagements (he has never appeared with any of the
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> orchestras, although probably not for want of invitations). He speaks
movingly of his years with the <LOCATION>Dresden</LOCATION> players, of the hardships they
endured in <ORGANIZATION>GDR</ORGANIZATION> times and the uncertainties that now beset them, and above
all of the orchestra's character - 'so warm, with its rich string sound, so
full and natural'.
Where will <PERSON>Blomstedt</PERSON> go after <DATE>1995</DATE>? He is keeping that secret; but wherever
it may be, the appointment must surely promise the conditions in which this
first-rate musician and orchestral trainer can flourish - as he so obviously
has in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.

   In Concert: Flutists' Blowout

<LP>
   New York -- The job of putting on one orchestral premiere
is daunting enough for most musicians, but four in a single
concert, all of them for flute, smacks of artist masochism.
Nonetheless, flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson recently
brought his Solisti New York Chamber Orchestra together with
three other prominent flutists for just such a blowout in
Town Hall.
   The concert was the culmination of a project that began
several years ago, when Mr. Wilson and fellow flutists Carol
Wincenc and Paula Robison applied for a grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts to commission works from
three composers. Each flutist would play all the concertos
and premiere one, thereby ensuring at least three
performances of each work. After some haggling, the trio
tapped Joseph Schwantner ("an established composer,"
according to Mr. Wilson), Robert Beaser ("a new kid on the
block") and Paul Schoenfield ("someone from out of left
field").
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only <PERSON>Mr. Beaser</PERSON> finished his piece, "Song of the Bells,"
on schedule, and <PERSON>Ms. Wincenc</PERSON> premiered it with the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul
Chamber Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Cut to 1989-90. <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Solisti New York</ORGANIZATION> have come to an agreement with <PERSON>Town Hall</PERSON>,
the only presenter in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> willing to take on an evening
of new flute concertos, and they have a concert date. To
round out the program, they have added futuristic flutist
<PERSON>Robert Dick</PERSON> performing his own new concerto. A recording for
<LOCATION>New World</LOCATION> is lined up. So where are the other concertos? Uhh
. . . they're coming along. <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> realizes that
conducting four new works and playing one will probably send
him round the bend, so he enlists the services of <PERSON>Alasdair
Neale</PERSON>, assistant conductor of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>,
former flute player, and a crack new-music learner. A few
months before the concert, <PERSON>Ms. Wincenc</PERSON> has the solo part of
the <PERSON>Schoenfield</PERSON> concerto. A week before the concert, the
orchestral parts arrive. "They were full of errors," <PERSON>Mr.
Wilson</PERSON> says. "There were no meters in the score, no bar
lines. . . . <PERSON>Alasdair</PERSON> likes a challenge, but . . . ."
   Conductors are used to the last-minute nature of
premieres, but they don't usually have to deal with more than
one dilatory composer at a time. The entire <PERSON>Schwantner</PERSON>
concerto also showed up about a week before the performance,
and it was hard.
   "Luckily it was beautifully copied and there were no
revisions," <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> says. There were other surprises as
well. "No matter what you ask for, you get something
different," says <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> of the orchestrations originally
specified in the commissions. The <PERSON>Beaser</PERSON> piece required four
horns. "If the composer says, all I need is one more horn to
make a masterpiece, can you say no?" <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> asks. <PERSON>Mr.
Dick</PERSON>'s piece called for steel drums, and steel drum sets
aren't uniform in the location of pitches on the instrument.
"Two days before the concert, our percussionists got the
drums and the parts and freaked out," <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> recalls.
   <PERSON>Mr. Schoenfield</PERSON>'s "Klezmer Rondos" needed a saxophone,
tuba and trombone for its klezmer band, which was ostensibly
meant to suggest the sound of East European Jewish villages
of yore. It also required a singer.
   Five rehearsals, up from the usual three, weren't enough,
but the orchestra coped obligingly with the messy parts and
frequent changes. "They are an easygoing group," <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>
says.
   The evening, as you might have supposed, turned out to be
a study of contrasting flute style. After an elegant
performance of <PERSON>Ives</PERSON>'s "The Unanswered Question," with the
four flutists (covering all the original wind parts)
responding to the trumpet soloist in the balcony, <PERSON>Ms. Robison</PERSON>
took the stage for <PERSON>Mr. Beaser</PERSON>'s "Song of the Bells." The
orchestra laid out a cushioned, exotic tapestry of sound,
from which <PERSON>Ms. Robison</PERSON>, ever a direct and uncomplicated
performer, soared triumphant, like a breath of clear air.
   <PERSON>Mr. Dick</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> club-style attire -- green jacket,
white-spotted black shirt and tie -- announced that his
"Concerto for Flute/Bass Flute, Strings and Percussion" was
going to be from a different musical planet. No more tonal
romanticism: Here was the flute making whistles, multiple
tones and noises like escaping steam. <PERSON>Mr. Dick</PERSON>'s eerie sounds
were picked up and amplified by the sound of a violin bow
drawn across a xylophone, and they gathered momentum for the
syncopated, jocular finale. The thud of the bass flute cut
through any preconceptions about the ethereal sound of the
instrument. What noise will he make next, one wondered. The
effect was engaging, but more curious and entertaining than
expressive.
   With <PERSON>Mr. Schwantner</PERSON>'s "A Play of Shadows," <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON>
returned us to the tonal universe. Here again, as in the
<PERSON>Beaser</PERSON> concerto, a harp in the orchestra provided a foil for
the flute. The concerto sounded a lot like <PERSON>Mr. Schwantner</PERSON>'s
other pieces; the symmetrical form and the opening and
closing glissandos recalled "A Sudden Rainbow." But
soft-edged, coloristic and Schwantnerian as it was, it was
also more rhythmically jaunty than the <PERSON>Beaser</PERSON> concerto. <PERSON>Mr.
Wilson</PERSON> gave the virtuosic solo part a nuanced intensity.
   The finale, <PERSON>Mr. Schoenfield</PERSON>'s "Klezmer <PERSON>Rondos</PERSON>," was indeed
a voice from the shtetl: Yiddish folk melodies in the flute,
a wailing saxophone, a slow, circus march with tambourine,
and finally, the flute commenting on a despairing Yiddish
text about a beautiful, cold girl who comes to a sad end,
sung by a baritone, <PERSON>Douglas Webster</PERSON>. The piece was packed
with local color and entertainment, though the vocal part
didn't add much. <PERSON>Ms. Wincenc</PERSON>, resplendent in a red gown, and
with an edge and abandon to her flute playing, lent an air of
drama to the <TIME>evening</TIME>.
   The three commissions have been recorded (<PERSON>Mr. Dick</PERSON>'s piece
wasn't included because it hadn't been part of the original
deal, and it wouldn't have fit into the basically tonal cast
of the recording), and the three flutists are now looking for
other places to perform the concertos. <PERSON>Mr. Wilson</PERSON> is happy
with the commissioning experience and says <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Michael Torke</PERSON>, and <PERSON>John Harbison</PERSON> have all promised him
concertos. Whether he would take on four premieres at a go
again is another question. "If you'd asked me the day before
the concert, I'd have said never again," he says. "But now --
well, sure."

   Ten years ago, composers didn't bother to write pieces for orchestra because they knew they wouldn't be played. 
Today, 17 composers are or have been in residence with major orchestras across the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the fruit of a big-budget program to rejuvenate the orchestral repertoire. 
In addition to acting as the gadfly for contemporary music in his or her host orchestra, something that has met with varying degrees of success, the composer-in-residence also is expected to write a piece for that orchestra. 
The orchestra then performs and records the work, which is released on a commercial label. 

   Five years into the program's projected 10-year span, four records, with pieces by five composers, have been released on <ORGANIZATION>Nonesuch</ORGANIZATION>. 
Three more already are in preparation, and <PERSON>John Duffy</PERSON>, head of the New York-based nonprofit organization Meet the Composer, which administers the program, says 20 records will be made altogether. 
The five composers already represented offer an intriguing if somewhat disturbing look at contemporary composition as defined by the Orchestra Residencies program. 
The fact is that four of the five pieces sound surprisingly similar. 

   The music directors of the orchestras select their composers-in-residence based on their music. (Another tenet of the program, more devoutly to be wished than actual in some cases, is that the conductor will become the champion of "his" composer's music.) 
All five composers are in their 30s and 40s. 
One, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, chosen by Edo de Waart for the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION> for a job that became the model for the Residencies program, is considered a minimalist, although his compositions bear little resemblance to the works of <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION>Philip Glass</ORGANIZATION> these days. 

   None of the others are affiliated with any particular movement. 
<PERSON>Libby Larsen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephen Paulus</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> natives and co-founders of the <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Composers Forum</ORGANIZATION>, were chosen by <PERSON>Neville Marriner</PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>John Harbison</PERSON>, who won the <DATE>1987</DATE> Pulitzer Prize for Music, spent two stormy years at the <LOCATION>Pittsburgh Symphony</LOCATION> at the behest of <PERSON>Andre Previn</PERSON> (<PERSON>Mr. Previn</PERSON> heard a <PERSON>Harbison</PERSON> piece on his car radio one evening and was smitten), and then followed the maestro to his current post at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Philharmonic</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Joseph Schwantner</PERSON>, who won the Pulitzer in <DATE>1979</DATE>, uprooted himself from the <ORGANIZATION>Eastman School of Music</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Rochester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, where he is a professor, to be in residence with the <LOCATION>St. Louis Symphony</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Leonard Slatkin</PERSON> for three years. 
The Slatkin-Schwantner and de Waart-Adams partnerships have been particularly fruitful, with the conductors playing many of the composers' pieces both with their own orchestras and as guest conductors. 

   Not one of these works -- which range from 13 to 40 minutes in length -- should send the audience screaming for the exits. 
If not formally tonal, they all sound tonal, and their dissonances are easy to take. 
Orchestral instruments are used idiomatically, without squeaking strings, prepared pianos or tormented woodwinds. 
There are recognizable melodies and lines, yet what drives most of these pieces is heavy-duty rhythm and experimentation with orchestral color. 
Sometimes there is so much color that you're not really sure what the picture is. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Paulus</PERSON>'s "Symphony in Three Movements" falls most heavily into that trap: It is so busy with instruments and motives that it is difficult to see any larger plan for all the details. 
<PERSON>Ms. Larsen</PERSON>'s "Symphony: Water Music," on the other hand, is serenely pictorial (according to the liner notes, she has "always found nature the most important inspiration for her music"), and it is fresh, lively and pretty. 
<PERSON>Mr. Schwantner</PERSON>'s "A Sudden Rainbow" (the shortest, at 13 minutes) is the least lyrical and most coloristic of the five. 
It uses a lot of percussion, contrasts different sound registers and choirs of instruments for a more transparent effect, and uses a single gesture -- a glissando that represents the sudden appearance of the rainbow -- as a unifying factor. 
Its characteristic use of fragments and color is also recognizably <PERSON>Schwantner</PERSON>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Harbison</PERSON>'s as yet unchoreographed ballet score "Ulysses' Bow" also has a distinctive profile. 
It is a graphic and poetic representation of its story: <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>' return from his wanderings, and his ousting of <PERSON>Penelope</PERSON>'s suitors. 
<PERSON>Mr. Harbison</PERSON> works out his ideas efficiently in five brief scenes and four even briefer interludes, each with its own identifiable character. 
The orchestra is rich, even Mahlerian. 
The angular, Stravinskian depiction of <PERSON>Penelope</PERSON>'s suitors as nasty, taunting children is wonderful, but not all the scenes work as well -- the more lyrical sections are limp. 

   By contrast with the others, <PERSON>Mr. Adams</PERSON>'s "Harmonielehre" has an argument, a beginning, a middle and an end. 
The composer does not get lost in coloristic experimentation; he focuses on musical and emotional ideas that he works out. 
The 40-minute piece opens with crashing chords that touch off the disturbance and torment of the first two sections, only to subside into an ethereal vision of redemption in the third. 
The repetitive patterns of minimalism appear, but most often as a kind of throbbing stasis that other voices circle around and rise above. 
It is a deeply disturbing, probing piece, and also the most personal and expressive of the five. 

   Indeed, all of the pieces except "Harmonielehre" occupy a kind of middle ground between a full-throated tonality (as exemplified by the works of <ORGANIZATION>David Del Tredici</ORGANIZATION>) and the non-tonal dissonance that contemporary composers feel they must embrace in order to be considered serious. 
This is what is coming to be called the <ORGANIZATION>New Romanticism</ORGANIZATION>. 
It is an idiom that doesn't terrify the audience, but the threat of tameness is dangerous too in the long run. 
Perhaps the orchestra as a medium is bringing out the conservative side of these composers -- the spare, acerbic "Samuel Chapter" for voice and chamber ensemble that fills out <PERSON>Mr. Harbison</PERSON>'s record is in quite a different mode from "Ulysses' Bow," for example, as is his "Flight Into <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>," which won the Pulitzer. 

   Interested conductors point out that contemporary music is becoming somewhat more acceptable in concert halls because composers are writing more "accessibly." 
Are they all -- or are those just the ones being chosen by the powerful Orchestra Residencies program? 
All of these pieces are worth listening to, and whatever their stylistic drawbacks, their existence in performance and on records is an important step forward for American orchestras. 
But one can't help wondering what else is out there.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: OPERATIC LIFE AND DEATH IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> now has three opera companies -- one rising, one moribund and one newly 
born -- as the historic city closes this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Newly born is <ORGANIZATION>Boston Opera Theater</ORGANIZATION>, a company established in the <DATE>spring of 1989</DATE> 
by some former leaders of <PERSON>Sarah Caldwell</PERSON>'s still-embattled Opera Company of 
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, and now raising money and support for a 1990-91 season expected to 
begin in <DATE>December</DATE> of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be misleading to characterize our group as just disgruntled," says 
Opera Theater executive director <PERSON>Robert Cannon</PERSON>, who at one time was president 
of <ORGANIZATION>Caldwell</ORGANIZATION>'s company. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply, we felt that the time had come to establish a new and dynamic opera 
producing company to take <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> into the next century. Our assessment of the 
previous company was that it could not be reorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Among the national and international artists who will work with the new 
company, Cannon says, are stage director <PERSON>Peter Sellars</PERSON> and his artistic 
associate, <PERSON>Craig Smith</PERSON>. (In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> declined to say more to The 
Times beyond confirming that he would be involved with Opera Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
"But this will be more than a company for <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>, who, after all, has a contract 
in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. It will be a broad-based company with an international outlook, 
and one that will bring in important productions from the outside, as well as 
mount its own, new work. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is raising money and putting the pieces together. We 
expect to make a major announcement of our plans in <DATE>January</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
Moribund is <ORGANIZATION>Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston</ORGANIZATION>, which has yet to announce its 
artistic plans for 1989-90, and is beset by a deficit reportedly in the 
neighborhood of <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY>. Repeated calls to the company netted no one willing 
to speak to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rising out of academia is <ORGANIZATION>Boston Lyric Opera</ORGANIZATION>. Formerly connected with 
<ORGANIZATION>Northeastern University</ORGANIZATION>, but recently broken off from that connection, <ORGANIZATION>Lyric 
Opera</ORGANIZATION> opened its 16th season in a new theater, and with high hopes, last month. 
</P>
<P>
According to general director <PERSON>Justin Moss</PERSON>, a Californian who came to 
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Baltimore Opera</LOCATION>, "We have taken a whole new direction with 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
He says two performances of Puccini's "Tosca" in <DATE>September</DATE> were sold out and 
artistically successful; yet to come are concert performances of <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>'s 
"Fliegende Hollander" in <DATE>January</DATE> and staged "Traviatas" in <DATE>March</DATE>. Is there room 
for three opera companies in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely. As a theater town, for instance, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> has audiences for 
everything. Opera is no different. We have a very educated and discerning 
population." 
</P>
<P>
JOFFREY CHANGES: <PERSON>Gerald Arpino</PERSON>, artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION>Joffrey Ballet</ORGANIZATION>, has 
announced the promotions of <PERSON>Scott Barnard</PERSON> to assistant artistic director and 
<PERSON>Barbara Forbes</PERSON> to ballet mistress, plus the addition of seven new dancers to 
the 1989-90 roster. 
</P>
<P>
New members are: <PERSON>Daniel Baudendistel</PERSON>, who rejoins the <ORGANIZATION>Joffrey</ORGANIZATION> after dancing 
with <ORGANIZATION>American Ballet Theatre</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Lar Lubovitch Company</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Pascal Benichou</PERSON>, 
formerly of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Ballet</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Alexander Brady</PERSON>, formerly with the 
1988-89 Joffrey II Dancers; <PERSON>James Conlin</PERSON>, who has danced with the companies of 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Pierre Lockett</PERSON>, formerly of Dance Theatre of 
<LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Jacob Rice</PERSON>, who has performed with companies in <LOCATION>Washington State</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Amanda Smith</PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION>Joffrey II Dancers</ORGANIZATION> from 
<DATE>1987</DATE> to <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>

<LEADPARA>  LOOK for the San Francisco Opera to announce the awarding of a commission to
East Bay composer Conrad Susa for an opera based on "Les Liaisons Dangereuses"
to make its debut four years from now.;   The focal role of the sexually
ravenous "virtuoso of deceit" Mme. de Merteuil -- played by Glenn Close in the
film "Dangerous Liaisons" -- will be offered to the Metropolitan Opera's star
lyric mezzo Frederica von Stade, who is moving from Long Island to the East
Bay.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SAN FRANCISCO OPERA COMMISSIONS A LIAISON  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Susa, 56, is an inventive composer with good credentials. His "Black River"
has been played by a number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troupes. His "Transformations" was done by
a subsidiary of the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> <DATE>a decade ago</DATE>. His "Serenade for a
Christmas Night" and "Hymns for the Amusement of Children," among other
pieces, have been recorded on both sides of the <LOCATION>Atlantic.</LOCATION>;   The commission
will be formally announced during the new year.;   Susa should fare better
than <PERSON>Hugo Weisgall</PERSON>. Weisgall, 79, was commissioned by the opera's General
Director <PERSON>Terry McEwen</PERSON> shortly before his departure in <DATE>1988</DATE> to write "Esther."
The commission was canceled by <PERSON>McEwen</PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON>Lotfi Mansouri</PERSON>, <DATE>two years
later</DATE>. "Esther" which was to have played this <DATE>fall</DATE>, was replaced by <PERSON>Hans
Werner Henze</PERSON>'s "Das verratene Meer.";   Next fall, the opera will present
another contemporary opera, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' "The Death of Klinghoffer," in its
<LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> premiere.;   LIVING WITH AIDS -- Credit lyric baritone and
chamber-singer <PERSON>William Parker</PERSON> with courage. Stricken with AIDS, he continues
his singing career, as demonstrated by his performance with the San <PERSON>Jose
Symphony</PERSON> <DATE>earlier this month</DATE>, sounding as expressive and round-toned as ever.; 
 Faced with the diagnosis, he has stepped up his professional activity. He
recorded both tragedy-laden <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> cantatas for baritone: No. 56 ("I Want to
Carry the Cross") with the <ORGANIZATION>Baroque Choral Guild</ORGANIZATION> singers, and No. 82, ("I Have
Enough") with <PERSON>Nicholas McGegan</PERSON> conducting.;   The resulting CD will be
released as a fund-raiser by the <ORGANIZATION>Shanti Project</ORGANIZATION>, an AIDS-assistance
organization in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. All the performers and the recording company
(<ORGANIZATION>Harmonia Mundi</ORGANIZATION>, with producer <ORGANIZATION>Rubina Young</ORGANIZATION>) are donating their services.;  
<PERSON>Parker</PERSON> has also commissioned a song cycle about death from several composers,
including <PERSON>Lee Hoiby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ned Rorem</PERSON>. It's scheduled for a <DATE>January</DATE> premiere in
<LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, with <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> as soloist. A <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> performance is scheduled in
<DATE>June, 1992</DATE> -- with several other baritones to help out.;   'MESSIAH' RECAST --
When the <LOCATION>Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra</LOCATION> got to <LOCATION>San Rafael</LOCATION> for its "Messiah"
concert this month, <PERSON>Elizabeth Blumenstock</PERSON> dropped her violin and pitched in to
sing soprano as an on-the-spot volunteer for the choir. Only five of 13
sopranos in the UC Chamber Chorus were in good enough health to appear. The
rest were victims of the flu and cold bugs that have been devastating
performing groups this month.;   OPERA AND BALLET RESURGENCE -- A lot of
performing arts groups are hurting at the box office, especially in
subscriptions. But the <LOCATION>San Francisco Opera</LOCATION> went from <PERCENT>94 percent</PERCENT> of capacity
attendance last fall to <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> this <DATE>fall</DATE>, with <DATE>1991</DATE> ticket sales of <MONEY>$12.8
million</MONEY>. And subscription sales were "up considerably," according to a
spokesman.;   The San <PERSON>Jose Cleveland Ballet</PERSON> also hit two records with this
year's "Nutcracker," logging new highs in single-ticket sales (15,972), which
account for more than <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of the overall tickets sold, as well as
income (<MONEY>$338,872</MONEY>), for the seven performances.;   THE LONGEST-PLAYING RECORD?
-- The <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON> record label has announced plans to record all the works of
<PERSON>Havergal Brian</PERSON> (1876-1972), the largely self-taught British composer whose
symphonies make <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>'s look like haiku.;   <PERSON>Brian</PERSON>'s 31 symphonies, several
running more than an hour in length, require huge forces, such as the 16
French horns for the Symphony No. 2, or an augmented choir for the Symphony
No. 4.;   He wrote his Symphony No. 25 in <DATE>1965</DATE>, as he was approaching his 90th
birthday.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this week celebrates a curious but
important milestone: The 200th anniversary of the days on which the
first <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and first <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> achieved a quorum and were finally
ready to begin the work of the new nation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> marks the occasion today, <DATE>April 4</DATE>, three days after
the actual <DATE>April 1</DATE> anniversary. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> celebrates on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
<DATE>April 6</DATE>, the actual date of its first working quorum.
   Commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the
bicentennials of both houses.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> established under the Constitution first convened
in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 4, 1789</DATE>.
   But the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the
two chambers from getting down to business.
   On that first day only 13 of the 59 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members and only eight
of the 22 senators were in attendance.
   Election complications, bad weather, muddy roads and just plain
sloth get the blame as causes for the delay.
   The journal of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> noted with monotonous regularity that
``a quorum of the members not being present, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> adjourned.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> under the discarded Articles of Confederation had been
noted for absenteeism and near paralysis, and many feared history
was about to repeat itself.
   ``We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' Rep. <PERSON>Fisher Ames</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> wrote to a friend in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. ``The public will forget
the government before it is born.''
   The senators who had managed to reach <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> wrote to their
absent colleagues: ``We apprehend that no arguments are necessary
to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the
government into immediate operation and, therefore ernestly request
that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible.''
   George <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> had been elected the nation's first president,
but could not enter office until the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> achieved a quorum and
met to count the ballots of the <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION>.
   From Mount Vernon he grumbled that senators and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members
were in a state of ``stupor or listlessness.''
   But eventually the required numbers assembled.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, counting its first quorum on <DATE>April 1 _ April</DATE> Fool's
Day some have noted _ elected <PERSON>Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> as its first speaker.
   And <PERSON>Fisher Ames</PERSON>, much mollified now that work could begin, said
he was pleased with his new colleagues.
   While there were few ``shining geniuses,'' he said, there were
many who had ``experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of
business.''
   On <DATE>April 6</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> counted its first quorum.
   The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors
and dispatching messengers to inform <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> that
they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this week celebrates a curious but
important milestone: The 200th anniversary of the days on which the
first <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and first <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> achieved a quorum and were finally
ready to begin the work of the new nation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> marks the occasion today, <DATE>April 4</DATE>, three days after
the actual <DATE>April 1</DATE> anniversary. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> celebrates on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
<DATE>April 6</DATE>, the actual date of its first working quorum.
   Commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the
bicentennials of both houses.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> established under the Constitution first convened
in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> on <DATE>March 4, 1789</DATE>.
   But the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the
two chambers from getting down to business.
   On that first day only 13 of the 59 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members and only eight
of the 22 senators were in attendance.
   Election complications, bad weather, muddy roads and just plain
sloth get the blame as causes for the delay.
   The journal of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> noted with monotonous regularity that
``a quorum of the members not being present, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> adjourned.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> under the discarded Articles of Confederation had been
noted for absenteeism and near paralysis, and many feared history
was about to repeat itself.
   ``We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' Rep. <PERSON>Fisher Ames</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> wrote to a friend in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. ``The public will forget
the government before it is born.''
   The senators who had managed to reach <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> wrote to their
absent colleagues: ``We apprehend that no arguments are necessary
to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the
government into immediate operation and, therefore ernestly request
that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible.''
   George <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> had been elected the nation's first president,
but could not enter office until the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> achieved a quorum and
met to count the ballots of the <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION>.
   From Mount Vernon he grumbled that senators and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members
were in a state of ``stupor or listlessness.''
   But eventually the required numbers assembled.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, counting its first quorum on <DATE>April 1 _ April</DATE> Fool's
Day some have noted _ elected <PERSON>Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> as its first speaker.
   And <PERSON>Fisher Ames</PERSON>, much mollified now that work could begin, said
he was pleased with his new colleagues.
   While there were few ``shining geniuses,'' he said, there were
many who had ``experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of
business.''
   On <DATE>April 6</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> counted its first quorum.
   The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors
and dispatching messengers to inform <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> that
they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: BALLET OF LOS ANGELES FINALLY PLAYS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he promised in <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>John Clifford</PERSON> will bring his Ballet of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, for the first time, next <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The 3-year-old touring company 
has been traveling with some regularity across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since its 
founding in <DATE>1987</DATE> -- but has never danced in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, longtime dance observers will note that a Clifford company has not 
danced in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> since the final local performances of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles Ballet</ORGANIZATION> (1975-85) in the <DATE>summer of 1984</DATE>; the company gave its finale 
ultimo in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> that fall, then formally disbanded the following year. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clifford</PERSON> said last fall that he hasn't been avoiding <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and would 
have been here sooner if "there were no deficits involved." 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ballet of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> is presenting itself as part of the company's 
<DATE>spring</DATE> tour. Two performances will be given in Bing Theater next <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at 3 
and <TIME>8 p.m</TIME>. The 11-member touring group will give one program twice: 
<PERSON>Balanchine</PERSON>'s "Apollo," <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON>'s "Songs of a Wayfarer," and his new "Rio Bar 
and Grill," to music of <PERSON>Milhaud</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The tour dancers: <PERSON>Allegra Kent</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nancy Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leslie Carothers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Antonio Lopez</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Courtland Weaver</PERSON>, <PERSON>David MacGillivray</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mandy Bawden</PERSON>, <PERSON>Diane Dickson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Diane 
Diefenderfer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sean Carey</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Stuart Loungway</PERSON>. In addition, two <LOCATION>New York City 
Ballet</LOCATION> principals, both of them alumni of the old <LOCATION>Los Angeles Ballet</LOCATION>, will 
dance here. They are <PERSON>Darci Kistler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Damian Woetzel</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
On the phone from his rehearsal studio last week, <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON> specified that 
<PERSON>Kistler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Woetzel</PERSON> "are not appearing as guest artists, but as alumni (of the 
former company)." 
</P>
<P>
"I did not put them on these performances because I did not want to exploit 
them," <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON> said. "And also so as not to create the impression that this is 
a company that presents guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to see what we have -- also what we had. Many of 
these dancers are <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> people. I live here, and make it my base for 
touring. I am really dedicated to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and this is really an <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Clifford, 42, says the troupe's three years of touring have been successful in 
that "our tours are strictly no-deficit affairs. When we decide to grow and 
settle down, we will have to face (the reality of) forming a board of directors 
and going into the business of fund raising. But so far, just being a traveling 
company, we have not had to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Where would he like to settle? 
</P>
<P>
"I want to locate where I'm wanted. But, if <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> doesn't want this 
company, there is a lot of interest in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. They certainly want the 
arts down there." 
</P>
<P>
SELLARS IN <LOCATION>BOSTON</LOCATION>: Every time <PERSON>Peter Sellars</PERSON> starts a new project, Angelenos 
hold their breath. Last weekend <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> surfaced in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to officially 
announce the formation of a company called <ORGANIZATION>Boston Opera Theater</ORGANIZATION>. Adding this to 
his other ventures here and in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, one might wonder how the artistic 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Festival</ORGANIZATION> can keep his commitments. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON>' answer to this question was unequivocal. "My major 
commitment is to the <LOCATION>L.A. Festival</LOCATION>, which is where I live. Here in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> I am 
only an adviser." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON>' only obligation to <ORGANIZATION>Boston Opera Theater</ORGANIZATION> is to assist in 
reviving his trilogy of Mozart/Da Ponte operas over several seasons, starting 
with "The Marriage of Figaro" in <DATE>January</DATE>. After dozens of performances of these 
works, which originated at the <ORGANIZATION>PepsiCo Festival</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, later in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, reviving the productions in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> will require a minimal time 
commitment, <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"These productions, created with a core of artists who make <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> their home, 
have been in a range of cultural capitals but never in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. I am pleased 
that a cycle of work, begun seven years ago, reaches its conclusion, at last, 
in our hometown." 
</P>
<P>
Among <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON>' projects is his first film. It's being produced for this year's 
<ORGANIZATION>L.A. Festival</ORGANIZATION> and is titled "The Cabinet of <PERSON>Dr. Ramirez</PERSON>." It is <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON>' spoof 
of "The Cabinet of <PERSON>Dr. Caligari</PERSON>," the silent screen <PERSON>Fritz Lang</PERSON> classic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my feature-length silent film in color, with a score by <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>. It 
will be great. It's going to be shot in <DATE>June</DATE>," <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> said, "on location in 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Then I edit it in <DATE>July</DATE> and <DATE>August</DATE> and it premieres in <LOCATION>Hollywood Bowl</LOCATION> 
during the Festival with the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Philharmonic</LOCATION> playing the <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> 
score live." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1991</DATE>, he stages the <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> opera "Klinghoffer," based on the story of 
the American <PERSON>Leon Klinghoffer</PERSON>, who was killed by hijackers on board the Italian 
liner Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
Another frequent <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> collaborator -- the avant-garde dancer/choreographer 
<PERSON>Mark Morris</PERSON> -- also has a prominent role in "Klinghoffer" as well. The new 
opera will receive its world premiere in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, then goes to <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> (for the <DATE>1991</DATE> festival) and then <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars also confirmed "what the world already knows" that he will stage 
<PERSON>Olivier Messiaen</PERSON>'s opera, "St. Francois d'Assise" at the <ORGANIZATION>Salzburg Festival</ORGANIZATION> in 
<DATE>1992</DATE> in collaboration with the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Philharmonic</LOCATION>. Pending a formal 
announcement from <LOCATION>Salzburg</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> declined further comment. <PERSON>Peter Catalano</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>David Sweet</PERSON> contributed to this column.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: American influences - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The billing for <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s concert by Music Projects/London was 'American
Counterpoints', but this really applied only to <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>'s ingenious
<LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> Counterpoint for one live flute and ten more on tape; and maybe, to
<PERSON>Colin Matthews</PERSON>' Hidden Variables, which is in part a mischievous send-up
(British) of American minimalism and post-minimalism.
Still, what's in a name? In this case, the official but purely notional
tie-in with the American Art show at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Academy</ORGANIZATION>. (There may have been
people there who came expressly to match their impressions of American
abstract painting against aural <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Cage</PERSON>, but how would one
know?) Forget the label: this was a concert full of lively imagination, from
the planning to the execution - bright, inquiring, funny and exhilarating.
Music Projects/London was set up by the conductor <PERSON>Richard Bernas</PERSON> a good
while ago. Their distinguished seniors, the <LOCATION>London Sinfonietta</LOCATION>, have enjoyed
more continuity of personnel; but the MP/L's track record must by now make
them the leading young challengers. In the <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth Hall</PERSON> on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, it seemed to me - I may be wrong - that there were many more
under-25s than the norm for the pricier Sinfonietta concerts.
Yet that was not because the MP/L programme was hot-off-the-stove stuff. On
the contrary, it treated us to ancient, scatty <PERSON>Charles Ives</PERSON>, and <PERSON>John Cage</PERSON>
in his least-known period (a <DATE>1947</DATE> ballet score for <PERSON>Merce Cunningham</PERSON>, The
Seasons), along with the more recent <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matthews</PERSON>. The ten minutes of
<PERSON>Reich</PERSON>'s fresh, extremely clever multi-flute exercise were entirely justified
by <PERSON>Nancy Ruffer</PERSON>'s solo playing. The Cage score finds him somewhere between
tranquil, mock-naive formalism and an active urge to scrap Western musical
paraphernalia altogether: fascinatingly dull, not just dull.
MP/L is distinguished above all for its cutting edge and its verve. In
<PERSON>Ives</PERSON>'s three 'Theatre Orchestra Sets' - the fullest versions that I've
heard, carefully traced back to the first drafts - everyone in the ensemble
leapt to their opportunities, with full prompting from <LOCATION>Bernas</LOCATION>. Almost every
piece in these ragbag collections has a different instrumentation, anything
from a woozy wind-band to sighing strings, and each strikes sparks off some
unheard-of idea. That cornucopia of random inspirations, whether radical or
just gleefully silly, was wonderfully bracing to hear. (Some FT readers
might like to know that <PERSON>Ives</PERSON> was all his life a professional insurance man,
apparently with great actuarial breakthroughs to his credit.)
<PERSON>Matthews</PERSON>' beady-eared diatribe, which features scathing parodies of <PERSON>John
Adams</PERSON> in particular and other trendy Americans wholesale, has its own
musical sense and weight too, as the ML/P team made clear. We were hearing
the new 'chamber' version of Hidden Variables, most obviously in its reduced
strings. Aptly tacky, I thought: the budget forces focused the
implausibility of what <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> gets away with on Hollywood-scale strings.
*****
In the <ORGANIZATION>Barbican Hall</ORGANIZATION> meanwhile, <PERSON>Itzhak Perlman</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Symphony
Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON>Andre Previn</PERSON> were purveying an older, milder brand of
American music: <PERSON>Samuel Barber</PERSON>'s Violin Concerto of <DATE>1940</DATE>. This expert piece
of musical craftsmanship, with its curvaceous
Richard-Strauss-goes-to-New-England first movement, gently moody middle and
dashing finale, is today more liable to elicit under-praise than encourage
over-estimation.
It offers no challenge to the listener, no adventure, no threat of uncharted
emotional experience; but within their self-ordained limits its musicianly
qualities remain effortlessly graceful and delightfully fresh. Perhaps a
grander style of musical address, a riper rhetorical character was intended
by <PERSON>Barber</PERSON> than <PERSON>Perlman</PERSON> essayed in the solo-writing, or than <PERSON>Previn</PERSON> charged
from the orchestral accompaniment; but for shining sweetness and purity of
style this violinist has no equals today.
This was altogether a fine, civilised performance, and after the interval
<PERSON>Previn</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>LSO</ORGANIZATION> matched it with an <ORGANIZATION>Elgar Second Symphony</ORGANIZATION> of easy flow and
sustainment of symphonic argument. Again, certain Elgarians in the audience
might have found their cravings for passionate engagement with the score's
melodic shapes unsatisfied (from <ORGANIZATION>Elgar</ORGANIZATION>'s own recording of the work with the
<ORGANIZATION>LSO</ORGANIZATION> we know how high a value he set on full-bodied portamento
string-phrasing). But in its truthful, uninflated authority, <PERSON>Previn</PERSON>'s
command of the symphony is now solidly impressive from first note to last.

THE GROWING DEBATE OVER MINIMALISM; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR COMPOSERS' VIEWS ON MINIMAL MUSIC -- WHERE IT'S BEEN, WHERE IT'S GOING AND 
WHAT'S THE BROUHAHA?

<P>
Ever since minimalism appeared on the music scene 25 years ago, academic 
composers have decried the trashing of their complex music language and the 
acceptance, in its place, of a highly simplified -- some say simplistic -- one. 
Their charge: a sellout to commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
The minimalists say the scholars adhere to an "old-boy network" whose in-bred, 
practically impenetrable scores alienate everyone except each other.

With growing alarm and resentment, the old guard watched while these upstarts 
basked in the spotlight and took the prizes: audiences, publicity, career 
opportunities. They festered. They stewed. For every article on standard-bearer 
<PERSON>George Perle</PERSON>, for instance, there are 500 profiles of the ever-popular <ORGANIZATION>Philip 
Glass</ORGANIZATION>. For every <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> commission given <PERSON>Charles Wuorinen</PERSON>, a <MONEY>$1-million</MONEY> one 
turns up for <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
A whole generation has grown up listening to mimimalism's repetitive, 
bare-bones thumping -- in the movies ("The Thin Blue Line"), in dance and opera 
("In the Upper Room" and "Nixon in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>"), even in the sanctified museum of 
the concert hall ("Harmonium"). 
</P>
<P>
Critics and commentators have debated the issues but composers tend to be 
closed-mouthed about their peers. Not so <PERSON>Perle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON>, Pulitzer Prize 
winners, recipients of <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Fellowships</ORGANIZATION> and articulate debunkers of 
minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, minimalist <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> and neo-romantic <PERSON>David del Tredici</PERSON> were 
given opportunities to defend their striking successes. That said, here they 
are in full cry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Charles Wuorinen</PERSON>: Thanks to Short-Sighted Critics, the 'Quick Fix' Winds Up as 
Most Popular 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Charles Wuorinen</PERSON> treads the same path of rigorously difficult composition as an 
<PERSON>Elliott Carter</PERSON> or <PERSON>Pierre Boulez</PERSON> and talks about his "passion" for music as High 
Art. At 51, he is a fierce polemicist, waging verbal wars against what he sees 
as the rising tide of Philistinism. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the status quo, he does not equivocate in laying blame; his finger 
points first to music journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the fault of the critical press," he says, "that people lose sight of the 
difference between the real nature of a thing and how it is promoted." Citing 
an example, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> quotes <PERSON>Harold Schonberg</PERSON>, former music critic of the <ORGANIZATION>New 
York Times</ORGANIZATION>, who remarked 10 years ago: "I am going to protect the public from 
new music." 
</P>
<P>
"That statement outraged me," <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> says, explaining how such a prejudice 
fuels public intolerance "to anything but the familiar. Critics are not 
supposed to be indistinguishable from audiences. They're supposed to know more, 
to stretch the limits of listeners' experience. Instead they try to gauge only 
the immediate appeal of a piece," he charges. 
</P>
<P>
What the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> composer is complaining about is the same thing political 
pundits decried in the last presidential campaign: that after televised debates 
between the candidates, TV anchors waited to see the polls before declaring 
winners or losers, thereby relinquishing their own critical evaluation. Yet it 
would seem that arts critics bow less to popular opinion than television's news 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pandering to the least worthy effort just because of its easy appeal serves 
neither the public nor the cause of music," <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Familiarity breeds love, but if audiences never get a chance to become 
familiar with something new, it cannot have an impact. Look at <PERSON>Brahms</PERSON> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Tchaikovsky</ORGANIZATION>, for instance. It's only because some critics defended their music 
that it is now a concert hall staple." 
</P>
<P>
So have orchestra managements been less than valiant, according to the academic 
proselytizer. He mentions a <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION> study, designed to explain 
subscriber dropouts. One woman who let her subscription expire protested being 
duped, he recalls: 
</P>
<P>
"She saw a brochure flagging <PERSON>Isaac Stern</PERSON> and Tchaikovsky and she came expecting 
him to play that composer. As it turned out he performed a new concerto, its 
name buried in fine print, and the orchestra played a Tchaikovsky symphony. Why 
set up that kind of disappointment? Why treat patrons as though they were 
merely customers you're trying to sell toothpaste to? Why not be forthright and 
honorable?" 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> doffs his hat to <PERSON>Ernest Fleischmann</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles Philharmonic</LOCATION> for championing <PERSON>Boulez</PERSON>, the stellar composer/conductor, 
himself a stern tribune of all that's cerebral in music: 
</P>
<P>
"Is he charismatic? No. Is his music anything but complex? No. There is nothing 
half-hearted or apologetic in the way the <LOCATION>Philharmonic</LOCATION> presents him. And the 
public responds to the endorsement, the year-in, year-out commitment to what 
<PERSON>Boulez</PERSON> offers." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from such a rarely seen attitude, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> says, "people have stopped 
trying to be civilized. At one time there was a striving for prestige. 
Compositions had stature because they invoked higher values. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, hardly anyone takes such a stand. What we have is the quick fix, the need 
for instant self-gratification. And that accounts for this utterly 
unchallenging, unprovocative kind of music. In fact, it accounts for the 
general ills of our society -- all the way up to our government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"These days it's a question of how many clap the longest and loudest. Nothing 
is being asked of the creator or the recipient." 
</P>
<P>
Lest his comments be seen as sour grapes, the composer points out that he "has 
as much work, and more, as I can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> practices the fire and brimstone that he preaches. In order 
to uphold his lofty standards, he founded a chamber orchestra, the <ORGANIZATION>Group for 
Contemporary Music</ORGANIZATION>. Without absolutely compelling performances, he argues, 
there can be no persuasion of a difficult work's excellence. Too often, he 
believes, unconvincing accounts of new music give it a bad name. And too often 
symphony orchestra musicians show the same skepticism as audiences. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, players do not embrace the typically simplistic examples of 
minimalism. For example, when the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Philharmonic</LOCATION> played an excerpt of 
<ORGANIZATION>Philip Glass</ORGANIZATION>' "the CIVIL warS" <DATE>several years ago</DATE>, the musicians deliberately 
turned pages noisily to express their contempt of its incessant arpeggio 
repetitions and limited harmonic interest. 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen, apparently unmollified by this response, fears that "the distinction 
between art and entertainment no longer exists. . . . We've succeeded in 
cheapening art and ruining entertainment. By making popularity the touchstone, 
we rationalize that we're being democratic and realistic." 
</P>
<P>
His favorite anecdote on the subject of music's lowered standards involves a 
composing student who naively told a professor that he wanted to be famous and 
loved and popular. 
</P>
<P>
"How popular?" asked the professor. "As popular as <PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON>? But Stravinsky 
is more popular than <PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON>. As popular as Stravinsky?But <PERSON>Beethoven</PERSON> is more 
popular than <ORGANIZATION>Stravinsky</ORGANIZATION>. As popular as <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>?But Tchaikovsky is more 
popular than <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION>. As popular as <ORGANIZATION>Tchaikovsky</ORGANIZATION>?But <PERSON>Lawrence Welk</PERSON> is more 
popular than Tchaikovsky." 
</P>
<P>
So much for goals and definitions of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Our refusal to be serious," <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> says, "can be seen in this surge of 
anti-intellectualism and yahooism. It's been going on for 25 years. If things 
don't change -- and I don't think they will -- serious music will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>: Dividing Art Between 'Serious' and Unworthy Is Far Too Simplistic 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, a Grammy laureate of different flora altogether, stays happily out 
of academic gardens. Right now, he's fielding phone calls from maverick 
director <PERSON>Peter Sellars</PERSON>, among others, in his hotel room, having just finished 
rehearsing the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul Chamber Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> for a concert of 20th-Century music. 
</P>
<P>
He says this is a convenient time to talk, "if you don't mind interruptions. I 
have about 15 minutes before rushing out to a dinner engagement." 
</P>
<P>
Adams has barely said this before another call comes in -- this one from <PERSON>Lisa 
Klinghoffer</PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON>Leon Klinghoffer</PERSON>, the wheelchair-bound American 
murdered aboard the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro by an Arab terrorist in 
<DATE>1985</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
What the 42-year-old composer of "Nixon in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>" and "Harmonium" is doing is 
another opera based on current affairs -- this one recounting the above 
incident. It too will enlist <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> as collaborator. Commissioned by six opera 
companies, the work will have its world premiere in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Adams has already pondered the debate over minimalism. Creators in a given 
field always seem to know who their detractors are and what they're saying. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I couldn't be happier to answer <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> and his criticisms," says 
<PERSON>Adams</PERSON>. "It's something I've never had the chance to do before. Frankly, (pause) 
I think he's a square. 
</P>
<P>
"To make arbitrary divisions between what is serious and what is outside the 
worthwhile realm is just too simplistic. Has he ever considered that 
<PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> and Goethe drew on the vernacular? That they were hardly averse to 
referring to their own contemporary culture? This is what <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> does so 
brilliantly. It's essential to utilize the environment we are part of, rather 
than cut ourselves off from it." 
</P>
<P>
The argument that art and entertainment run along clear-cut and separate paths 
is one that <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> doesn't buy. While he concedes that <PERSON>Lawrence Welk</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Liberace</PERSON> are "strictly entertainers," too many others defy such easy 
categorization. 
</P>
<P>
He hastens to add that his own music was intended to have entertainment value 
-- "so did <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ravel</ORGANIZATION> acknowledge it, as well as all the great composers 
did, until these self-appointed guardians of theory came into existence." But 
he finds "the dour, grim attitude behind art for art's sake to be phony." 
</P>
<P>
As for minimalism, per se, he does not object categorically to the term. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there's any more antipathy to it than to catch-all labels in 
the past. Picasso probably didn't like being called a Cubist, simply because it 
unfairly limited his identity. 
</P>
<P>
"But the word minimalism is eminently mockable. How many times do we hear the 
standard snipe: 'Minimal music for minimal minds?' " 
</P>
<P>
What <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> is eager to talk about is the genesis of the much-debased form. He 
explains it as a pendulum swing away from the forbidding 12-tone music of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Second Viennese School</ORGANIZATION> -- a revolt against <PERSON>Schoenberg</PERSON> and his disciples, who 
dominated compositional thought from the <DATE>1920s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
He sees music composition as having gone through cycles of complexity -- 
"inbreeding to extinction" -- followed by radical reappraisals of language. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>," says the defender of populism. "His music was immensely 
simple compared to the Baroque style, which immediately preceded it, almost a 
contradiction to the kind of involved counterpoint <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> put forth. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still say that our critics, <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON> and his elite brotherhood, are 
torchbearers of High Art out of defensiveness. What's getting these guys so 
apoplectically mad is how loved our music is. Whether it, or any other music, 
has value though, no one can be sure of. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be an academic music, a theory music. We (minimalists) exist 
outside of it. Our important feedback comes from the people -- the ones who 
write letters expressing how profoundly affected they are by a piece. As for 
the future, we must hope that the swing does not go too far, that the love 
affair with popular culture does not become an end in itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>George Perle</PERSON>: Minimalism's Numbers 'Mean Nothing to Me . . . I'm Not Counting' 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>George Perle</PERSON>, now at <ORGANIZATION>UC Berkeley</ORGANIZATION> to deliver the prestigious <PERSON>Ernest Bloch</PERSON> 
lectures, takes a morning phone call. The nocturnal composer did not spend most 
of the night working as he often does. So he has the patience to explain that 
his music is accessible without being simplistic, that he is not guilty as 
charged of being an eat-your-peas academic. 
</P>
<P>
An invitation to jump into the fray is less than compelling, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I have little concern with telling people what to listen to and why. Do they 
like it?" asks the 74-year-old detester of minimalism. "Then let them go ahead. 
I won't sit in judgment." Perle takes the opposite stand of <PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON>. Society 
will find its way, he believes. He need not be a standard-bearer for anyone but 
himself. Indeed, it is only with much cajoling that he addresses the 
minimalists and others who, he says, "have nothing new to say." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Glass, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"What he writes is childish babble. It uses the most superficial aspect of an 
old musical language. People do not come out of the hall humming it because 
it's applied to visual events and doesn't stand alone. It's music for people 
who hate music and can only be looked at historically, as a reaction to the 
misunderstood 12-tone system, which created problems both for audiences and 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
"But surely those old harmonic relationships (<PERSON>Brahms</PERSON> and Beethoven) can find 
better means of preservation than the bare-bones formulas devised by the 
minimalists." 
</P>
<P>
Perle -- who, in his early research into the first 12-tone music, found his 
compositional niche -- has brought that 20th-Century language to a comfortably 
integrated place, one placing him in what he calls the mainstream. Whether that 
mainstream has 1,000 or 1,000,000 listeners swimming in it, though, is 
immaterial. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach is not concerned with popularity," he says, conceding minimalism's 
fascination for the masses. Numbers mean nothing to me. I'm not counting." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to describe his pleasure over the world premiere of his "Windows of 
Order," presented by the <ORGANIZATION>Juilliard String Quartet</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s 
Library of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a <ORGANIZATION>Beethoven</ORGANIZATION> crowd that filled the hall, people with a sincere and 
developed love for music. But if someone told me I could exchange this for a 
stadium mob of 10,000, I wouldn't make the trade off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an elitist, though," says the esteemed author of contemporary music 
theory. "I come from a working-class background. My favorite novelist is <PERSON>Henry 
James</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
But, "I'm also inclined to go to a movie or turn on TV. I don't have to be 
serious about everything." 
</P>
<P>
The scholarly composer points to the enormous growth of music today -- 
including the recording industry, expanded numbers of live concerts, etc. -- 
that comes as a result of greater leisure time. Yet he sees an erosion of 
standards. And worse, "certain colleagues manipulating the public." 
</P>
<P>
"There are those in the business of feeding that public, who don't care about 
it or music -- only their own success. They appeal to trend-seekers and set 
themselves up as arbiters of trendiness. Who is truly on the side of the 
public? I think I am. Not because I'm a nice guy or want to be popular but 
because my music has integrated the 12-tone language into something accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between the complex and the complicated. Mozart was 
complex and so is our spoken language, with its elaborate grammar. But some 
serial music is only complicated. By that I mean artificial, not relevant. 
People think I'm more humane than <PERSON>Boulez</PERSON>, for example, which is hardly the 
point. My music is simply more coherent than his. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the only thing I dislike, although some of its practitioners 
-- like <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> -- are more palatable than others. Quoting hundreds of bars of 
<LOCATION>Mozart</LOCATION> -- <PERSON>George Rochberg</PERSON> does this -- hardly counts as new music. And 
borrowing a dead language, the way (<PERSON>David</PERSON>) Del Tredici does, is no better. I 
don't want to get personal, but these composers gain no more of my sympathy 
than the Glasses of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"As for minimalism, I think it will grind itself out of existence. But 
something just as bad will take its place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David del Tredici: Good Minimalist Music Will Bring Audiences Back 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David del Tredici</PERSON>, at 52, remembers having <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> as a student in his music 
theory class at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>. He's also good friends with minimalist <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>. 
But even this mild-mannered middleman among composers has a satiric epithet for 
Philip Glass: "He's Rossini without melody. I think his music is awful." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION>Del Tredici</ORGANIZATION> has considerable empathy for the minimal movement -- 
for he too belongs to a generation that defected from the hard-core atonality 
that was fashionable until the mid-<DATE>'60s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember being thrilled by very dissonant music," he says. "Everything I 
wrote at first was in the voguish Schoenbergian mold. So my first attempt at 
tonal music was terrifying. But when I heard the wild roar of approval from the 
audience -- a far different thing from the respectful neutrality that typically 
greeted new works -- I knew it was a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
He's referring to his "Final Alice," an enormously popular piece jointly 
commissioned by the Big Six orchestras -- <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> -- for the <DATE>1976</DATE> Bicentennial celebrations. It 
earned him a Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
It also earned him an adjective that he is not fond of: accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a synonym for cheap," he says. "The word has a bad connotation. We all 
grew up with the attitude that immortality comes to those who write 'ahead of 
their time.' To be accessible is to lack the wherewithal for immortality. We 
consoled ourselves that no one in <LOCATION>Beethoven</LOCATION>'s day could understand his late 
works. Therefore our music should be inaccessible. Hogwash!Everyone knew back 
then that even his difficult pieces were extraordinary. We've overdone the idea 
of 'ahead of his time.' 
</P>
<P>
"And now the reaction to it -- minimalism -- is also excessive." 
</P>
<P>
But if <ORGANIZATION>Del Tredici</ORGANIZATION> trembles at the thought of being called accessible, why does 
a somewhat forbidding <PERSON>George Perle</PERSON> crave such a label? 
</P>
<P>
"One man's accessible is another man's forbidding," says the easygoing 
neo-Romantic, who is accustomed to his current outside-the-academy rank as 
composer in residence at the <LOCATION>N.Y. Philharmonic</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a bad boy today, that is, an anti-scholar, you take up 
minimalism or what I embrace, neotonality. Neither of these has any place in 
the academic hierarchy. That, in itself, attests to their vitality! 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve-tone music has lost its thrill. It's a waning reality, an historical 
fact that doesn't mean anything now. Neither a <PERSON>Boulez</PERSON> nor a <PERSON>Stockhausen</PERSON> has any 
relevance today. But it still takes courage to walk away. Less courage for 
minimalists who are regarded as 'new.' The fact that they're boring is only a 
secondary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Adams is trying to extend the horizons of minimalism. <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>, acting like 
a spider under a rock, wants to hold onto its static subtleties. However, no 
honest person could deny the powerful influence of minimalism. It begets 
audiences and, in that, gives contemporary music a good name. Where 12-tone 
dissonance sent people fleeing, the best forms of minimalism are bringing them 
back."

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1973</DATE>, when <PERSON>Michael Tilson Thomas</PERSON> conducted "Four Organs" by <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON> on a <ORGANIZATION>Boston Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> program at <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Hall</ORGANIZATION>, rival factions in the audience bellowed boos and bravos. 
As the 20-minute minimalist work unfolded, with its single, six-note chord repeated obsessively in myriad rhythmic variations, a man in the balcony stood up and cried, "Stop, stop, I'll confess!" 

   "After it was over," recalls the composer, now 51, "<PERSON>Michael</PERSON> said, 'This is great; this is history.' 
And I said, 'Are you sure?'" 

   Today, all-Reich concerts sell out major halls, <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON>'s recordings make the top 10 on the Billboard classical charts, and a series of increasingly large-scale works have brought him far from his early minimalist roots. 
Yet his works remain as controversial as ever. 

   Detractors call them "stuck needle" music because of the repetitive rhythmic and melodic patterns. 
Barbs like that are one reason why <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON> attended the <LOCATION>New York Philharmonic</LOCATION> rehearsals last month of his latest work, "The Four Sections," in "heavy body armor." 
As it turned out, he found "the vibes from the Philharmonic musicians better than they were when the piece was premiered by the <LOCATION>San Francisco Symphony</LOCATION>" <DATE>last fall</DATE>. 
Moreover, <PERSON>Zubin Mehta</PERSON>, whose conducting usually vacillates between the perfunctory and the vulgar, carefully shaped and sustained the swirling canons for strings in the opening movement. 
Images of slow-motion square dances came to mind. 

   Overall, "The Four Sections" is a more restrained work than, say, the rollicking "Sextet" (<DATE>1985</DATE>), a personal favorite available on <ORGANIZATION>Nonesuch</ORGANIZATION>. 
But other performers have brought more bounce to the pulsating rhythms in its faster movements. 

   Indeed, having his works performed by leading orchestras has been a major change for this aging young Turk. 
In <DATE>1966</DATE>, he founded <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON> and Musicians, and this cadre of expert players was the primary vehicle for performances of his music prior to <DATE>1982</DATE>. (The group will perform an all-Reich program at the <ORGANIZATION>Walker Art Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 13</DATE>.) 
On stage, in their mandatory white shirts, they convey an ardent understanding of <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON>'s idiom: richly textured tonal harmonies, colorful percussion and infectious rhythms influenced by African drumming and jazz. 

   They're also accustomed to his "Type A" personality. 
A direct, voluble man who doesn't mince words if, say, the sound equipment isn't up to par on tour, he has tried to maintain similar control over performances of his orchestral works by other entities. 
<PERSON>Mr. Thomas</PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION>Brooklyn Philharmonic</LOCATION> in the American premiere of "The Desert Music" (<DATE>1984</DATE>) and the world premiere of "The Four Sections," notes: "<PERSON>Steve</PERSON> gets involved in everything from the stage setup to the kind of extension cords used to plug in the vibraphones. 
He's very fierce about wanting every detail right." 

   That doesn't always happen in orchestral situations with limited rehearsal time. 
"With my ensemble," says the composer, "we typically spend 36 to 42 hours spread over a few months learning a new piece." 
At the <ORGANIZATION>New York Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION>, by contrast, <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON> got nearly six of the nine hours of available rehearsal time devoted to his piece -- a generous proportion but considerably less than ideal. 
"It took me the better part of a year to write this piece," he says. 
"So, yes, it's being done and that's wonderful, but where do you as a composer fit into the scheme of things? 
Basically, you're just squeezing under the door." 

   Partly for these reasons, and partly because "I just don't have any more of that in me," <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON> calls "The Four Sections" his farewell to the orchestra for the near future. 
Unlike his so-called minimalist colleagues, <PERSON>Philip Glass</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>, he has no plans to write an opera, either. 

   "I hate opera," he declares, running a hand through his short, dark brown hair. 
"The conventions -- aria recitatives, the whole vocal style -- are from another time. 
To change the musical language or the subject matter doesn't set it up for me as a music drama. 
You get composers today who are trying to create something contemporary and immediate, yet once the singers open their mouths you're back into 17th-, 18th-, 19th-century <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. 
It grinds my gears and it hurts my ears." 

   Instead, he is tackling a piece for string quartet and tape for the <ORGANIZATION>Kronos Quartet</ORGANIZATION>, and mulling over ideas for a mixed media piece involving his ensemble as well as recorded voices from the World War II period. 
"It's gonna be a whole new page," he says. 
"It will go back to 'Come Out' and 'It's Gonna Rain.'" 
These two seminal works from the mid-1960s use recorded speech on tape loops that gradually go out of phase with each other. 

   In those days, <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON> -- a native New Yorker who studied piano and drums as a child -- was struggling to make the <MONEY>$65-a-month</MONEY> payments on a loft in what is now trendy <LOCATION>Tribeca</LOCATION>. 
He performed his music for a small coterie of fans from the SoHo art community but didn't consider a compositional career until he enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell</ORGANIZATION> as a philosophy major. 
After studies at the <ORGANIZATION>Juilliard School</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mills College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, he lived in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where he supported himself by driving a cab and working as a postal clerk. 

   When he returned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and founded his ensemble, his Juilliard buddy <PERSON>Philip Glass</PERSON> came back from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 
For a time, the two shared compositional discoveries and performers. 
To help make ends meet, they even established the <ORGANIZATION>Chelsea Light Moving Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which transported lighting fixtures for Bowery wholesalers. 
As interest in their early minimalist works extended beyond the downtown music scene, however, tensions developed and they became bitter rivals. 
"I've just decided that the less said in print about this the better," says <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON>. 

   Today, he and his wife, artist <PERSON>Beryl Korot</PERSON>, share quarters in a comfortable lower <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> loft with their son, <PERSON>Ezra</PERSON>, and two dogs. 
And the composer "walks a tightrope" between performing with his ensemble and writing his music. 
Over the years, he has proved the most intellectually engaging of the minimalists despite pressure from what <PERSON>Mr. Thomas</PERSON> describes as "the arbiters of musical fashion as to whether his works should be more 'uptown' or 'downtown.' 
What's important about <PERSON>Steve</PERSON>'s music is that it transcends both those boundaries." 

   It will be interesting to hear how <PERSON>Mr. Reich</PERSON>'s music, starting with the Kronos commission, evolves over the next few years. 
"By forcing myself to look at something old, something new, at the same time," he asserts, "I'm sort of dealing myself a wild card." 
From the composer of "Four Organs," we expect no less.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- In Concert:
   A Decade's Diversities

   New York -- To most of the art world, eagerly involved
with the latest trends, the '80s already are old news. But in
the back-to-the-future world of classical music, where
playing centuries-old music on period instruments is often
thought up-to-date, works from the '80s can still seem
glitteringly new. And, for most of us, they usually are. Only
a small fraction of important new work gets recorded, and
that often takes several years. (None of Philip Glass's
orchestra scores of the past decade have yet been recorded.)
Second performances of all but the most popular new pieces
are rare; most musicians prefer the glamour of a premiere.
Unlike in the visual arts, which support several monthly
magazines, there are now, with the recent demise of Musical
America, no commercial American magazines that report on what
is happening in music around the country.
   So Joel Sachs's choice to devote this year's "Focus]"
festival at the Juilliard School to a six-concert survey of
the "American '80s" might have provided an unusual overview
where modern music is going these days had that been his
intention. But, as Mr. Sachs noted in his program
introduction, beyond a noticeable conservative trend in music
that paralleled the political climate of the times, American
music remained as diverse as ever. Partly because
dissemination is so slow, there are fewer stylistic shifts in
music than one finds in the visual arts, and they occur more
slowly. For instance, minimalism, which came and went during
the '60s in painting and sculpture, gradually evolved in
music throughout the '70s to become a mainstream language of
the '80s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The festival did manage to represent most -- although I
counted about three dozen Americans who wrote pieces between
<DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE> that I liked but weren't included -- of the
different kinds of music typical of the past decade, and it
lived up to its diverse billing. It began in gloomy fashion
with the academic expressionism of <PERSON>Leon Kirchner</PERSON>'s "For Solo
Cello," and ended outrageously, one week and 36 works later,
with <PERSON>Paul Schoenfield</PERSON>'s "Four Parables" for piano and
orchestra, a Gershwin-esque kitsch extravaganza that received
an overexcited standing ovation.
   With no common language, some composers work primarily
with instrumental color (<PERSON>Margaret Brouwer</PERSON>'s impressionistic
orchestra piece, "Third From the Sun"). Minimalism's rhythmic
repetition remains so strongly in vogue that <PERSON>Steve Reich</PERSON>'s
Sextet sounded almost like a classic in this context. There
arose in the late '80s a young postminimalist generation full
of quirky life, and two of its members, <PERSON>Stephen Dougherty</PERSON> and
<PERSON>David Lang</PERSON>, were represented with alluring works. Number
crunchers like <PERSON>Milton Babbitt</PERSON> are still at it (his brief
"Homily" for snare drum solo is a dazzling exercise in
rhythmic obscurity), and so are the academic electronic boys,
such as <PERSON>Mario Davidovsky</PERSON>, who favor the '50s school of bleeps
and burps (his "Synchronisms No. 9" for violin and tape was
eloquent despite its antiquated electronic sounds).
   Bright Sheng, born in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, colors Chinese folk music
with Western techniques. Chinary Ung, a composer from
<LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>, illuminates Western muic with an Asian spirit. <PERSON>Lou
Harrison</PERSON>, a Northern Californian, can make clay bowls sound
like a gamelan. <PERSON>Tania Leon</PERSON>, Cuban born, spices her works with
Latin rhythms. <ORGANIZATION>David Diamond</ORGANIZATION> wrote the same kind of
neoclassical music in the '80s that he wrote in the '40s.
<PERSON>John Cage</PERSON>, whose seventh decade coincided with the <DATE>'80s</DATE>, has
never stopped experimenting. <PERSON>Anthony Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Muhal Richard
Abrams</PERSON>, composers out of a progessive jazz tradition, are no
strangers to improvisation. <PERSON>Morton Subotnick</PERSON> uses electronic
modifications of standard instruments in performance to
create new cybernetic perspectives.
   Refreshing as it might seem not to have a curatorial point
of view placed on it, such diversity can seem confusing. But
perhaps one of the lessons of "Focus]" and maybe a lesson of
the multicultural '80s as well, is that different traditions
are really different: They don't always mix well and
shouldn't be expected to. So rather than enhance one another,
these pieces often clashed. A gorgeous, richly sensuous piece
for string quartet, "Solstice," by a <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>
composer, <PERSON>Robert Erickson</PERSON>, was poor preparation for the
rigorous if equally expressive Third Quartet of <PERSON>Richard
Wilson</PERSON>, which followed. Both are terrific pieces, but their
sensibilities are incompatible.
   The Juilliard students who performed this music did not
help. Perhaps the major disappointment of the festival was
the level of performance, which was always proficient but
seldom charismatic or understanding. There were, however, two
important exceptions. The <ORGANIZATION>Inja Quartet</ORGANIZATION>, which played
"Solstice," is a rapturous ensemble. <PERSON>Cheryl Marshall</PERSON>, a
flamboyant soprano, completely misunderstood the whimsical
theatricality of <PERSON>Mr. Cage</PERSON>'s "Sonnekus 2" by acting the tart
in quotations of two <PERSON>Satie</PERSON> songs. But she had the strongest
stage presence of anyone in the festival, and she made up for
the Cage with a wonderfully athletic performance of <PERSON>Joan La
Barbara</PERSON>'s heavy-breathing "Time(d) Trials and Unscheduled
Events."
   Mostly though, performances tended to be dour and dutiful,
as if the <DATE>'80s</DATE> were a gray era. Important pieces like <PERSON>John
Adams</PERSON>'s grim but inspiring "Wound Dresser" or <PERSON>Jacob
Druckman</PERSON>'s characterful Third String Quartet came off as
dull. Witty ones, like <PERSON>Pia Gilbert</PERSON>'s "Food," didn't sparkle.
Although these performers were growing up during the '80s,
most of them played as if they had had nothing to do with
those times. And it's not a hopeful thought that maybe they
didn't.

<TEXT>
IN CASE some of you have not somehow already heard, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>'s The Death
of Klinghoffer is the new opera about the <DATE>1985</DATE> hi-jacking of <ORGANIZATION>Achille Lauro</ORGANIZATION>
by Palestinian terrorists. Its <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> premiere on <DATE>March 19</DATE> was reviewed
here by <PERSON>Max Loppert</PERSON>, and now it has begun its tour of the globe. It went on
to <LOCATION>Lyon</LOCATION> and in due course will visit <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>. An opera that might have been dedicated to, and at some points
conceived by, <PERSON>Vanessa Redgrave</PERSON>, it is the kind of serious and important
bilge that everyone should see once.
Everyone involved has their better passages. The composer <PERSON>Adams</PERSON>'s most
stirring writing is in his choruses and in some orchestration. The director
<PERSON>Peter Sellars</PERSON>'s use of huge live video-screens, showing a singer blown-up as
if on TV documentary (shades of <PERSON>Twyla Tharp</PERSON>'s Bad News) is striking. Some of
the librettist <PERSON>Alice Goodman</PERSON>'s efforts both at vernacular talk and at
lyrical reflection are more successful than others.
But none of this alters the central emptiness and theatrical ineptitude of
this show. Most of <ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>'s word-setting is drear; even when you can
sometimes make out words and sentences, you lose the drift of paragraphs.
The use of amplification and synthesiser makes us feel we are no longer at a
live performance. Though <PERSON>Goodman</PERSON>'s libretto may be influenced by the <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>
passions and certain opera, she is above such petty matters as laying out a
what-happens-next narrative or developing dramatic tension between
characters. And the hand-jive semaphores that <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON> gives his solo
singers, as in his Magic Flute, have neither dynamic sense nor theatrical
dimension.
In this context it is always a relief to see <PERSON>Mark Morris</PERSON>'s choreography,
which alone seems to enjoy such basic aspects of theatre as
characterisation, space, rhythmic variety, gestural force. &gt; He is the
greatest choreographer to be working in opera since <PERSON>Frederick Ashton</PERSON>, but
here he is shackled, and his talent obscured.  Morris's most obvious problem
is the monotony of much of <ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>'s music. But, at a deeper level, the whole
show - even though <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> has long been involved in the planning of it, with
his <ORGANIZATION>Monnaie Dance Group</ORGANIZATION> - is anti-Morris: by which I mean it is opposed to
what <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>'s best work exemplifies.
Time and again, <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>'s choreography has shown that his constant theme is
human diversity. In Dido and Aeneas he was both Dido and Sorceress and the
same dancers played, with brilliant differentiation but not a single change
of costume or make-up, courtiers and witches. The point - no-one could miss
it - is to show just how startlingly various each human being can be. 'I am
large, I contain multitudes' could be his motto.
Klinghoffer, by contrast, is about human uniformity; and makes glib swipes
at the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> in so doing. &gt; The Prologue is in three parts: chorus of exiled
Palestinians; American family discussing the news; chorus of exiled Jews.
See? Those exiles - they're all the same.
The un-American sentiments of Klinghoffer are, of course, the work of
American artists. The opera tell you nothing about the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> but
plenty about white middle-class liberal American guilt. &gt; It displays much
the same thinking as <PERSON>Sellars</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Los Angeles Festival</LOCATION> did last <DATE>summer</DATE>: 'The
American century is over, Eurocentric culture is dead, let's celebrate 'the
other.'' In context of the events of the last nine months in the <LOCATION>Middle
East</LOCATION>, it is all the easier to see <PERSON>Klinghoffer</PERSON> for what it is: hollow,
pretentious, effete and phoney.

<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to humorist <PERSON>Garrison Keillor</PERSON>, it has been a quiet musical year 
in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. In this <LOCATION>Lake Wobegon</LOCATION> by the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, not even the dread angel of 
fiscal crisis passed over the city's major musical organizations this year, 
visiting instead the theater companies. 
</P>
<P>
So it is fitting, then, that <DATE>1990</DATE>'s biggest story, after a decade of financial 
woes, is that the <LOCATION>San Diego Symphony</LOCATION> inaugurated the year by retiring its 
<MONEY>$4.3-million</MONEY> debt on <ORGANIZATION>Symphony Hall</ORGANIZATION>. The combination of a <MONEY>$2.5-million</MONEY> gift from 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> newspaper publisher <PERSON>Helen Copley</PERSON> and the forgiveness of the remaining 
<MONEY>$1.8-million</MONEY> debt by four local banks put the orchestra solidly in the black 
for the first time in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the <LOCATION>San Diego Opera</LOCATION>, ever-prudent general director <PERSON>Ian Campbell</PERSON> 
maintained a healthy surplus in the company bank accounts for the third year in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year in which both the symphony and the opera began to take 
20th-Century repertory seriously. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego Opera</LOCATION>'s most successful production of its <DATE>1990</DATE> season was <PERSON>Francis 
Poulenc</PERSON>'s "Les Dialogues des Carmelites" in <DATE>February</DATE>. The melodious <DATE>1956</DATE> opera 
hardly qualifies for avant-garde status, but this austere, starkly realistic 
music drama had never been attempted by the local company. Dramatically 
persuasive and unusually well-sung, the production demonstrated to the 
conservative local opera public that there is viable operatic life after 
<PERSON>Menotti</PERSON>'s cloying <ORGANIZATION>Puccini</ORGANIZATION> reprises. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the Poulenc production, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> announced he would include at 
least one challenging 20th-Century opera in each upcoming season. The offerings 
of the <DATE>1991</DATE> season feature both <PERSON>Benjamin Britten</PERSON>'s <DATE>1947</DATE> comic opera "Albert 
Herring" and American composer <PERSON>Carlisle Floyd</PERSON>'s new version of his <DATE>1962</DATE> grand 
opera "The Passion of <PERSON>Jonathan Wade</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
In a pair of concerts at <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mandeville Auditorium</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE> and 
<DATE>February</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego Symphony</LOCATION> featured major orchestral works by Pulitzer 
Prize-winning composers <PERSON>Charles Wuorinen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Reynolds</PERSON>. Although these 
recent compositions (none earlier than <DATE>1984</DATE>) were well-received, attendance was 
modest, and symphony management declined to continue this forward-looking 
series. Still, it was refreshing to hear the local orchestra play <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON>' 
<DATE>1989</DATE> Pulitzer Prize-winning composition "Whispers Out of Time" with authority. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Yoav Talmi</PERSON>, who became the orchestra's music director in <DATE>October</DATE>, has 
stated that he will integrate contemporary compositions into future symphony 
</P>
<P>
programming, his initial selections have been cautious, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Samuel Barber</PERSON> violin concerto he conducted on the second concert of the 
season, for example, is stylistically a far cry from either <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON> or 
<PERSON>Wuorinen</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary music has been the rallying cry of the <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> music department since 
its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Notable offerings this year included a weeklong festival in early <DATE>April</DATE> devoted 
to the music of <PERSON>Iannis Xenakis</PERSON>. If the iconoclastic Greek composer's verbal 
explanations of his complex music provided little insight, the cumulative 
effect of hearing a range of his works in succession ratified <PERSON>Xenakis</PERSON>' lofty 
position in the current compositional pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
SONOR, <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>'s resident contemporary new music ensemble, premiered <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON>' 
"Personae" in <DATE>March</DATE>. This eloquent, chamber-sized violin concerto written for 
and played by <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> violinist <PERSON>Janos Negyesy</PERSON> may be the vehicle by which 
<PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON>' name enters the American musical mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Chamber Music Society</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, despite its smug conservatism 
-- executive director <PERSON>Neale Perl</PERSON> recoils at the mere mention of contemporary 
music -- the well-heeled organization made several notable contributions to the 
local music scene this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the society's aegis, the <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul Chamber Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> brought <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' 
new work "The Wound Dresser" to the Civic Theatre in <DATE>February</DATE>. The haunting 
work set <PERSON>Walt Whitman</PERSON>'s searing Civil War poetry in a rich, if subdued, 
orchestral fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, when La Jolla SummerFest's artistic director, <PERSON>Heiichiro Ohyama</PERSON>, 
selected <PERSON>Andre Previn</PERSON> as the annual festival's first composer in residence, it 
raised more than a few eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, <PERSON>Previn</PERSON>'s pair of chamber compositions sounded pleasant and slightly 
innocuous. But, if <PERSON>Previn</PERSON> is to be the Trojan Horse for more substantial 
resident composers in the future -- as <LOCATION>Ohyama</LOCATION> has intimated -- it will be 
another step in the right direction for the sponsoring <ORGANIZATION>La Jolla Chamber Music 
Society</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the memorable performances in <DATE>1990</DATE>, German tenor <PERSON>Hans Peter Blochwitz</PERSON>' La 
Jolla recital in <DATE>October</DATE> stands out. Beyond the beauty of his lyric instrument, 
the sophisticated and emotionally complex traversal of <PERSON>Schumann</PERSON>'s 
"Dichterliebe" and <PERSON>Schubert</PERSON>'s "Die Schoene Muellerin" song cycles defined what 
a Liederabend should be. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>May</DATE>, pianist <PERSON>Emmanuel</PERSON> Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma collaborated in a stirring, 
profound program of <ORGANIZATION>Rachmaninoff</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Stravinsky</PERSON> and Prokofiev at Civic Theatre. 
Another cellist of the first rank, <PERSON>Janos Starker</PERSON>, brought virtuosity and great 
insight to lesser-known works by <PERSON>Martinu</PERSON> and Cassado at <ORGANIZATION>Sherwwood Hall</ORGANIZATION> in his 
<DATE>October</DATE> solo recital. 
</P>
<P>
In the final concert of <ORGANIZATION>SummerFest</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado String Quartet</ORGANIZATION> delivered a 
stunning, passionate interpretation of <PERSON>Alberto Ginastera</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Second String 
Quartet</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the notable conductors to grace local podiums, <PERSON>JoAnn Falletta</PERSON> should be 
at the top of any critical listener's list. <PERSON>Falletta</PERSON>, who is music director of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Long Beach Symphony</ORGANIZATION>, made her local debut in <DATE>January</DATE> with the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego 
Chamber Orchestra</ORGANIZATION>. The local ensemble has seldom sounded as nimble, responsive, 
and polished. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, German conductor <PERSON>Christof Perick</PERSON> rattled the rafters of 
<ORGANIZATION>Copley Symphony Hall</ORGANIZATION> with his noble, expansive approach to <ORGANIZATION>Bruckner's Fourth 
Symphony</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, American conductor <PERSON>Kenneth Kiesler</PERSON> brought a refreshing 
vision of <ORGANIZATION>Handel</ORGANIZATION>'s "Messiah" to <ORGANIZATION>Copley Symphony Hall</ORGANIZATION>. His approach peeled back 
pious tradition to get to the oratorio's Baroque roots, and the <LOCATION>San Diego 
Symphony</LOCATION> and Master Chorale responded with laudable precision and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the disappointments of the year, <PERSON>Paul Dresher</PERSON>'s contemporary opera "Power 
Failure" comes immediately to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Dresher's Berkeley-based ensemble brought the minimalist work to the Spreckels 
Theatre in <DATE>February</DATE> amid much fanfare, but the opus turned out to be 
dramatically simplistic and musically static in a deadly way. But <PERSON>Dresher</PERSON>'s 
low-budget group had no patent on dullness. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the <LOCATION>San Diego Opera</LOCATION> took 
<PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s inspired "Die Zauberfloete" and imaginative sets by <PERSON>Maurice Sendak</PERSON> and 
somehow managed to squeeze all of the magic out of the opera. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>October</DATE>, the rising Siberian baritone <PERSON>Dmitri Hvorostovsky</PERSON> made his 
long-awaited <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> recital debut in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>'s Sherwood Auditorium. His 
shallow interpretations and callous over singing of the all-Italian program 
made many listeners wonder how the judges awarded him first prize in the <DATE>1990</DATE> 
Singer of the World Competition held in <LOCATION>Cardiff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But no performance was as maddening as guest conductor <PERSON>Alexander Schneider</PERSON>'s 
all-out attack on <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> and Haydn at the <LOCATION>San Diego Symphony</LOCATION>'s first Classically 
Baroque concert in <DATE>November</DATE>. Anyone with such antipathy for Baroque music 
should be enjoined from even picking up a score by <PERSON>J. S. Bach</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Two passings during <DATE>1990</DATE> also deserve mention. <PERSON>Zoltan Rozsnyai</PERSON>, music director 
of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Symphony</ORGANIZATION> from 1967-71, died in <DATE>September</DATE> at age 62. In more 
recent seasons, he had been music director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> and 
member of the music faculty at <ORGANIZATION>United States International University</ORGANIZATION>, at which 
the <ORGANIZATION>International Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> was based. 
</P>
<P>
And the <LOCATION>Los Angeles Philharmonic</LOCATION>, after a laudable 69 years of playing concerts 
in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, decided to terminate its series after its <DATE>April 28</DATE> Civic Theatre 
concert. Although the local Philharmonic series had once been a coveted season 
ticket, in recent years the demand had waned significantly.

<TEXT>
The Spanish savings bank 'la Caixa', based in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, supports a
diversity of concerts, including an early music festival now in its 16th
year, and has just started a contemporary music festival. Looking at once to
international celebrity and local talent, this inaugural venture featured
the music of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s senior composer <PERSON>Elliott Carter</PERSON> (86 in <DATE>December</DATE>) and
of the notable Barcelona-born (in <DATE>1935</DATE>) and based composer, <PERSON>Josep Soler</PERSON>.
The first of the concerts I attended was given by the <LOCATION>London Sinfonietta</LOCATION> and
its new chief conductor <PERSON>Markus Stenz</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Fundacio la Caixa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Centre
Cultural</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s <DATE>1981</DATE> settings for tenor and ensemble of six sonnets by
<PERSON>Robert Lowell</PERSON>, In Sleep, in Thunder (a Sinfonietta commission), came across
in their marvellous intricacy with pungent force if not much tonal beauty, a
lack due not only to the acoustics but to something insistently plain-voiced
about the otherwise impressively deft singer <PERSON>Jon Garrison</PERSON> and to something
stubbornly unlyrical in <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s nonetheless intelligent vocal writing.
<PERSON>Josep Soler</PERSON> was represented by a short neo-classical concerto for
harpsichord and five instruments which he wrote in <DATE>1969</DATE> to complement the
famous work by Falla and which the <ORGANIZATION>Sinfonietta</ORGANIZATION> recorded back in <DATE>1976</DATE>. The
soloist, <PERSON>John Constable</PERSON>, conducting from the keyboard, secured a lively
account of this sweetly bristling 12-tone music, though one discovered from
next evening's concert that the taut idiom no longer reflects <PERSON>Soler</PERSON>'s
approach. His Dos poemes per a orquestra (1990-93), performed by the
Orquestra simfonica de <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> nacional de Catalunya under <PERSON>Josep Pons</PERSON>,
proved a somewhat neo-romantic affair, the first practically a concerto for
pastoral oboe and rustling curtain of divisi muted strings with unlikely
touches from synthesised organ; the second whipping things up a bit with a
wind machine. Soler's language seems to have become dangerously eclectic,
dicing with kitsch.
The two big movements of <PERSON>Elliott Carter</PERSON>'s <DATE>1965</DATE> piano concerto were complex
not in a playful but a geometrical way; a dense, often dark labyrinth. The
American <PERSON>Ursula Oppens</PERSON> was the staggeringly dauntless, highly experienced
soloist. Pons and the orchestra, with its concertino group gathered round
the piano, performed with truly admirable courage and conviction, though
never approaching an ideal balance of forces and seldom finding the ease and
confidence to animate their jaggedly expressive polyphonic lines rather than
just execute them.
Earlier in the week <PERSON>Oppens</PERSON> gave the Spanish premiere of a five-minute piano
piece, 90+, which <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> recently added to his ongoing series of luminous
little tributes to colleagues, in this case the nonagenarian Italian
composer <PERSON>Goffredo Petrassi</PERSON>. Pitched at a technical level which should not
exclude the gifted amateur, it is a perfect epitome of <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s dazzling
metrical style and is built on 90 repetitions of the same pulsation, and
then some more, as though to wish Petrassi a few years yet of active life.
One certainly wishes <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> the same: he has just completed an orchestral
piece for next year's Proms and is at work on a voice and piano song-cycle
for next year's <ORGANIZATION>Aldeburgh Festival</ORGANIZATION>.
***
Russian music of very diverse character was played in two concerts on
consecutive evenings at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Festival Hall</ORGANIZATION> by two orchestras, both
conducted by Russians. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Philharmonic</ORGANIZATION> under its principal
conductor <PERSON>Yuri Temirkanov</PERSON> gave a neatly contrasted, slightly daring
programme which began with <ORGANIZATION>Prokofiev's Suite</ORGANIZATION>, Op. 33a from his <DATE>1919</DATE> opera,
The Love for Three Oranges. These six, wonderfully crisp and witty movements
were executed with panache.
Rachmaninov's three <ORGANIZATION>Symphonic Dances Op</ORGANIZATION>. 45 of <DATE>1941</DATE> were brought off well
enough but seemed all the more jadedly conservative with the concert's
marvellous middle item, the Concerto for Piano and Strings (<DATE>1979</DATE>) by a
living Russian, <PERSON>Alfred Schnittke</PERSON>, still echoing in the mind. This often
harshly dissonant work, <PERSON>Schnittke</PERSON>'s third piano concerto, in this superbly
thoughtful, elegantly shaped, powerful account, with soloist <PERSON>Dmitri Alexeev</PERSON>,
came over as no more alienating than a darker piece by Sir <PERSON>Malcolm Arnold</PERSON>.
The music, like <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION>'s, touches on jazz and the <ORGANIZATION>RPO</ORGANIZATION>'s principal double
bass, <PERSON>Jack McCormack</PERSON>, plucked out his cabaret tones with style.
Though the concerto does, indeed, have its violent outbursts, they are only
some of the strangely assorted collection of musical objects - including a
quiet Moonlight Sonata-like triplet figure for piano, a near-pastiche of the
Russian Hymn from the <DATE>1812</DATE> overture, and a glissandoing string passage -
which <PERSON>Schnittke</PERSON>'s apparently zany but actually ironclad argument shows to be
all of a piece. Alexeev and <PERSON>Temirkanov</PERSON> held one enthralled by the music's
sheer dialectic.
On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>BBC Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> under its principal guest conductor
<PERSON>Alexander Lazarev</PERSON> gave the UK premiere of the single movement Symphony No 7
(<DATE>1986</DATE>) by the Armenian composer <PERSON>Alfred Terteryan</PERSON> (born <DATE>1929</DATE>). His music is
folk-influenced in a far from picturesque way. Here he writes an obbligato
part for the folk percussion instrument called the dap' (<PERSON>Timothy Darside</PERSON>),
which sounded not unlike the Indian tabla. This sound was often multiplied
10 or 11 times by the percussion department, or echoed by a tape recording.
A sort of musical prophecy of the Armenian earthquake of <DATE>1988</DATE>, the symphony
deals wholly in monolithic and austere ritual gestures, minimalist in
material whilst maximalist in rhetorical power. A far cry from <PERSON>Schnittke</PERSON>'s
irony, but a cry deserving of attention.

Following traditional Japanese etiquette, <LOCATION>San Diego Symphony</LOCATION> guest conductor 
<PERSON>Kazuyoshi Akiyama</PERSON> brought a special gift for his hosts. In <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>Symphony Hall</ORGANIZATION> concert he conducted the first local performance of <PERSON>Toru 
Takemitsu</PERSON>'s "Star-Isle." The mildly astringent Impressionism of his fellow 
countryman's evocative tone poem suited the orchestra's strengths admirably, 
calling forth burnished sonic implosions from the brasses and warm, muted tones 
from the strings. This brief musical essay by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s premiere composer was a 
welcome present indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama stimulated the players in most of the right ways, leading the orchestra 
in one of its more energetic, persuasive programs of the current season. The 
48-year-old maestro -- he is music director of the <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo Symphony</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION>'s Syracuse Symphony -- presided over a vibrant, yet thoroughly detailed 
performance of the <ORGANIZATION>Samuel Barber Piano Concerto</ORGANIZATION> and offered an urgent, 
extroverted interpretation of <ORGANIZATION>Debussy</ORGANIZATION>'s "La Mer." 
</P>
<P>
The success of <ORGANIZATION>Barber</ORGANIZATION>'s concerto was ensured by piano soloist <PERSON>John Browning</PERSON>, 
who premiered the work about 27 years ago under the composer's watchful eye. 
From his brilliant, authoritative octaves that opened the concerto, <PERSON>Browning</PERSON> 
sculpted a taut, muscular reading that left no doubt of his complete identity 
with the music. He was strong but not flashy, creating a wide spectrum of 
colors that made the piano sound almost orchestral. He was meticulous but not 
fussy, an equally apt description of <LOCATION>Akiyama</LOCATION>'s approach to the dense, colorful 
orchestral accompaniment. Seldom has the orchestra seemed so completely engaged 
in its half of a concerto performance. 
</P>
<P>
Barber had both the good sense and the misfortune never to have been 
sufficiently avant-garde for the musical trendsetters of his day. But now that 
his music is again in vogue, and we hear it with more perspective, it is 
instructive to compare <PERSON>Barber</PERSON> with the current crop of born-again 
neo-Romantics. How many of them display even half of <LOCATION>Barber</LOCATION>'s compositional 
craft or can shape a theme as haunting as his Piano Concerto's lavishly lyrical 
slow movement? 
</P>
<P>
If Akiyama made every moment of "La Mer" exciting and urgent, it must be noted 
that <ORGANIZATION>Debussy</ORGANIZATION>'s sea is usually less turbulent under the baton of most 
conductors. It would be instructive to hear Akiyama conduct Bartok or early 
Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Rossini's tediously sectional overture to "Semiramide" opened the concert, 
although Akiyama paced it judiciously. It seemed little more than a formality, 
curiously unrelated to the rest of the program. Tonight at 8 in <ORGANIZATION>Symphony Hall</ORGANIZATION> 
this concert will be repeated; on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> it will be played in <ORGANIZATION>Bowers 
Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Potter Junior High School</ORGANIZATION>.

   Academy Award-winning director <PERSON>Jean-Jacques
Annaud</PERSON> knew what he wanted when he set out to find the lead
character for his acclaimed new movie, ``The Bear.''
   ``I was looking for a <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> kind of character,'' <PERSON>Annaud</PERSON>
said. His star is <PERSON>Bart</PERSON>, a 9-foot-2-inch Kodiak bear.
   ``I knew immediately <PERSON>Bart</PERSON> was the bear I was looking for because
he was very reliable, very impressive,'' <PERSON>Annaud</PERSON> said in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times.
   Annaud, who won an Oscar in <DATE>1976</DATE> for ``Black and White in
Color'' and also directed ``Quest for Fire'' and ``The Name of the
Rose,'' based the new movie on a <DATE>1916</DATE> book, ``The Grizzly King,''
by <PERSON>James Oliver Curwood</PERSON>.
   He wanted to make ``a film that would be honest to animal
nature, that would be an adventure film, or thriller, in which an
animal would be the hero.''
   ``I read this novel through the eyes of the hunted, through the
eyes of the victim,'' <PERSON>Annaud</PERSON> said, who found Bart through <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>
animal trainer <PERSON>Doug Seus</PERSON>. ``I saw it was the perfect structure for
having an exciting animal story with all the good ingredients for
movie entertainment, as well as describing what is common to human
psychology and animal psychology.''
