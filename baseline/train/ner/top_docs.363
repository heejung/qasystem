<HEAD>Soldiers, Peasants Clash in Northwest Haiti</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Soldiers and peasants clashed in
the hamlet of Danti in <LOCATION>northwest Haiti</LOCATION> with a rural law officer
reported killed and many peasants wounded, radio stations in the
capital said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The report coincided with a plea by Foreign Minister <PERSON>Gerard
LaTortue</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for international aid for this impoverished
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation. He told a news conference at <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Department of State</ORGANIZATION>, ``No democratic process can sustain itself if
it is not accompanied by economic development.''
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> suspended most of its aid to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> following
election violence last <DATE>November</DATE>.
   Section chief <PERSON>Leroy Ely</PERSON> was killed in <LOCATION>Danti</LOCATION> <DATE>last Thursday</DATE>,
touching off the clashes which reportedly continued until <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Section chiefs in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> are rural police officers with military
rank, responsible for supervising public works as well as
maintaining law and order. Under the 29-year <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family
dictatorship, section chiefs exercised wide powers.
   Ely traveled to Danti to impose the authority of the capital
city of the section, <LOCATION>Le Borgne</LOCATION>. Peasants demanded their hamlet be
assigned to neighboring <PERSON>Gros Morne</PERSON> district and in subsequent
rioting, <PERSON>Ely</PERSON> was killed.
   Soldiers came to quell the unrest. Radio Lumiere, <ORGANIZATION>Radio
Metropole and Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported that from <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, Danti residents were beaten and arrested or forced to flee.
Their homes were pillaged and burned.
   Witnesses interviewed by <ORGANIZATION>Radio Metropole</ORGANIZATION> said many people were
wounded or forced to take flight. Radio <PERSON>Haiti Inter</PERSON> said 25
peasants were arrested.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>Radio Metropole, Danti</ORGANIZATION> is in a relatively fertile
zone and Le Borgne authorities did not want to lose it.
   Disputes over land have become common and violent in this arid,
mountainous and overpopulated nation that shares the island of
Hispaniola with the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   Last <DATE>July</DATE>, hundreds of peasants clashed with landowners and
among themselves over property in the northwest village of <PERSON>Jean
Rabel</PERSON>. Dozens were killed.
   In asking for foreign help, <PERSON>LaTortue</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>, that ``For us Haitians, economic development means ... food
and water for the great majority of the population, and health
services, education and housing.''
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s biggest foreign aid donor,
contributing <MONEY>$103 million</MONEY> a year to the poorest nation in the
<LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>, with a population of 5.3 million.
   Most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid was suspended following cancellation of <DATE>last
November</DATE>'s national elections because of violence, which the
then-ruling junta under Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> did little to curtail.
   <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> maintained their aid commitments to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, but
the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> have withheld
<MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> in loans.
   LaTortue, who spent 10 years in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> as part of his
25-year exile during the Duvalier dictatorships, criticized <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials for blocking aid to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> following controversial
national elections last <DATE>January</DATE>.
   He asked <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commonwealth, to make available
scholarships for Haitian students and do what it could to promote
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s economic development.
   Dictator <PERSON>Francois Duvalier</PERSON> ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> since <DATE>1957</DATE>. His son,
<PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON>, took over at his death but fled <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE> during a
popular uprising. A president, <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, was chosen in
<DATE>January</DATE>.

THE <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> has not ruled out military intervention in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> to protect American
lives and restore democracy there, President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s ambassador to
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>yesterday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
Ms <PERSON>Madeleine Albright</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> was monitoring the situation closely

'The protection of American lives is foremost in our minds,' she said. 'We
don't rule anything in or anything out. This is a very tense situation, but
one in which we have to maintain calmness about our response.'
Reports from <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> said hundreds of foreigners fled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> yesterday
after a night of heavy gunfire in some of the capital's neighbourhoods.
The country's international airport was jammed with American and Canadian
citizens who were urged to leave <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> or take security precautions ahead of
stringent UN trade sanctions which come into effect at <TIME>midnight tonight</TIME> <LOCATION>New

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>, a former
military adviser for the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> dictatorship, declared himself
president on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after ousting Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>.
   Avril, adjutant general of the army, said in an early morning
address on national television that the <ORGANIZATION>Presidential Guard</ORGANIZATION> toppled
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> because it was ``sickened'' by the way <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>
governed. <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> was sent to the neighboring <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   Residents reported hearing heavy gunfire <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> near the
presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting between
military factions.
   <PERSON>Frantz Lubin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s director of information, said soldiers
were killed, but Avril mentioned no casualties.
   Haiti radio stations reported that at least six people were
killed in the capital in coup-related clashes, and that mobs
pillaged two homes owned by <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and the home of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>
Mayor <PERSON>Franck Romain</PERSON>.
   The military government appealed in a national television
broadcast ``for calm, discipline and order in respect of individual
rights and liberties.''
   A witness told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> she saw two bodies in the
courtyard of Romain's luxurious house in the suburb of Delmas and
the property was occupied by soldiers.
   ``The house was stripped, doors were torn off the hinges. It was
a shell,'' the witness said.
   Avril took over a week after about 20 men armed with machetes,
handguns and steel pikes attacked the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> during
a Mass being said by the Rev. <PERSON>Jean Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, a vocal
critic of the military government. Thirteen people were killed and
77 wounded. Opposition leaders blamed <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>'s government for the
attack and another church burning two days later.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, slum dwellers killed and burned the body of
one man and cheered when a soldier shot and killed another man
suspected of participating in the massacre. By midday, the city was
quiet, but the airport was closed.
   Avril, who was adviser to ousted President <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>,
said <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> will respect all international treaties, liberties and
human rights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake
of national reconciliation.''
   <PERSON>Lubin</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON>, commander of the 700-man <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines
Barracks</ORGANIZATION>, was named commander-in-chief of the army, but <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> did
not mention <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>. Dessalines is the most feared unit in the
7,000-man army.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, who has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges
in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, had been considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>
after <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>. It was not known if <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> played a role in the coup,
but sources said <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> were at odds.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Anita Stockman</PERSON> said
noncommissioned officers of the <ORGANIZATION>Presidential Guard</ORGANIZATION> captured <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>
in an apparently bloodless coup and persuaded Avril to take over.
   She said they were believed to be ``dissatisfied with recent
human rights violations and the general deterioration in the
security situation punctuated by attacks against the churches over
the past two weeks.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Stockman</PERSON> said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> phoned the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador and said he
was assuming the presidency. She said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government still
wants <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> to answer the drug trafficking charges in court.
   Namphy arrived in a private plane at a private airport in <LOCATION>Santo
Domingo</LOCATION>, the Dominican capital, early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, said <PERSON>Fabio
Herrera Cabral</PERSON>, deputy foreign minister of the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   Namphy, in a military uniform, was accompanied by his wife and
daughter, <PERSON>Herrera Cabral</PERSON> said. They arrived with no luggage and
climbed into a waiting limousine, an airport employee said.
   They were taken to the <LOCATION>Dominican Concorde Hotel</LOCATION>, where former
President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON> stayed after <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> toppled him in a <DATE>June
17</DATE> coup, <PERSON>Herrera Cabral</PERSON> said. It was not known if <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> would
remain in the Dominican capital.
   Avril reported <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>'s ouster at about <TIME>2:30 a.m.</TIME>, several hours
after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the
presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for
cover.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the fighting
involved army factions and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>, the
dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year
dictatorships of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family. Details were not known.
   In his speech to members of the Presidential Guard at the
palace, <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION> declared himself president and promoted himself to
lieutenant general.
   ``The Presidential Guard, sickened by the way the country has
been governed since the seventh of <DATE>February, 1988</DATE> ... has been
forced to act again,'' he said.
   Avril, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in
a military uniform. He was introduced as ``the most honest officer
in the armed forces'' by a sergeant who wore full battle gear.
   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of
governments since nationwide riots forced <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> to flee to exile
in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>. Duvalier had been president since the
<DATE>1971</DATE> death of his father, <PERSON>Francois Duvalier</PERSON>, who ruled since <DATE>1957</DATE>.
   Namphy led a military junta after <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> fled. Avril served as
an adviser to the junta, but resigned in early <DATE>1986</DATE> after
anti-government demonstrations demanded that he and other close
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> associates resign.
   In <DATE>March 1987</DATE>, voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution
calling for elections under civilian control.
   Gunmen killed at least 34 voters on Election Day <DATE>Nov. 29</DATE>, and
the election was canceled. Soldiers from <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Barracks</ORGANIZATION>
were blamed.
   Namphy scheduled new elections, but few people voted and <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>
was elected on <DATE>Jan. 17</DATE>.
   Manigat became involved in a dispute with the military over the
transfers of <LOCATION>Avril</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and other military leaders. Avril played a
key role in <LOCATION>Namphy</LOCATION>'s <DATE>June 17</DATE> overthrow of <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>.

violence.
   The three-week voter-registration period began <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> arrived at <TIME>9:30 a.m.</TIME> and left for <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> at <TIME>2:30 p.m.</TIME>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Officials in a small town clashed
with citizens demanding their ouster and a soldier guarding the
officials shot and killed one of the demonstrators, an independent
radio station reported <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Some Haitians said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s confrontation in <LOCATION>Desdunes</LOCATION>, 150
miles north of the capital, was one of several indicating the
military government is clamping down on the reform movement
launched by a <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> soldiers' rebellion.
   In unrelated fighting about 50 miles south of <LOCATION>Desdunes</LOCATION>, two
people were killed <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a feud between members of two families
over land and hundreds of people fled their homes fearing a
massacre, according to <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti-Inter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said the fight in <LOCATION>Desdunes</LOCATION> began after groups
representing youths, peasants and planters met to formulate demands
for disarming members of the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> and repressive
government officials.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> were the private militia that supported the
29-year dictatorship of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family.
   The demonstrators took to the streets intending to shut down
government offices, the broadcast said. Before they got to the
courthouse they were blocked by ``The Steamroller,'' a group of
henchmen and city officials led by Mayor <PERSON>Anthenor Mercius</PERSON>, the
radio said.
   The mayor's group, guarded by soldiers, threw rocks at the
protesters, and four soldiers protecting the demonstrators withdrew
to their barracks, the broadcast said.
   It said a soldier in the mayor's group, Sgt. <LOCATION>Detroit Valco</LOCATION>,
killed a youth identified as <ORGANIZATION>Evarol Racine</ORGANIZATION> and wounded another man
in the foot. Four other demonstrators were injured by rocks, the
radio said.
   <PERSON>Paul Latortue</PERSON>, an economist who ran for the region's <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat
in <DATE>November</DATE>'s violently aborted national elections, said the town
is a stronghold of the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>.
   Latortue noted that on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the government said it was
temporarily suspending the search for <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>. On
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, soldiers killed a squatter in the capital, and on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> they dispersed a demonstration in the town of
<LOCATION>Port-de-Paix</LOCATION>, he said.
   The government believes ``the social potential of the soldiers'
reform movement is too high, it must be reduced and checked,''
<PERSON>Latortue</PERSON> said.
   The enlisted men of the Presidential Guard overthrew the
military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> in a bloodless coup on
<DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> and named Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to replace him.
   The soldiers demanded an improvement in living conditions for
themselves, the ouster of unpopular military and government
officials, and a return to the <DATE>1987</DATE> Constitution, which <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>
suspended.
   In the initial reaction to the coup, people across the country
chased down, killed and burned several <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON> said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> has consolidated his power and promoted
non-commissioned officers to bring them into line.
   ``Avril is successfully bringing off a vast seduction campaign
on behalf of American aid,'' <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON> said. ``But the fist in the
velvet glove is iron.''
   Radio-Metropole reported <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Haitian employees of the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agency for International Development</ORGANIZATION> petitioned for immediate
resumption of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   Two-thirds of the <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid package was cut off last
year when <DATE>November</DATE>'s elections were canceled. Thugs supported by
the army attacked and killed 34 people at the polls.
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> took over after dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled to
exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>February 1986</DATE>. Duvalier ruled after the <DATE>1971</DATE>
death of his father, <PERSON>Francois Duvalier</PERSON>, who took over in <DATE>1957</DATE>.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said its reporter in <LOCATION>Estere</LOCATION>, 100 miles north
of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, said one person was was shot to death, another
was killed by machete blows and ``many people'' were clubbed or
stoned in fighting <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the fertile <LOCATION>Artibonite Valley</LOCATION>.
   It said the feud involves members of the Hatier and Bercourt
families who have had violent disputes for years over land
ownership.
   The report said that after a fatal shooting, Hatier property
near <LOCATION>Estere</LOCATION> was invaded by members of the Desdunes-based Bercourt
and in the fighting, hundreds of residents fled the area in panic.
   It said police made one arrest and called for reinforcements to
help restore calm.

LT GEN <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s army commander, yesterday ignored demands to
respect the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations-brokered</ORGANIZATION> plan allowing the country's exiled
president to return, despite the re-imposition of an international embargo,
AP reports from <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
Six <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and three Canadian navy ships were offshore to enforce the embargo
yesterday, and a French frigate was on the way to join them. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> said it
would send a frigate.
Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the
midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers
snapped shots of him smoking and joking.
Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans,
he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.'
The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow
exiled President <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON> to return to office on <DATE>October 30</DATE>.
Gen <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> was a key part of the military coup which overthrew <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> -
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s first popularly elected president - in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
The capital, <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, came to life slowly on the first day of the
embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump
attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a
gallon and there were no queues.
But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second
day on <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>'s orders, to mourn the assassination <DATE>last week</DATE> of <PERSON>Mr Guy
Malary</PERSON>, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet
preparing for <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>'s return. <PERSON>Mr Robert Malval</PERSON>, the prime minister,
has blamed military authorities for the murder.
The sanctions decreed by the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> include a ban on oil and
petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s de facto authorities or 'their agents'.
While the blockade could stop tankers, the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> has taken no measures to halt
petrol shipments from the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>. The Dominican government is close to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s army,
and previous cross-border embargo violations had been reported.
The Haitian military is also believed to have stockpiled several weeks'
supply of oil reserves.
The dispute has raised tensions in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>. Hundreds of residents
have fled to the countryside in anticipation of more army repression or a
foreign invasion.
Gen <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> said the solution to the crisis lay in further negotiation, but
UN envoy <PERSON>Mr Dante Caputo</PERSON>, the architect of the plan to restore <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>,
rejected that idea.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Foreigners and Haitians flee amid rumours of invasion

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of foreigners living in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s capital, gathered
at its international airport yesterday in an effort to flee the country
following the broadcast of a statement by supporters of the military
government that all white foreigners should leave immediately.
An attempt by the military government, through another broadcast yesterday,
to retract the command appeared only to have added to the growing panic and
tension.
Meanwhile, Haitians are leaving the capital for the countryside in the wake
of rumours that a foreign military invasion is imminent as part of
international efforts to restore <PERSON>Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON> as president.
Clashes between factions supporting <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> and those backing the
military government, which has refused to step down, claimed 16 lives over
the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, and appeared likely to continue yesterday as <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>'s
supporters organised three days of mourning for <PERSON>Mr Guy Malary</PERSON>, the justice
minister who was assassinated on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
Diplomats said Haitians were convinced that foreign troops would land in a
matter of days unless the military rulers left office and made way for <PERSON>Mr
Aristide</PERSON> to return.
The fears of an invasion heightened at the <DATE>weekend</DATE> as warships from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> took up positions off <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s coast to enforce an international
economic embargo aimed at forcing Gen <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON>, the military leader, and
other officers to step down in accordance with an agreement reached with <PERSON>Mr
Aristide</PERSON> in early <DATE>July</DATE>. Gen <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lt Col Michel Francois</PERSON>, the police
chief, have said they will not leave office.
The effectiveness of earlier attempts at an embargo have been frustrated by
hectic trading across the border between <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>,
which share the island of Hispaniola. The Dominican government has said it
will reinforce military patrols at the border, but businessmen in <LOCATION>Santo
Domingo</LOCATION>, the capital, said yesterday that this might not be enough to
prevent some soldiers and other smugglers from selling petrol and other
essentials to the Haitians.
Supporters of <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> say factions in the military have plotted the
murder of several prominent Haitians, including <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> supporters and
members of the civilian government, to frustrate further the return of <PERSON>Mr
Aristide</PERSON>.
The claim gained currency following the murder <DATE>last month</DATE> of <PERSON>Mr Antoine
Izmery</PERSON>, a businessman and supporter of <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>, and that of <PERSON>Mr Malary</PERSON>
last week.
Likely targets of the campaign are reported to be <PERSON>Mr Robert Malval</PERSON>, the
prime minister, and <PERSON>Mr Evans Paul</PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> and a
supporter of <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> today
declared himself president of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> after troops stormed the
national palace and deposed civilian President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>.
   ``The future of democracy and liberty was at stake. The army
must protect the superior interests of the country and must head
the country,'' <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> said in a television broadcast <TIME>late this
morning</TIME> from the presidential palace.
   ``To this end, a military government has been formed with, as
president, Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>,'' he said.
   The coup ended four months of civilian government and put <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>
back in command of the nation he led for two years as head of a
three-man junta. It came less than a week after <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> fired
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and tried to reorganize the military.
   Namphy was surrounded by military leaders, including Lt. Col.
<PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON>, once <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s chief military ally. It was not
immediately known if <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> had aligned himself with <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> and his family arrived today in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>, the
capital of neighboring <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>. Manigat was staying at
the <ORGANIZATION>Dominican Concorde Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, a hotel spokesman said. Haiti and the
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> share the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of Hispaniola.
   ``The president betrayed your confidence and violated the
constitution he swore to observe,'' <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> said. ``He took a path
that led irrevocably to the most brutal form of dictatorship. To
this end, he attacked the army and shook its high command to make
it a docile instrument of personal power. He thus imperiled the
conquest of <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE>.''
   A few hours later, the military announced a new Cabinet of
ministers. The announcement said the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House of Deputies</ORGANIZATION>
had been dissolved and that the new government would rule by decree.
   The new Cabinet, announced on state-run television by Col. <PERSON>Gary
Leon</PERSON>, general secretary of the armed forces, was made up of 11
members of the military and one civilian.
   <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was inaugurated as president <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE>. The junta stepped
down after he took office.
   Manigat retired <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> as commander in chief of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s
7,000-man army on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, charging him with insubordination in
ordering the transfer of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and other high-ranking officers three
days earlier.
   Namphy first appeared on state-run television at about <TIME>1:30 a.m.</TIME>
in a broadcast from the palace shortly after the coup.
   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' he declared, waving
an Uzi submachine gun and flanked by soldiers.
   There was no official word on casualties from the takeover.
   A man at <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s residence was on the telephone with the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
News when soldiers moved in. Jean Lescouflair identified himself as
director of the regional <ORGANIZATION>Information Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and a former <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
teacher. He said <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was upstairs with government ministers
discussing how to respond to <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s statement when soldiers
arrived at about <TIME>3:08 a.m.</TIME>
   ``I am hearing some noise coming like a machine gun,'' he said,
lowering his voice. ``They are entering the yard now ... It seems
like they are smashing the cars in the yard.''
   At <TIME>3:20 a.m. Lescouflair</TIME> told the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> News he could hear a
security guard shouting in French, ``Don't shoot! We're coming
out!''.
   A few minutes later, someone was heard yelling ``Hands up!'' in
French, the newspaper said. The last words from Lescouflair were,
``Call my wife. Goodbye.''
   Haitian journalists said troops loyal to <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> were killed
when soldiers backed by three tanks freed <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> from house arrest
and stormed the palace. <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> had been held at his residence in
<LOCATION>Bon Repos</LOCATION>, 15 miles outside the capital.
   The front of the palace did not appear damaged and showed no
sign of battle.
   The airport was closed today. By midday, the streets of the
capital were busy with cars, trucks and pedestrians.
   Early today, radio stations were not broadcasting news, only
music, and international operators refused to accept calls. One
operator said <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> ordered operators not to place calls, but it
was possible to dial directly.
   People on the streets were aware of what had happened, despite
the lack of radio reports.
   ``It's not good for democracy, what happened, but it may be good
for <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>,'' said one 22-year-old unemployed laborer. ``Maybe we
cannot talk, but maybe we can work.''
   The fighting began after a 10-minute blackout at about <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The streets of this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> capital became deserted.
Automatic and heavy caliber gunfire broke out around the palace.
   Heard from a hotel two blocks away, it died down, then surged
for 1{ hours again just after <TIME>midnight</TIME>, when explosions also were
heard.
   Government sources said <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>, 57, was taken by ambulance from
his home to a military hospital. A Haitian journalist said <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>
would be expelled from the country.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Agence France-Press</ORGANIZATION> reporter spoke by telephone with <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>
early today and reported the president said he was uninjured.
   Earlier <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> retired the <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> police chef
and transferred about two dozen officers, including the head of the
presidential guard.
   ``The presidential guard went to get <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and brought him to
the palace,'' said the Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The army has controlled this impoverished nation during most of
its 184-year history. A junta ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> for two years after
dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>February
1986</DATE>.
   The military ran the <DATE>Jan. 17</DATE> balloting in which <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was
elected. The most popular candidates and most voters boycotted the
election, and it was widely criticized as rigged.
   An independently run election <DATE>Nov. 29</DATE> was thwarted by violence
that left more than 30 people dead.
   Paul's soldiers were blamed for much of the violence, after
which the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> withheld <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> in aid. Paul was
indicted in <DATE>March</DATE> by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> grand jury on drug trafficking charges.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Haiti awaits Aristide's resurrection: Why the former
president may be back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM SPINDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of the safe return of President <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON> to
lead <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> appears to have increased over the last week.
Violence and intimidation by supporters of the military leadership which
ousted the president two years ago last week looked likely to jeopardise the
implementation of an accord aimed at his safe return.
But the violence - at least in the capital, <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> - appears to have
subsided and a weekend decision to boost the UN presence in the country has
raised hopes that <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> can return safely.
Around 600 US troops begin to arrive in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> next week in a
'non-confrontational' role as part of a 1,650-member UN mission in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> to
help in the restoration of democracy. The contingent is expected to contain
more than 500 police.
The agreement between military leaders and <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> envisaging the
latter's return, was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> and the governments of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and signed on <DATE>July 3</DATE>. The accord contemplated
the appointment of a new Prime Minister by <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> and his return on
<DATE>October 30</DATE>.
But since <PERSON>Mr Robert Malval</PERSON> took office as Prime Minister on <DATE>September 2</DATE>, he
and his cabinet have been obstructed and intimidated by government employees
appointed after the coup, who do not want to give up their posts. The
employees have been helped by bands of civilian police auxiliaries known as
'attaches' who have attacked government ministers and the mayor of
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Evans Paul</PERSON>.
According to human rights groups, the 'attaches' are also responsible for
this month's violence against Aristide supporters, in which dozens of people
have been killed or have disappeared, including an important backer of the
President, <PERSON>Mr Antoine Izmery</PERSON>, who was pulled out of a church service and
shot dead.
The prosecutor in charge of investigating some of these killings, <PERSON>Mr Wilson
Ciceron</PERSON>, has resigned after receiving death threats. Ministers have been
subjected to intimidation which, in some cases, has prevented them going to
work. <PERSON>Mr Malval</PERSON> and his government cannot go anywhere without heavy police
protection.
The man whose job it is to provide it, the police chief, <PERSON>Lt Col Michel
Francois</PERSON>, has been accused by <PERSON>Mr Dante Caputo</PERSON>, special envoy of the
<ORGANIZATION>Organisation of American States</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, of being responsible
for <PERSON>Mr Izmery</PERSON>'s murder.
<PERSON>Mr Malval</PERSON>'s government has invited exiled Haitians to return to the country,
but there is no evidence that any of those returning are Aristide
supporters. Most appear to be supporters of the former <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>
dictatorship, which ruled the country for three decades.
In an apparent attempt to keep the activities of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> supporters
above board, <PERSON>Mr Malval</PERSON> has legalised a Duvalierist party.
In spite of the violence, <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> is adamant that he will return to
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> next month. He is planning to arrive with a number of
prominent international personalities, including the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>
winner Ms <PERSON>Rigoberta Menchu</PERSON> and possibly former <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> president <PERSON>Mr Jimmy Carter</PERSON>.
If he does, he will find mountains of refuse blocking the streets of the
capital, hunger and disease throughout the country, and an economy almost in
ruins. His first priority, nevertheless, will be to stay alive and to try to
stem the violence.
His task will not be helped by a new organisation calling itself the
'<DATE>September 30</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Group</ORGANIZATION>' after the date of the <DATE>1991</DATE> coup. It has been
distributing leaflets in the streets of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> threatening to
'eradicate' <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>'s activists before his return.
'The days to come must be red with blood' they warn. They also pledge to
intervene immediately whenever an employee appointed since the coup is
fired. 'Our democracy', the leaflet states, 'consists of the law and the
machine gun'.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> _ Advocates of democratic reform expressed
hope that <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s new military leaders would open a dialogue with
the people after ousting Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henry Namphy</PERSON>, who ran the country
for more than two years.
   Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>, the army's chief administrative
officer, went on national television <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and declared himself
president of the Western hemisphere's most impoverished nation.
   He said <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> was ousted by the 1,000-man Presidential Guard
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> because it was ``sickened'' by his rule, which was
marked by a tolerance for the murder of government opponents.
   Avril was a military adviser to <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> before the
dictator's <DATE>February 1986</DATE> flight into exile and has since managed to
ally himself with the prevailing forces in the 7,000-man military.
   The government said an unspecified number of soldiers were
reported killed in the coup, and <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> was sent to the <LOCATION>Dominican
Republic</LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   Port-au-Prince appeared calm <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, though the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
Canadian embassies advised their citizens to stay off the streets.
Small groups of people milled in the streets and traffic was light.
Television and radio stations resumed their normal programming.
   The airport, which was closed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, was expected to reopen
today.
   But for the four-month civilian presidency of <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>,
which ended in <DATE>June</DATE> with a bloodless coup, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> had run <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>
since <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>'s departure, heading a military-led junta until
<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was elected in <DATE>January</DATE> in junta-run balloting that was
widely boycotted.
   On <DATE>Nov. 29</DATE>, independently run elections were thwarted by armed
thugs supported by the army who killed 34 people at the polls.
   And a week before the coup, about 20 men armed with machetes,
handguns and steel pikes attacked a <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> during a
Mass being celebrated by the Rev. <PERSON>Jean Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, a vocal
critic of the <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> government. Thirteen people were killed and 77
wounded.
   Opposition leaders blamed the government for the attack and
another church burning two days later.
   Heavy gunfire was heard in the capital <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> shortly
before the coup, but <PERSON>Susan Clyde</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>
here, said ``it appeared to be mainly celebratory shooting in the
air, nobody shooting at anyone or anything.''
   <PERSON>Frantz Lubin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s director of information, said an
unspecified number of soldiers were killed.
   Radio stations reported that at least six people were killed in
the capital in coup-related clashes and that mobs pillaged two
homes owned by <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and the home of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Franck
Romain</PERSON>.
   Although motives for the coup were unclear, it appeared the
soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the elite Presidential
Guard were disenchanted with <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s authoritarian rule.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Presidential Guard had given the army's High Command a list of
19 demands for forming a new government, including democratic
reform and better living conditions for soldiers.
   All the demands were accepted, the diplomat said, except the
nomination of Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON> as military commander-in-chief.
Paul has been indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man Dessaline unit, had been
regarded as the most powerful figure in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> after <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>. It was
not known if <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> played a part in the coup, but sources said he
and <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> were at odds.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Anita Stockman</PERSON> said
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still wanted <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> extradited to face the drug
charges.
   Initial reaction to the coup from advocates of democratic reform
was positive, but cautious.
   ``I will support the military government if they say as soon as
possible when they will call elections,'' said <PERSON>Louis Dejoie II</PERSON>,
leader of the national <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Industrial Party</ORGANIZATION>. ``We are
ready to speak with any government that respects human rights.''
   In his statement to the nation early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>
will respect all international treaties, liberties and human rights
and that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake of national
reconciliation.''
   The statement was considered significant because it echoed a
recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader <PERSON>Marc Bazin</PERSON>, a
conservative leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee for Democratic Understanding</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bazin</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Dejoie</ORGANIZATION> were among four leading candidates for
president in the <DATE>Nov. 29</DATE> elections and boycotted the elections won
by <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>.
   Dejoie said he expected the military to announce when elections
would be held in the next week or so.
   ``They must do it or they won't have any support,'' <PERSON>Dejoie</PERSON> said.
``The army right now has to regain its credibility. We want to give
them a chance with this new change of guard.''
   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of
governments since nationwide riots forced <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> to flee to
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. Duvalier had been president since the <DATE>1971</DATE> death of his
father, <PERSON>Francois Duvalier</PERSON>, who ruled since <DATE>1957</DATE>.

US officers bluntly warned <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s military chiefs yesterday that they must
co-operate with the intervention force, after <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> marines killed 10 Haitians
in a fierce gun battle at a police station at the <DATE>weekend</DATE>.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, who will address the <ORGANIZATION>UN General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> today, said
he regretted the loss of life, but vowed US troops would continue to respond
to hostile action against them.
The outgoing Haitian strongman, General <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON>, was called,
grim-faced, to an airport meeting with the head of the US-led intervention
force, General <PERSON>Hugh Shelton</PERSON>, to discuss co-operation and flew by helicopter
to the site of the clash in the northern town of <ORGANIZATION>Cap Haitien</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> said
other officers would be meeting the Haitian military to 'ensure their
co-operation'.
The clash on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> - the first involving US troops since they
landed a week ago - came after steadily rising tension between marines and
Haitian authorities in the town.
A <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> officer said pro-democracy demonstrators taunted armed men outside a
police station as marines arrived on patrol. When one of the armed men
raised a sub-machine gun, a marine shot him dead and a gunfight broke out,
the officer said. A <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> sailor was slightly hurt.
Gen Cedras accused the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> of atrocities and demanded the court-martial of a
marine colonel, but the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> brushed aside his angry reaction. Hundreds of
jubilant Haitians yesterday ransacked police stations and an army barracks
in the town, as soldiers and police abandoned their posts. The crowd carried
off beds, tables, desks, electric fans and stacks of papers, before <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
marines restored order.
A leader of the Haitian paramilitary voiced concern that violence could
spread to the capital, <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>. 'Things are getting tense,' he said.
'I feel in danger from the mobs.'
Dozens of demonstrators, emboldened by the presence of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>,
staged an unprecedented mock funeral for Gen Cedras outside the airport in
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
Senator <PERSON>Sam Nunn</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>US Senate</ORGANIZATION> armed services committee and a
member of former president <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>'s team that negotiated the Haitian
generals' agreement to leave power, warned there might be more conflict.
'This is the first bad incident we've had involving, directly, American
troops, but it won't be the last,' he said.
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> <TIME>last night</TIME> had talks with UN secretary-general <PERSON>Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali</PERSON> on plans for turning over the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> to
UN peacekeepers. The weekend gun battle is likely to increase the pressure
on the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration to get <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> troops out of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> as quickly as
possible.
The exiled president, <PERSON>Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, whom the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> wants restored
to power, declared yesterday he would call the Haitian parliament into
session on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to consider the plan to grant an amnesty for the
military rulers who ousted him.
The military rulers agreed to step down when an amnesty is passed, and the
exiled president, who is still in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, clearly hopes to speed their
departure.

THE Haitian capital of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> was tense yesterday, with many shops
and offices closed and heavily-armed men roaming the almost empty streets.
Public transport was at a standstill. Small-arms and machine-gun fire was
heard through the <TIME>night</TIME>, following <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s violent demonstrations which
prevented the landing of US troops on a UN mission intended to oversee the
restoration of democracy on the island.
The offices of national radio and television were occupied by plainclothes
police auxiliaries, known as 'attaches', who also led <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s
demonstrations.
The UN special representative in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Dante Caputo</PERSON>, cancelled a planned
trip to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> because of the incident. He blamed the Haitian military
for <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s incident, saying the attacks were an insult to the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> and a
clear violation of the agreements signed in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> between the army and
exiled president <PERSON>Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, due to return to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> at the
<DATE>end of this month</DATE> under the peace plan.
The USS Harlan County, carrying the troops, remained anchored outside port
yesterday as <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> officials tried to negotiate a plan for its safe arrival.
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <PERSON>Mr Warren Christopher</PERSON>, secretary of state, yesterday accused
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s military leaders of violating the UN-mediated accord and warned that
if sanctions were reimposed, they would be severe.
'By their actions, Gen (<ORGANIZATION>Raoul</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> and Chief of Police (<PERSON>Joseph Michel</PERSON>)
<PERSON>Francois</PERSON> are inviting reimposition of severe economic sanctions that could
affect their country and would also affect them personally,' <PERSON>Mr Christopher</PERSON>
said.
<PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON>, who led the <DATE>1991</DATE> coup which ousted <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>, condemned the
violence but said he sympathised with the Haitians' outrage at the threat to
their sovereignty.

   The military coup in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> will not
interrupt <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s efforts to regain millions of dollars allegedly
taken by dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> when he fled to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
attorneys representing <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   A judge was to be selected <DATE>Monday</DATE> in this southern French city
to hear the case against <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>, accused of misappropriating <MONEY>$120
million</MONEY> in public funds.
   In <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri
Namphy</PERSON> re-established military rule by decree and named his own
government a few hours after ousting President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>'s
civilian government.
   The coup crushed hopes for the democracy promised two years ago
after <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> was toppled, ending his family's 29-year
dictatorship.
   ``We are not lawyers for the government but for the Haitian
state,'' said attorney <PERSON>Yann Colin</PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> in its
French legal proceedings.
   In <DATE>April</DATE> a French court ruled it had jurisdiction in the case
against <ORGANIZATION>Duvalier</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Haitian national lottery, office of vehicle insurance,
gaming commission and <ORGANIZATION>Port-au-Prince Bank</ORGANIZATION> are demanding that
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> and members of his entourage reimburse the government.
   Colin claimed the <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> requested represents only part of
what Duvalier diverted.
   Since arriving in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> has lived with
his wife, <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON>, and other family members in a luxurious mansion
in southern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> rented from <LOCATION>Saudi</LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON>Adnan Kashoggi</PERSON>.
   Duvalier has declined to comment on political developments in

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Soldiers who toppled the regime of
Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> mutinied against more commanders <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
and civilians rallied to join the uprising. Witnesses said a
12-year-old boy was killed when troops fired on a crowd.
   Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>, made president <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after a coup led
by <ORGANIZATION>Namphy's Presidential Guard</ORGANIZATION>, tried to quell the military
uprising <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by naming a new armed forces chief and retiring
nine unpopular commanding officers.
   ``The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst of
a general mutiny,'' a Western diplomat said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Coup leaders who put Avril in power demanded that he institute
democratic reforms, including free elections that <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> has not had
in 31 years. But even though Avril appealed for calm, the purge
that put him in power continued to spread to military barracks and
the streets.
   Radio <PERSON>Haiti Inter</PERSON> said army units opposed to Avril attacked a
crowd in this capital city at <TIME>4:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and that a
12-year-old boy, identified as <PERSON>Nilo Chailes</PERSON>, was killed and three
people were wounded.
   Witnesses said the crowd was on its way to pillage the home of a
sergeant known for his brutality when soldiers fired.
   The station said mutineers battled other soldiers, with one
soldier killed in a clash <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Jacmel</LOCATION>, about 45 miles south
of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Mutineers on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> were rounding up agents of <ORGANIZATION>Namphy's
Bureau of Criminal Investigatons</ORGANIZATION> and leaving them at army
headquarters in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>. before cheering crowds, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti
Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Radio stations said ousted military commanders were also being
dropped off _some in handcuffs _ at the headquarters, but their
fate was unclear.
   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic radio station, reported
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Sergo Joseph</PERSON>, arrested <DATE>Aug. 5</DATE> for writing an
anti-government slogan on a wall, was freed by a judge <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>.
   He was severely beaten after his arrest and the human rights
group <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> campaigned for his release.
   In <ORGANIZATION>Cap Haitien</ORGANIZATION>, a crowd plundered the residence of <PERSON>Louis Noisin</PERSON>,
a former <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> president, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, civilians supporting the mutineers engaged in mob
killings and workers at government companies struck to unseat
state-appointed managers, actions apparently aimed at wiping out
remnants of <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s rule.
   ``The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has become
a people's army, at least for the moment,'' the diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Organizers canceled a demonstration at <ORGANIZATION>St. Jean Bosco Roman
Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> planned for <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to support the soldiers'
rebellion and rescheduled it for <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The organizers, members
of a leftist coalition, said they would meet instead with Avril and
Sgt. <PERSON>Joseph Heubreux</PERSON>, leader of <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s coup.
   ``I came to <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> from the country to participate in
the demonstration,'' said <PERSON>Andre-Juste Pierre</PERSON>, 32, an unemployed
welder from <LOCATION>Cabaret</LOCATION>, 20 miles north of the capital. ``I don't feel
frustrated because the military government is afraid. We'll
demonstrate tomorrow.''
   About 100 people gathered in front of the burned-out ruins of
the church, staring at the charred, mutilated body of a thug killed
by a mob <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Witnesses identified him as an ex-officer of the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton
Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>, the dreaded private army of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> dictatorship.
They said the man took part in the <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> massacre of 13
parishioners at the church that provoked <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s coup.
   The government's dismissal of eight generals and a colonel
followed the ouster by soldiers of at least 11 commanders
nationwide since <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   In <ORGANIZATION>St. Marc</ORGANIZATION>, about 60 miles north of the capital, residents took
to the streets <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to punish thugs allegedly allied with the
local army commander. Soldiers fired rifles into the air to
disperse them, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Metropole</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Among officers retired <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was former <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Minister Brig.
Gen. <PERSON>Williams Regala</PERSON>, despised in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> for his ties to the
dictatorship of Francois ``Papa Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> and his son,
<PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON>. Namphy headed a three-man junta that ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> after
the younger <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> was forced into exile on <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>.
   Central Bank employees went on strike <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> demanding the
board of directors resign, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Metropole</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Employees of at least the state flour mill and electric company
joined the military mutiny and ousted their bosses <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
Unpopular managers of other government companies also were
expelled, radio stations said, but details were sketchy.
   Radio stations estimated that up to 12 <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> had been
killed by mobs and soldiers since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ The military commander of
<LOCATION>Cap-Haitien</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s second-largest city, has prohibited street
demonstrations until further notice, the independent radio station
Haiti-Inter reported <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Col. <PERSON>Carrel Occil</PERSON>, military commander of the northern coastal
town, issued the order on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in response to plans for
upcoming demonstrations, the radio said.
   Neighboorhood citizens' committees had been planning
demonstrations against unpopular government officials and in
support of the <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> coup that initiated a nationwide movement
of reform, it said.
   Since the ouster of the military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri
Namphy</PERSON> by rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard on <DATE>Sept.
17</DATE>, dozens of commanders with ties to the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> regime were
removed throughout <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> and unpopular and repressive army officers
and government officials dismissed.
   An unidentified member of a Cap-Haitien neighborhood committee
told Haiti-Inter that ``nothing has changed,'' that anti-democratic
officials are still holding office.
   In recent declarations, such prominent political leaders as
<PERSON>Louis Dejoie Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sylvio Claude</PERSON> have been calling on the
government to make a clean sweep of members of the dreaded <ORGANIZATION>Tonton
Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> from public office.
   In a related development, club-swinging soldiers broke up a
demonstration <DATE>Sunday</DATE> against the rural police in Petite Riviere, a
town in the <LOCATION>Artibonite Province</LOCATION> 40 miles north of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>,
Haiti-Inter reported.
   The soldiers, from the garrison of <LOCATION>Gonaives</LOCATION> to the north of the
town, arrested two protesters and dispersed the crowd by shooting
into the air. None of the people who were clubbed was seriously
injured, Haiti-Inter reported.
   Last week in the same town, 2,000 people demonstrated without
incident.
   In recent days, however, the army has intervened to quell
rallies.
   Last <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, soldiers shot and killed a protester in a
demonstration of squatters in the capital, and two weekends ago, in
Cote-de-Fer, a small southern coastal town, a popular tribunal
composed of citizens and local soldiers was disbanded without
incident by the army.
   Dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> since <DATE>1957</DATE>
and was succeeded by his son, <PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON>, who fled into exile in
<DATE>February 1986</DATE> in the midst of a popular uprising.
   Namphy led a three-man junta that governed this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island
nation until <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON> was elected president last <DATE>January</DATE> in
elections widely viewed as fraudulent.
   Namphy ousted <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> and declared himself president on <DATE>June 20</DATE>.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ In attacks political and civic
leaders blame on thugs angered by the shift from army to civilian
rule, marauding gunmen have killed at least 19 people this week,
officials and radio reports say.
   The victims included 11 members of a self-defense group hacked
to death in the town of Petit Goave, the birthplace of nationwide
demonstrations that forced Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril from power.
   In the capital of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, assailants killed at
least four people and wounded eight, according to the reports. The
wounded included five members of a self-defense unit shot by gunmen
in speeding cars.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, the political and civic coalition that chose
provisional President <PERSON>Ertha Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON> after <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> went into
exile <DATE>last week</DATE>, has urged the formation of self-defense units.
   There has been a dearth of police protection since Avril fled.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION> said thugs and members of the
ill-disciplined, 6,000-man army _ the traditional power broker in
this impoverished <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation _ are angry at the military's
surrender of power to civilians.
   ``These acts of urban terrorism have been committed by
irreconcilable supporters of dictatorship,'' politician <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller
Guerre</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Others said the attacks were aimed at
destabilizing the civilian government.
   An official at the state hospital in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> said the
morgue received the bodies of two people shot before dawn
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the hospital treated eight people _ including the five members of a
self-defense unit _ for bullet wounds.
   Privately owned <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> said gunmen trying to hold up
a rice storehouse downtown killed security guard <PERSON>William Desir</PERSON> late
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and shot up the building before driving off and shooting
at passers-by.
   And it said fishermen in the seafront neighborhood of <ORGANIZATION>Carrefour</ORGANIZATION>
on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> found the body of an unidentified, naked man with his
hands tied behind his back.
   The Roman Catholic station <ORGANIZATION>Radio Soleil</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> and
an independent source said 13 people, including 11 members of a
neighborhood self-defense group, were killed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Petit
Goave</LOCATION>, 50 miles southwest of the capital.
   Radio <PERSON>Haiti Inter</PERSON> said the 11 were hacked to death by a gang of
assailants while searching for the killers of an elderly couple who
were shot and disemboweled earlier in the day.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, 1,000 police at checkpoints in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>
searched private vehicles for weapons, state television said.
   A soldier was shot to death in the capital by unknown assailants
<DATE>Monday</DATE>, and eight nuns at a Roman Catholic girls' school were
beaten and injured by machete-wielding assailants who broke into
their compound on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Haiti has had five governments since a <DATE>February 1986</DATE> popular
uprising forced dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> into exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   All but the current government were dominated by the military.
   Avril was elevated to power 18 months ago in a coup by
rank-and-file soldiers who said they were outraged with
state-sanctioned murder and corruption.
   His resignation followed a week of nationwide demonstrations
sparked by the killing by the army of an 11-year-old girl on her
porch in Petit Goave.
   If the current government holds general elections as promised,
the next government will be the first chosen by the people since
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> declared independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1804</DATE>.

ASSASSINS yesterday killed <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s justice minister and at least two other
people in an escalation of the violence that has set the country's military
leaders on a collision course with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> administration, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports
from <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
Justic Minister Guy Malary was shot dead in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the capital,
shortly after President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> had warned Haitian military leaders to
restore democracy. <PERSON>Mr Malary</PERSON>, a wealthy lawyer, was a supporter of ousted
President <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, who is intended to return to the country
under a <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> peace accord signed by General <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON>, the army
chief.
The Haitian government said that <PERSON>Mr Malary</PERSON>'s bodyguard and driver were also
killed and local radio said there were unconfirmed reports of a fourth
death. The minister's car was found riddled with bullets beside a church
where another supporter of President <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> was shot dead last month.
In another show of defiance against international pressure, members of a
pro-military group marched into parliament, briefly held some legislators
hostage and expressed their support for <ORGANIZATION>Gen Cedras</ORGANIZATION>, local radio reported.
Nearly all cabinet ministers, who were sworn into office last month, have
received death threats from civilian gunmen known as 'attaches' for their
links to police and army. <PERSON>Mr Malary</PERSON> had been spearheading legislation to
separate <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s army and police, a crucial step in the UN accord.
Earlier yesterday, police chief <PERSON>Michel Francois</PERSON>, who controls
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, vowed he would not bend to international pressure and give
up power. 'I'm Haitian and I've chosen to die in my country,' he said.
His supporters said they would paralyse Port-au-Prince with a general strike
on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the day international sanctions imposed by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>
take effect.
<PERSON>Mr Dante Caputo</PERSON>, the chief UN envoy to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, said even the immediate
resignation of <PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON> was not enough to call off the UN sanctions. He
said he wanted hard proof that the army would halt growing street violence
before the UN considered cancelling the planned oil embargo and freeze of
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s assets.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> formed a
military government <DATE>Monday</DATE> with himself in charge, after deposing
the 4-month-old civilian administration of President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>.
   The 55-year-old career soldier named a 12-member Cabinet that
included only one civilian, and said he would rule by decree as the
new president.
   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> declared on
national television shortly after the coup, waving an Uzi
submachine gun and flanked by soldiers.
   <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>, who was seized <DATE>Sunday</DATE> evening at his hillside villa
outside <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, arrived in neighboring <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> with his family, said military sources in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>.
   In a statement issued through a spokesman of the hotel where
<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> and his family were staying, the 57-year-old ousted
president said he was not injured in the coup.
   The administration of President <PERSON>Joaquin Balaguer</PERSON> gave no
official statement, but <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was a
``guest of the Dominican government'' and might travel <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME> to <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, where he had been offered political asylum.
   Except for a few random shots heard, <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> was quiet
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. There were no reports of unrest in the provinces. Men
and women strolled past the national palace and children played
soccer at a closed gasoline station two blocks away.
   In a short live broadcast on state-run television from the
<ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> said <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> ``betrayed your confidence and
violated the constitution he swore to uphold.''
   ``The future of democracy was at stake,'' said the general, who
was accompanied by elements of every unit in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s 7,000-member
armed forces. ``The army must protect the superior interests of the
country and must head the country. To this end, a military
government has been formed.''
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>, who spoke in French for about five minutes, pledged to
``guarantee that all the conquests of <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE> (when his three-man
junta turned over the government to <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>) will be respected. To
our powerful friends and to international organizations, I
guarantee the respect of all commitments.''
   <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Phyllis Oakley</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>:
``The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> government strongly condemns this serious blow
to hopes for democracy in that troubled land.''
   Namphy's action halted, at least for now, the slow journey
toward democracy begun after President <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled
the country <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>, ending the 29-year dictatorship founded
by his father, <PERSON>Francois</PERSON> ``Papa Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>.
   The general, who was <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>'s chief of staff, led
the junta that ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> until <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> won a presidential
election this year with the army's help.
   <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, a nation of 6 million people and the poorest country in
the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>, shares the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of Hispaniola
with the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   Manigat began his disastrous confrontation with the army, the
traditional base of power since independence in <DATE>1804</DATE>, by removing
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> as commander on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Manigat also reassigned two dozen
other officers <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, many of them <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>'s allies.
   He accused <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> of insubordination for ordering the transfers
of several officers without presidential permission, including
<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s main military ally, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON>. The
barracks of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s command, the 700-man <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Battalion</ORGANIZATION>, is
directly behind the <ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, who has been indicted by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> federal court on charges
of drug trafficking, was in the group standing around <LOCATION>Namphy</LOCATION> during
the television appearance <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but whether he had allied himself
with the general was unclear.
   The military announced a new Cabinet, dissolution of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s intention to rule by decree.
   Col. <PERSON>Gary Leon</PERSON>, general secretary of the armed forces, read the
names of the Cabinet members on television. Gen. <PERSON>Williams Regala</PERSON>,
who was defense minister under <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> and signed the order
retiring <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>, will be minister of defense and interior.
   No public opposition greeted <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> on his first day back in the
palace. There were no rallies for <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>, whose political
headquarters was ransacked.
   The international airport in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> was closed, along
with most schools and businesses in the capital. Car and pedestrian
traffic was curtailed. Overseas telephone lines were closed down
and an employee at the government telephone company, <ORGANIZATION>Teleco</ORGANIZATION>, said
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> ordered it.
   Few soldiers were in the streets and there were no military
checkpoints.
   Namphy had been under house arrest but was freed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
apparently with aid of the presidential guard and the Leopards
counter-insurgency unit using three tanks.
   Shooting began in front of the palace at about <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
as the presidential guard and Leopards battled <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines
Battalion</ORGANIZATION>. At <TIME>1:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION> announced the coup on
television in a broadcast from the palace.
   There were no official reports on casualties but Haitian
journalists said some soldiers loyal to <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> were killed. <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jeffrey Lite</PERSON> said no Americans were injured.

<HEAD>Human Rights Activist Stabbed To Death in Haiti, Government Blamed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ <PERSON>Lafontant Joseph</PERSON>, a prominent human
rights activist, was found beaten and stabbed to death <DATE>Monday</DATE> in a
jeep near the <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> airport, police said.
   ``This murder is a very serious incident,'' <PERSON>Jean-Claude Bajeux</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Ecumenical Center for Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. ``It means that the lives of all militants for
human rights in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> are in danger.''
   <PERSON>Paul Latortue</PERSON>, a former senatorial candidate who lives in exile
in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, blamed the murder on government leader Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>.
   ``I have no doubt that this is a political killing,'' he said.
``It's connected with the government.''
   <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, 54, director of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Center of Education for Human
Rights</ORGANIZATION>, was found dead in his four-wheel drive vehicle near <LOCATION>Mais
Gate International Airport</LOCATION>, just outside the capital. A passerby
recognized the dead man and contacted his family.
   The activist's nephew, physician <PERSON>Ronald Joseph</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> had
been stabbed once in his chest and two or three times in his back.
``The body looked mutilated,'' he said.
   Army Maj. <PERSON>Joseph Baguidy</PERSON>, head of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Criminal
Investigation</ORGANIZATION>, said police found blood about 500 yards from the
car, indicating <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> was killed outside the vehicle.
   There appeared to be more than one assailant, <PERSON>Baguidy</PERSON> said. He
did not elaborate.
   The police official said the seats of the car were found in a
horizontal position and that police discovered a pair of women's
sandals in the vehicle.
   He said it was possible a woman may have been in the car with
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, but that no other body had been located.
   ``We are now examining the blood to see whether there was
another victim,'' he said.
   Radio Metropole, an independent station, said <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> was last
seen alive by his wife, <PERSON>Raymonde</PERSON>, whom he dropped off at their home
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. <PERSON>Mrs. Joseph</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Haitian Women's
Committee Against Torture</ORGANIZATION>, was the first to identify her husband's
body.
   <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, a lawyer, founded the <ORGANIZATION>Center of Education for Human
Rights</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> and was a co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION>League of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <DATE>November 1980</DATE>, under dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>, he was
arrested, jailed and tortured for his outspoken criticism of the
government. <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> was then ordered to leave <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, but refused to
do so.
   Before the national elections scheduled for <DATE>November 29</DATE>, which
were suspended because of civil violence, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> was a candidate
for a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat on the leftist <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION> ticket.
   At the time of his death, the activist was director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Elliot Pierre High School</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON> said the killing was connected with an incident last
week in which four men in black uniforms with Uzi machine guns
burst into the home of sociologist <PERSON>Laennec Hurbon</PERSON> while he was
away, ransacked the premises and stole <MONEY>$1,300</MONEY>.
   Joseph and <PERSON>Laennec</PERSON> were both prominent members of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Congress of Democratic Movements</ORGANIZATION>, a political group working to
organize Haitians and uphold the constitution.
   ``It's an attempt to kill one by one those who argue for
democratic development,'' said <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON>Gerard</PERSON> was
foreign minister in the government of President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, who
was ousted in <DATE>June</DATE>.
   ``We have entered a different phase in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> now where political
killings in the street are going to take place. They don't arrest
you, they kill you in the streets and make it appear that it is the
work of bandits.''
   ``Haitians now live within a system which gives the lives and
property of its citizens no protection. Anything can happen and no
one can prevent any determined gang of killers from doing as it
sees fit,'' <PERSON>Bajeux</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>, who took power in a coup <DATE>June 19</DATE>, suspended the
constitution Haitians approved in a <DATE>March 1987</DATE> referendum.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s new military government has
retired a powerful army colonel who was indicted on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> drug
charges and was once considered a leading candidate for chief of
the armed forces.
   A few bursts of gunfire were heard around <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> late
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, but there was no obvious sign today that Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude
Paul</PERSON> was resisting the retirement. It was not known where he was.
   Several Haitian leaders hailed the retirement after it was
announced <DATE>Friday</DATE>. They said it showed that the 2-week-old
government was moving in the right direction.
   ``They are giving proof of their sincerity to oust
Duvalierists,'' said <PERSON>Louis Dejoie</PERSON>, a former presidential candidate.
He was referring to dictators <PERSON>Francois Duvalier</PERSON> and his son,
<PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> for 29 years until the younger
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> was swept from power in a popular uprising in <DATE>February
1986</DATE>.
   Both Haitian and diplomatic sources said <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s retirement could
eventually lead to renewed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, which was cut off
after a massacre of 34 people during elections last <DATE>November</DATE> in
this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation.
   ``The situation is positive and encouraging,'' said <PERSON>Susan Clyde</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said the embassy was told that
<PERSON>Paul</PERSON> had been replaced by his second-in-command, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Guy
Francois</PERSON>, an American-trained officer.
   The brief announcement on state television late <DATE>Friday</DATE> said only
that <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was retired from the army and his post as commander of
the feared 700-man <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Barracks</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   The announcer said the decision was signed by <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s president,
Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>, and by the minister of defense and
interior, Col. <PERSON>Carl Dorsainvil</PERSON>. It did not say when the retirement
took effect.
   In <DATE>March</DATE>, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
that accused him of conspiring to import cocaine into the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. Paul has denied any involvement.
   As head of the largest unit in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s 7,000-member army, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>
had been considered one of the most powerful figures in the
military. Haitian officials had said he could be named armed forces
chief shortly after Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> took power in a military
coup on <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE>.
   However, officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said such a move could hurt
U.S.-Haitian relations, and it never materialized.
   In <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> had reassigned <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> to an administrative
position, but <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> refused and was backed by then-President <PERSON>Leslie
Manigat</PERSON>. Namphy ousted <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>. Paul remained head of his battalion.
   Paul has been linked to the <DATE>November</DATE> massacre of voters at a
polling place and to the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>, the hated personal
security forces of the <ORGANIZATION>Duvaliers</ORGANIZATION>.
   Told of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s retirement, one Western diplomat said, ``This
means that the American government will certainly reinitiate
assistance to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, but will <PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON> accept his
retirement?''
   A Haitian government official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was surprised by the development, which he
called ``a door wide open'' to restoration of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid.
   The <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> annual package, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s largest source of
foreign aid, was ended after the election massacre.
   Dejoie said <DATE>Friday</DATE>, ``Now the guns have changed shoulders. I am
very pleased at the attitude of this government. The house-cleaning
is still going on in the army.''
   After rank-and-file soldiers overthrew <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> two weeks ago,
they installed Avril as president under a new military government.
They said they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence and
institute democratic reforms, but the new rulers have set no date
for elections.
   The week after the coup, chaos ruled as soldiers around the
country rebelled against commanders and civilian mobs scoured the
country looking for people linked to the Duvalier regimes.
   About 10,000 mostly young people danced in the streets of
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in support of the soldiers' coup. It was
one of the biggest outpourings seen in the capital since
<PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. Some of them
chanted ``Long Live <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, Down With America.''

<HEAD>Caribbean Religious Group Condemns Haiti's Rulers for Church
Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Council of Churches</ORGANIZATION>
denounced the killing of 13 parishioners and the burning of two
churches in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> and urged the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> governments to
condemn <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s military rulers.
   But <DATE>late Saturday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> deposed its military leader, Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>, and two military commanders took power, a government
spokesman said in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the Haitian capital.
   It was unclear whether the attacks on <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> and the following
day, blamed on the government, were related to <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s ouster.
   The church council, which represents Roman Catholic and
Protestant churches in 16 Caribbean countries, said the bloody
attacks were ``cold-blooded cruelty which was shocking even by the
brutal standards of Haitian repression.''
   While army critic Rev. <PERSON>Jean Bertrand Aristide</PERSON> said Mass <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE>
at <ORGANIZATION>St. Jean Bosco Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, two dozen people armed with guns
and knives attacked killed parishioners before burning down the
building as soldiers watched from across the street.
   Nine were killed in the massacre and 77 were wounded, of which
four died at in the hospital, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Five men and a woman that night boasted on government television
they took part in the massacre, and the next day arsonists burned
down a second Roman Catholic church.
   ``The inaction of the government security forces can only be
interpreted as collusion with the method of terrorizing the Haitian
population into silence,'' said the council's statement, released
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Though the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> said it
``regretted'' the massacre and promised to punish the culprits,
similar statements issued after mass killings in the past have
never resulted in investigations or convictions.
   Namphy returned to power after ousting the 4-month-old
government of civilian President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON> in a coup <DATE>June 19</DATE>.
Namphy previously ruled for two years after the exile to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> of
President-for-Life <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> on <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>.
   But on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> was ousted in a military coup and taken
to the airport, said <PERSON>Frantz Lubin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s director of information.
<PERSON>Lubin</PERSON> said he believed Commander Prosper Avril had been named the
new head of state and <LOCATION>Dessalines</LOCATION> Barracks Commander <PERSON>Jean-Claude
Paul</PERSON> as new commander-in-chief of the army.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON>, the forcibly
retired commander of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s most feared army unit who was indicted
on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> drug charges, died <DATE>Sunday</DATE> under suspicious circumstances, a
family friend said. He was 49.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, a 29-year army veteran and one of
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s most powerful figures, died of a heart attack at about <TIME>3
p.m.</TIME> in his home in suburban Fermathe. The independent station gave
no other details.
   A family friend said there was speculation <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was poisoned,
possibly prior to having a heart attack.
   The friend, who would not be identified further, said <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s
housemaid and yardman were arrested and taken to <LOCATION>Petionville</LOCATION> police
station for questioning about the colonel's death.
   Paul's former wife, <PERSON>Mireille Delinois</PERSON>, was taken to the station
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and was under police protection because of fear of
reprisals by <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s relatives, the friend said.
   The military government's spokesman, <PERSON>Frantz Lubin</PERSON>, said he had no
information on <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s death. <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Susan Clyde</PERSON>
also said she had nothing. The capital, <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, appeared
calm.
   Paul was fired <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE> after a coup led by noncommissioned
officers ousted <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s military leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>,
replacing him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The coup leaders said they were outraged with the state-sponsored
murder and corruption <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> tolerated.
   Paul had commanded the 700-man <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Battalion</ORGANIZATION>, the most
brutal unit in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s 7,000-member army, and had been linked to the
<ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>, the hated private army of the 29-year <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>
family dictatorship.
   Soldiers under <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s command have been blamed for widespread
violence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promised
after a popular uprising drove <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> into exile in
<DATE>February 1986</DATE>.
   The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the
cancellation of independently run general elections last <DATE>November</DATE>,
leaving at least 34 people dead.
   Paul had been considered one of the most powerful members of the
army, which has run this impoverished <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation for most of
its 144 years.
   In <DATE>March</DATE>, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> on
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Soldiers who staged the <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> rebellion that ousted <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>
said they wanted to name <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> the army chief but decided not to
because of the drug charges.
   Immediately after the coup, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> appeared to be allied with
<PERSON>Avril</PERSON>, but the new leader reportedly became concerned that <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>
might turn against him. Avril had already ousted about 60 of the
army's most repressive commanders.
   Haitian and diplomatic sources later said <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s retirement could
help lead to the renewal of a <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> annual aid package the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> cut off after the <DATE>November 1987</DATE> election massacre. One
of the conditions the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration has set for renewing aid
is that <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> cooperate in halting the flow of drugs through <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>
into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The drug trafficking indictment alleges <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> conspired to import
220 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1986</DATE>. It
says the traffickers used a landing strip on <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s farm 90 miles
outside <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> to load and fly the shipment to the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Fritz Pierre-Louis</PERSON>, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who
later defected, told Sens. <PERSON>Alfonse D'Amato</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.Y.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Bob Graham</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Fla</LOCATION>. in a special <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> hearing that <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s
troops were involved in drug trafficking.
   Namphy led a military junta that assumed power when <PERSON>Jean-Claude
Duvalier</PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   An attempt to dismiss <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> in <DATE>June</DATE> failed and led to the fall of
the civilian government of <PERSON>Leslie F. Manigat</PERSON>, who won military-run
presidential elections in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> had reassigned <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> to an administrative post, but <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>
refused and was backed by <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>. Namphy ousted <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> on <DATE>June 20</DATE>,
accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> remained head of
his battalion.
   <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> did not intervene when soldiers overthrew <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> in
<DATE>September</DATE>.
   The soldiers who formed <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s new government have said they
want to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute
democratic reforms, but the government has set no dates for
elections.

Fresh violence broke out in the Haitian capital <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> <DATE>yesterday</DATE> as
a demonstration celebrating the expected return of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s democratic
government degenerated into a pitched battle, leaving at least three people
dead and over a dozen injured.
The fighting, after a grenade attack that killed five people on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
marked a resurgence of clashes that threaten <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> efforts to restore democracy
to the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation.
Yesterday's confrontation, erupted, when paramilitaries loyal to the
military regime attacked a crowd marching on the third anniversary of the
coup that toppled elected President <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>. The incidents
throw into doubt the capacity of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military, numbering 20,000 troops,
to guarantee civilians security for free political expression. They have
also increased pressure on the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to pursue a more forceful disarmament of
Haitian paramilitaries.
The demonstration followed mass at <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> cathedral, where Father
Amos called for reconciliation between military loyalists and Aristide
supporters. The mass was attended by <PERSON>Mr Robert Malval</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>'s
nominated premier, who emerged from hiding to sit in the front pew, across
the aisle from <PERSON>Mr William Swing</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> ambassador.
Last night <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON> urged Haitians to halt the fighting. 'There should be
neither violence nor vengeance.' He was noncommital about when he would
return to <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, suggesting it could be 'before <DATE>October 15</DATE>' - the
date <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s military are due to step down.
The crowd had followed the official route for the demonstration past the
offices of <ORGANIZATION>Fraph</ORGANIZATION>, a militia faction loyal to the military government of
Lieutenant-General <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON>. Fraph paramilitaries were understood to
have thrown stones at and opened fire on the demonstrators, who took cover.
A suspected member of the paramilitary group was chased and beaten to death
by the crowd.
Observers say low-ranking officers of the police and army have relinquished
their responsibilities.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Haiti declares emergency as UN sanctions tighten
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s army-backed government has declared a state of emergency after the
tightening of economic sanctions against the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation and amid
intensified rumours of impending foreign military intervention to remove the
military and reinstate <PERSON>Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, the exiled president.
The announcement of the emergency by <PERSON>Mr Emile Jonassaint</PERSON>, recently appointed
head of the government by the army, coincided with an attempt by several
thousand Haitians and hundreds of foreigners to leave the country before the
termination of commercial flights, one of several new sanctions against
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, takes effect.
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> say they will end commercial flights to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 25</DATE>
to increase pressure on the military rulers who took power in a coup 30
months ago. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is also expected to end commercial flights, but it is not
yet known whether other countries which have air links to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, including
the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, will do the same.
In a further show of defiance, the Haitian military said it would close the
country's main airport in <LOCATION>Port</LOCATION> au Prince, the capital, and several smaller
airfields, five days before the new sanctions takes effect.
Foreigners have been told by their governments to leave <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> quickly, and
several governments are also evacuating family members of their diplomatic
staff. Most of the Haitians who have been purchasing tickets to leave the
country are children and women who are being sent abroad as the tighter
sanctions take effect.
Concerns about public safety increased over the weekend after the military
seized guns from several <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> marines entering the country. US officials said
the marines were assigned to duties at the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION>Port</LOCATION> au Prince, as
part of a normal rotation of guards.
The imposition of a state of emergency will not change the situation in the
country. The military and its police arm have been exercising powers in a
virtual state of siege since economic sanctions were put into effect soon
after the coup.
Diplomats in <LOCATION>Port</LOCATION> au Prince said yesterday the declaration of the emergency,
and decision to close airports before the <DATE>June 25</DATE> deadline, were part of the
military government's display of defiance of efforts to have <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>
returned.

Caribbean troops and a group of returning Haitian refugees arrived in the
Haitian capital of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> <DATE>yesterday</DATE>, which suggests that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
military believes it is in full control just 10 days before the scheduled
return of exiled President <PERSON>Jean Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>.
The 262 <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> will be
in charge of security at the port in the capital. This has become a vital
task as humanitarian aid begins to pour in now that US troops have set up
distribution networks.
Some 492 refugees arrived from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION>Guantanamo Bay</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
A total of 14,000 refugees remain outside <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> officials expect 500
a day to arrive should the country remain calm.
Political tensions have been partly defused by a virtual breakdown in the
Haitian police force now that its leader, <PERSON>Lt Col Michel Francois</PERSON>, has fled
to the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
Police officers were completely absent from Haitian streets yesterday,
remaining at their headquarters even while sporadic looting took place
across the street from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> embassy.
US soldiers have worked with Haitians in recent days to locate the homes of
suspected army auxiliaries, who terrorised the population with their harsh
crackdown against supporters of <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>.
But with thousands of weapons still reported to be in the hands of
pro-regime auxiliaries and other extremists and some Haitians thirsting for
revenge, the potential for violence remains high.
Parliament yesterday continued to debate the granting of a general amnesty,
a condition for de facto leader Lt Gen <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON> to step down, but
appeared unable to arrive at a consensus.

<TEXT>
The price of black market petrol shot up in fuel-starved <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> after a
weekend explosion and fire destroyed a big depot for fuel smuggled into
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> in defiance of a UN embargo, AP reports from <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
Fuel prices jumped from about 110 gourdes (about Dollars 8.50 or Pounds
5.80) a gallon to 135 gourdes since the blaze on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, according
to checks at several sales outlets yesterday.
Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel - increasingly precious in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> since
the imposition of the UN embargo in <DATE>October</DATE> - were destroyed in the blaze
that gutted a half-block of <ORGANIZATION>Rue de Cesars</ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
Authorities reported no casualties, and all sides blamed carelessness rather
than arson.
The area near the Roman Catholic cathedral had been transformed into a
dangerous stockpile of petrol, kerosene, diesel and other fuels. Most were
kept in plastic jugs and drums, and vendors often smoked while working, even
alongside trucks full of fuel parked on both sides of the avenue.
Two fuel trucks blew up in the explosion, and at least 12 two-story
buildings were destroyed in the fire.
The army has stockpiled petrol in underground depots around the capital, but
the fuel at the burned warehouses was the main source of sales to civilians.
With legal importers observing the embargo, Haitians have been storing fuel
in makeshift stockpiles throughout the capital.
The fuel embargo was imposed to punish the army for blocking the return of
elected President <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, ousted and exiled in a <DATE>1991</DATE> coup.
With <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s poor - Father <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>'s main supporters - already suffering
the most by the embargo, an increase in fuel prices will make things worse
for them.

<HEAD>Demonstration Reported in Port City of St. Marc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ A protest against a customs
officer's arrival in the port city of <ORGANIZATION>St. Marc</ORGANIZATION> turned into an
anti-government demonstration by more than 5,000 Haitians on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Radio Metropole</ORGANIZATION> station reported.
   It was one of the first demonstrations reported in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> against
the government of <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON> since he was elected president in
<DATE>January</DATE>.
   The station said hundreds of protesters took to the streets
after learning that a customs officer arrived in <LOCATION>St. Marc</LOCATION> to
enforce a government order to stop illegal entry of imported goods
into this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island country.
   The officer ordered a halt to the unloading of cargo ships in
<LOCATION>St. Marc</LOCATION> harbor, about 55 miles northwest of the capital city of
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Demonstrators first turned their wrath on the unidentified
customs officer.
   Armed with machetes, sticks, knives and stones, they set up
flaming tire barricades and shouted, ``I am going to eat you! I am
going to devour you!,'' the station said.
   Two hours later, the number of protesters swelled to about 5,000
and they turned on the government, shouting, ``Down with
<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>!,'' Radio Metropole reported.
   No injuries were reported.
   Manigat earlier announced he intended to stop the illegal flow
of goods into <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> that has flourished since former
President-for-life <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled into French exile <DATE>Feb.
7, 1986</DATE>.
   The president said his program was aimed at stabilizing the
economy of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, the poorest nation in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>.
Although figures have never made public, the contraband helped
drive down prices in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> but cut into government tax revenue.
   Contraband brought to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> comes mostly on ships from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and
includes second-hand clothing, canned food, cigarettes, rice, and
other consumer goods.
   Since then, port cities have been the focal point of the
government plan.
   Goods valued at <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> were confiscated at <LOCATION>Miragoane</LOCATION>, a port
city 50 miles west of Port-of-Prince. Imported passenger cars were
held at other ports until import duties were paid.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported two weeks ago that the military
stopped merchants from taking possession of goods at the port of
<ORGANIZATION>Cap Haitien</ORGANIZATION> on the north coast.

<HEAD>Strike Paralyzes Capital; Radio Report: Duvalier Plans Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ A protest strike over the return
from exile of two former officials linked to human rights abuses
under dictatorial regimes on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> paralyzed this normally
bustling capital of 1 million people.
   Meanwhile, the independent Radio Haiti-Inter reported deposed
dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON> ``Baby Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> had booked a flight to
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> for <DATE>July 29</DATE> and that two of his former ministers were
expected to arrive <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Duvalier has lived in exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> since he was ousted in a
popular uprising in <DATE>February 1986</DATE>.
   The radio station gave no attribution for the report, which
could not be independently confirmed.
   The one-day protest strike was supported by political groups,
labor unions and many civic groups. Strike supporters expressed
concern that <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> supporters were attempting to make a comeback
in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   Downtown shops, open-air markets and gas stations were closed
for the one-day protest, and no buses were running. Streets were
virtually deserted.
   Employers sent home the few assembly line workers who showed up
for work at the sprawling industrial park near the airport,
independent Radio Antilles reported. About 15,000 people are
employed there.
   Reports from <LOCATION>Cap-Haitien</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gonaives</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s second- and
third-largest cities, indicated widespread support for the strike
in the provinces. Most businesses were closed but buses were still
running.
   There were no reports of violence.
   <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of 12 political groups, called the
strike <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after the government failed to comply with its
demand to arrest two former high-ranking officials, <PERSON>Roger Lafontant</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Williams Regala</PERSON>, who returned separately from exile last week.
   As interior and defense minister under ``Baby Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Lafontant</PERSON> reputedly headed the dreaded <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> paramilitary
force. Duvalier's ouster ended the 29-year dynasty founded by his
father, <PERSON>Francois ``Papa Doc</PERSON>,'' who died in <DATE>1971</DATE>.
   Regala, a retired army major general, served as interior and
defense minister under two previous military regimes. He is widely
regarded as the mastermind of the election day massacre of <DATE>Nov. 29,
1987</DATE>, in which thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death
at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Lafontant had been living in self-imposed exile in the
neighboring <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> the past 4{ years.
   Regala fled to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>March</DATE> when military ruler
Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> was forced into exile by a popular uprising.
   Their return to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> heightened fears of an organized attempt
to disrupt general elections scheduled for <DATE>Nov. 4</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION> declared in a statement that <PERSON>Lafontant</PERSON> and <PERSON>Regala</PERSON>
``at large are ill omens of growing insecurity and a slap in the
face of justice.''
   In <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Paul Laortue</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidate in
the aborted <DATE>1987</DATE> elections, said the return of <PERSON>Lafontant</PERSON> and <PERSON>Regala</PERSON>
was a ``very serious test by the Duvalierist sector to find out if
they can make a comeback.''
   ``If these two guys can stay in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, that means that before
the end of the year <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> could attempt to come
back. ... I don't know if he would dare, but it would be viable,''
said <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON>, who now teaches at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Puerto Rico</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION> coalition had given civilian President <PERSON>Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON> until noon <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to arrest <PERSON>Lafontant</PERSON> and <PERSON>Regala</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON>, who was appointed president to succeed
Avril, made no public statement in response to the protest.
   Her silence underscored a long-standing rift between the
president and the <ORGANIZATION>19-member Council of State</ORGANIZATION>, which was appointed
to govern alongside her in a caretaker civilian government.
   In a statement <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Council of State</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Lafontant</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Regala</PERSON> had been widely accused of ``repeated human-rights
violations and illicit enrichment.''
   The council said their return from exile was ``due to the policy
of the present executive (<PERSON>Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON>), which hasn't
managed to set the legal process in motion.''
   An arrest warrant for <PERSON>Lafontant</PERSON>, issued <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by government
prosecutor <PERSON>Bayard Vincent</PERSON>, was not served. But the police chief,
Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duperval</PERSON>, said it would be, independent Tele-Haiti
reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. A second warrant was issued <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.

   Three Haitian soldiers armed with rifles and
seeking political asylum forced their way onto an <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>
jetliner in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and flew to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, officials said.
They were arrested when the plane landed at <LOCATION>Kennedy Airport</LOCATION>.
   No one was injured in the incident, said <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Jim Brown</PERSON>. The three men had surrendered their weapons
before the airplane left <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Airport security and the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> were waiting when the plane, with
224 passengers and a crew of nine, arrived about <TIME>8:15</TIME> p.m in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>. The three men were arrested without incident, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said.
   ``They intended no harm to anyone, there was no threat of
violence,'' said <PERSON>James Fox</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office.
``They just said they wanted to leave <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.''
   The men were identified as <PERSON>Edouine Noel</PERSON>, 24; <PERSON>Nicolas Mormil</PERSON>, 23;
and <PERSON>Jean Charlston Beinamie</PERSON>, 23, said <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Chris Favo</PERSON>. All
three were taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> pending a hearing <DATE>Monday</DATE> on their request for asylum, he
said.
   They men were regular army personnel who did not want to be part
of the recent coup in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, said Port Authority Detective <PERSON>William
Ahrens</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> Flight 658 took off at <TIME>4:40 p.m.</TIME> after the
three soldiers slipped under a wire fence that surrounds
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince International Airport</LOCATION> and ran aboard the plane,
airport employees said.
   Radio <PERSON>Haiti Inter</PERSON> said the plane's captain agreed to fly the
three men to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the plane's destination. The station said
the men made no political statements.
   <PERSON>Eric Boucicault</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, said
``three soldiers on duty entered at the end of the line of
passengers with a determined air. We could not refuse their
entrance. As a result of negotiation, they deposited all their
arms, pistols and rifles, in the pilot's cabin.
   ``Now they are seated calmly in their seats, and normal service
is being maintained,'' he said before the airplane landed in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>.
   Flight 658 runs daily between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and the capital city of
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, where it arrives about <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> and leaves after <TIME>4
p.m.</TIME>
   ``The pilot did a super job,'' said passenger <PERSON>Cameron Smith</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. ``He negotiated a deal with them. He put them up in first
class and tended to them the rest of the way.''
   Other passengers were not immediately let off the plane as
authorities questioned them. The approximately 200 people who were
waiting for the flight's arrival said they were not told about the
incident until the plane landed.
   ``They were pointing M-16's already cocked,'' said the Rev.
<PERSON>Eugene Bryant</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> minister who performed missionary work in
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>. ``It was all in French. We were just watching.''
   Many people refused to give their names for fear of retaliation
by the new Haitian regime.
   ``I went there for two weeks. It was the scariest two weeks of
my life,'' said one woman passenger, declining to give her name.
``I thought I was going to get a break, but the plane ride was no
break.''
   Haiti has been beset by turmoil in recent weeks.
   A <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> coup by lower-ranking soldiers led to the ouster of
Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henry Namphy</PERSON>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> was installed as
president and the coup triggered a huge military uprising that led
to the ouster of military commanders loyal to <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and the
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family dictatorship that preceded him.

two centuries as a nation.;   "Today, the armed forces find themselves
obligated to assume the heavy responsibility to keep the ship of state
afloat," <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> said.;   "After seven months . . . of democratic experience,
the country once again finds itself a prey to the horrors of uncertainty. With
all Haitians . . . we will bring the ship to port.";   The takeover began with
mutinies at an army base and a police station <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Rebel elements
fired on <ORGANIZATION>Aristide</ORGANIZATION>'s private residence at daybreak and on his entourage as it
later headed to the <ORGANIZATION>National Palace.</ORGANIZATION>;   The soldiers later seized the palace
and captured <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>. His foreign minister, <PERSON>Jean-Robert Sabalat</PERSON>, said the
president was taken to army headquarters. Diplomatic sources said Venezuelan,
French and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials negotiated with the coup plotters to save the
president's life.;   A powerful sector of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s 7,000-member army long has
opposed the leftist policies of Aristide, a 38-year-old Roman Catholic priest
who drew much of his popularity from the impoverished masses of the nation of
6 million. The leaders in <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s coup attempt said <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> was interfering
in army affairs.;   At least 26 people were killed and 200 wounded as Aristide
loyalists battled soldiers. The sounds of gunfire continued late into the
night.;   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> condemns coup; The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> condemned the coup
and demanded <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>'s release. The <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> convened in late-night sessions.;   About 2,000 Haitian
residents of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> held a raucous rally outside the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> building.;   The
uprising occurred five days after <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> addressed the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>
in his first trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since becoming president of this
coup-prone <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation. He said at the time that he was certain <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> had
left the dark days of dictatorship behind.;   Among those killed when the
unrest first flared <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> was <PERSON>Sylvio Claude</PERSON>, an evangelical preacher
and two-time presidential candidate.;   <PERSON>Claude</PERSON>, 57, was set upon by a mob in
the southern provincial town of Cayes as he was leaving a political meeting
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Assailants burned him in the streets, according to Radio
Antilles, an independent station.;   Hours after word surfaced in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Little Haiti</LOCATION> section of Aristide's capture, protests broke out on city
streets, and demonstrators burned a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag, tires and other debris in
mounds in the street. A patrol car was set afire, police said.;   <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s
international airport closed <DATE>Monday</DATE> afternoon.;   At home during first attack;
Aristide had been at home with aides and a bodyguard at the time of the first
attack, the government said.;   <ORGANIZATION>Independent Radio Cacique</ORGANIZATION> said an armored
personnel carrier was attacked when it went to <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>'s home to take him to
the <ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION> from his residence in <LOCATION>La Plaine</LOCATION>, six miles from
Port-au-Prince.;   The trouble began <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with mutinies at an army
training camp at <ORGANIZATION>Freres</ORGANIZATION>, just outside <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, and at an army-run
police station in the downtown area of the capital.;   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in a
statement condemned the "outrageous attack against President Aristide by a
mutinous sector of the army.";   <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> had been scheduled to pay a call on
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> next week in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION>, said an official traveling with
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on a campaign trip in <LOCATION>New Orleans.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> has moved since the first
day of his administration to reform the notoriously corrupt army, historically
an agent of repression in <LOCATION>Haiti.</LOCATION>;   Upon assuming office, he replaced generals
from the <ORGANIZATION>Army High Command</ORGANIZATION> with younger officers more inclined toward
democratic reform, but he had not made the appointments permanent.;  
Dissident soldiers said <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> had been withholding permanent assignment to
ensure that the generals remained under his control.;   Bodies in the streets;
Dead bodies lay in the streets and slum areas ringing <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the
capital city of 1 million.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Critics Denounce Namphy's Revocation Of Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Critics said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>'s decision to discard the constitution approved 15
months ago demonstrates that the army has no intention of returning
the country to democracy.
   ``The army is sick of this talk of democracy. The truth is they
don't want elections,'' said <PERSON>Paul Latortue</PERSON>, a former senatorial
candidate in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> who lives in exile in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on state television that the existing
constitution included ``elements foreign to Haitian tradition'' and
was ``unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and
emotion.'' He said a new constitution would be written ``taking
Haitian reality into account.''
   ``We are experiencing a catastrophe,'' said <PERSON>Louis Roy</PERSON>, co-author
of the constitution and its most prominent defender. ``The entire
army and its commander-in-chief, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>, have committed perjury.
They swore allegiance to the constitution a year ago in spite of
the faults that they find in it now.''
   In a <DATE>June 19</DATE> coup, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> ousted President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, a
political science professor who was elected four months earlier and
is now in exile.
   Namphy ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> between the fall of dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude
Duvalier</PERSON> in <DATE>February 1986</DATE> and <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s inauguration <DATE>two years
later</DATE>. The military officer repeatedly pledged to respect the
constitution, approved by <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of Haitians in a <DATE>March 1987</DATE>
referendum.
   Among the guests invited to listen to <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>'s speech <DATE>Friday</DATE> at
his palace in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> were former presidential candidates
<PERSON>Gerard Phillipe-Auguste</PERSON>, who was <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s agriculture Minister,
and <PERSON>Gregoire Eugene</PERSON>, now <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s adviser on constitutional law.
   Also present were two former <ORGANIZATION>Duvalier</ORGANIZATION> aides, <PERSON>Claude Raymond</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Clovis Desinor</PERSON>, and the entire army High Command, including Col.
<PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON>, recently indicted in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> on charges of drug
trafficking.
   ``It was a comic and pathetic gathering <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at the
palace,'' said <PERSON>Jean-Claude Bajeux</PERSON>, a prominent opposition leader.
   ``A gang of dinosaurs have emerged from their caves to reassure
each other that their treasure would not be threatened by several
million human beings on the way to the polls to vote,'' said <PERSON>Bajeux</PERSON>.
   In <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was declared the winner of army-organized
elections boycotted by most Haitians.
   When asked to comment on <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s allegation that the
constitution was inspired by foreign ideas and was contrary to
Haitian tradition, <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON> said, ``He is saying returning exiles
bring undersirable ideas of change. I think <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> regretted the
decision to open the door to exiles after <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> left.''
Meanwhile, at the end of a four-day summit of <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Community</ORGANIZATION>
leaders in <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION>, Trinidad-Tobago Prime Minister <PERSON>A.N.R. Robinson</PERSON>
criticized the organization for not condemning <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>.
   ``I have no doubt whatsoever from the history of Gen. <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>
that he has no commitment to the democratic process,'' <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>
said.
   Streets were quiet in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and business
and public transportation functioned normally.
   ``It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of
rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which
nearly <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the population ... is vegetating,'' <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>
said in his speech.
   But he said his government would respect freedom of speech and
assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and political
parties.
   <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON> said <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>'s action pushes <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> even farther away
from democratic rule. ``The army and the Duvalierists never liked
the constitution. They want an authoritarian regime. I see the path
to democracy as blocked,'' he said.
   The army has directly or indirectly ruled this impoverished
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation for most of its 184-year history.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Former President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>
urged the world <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to shun the soldiers who threw him out of
office, but opposition politicians called him an opportunist and
said they were glad he was gone.
   One opposition leader suggested negotiations with Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri
Namphy</PERSON>, who proclaimed himself president on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   As night fell on a calm capital <DATE>late Tuesday</DATE>, there was concern
among relatives of some members of the <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> government who were
arrested during the coup.
   ``We only hope they come back as soon as possible,'' said
<PERSON>Francois Savain</PERSON>. His father, <PERSON>Roger Savain</PERSON>, was information minister
and <PERSON>Francois</PERSON>' brother, <PERSON>Roger Jr.</PERSON>, was a close friend of <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the two Savains, former <ORGANIZATION>Information Ministry</ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON>Rodney
Marcellus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean Narces Lescouflair</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> Cabinet chief
<PERSON>Lionel Desgranges</PERSON> were arrested. The source didn't know whether the
five remained in custody <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Capt. <PERSON>Isidor Pignon</PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION>Fort Dimanche</LOCATION> where political
prisoners are usually taken, angrily refused to tell <ORGANIZATION>The Associated
Press</ORGANIZATION> whether the <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> aides were there.
   Few other people in this impoverished city seemed upset by the
events that ended <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s 4-month-old civilian government and
brought back <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>, who had run the country for two years after
the Duvalier dictatorship ended.
   ``The message is clear: Haitians have been mocked for too long
by their governments. The people are not concerned because they
never accepted <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>. This has been an affair at the top,'' said
the Rev. <PERSON>Antoine Adrien</PERSON>, a liberal Roman Catholic priest and
advocate of democracy.
   A sociologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:
``Manigat by words alone wanted to maintain the illusion of
democracy. One puff of the army's bad breath blew it away.''
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would
maintain relations with the new government and work toward
democracy through diplomacy, not sanctions. ``There is no break in
the diplomatic relations; we're not contemplating it,'' spokeswoman
<PERSON>Phyllis Oakley</PERSON> said.
   Manigat is in the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, which shares the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>. He told reporters he had been
urging foreign governments and international organizations to
isolate the military government <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> set up.
   ``My government represented the only and final chance for
democracy,'' <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> said. ``The other democratic sectors have
understood that too late and it was their political mistake to
refuse the public support that would have strengthened my
government.''
   Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor,
called the new regime ``very fragile.'' He said the coup was the
result of corruption in the military.
   He said he did not know what role was played in the coup or
subsequent events by Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude Paul</PERSON>, who has been indicted
on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> always acted on his own,'' <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> said, adding that he
had faith in <LOCATION>Paul</LOCATION> as a loyal military man.
   Manigat sided with <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> last week by overruling <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>'s order
ending the colonel's command of the 700-man <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Battalion</ORGANIZATION>,
whose barracks is just behind the <ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   Manigat dismissed <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and confined him to his home, but loyal
officers freed him late <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Paul, however, was at <ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>'s side <DATE>Monday</DATE> when the 55-year-old
general waved an Uzi submachine gun on television and announced his
military government. Namphy restored <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> to his command and the
7,000-man Haitian army appears united.
   No injuries or deaths have been reported in the coup. Sporadic
shooting was heard in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> overnight but no casualties
were reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. Gunfire at night is part of a tradition of
intimidation in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   Opposition political leaders boycotted the <DATE>Jan. 17</DATE> election,
which <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> won with the army's help. Most expressed the belief
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that a new chance for democracy might follow his ouster.
   In <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, where he lives in self-exile, <PERSON>Louis Dejoie II</PERSON>
urged a dialogue between <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and politicians.
   ``The only way to put the country back on track is to have free,
honest elections,'' said <PERSON>Dejoie</PERSON>, one of four leading presidential
candidates who refused to enter the <DATE>Jan. 17</DATE> election. ``<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was
not viable nationally or internationally'' and ``tried to
double-cross the army the way he double-crossed the democratic
forces.''
   ``<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> has no popularity,'' he said. ``I will wait and see
what the military government offers the people before judging them.
They can't govern forever with bayonets.''
   <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, the world's first black republic, won independence from
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1804</DATE> and has experienced dozens of coups and autocratic
regimes.
   Namphy led a military-civilian junta that ran <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> after
President <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>, ending the
29-year dictatorship founded by his father, <PERSON>Francois</PERSON> ``Papa Doc''
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>. Namphy turned the government over to <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> last <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> said he overthrew <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> because the president betrayed
democracy and the constitution. <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and his army have made clear
they consider a good civilian government to be one that lets the
military keep its traditional role as the power behind the throne.

Lt-Gen <PERSON>Raoul Cedras</PERSON>, head of the military government in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, resigned his
post yesterday and announced he was leaving the country, thus facilitating
the return of the man he overthrew in a bloody <DATE>1991</DATE> coup, President
<PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>'s supporters immediately took to the streets of the capital,
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, to celebrate, forcing the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military to protect <PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON>
and his family, as well as Gen <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duperval</PERSON>, who was appointed
interim head of the Haitian military yesterday.
At a public ceremony on the steps of military headquarters, <LOCATION>Gen Cedras</LOCATION>
attempted to leave power in a dignified manner, handing over nominal control
of the armed forces and police to <PERSON>Gen Duperval</PERSON>, his second-in-command, as a
40-piece military band played the battle anthem of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s armed forces.
But thousands of Aristide supporters turned the ceremony into a mockery,
singing anti-military songs to the band's tune. Chants of 'Aristide is
coming back, <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> is going to eat sewage', and the noise of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military
helicopters overhead, drowned out much of the departing general's speech.
Gen <PERSON>Hugh Shelton</PERSON>, commander of the 17,000 US personnel on the ground in
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, oversaw the ceremony, escorting <PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON> to the podium while <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
troops kept screaming supporters of President Aristide at bay.
'I choose to leave the country because my presence could be a pretext for
unjustifiable acts,' <PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON> said.
There was no immediate announcement of which country would give him refuge,
but Ms <PERSON>Madeleine Albright</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> ambassador at the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION>, said <TIME>last night</TIME> the
general would move to an 'undisclosed South American country'. A <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> diplomat
ruled out <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION>.
US officials also said they believed <PERSON>Gen Duperval</PERSON> would relinquish power to
President <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>'s nominee to head the military when the president made
his expected return on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Five Haitian colonels met the president
last week in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to discuss civilian control of the military.
The resignation followed two days of meetings with US officials, including
<PERSON>Mr William Perry</PERSON>, defence secretary, and <PERSON>Gen Shelton</PERSON>, in which <PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON>'s
safety after he had stepped down and ways to deal improve the maintenance of
law and order in the country were discussed.
The general's authority over the military, and the military's reign of
terror over the population, had been steadily declining over the past week
as it became apparent that he had no future as commander.
Pro-Aristide demonstrations throughout the country have become widespread,
often with deadly consequences for the president's supporters.
On <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the town of <ORGANIZATION>St Marc</ORGANIZATION>, about 75km north of the capital, at least
10 people died and scores were injured as a bus ploughed into a pro-Aristide
rally. At the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, a similar incident occurred near <LOCATION>Miragone</LOCATION>, south of
the capital, killing 12.
Over the next few days, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> forces will be under pressure to protect both
pro-Aristide rallies, sure to increase as the population prepares for the
return of its president, and members of the Haitian military, which is in
disarray but under unusual orders not to fire on Haitians.
Gen <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> took power on <DATE>September 30 1991</DATE>, when his two leading associates
 -Brig-Gen <PERSON>Philippe Biamby</PERSON> and the police chief Lt-Col <PERSON>Michel Francois</PERSON> -
took President <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> from his home and sent him into exile, first in
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and then in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ A church leader today accused the
military government of undermining democratic reforms by ordering a
wave of arrests, beatings and the exile of political opponents.
   ``They have made rubbish of the constitution,'' said <PERSON>Roman
Catholic Bishop Willy Romelus</PERSON> on the church-run <ORGANIZATION>Radio Soleil</ORGANIZATION>. He
encouraged his listeners, however, to keep up their spirits.
   Of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s six main radio stations, only <ORGANIZATION>Radio Soleil</ORGANIZATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Protestant Radio Lumiere</ORGANIZATION> and the state-run <ORGANIZATION>National Radio</ORGANIZATION> were
broadcasting news <TIME>this morning</TIME> under a state of siege declared by
military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. Radio is the main source of
news in the country.
   In its toughest crackdown on the opposition since taking power
in a <DATE>September 1988</DATE> soldiers' revolt, the government arrested and
forced into exile seven prominent political activists during the
weekend. Dozens of others were arrested but were thought to have
been released.
   Port-au-Prince, the bustling capital of more than 1 million
people, remained calm. Shops and schools opened as usual and
traffic was normal.
   Critics said the crackdown indicates Avril intends to renege on
a promise to hold free elections in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   At a news conference <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, newly exiled activist
<PERSON>Hubert de Ronceray</PERSON> said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> promised the elections only ``to get
help from foreign countries.''
   ``There's no possibility of a democracy with <PERSON>Mr. Avril</PERSON>. He's a
dictator,'' said the conservative leader.
   The state of siege was declared after an army colonel, his wife
and servants were killed <DATE>Friday</DATE> by unidentified gunmen just 100
yards from de Ronceray's home.
   De Ronceray, deported <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, claimed he was the intended
victim. Other opposition activists speculated <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> was using the
killings as a pretext to derail the transition to democracy he
promised after coming to power in a <DATE>September 1988</DATE> soldiers' revolt.
   De Ronceray, 65, said that after his arrest he was kicked,
clubbed with guns, and had a cigarette jammed in his eye. The eye
was red as he spoke to reporters.
   The other exiles were also beaten before they were deported,
according to the activists and other sources.
   The government offered no comment on those reports.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> condemned the state of siege
and arrests and urged the Haitian government to reiterate its
commitment to free elections. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> suspended <MONEY>$60
million</MONEY> in aid to the impoverished country after <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s last
attempt at democratic elections was thwarted by armed thugs aided
by soldiers who massacred voters in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Louis Roy</PERSON>, a prominent civic leader and an author of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s
<DATE>1987</DATE> constitution, ``was carrying a small suitcase, kissed the
ground two times and mounted the stairway to exile,'' a relative
told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   Roy, 74, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Haitian Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, flew aboard a
commercial flight to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. ``I was hit in both ears and full in
the face in front of the duty officer at the police headquarters,''
he said upon arrival.
   <PERSON>Max Bourjolly</PERSON>, second-in-command of the Haitian Communist party,
was arrested at his home and exiled, apparently to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, said
party leader <PERSON>Rene Theodore</PERSON>.
   Family members and sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the others exiled <DATE>Sunday</DATE> were <PERSON>Aby Brun</PERSON> of the center-left
<ORGANIZATION>Congress for Democratic Movement</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sylvain Jolibois</PERSON> of the small
radical Jean-Jacques <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Group</ORGANIZATION>, and radical activists <PERSON>Michel
Legros</PERSON> and <PERSON>Max Montreuil</PERSON>.
   They said <PERSON>Brun</PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and the others to the
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, which shares the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of Hispaniola
with <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   Popular radical leader <PERSON>Sylvio Claude</PERSON> of the Haitian Christian
Democratic Party and <PERSON>Gerard Philippe-Auguste</PERSON>, head of the Movement
to Organize the Country party, went into hiding.
   De Ronceray and <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> are not new to exile. They spent several
years in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> during the rule of the late dictator Francois
``Papa Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>, whose son continued the 29-year family
dynasty until fleeing to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> after a popular uprising.
   In announcing the state of siege <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the government
suspended a law forbidding forced exile and renewed an entry visa
requirement for Haitians returning from abroad.
   De Ronceray claimed the colonel killed near his house, <PERSON>Andre
Neptune</PERSON>, was shot by attackers sent out to kill him. He said he had
changed his own schedule because of a warning Avril wanted him
``destroyed,'' and the officer was slain while in a car similar to
his.
   Human rights activist <PERSON>Jean-Claude Bajeux</PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, said he suspected either army rivals or
the drug mafia were behind the slayings.
   ``The coincidence is significant. For this killing to happen now
and they immediately use it to round up (opposition leaders), it's
a typically Duvalierist scheme.''
   He was referring to the network of Duvalier supporters left in
this former French colony, where <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the 5 million people
live in poverty.
   <PERSON>Paul Latortue</PERSON>, a Haitian economist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Puerto
Rico</ORGANIZATION>, said the weekend crackdown indicates Avril ``has allied
himself with the Duvalierists,'' whom he accused of killing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   ``The government will now either show its teeth and demonstrate
there'll be no elections, or have elections without the
opposition's participation, with controlled candidates,'' <PERSON>Latortue</PERSON>
said.
   Avril rose to power in a revolt that ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri
Namphy</PERSON>, who oversaw the <DATE>November 1987</DATE> elections that were canceled
when at least 34 voters were shot and hacked to death by thugs in
collusion with soldiers.
   Less than two months later, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> staged army-run elections
that were widely boycotted by voters and denounced by most foreign
observers as fraudulent. Several months later, he took back control
of the government.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ The military government of Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that loyal troops crushed a mutiny
after two days of fighting and that most of the rebel soldiers were
captured.
   ``The soldiers of the Presidential Guard presently occupy the
<LOCATION>Dessalines Barracks</LOCATION>,'' said a statement issued by the army
adjutant, Gen. <PERSON>Andre Jean-Pierre</PERSON>, and read on state-run radio.
   It said most of the rebels in the barracks were captured but
some fled and left behind their uniforms and weapons.
   The communique did not say how many rebels were captured or had
escaped. The normal force of the <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Barracks</ORGANIZATION> is 750
soldiers.
   Loyal soldiers shelled the barracks <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and resumed the
artillery bombardment <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. There also were firefights
in the area of the barracks, which adjoin the <ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION> in
the center of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Casualty figures for <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s fighting were not available.
   A source close to the government said 17 soldiers, all thought
to be rebels, were killed in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s fighting. Haitians monitoring
military radio broadcasts said reports indicated the Presidential
Guard suffered 15 casualties but there was no breakdown of dead and
wounded.
   The state hospital said at least one civilian was killed <DATE>Friday</DATE>
and unconfirmed reports put the civilian death toll at three.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Susan Clyde</PERSON> said it was believed two
Presidential Guard soldiers were killed <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``The casualty figures apparently are going to be lower than the
level of noise might have indicated,'' she said.
   Port-au-Prince remained calm after the government claimed
victory.
   Its communique said the captured rebels implicated drug
traffickers in efforts to overthrow Avril that began <DATE>April 2</DATE> with
an attempted coup. It said an anti-government plot was organized by
Haitian exiles formerly associated with the ousted regime of
dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>.
   The statement also claimed the mastermind of the revolt was
former Interior Minister <PERSON>Roger Lafontant</PERSON>, who is now living in the
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   The statement was issued at <TIME>5:15 p.m. EDT after several hours</TIME> of
heavy shelling of the barracks. Shooting had tapered off shortly
before the announcement.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said earlier that a hole was blown in the roof of
the gleaming white <ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>, which serves as the
presidential residence.
   It was believed the damage was caused by a mortar shell fired
about a mile away by rebels who fled the barracks <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and
took over a Roman Catholic church compound.
   Diplomats had said <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> it appeared Avril's troops had
gained the upper hand and driven the rebels from the compound. But
fierce firefights broke out again <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Reports <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> said members of the Leopards commando
unit who had been involved in the mutiny were seen removing their
uniforms. Witnesses said they abandoned their base in the capital's
suburbs.
   There were no reports of fighting elsewhere in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   The rebels accuse Avril's government, which took power in a
military coup six months ago, of favoritism toward the Presidential
Guard in pay and living conditions. They also said the government
was arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-supported
crackdown on drugs and corruption.
   In the attempted coup on <DATE>April 2</DATE>, rebel soldiers seized <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>
and took him to the airport for deportation but he was rescued by
loyalist soldiers.
   Avril went on television <DATE>Monday</DATE> to claim the rebellion had been
put down. However, rebel soldiers continued to roam the capital,
clashing with government forces.
   Avril, 50, came to power in <DATE>September 1988</DATE> in a coup by
non-commissioned officers that ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>. The
officers demanded democratic reform and an end to state-sponsored
violence.
   Namphy had deposed a short-lived civilian government. He had
earlier led a junta that took over after <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> was
swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in
<DATE>February 1986</DATE>.
   The government blamed the attempted coup <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> on
people opposed to both democratic change and a ``campaign against
drug trafficking, contraband and corruption.''
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has made the drug crackdown a condition for
restoring <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> in aid that it suspended after thugs
massacred 34 voters in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>, thwarting <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s first free
elections in more than 30 years.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ The government said it foiled an
attempt <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to overthrow Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials said loyal troops apparently rescued Avril as he was
being driven away to be deported.
   Avril told the nation early <DATE>Monday</DATE> in a televised address that
rebel soldiers ``blinded by their exorbitant ambition'' attempted
to overthrow his government and appealed to Haitians to support his
leadership.
   He did not provide details of attempted coup or say how it was
foiled. There were no reports of casualties.
   A government communique read earlier over state-run television
said ``certain officers besieged'' the presidential palace ``and
attempted to overthrow the government.''
   Presidential guardsmen told journalists <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> was taken captive
at his mansion in <LOCATION>Canape Verte</LOCATION>, a wealthy neighborhood in the hills
overlooking the capital, as he returned home from a party early
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Sources said four military officers had tried to overthrow
<PERSON>Avril</PERSON>, who assumed power six months ago in this impoverished
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> country's second coup in less than a year.
   In his 10-minute speech, <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> said: ``At a time when the
government is doing its utmost to ensure democratic progress and
economic recovery, once again the stability of the Haitian nation
was threatened.''
   He was flanked by at least a dozen soldiers dressed in battle
gear, including Sgt. Major <PERSON>Joseph Heubreux</PERSON>, who led the coup by
noncommissioned officers who put Avril in power last <DATE>September</DATE>.
   ``On the night of <DATE>April 1</DATE> and 2, some members of the armed
forces blinded by their exorbitant ambitions attempted to overthrow
the government which I assumed <DATE>Sept. 17 1988</DATE> as commander and chief
of the armed forces and president of the military government,''
<PERSON>Avril</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Susan Clyde</PERSON> said earlier that reports
indicated the coup attempt occurred about <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> and that <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> was
detained for a time.
   ``But it appears that when he was being taken to the airport to
be deported ... members of the presidential guard arrived at the
airport and escorted him back to the palace to be president
again,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   She said the attempted coup was ``totally bloodless.''
   However, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Liberte</ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified soldier as
<ORGANIZATION>Port-au-Prince</ORGANIZATION> would be ``set on fire'' unless the government
released one of the alleged coup leaders, identified by the soldier
as Lt. Col. <PERSON>Himmler Rebu</PERSON>, commander of the Leopards battalion
commando unit.
   Military sources said Rebu was under military guard at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   Loyal soldiers told journalists that <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Marie-Ange</PERSON>,
and her mother were taken captive with <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> but released a couple
hours later.
   They also said two of Avril's brothers and Interior Minister
Col. <PERSON>Acedius St. Louis</PERSON> and his son were seized by the rebels.
   Avril's son, brothers and <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> and his son reportedly were
freed after two tanks rolled into the Leopards' barracks and
negotiated their release <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. There were no reports of
casualties.
   Initial reports had said the army commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Herard
Abraham</PERSON>, was among the coup leaders. But later accounts said that
was not correct and that the plot collapsed when <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> refused
the rebels' offer of the presidency.
   Abraham was foreign minister under the government of Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>, who Avril replaced.
   The attempt came four days after the discharge of four top army
officers accused of drug trafficking.
   Unconfirmed reports said four army officers planned the coup,
including Gen. <PERSON>Guy Francois</PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION>Dessalines</LOCATION> barracks
in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, which is the base of the most feared unit in
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s 7,000-man army. The reports said all four officers had been
detained, but there was no confirmation.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Dennis Harter</PERSON> said the
situation in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> ``remains fluid.''
   <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s international airport was closed and large numbers of
soldiers were at the palace and on the streets, which were calm.
   Gunfire was heard twice near the palace in the pre-dawn hours.
Several hours later there was another spurt of gunfire in the same
area.
   Five soldiers of the Presidential Guard arrived at independent
radio station Liberte at <TIME>11:45 a.m.</TIME> and read a statement denying
Avril was ousted.
   ``There has not been any visible reaction from the people,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Clyde</PERSON> said. ``The streets are very calm. People are going about
their business as usual.''
   <PERSON>Richard Melton</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> deputy assistant secretary of state for
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> affairs, visited <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> <DATE>last Monday</DATE> and told Avril
resumption of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid depended in part on <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s efforts to crack
down on the narcotics trade.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, four top army officers accunvolvement in
the drug trade were discharged.
ay, a conservative political leader, said those
dismissals mighriggered the coup attempt.
   <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s last civ president, was elected in
violence-marred elections in <DATE>January</DATE> replaced a junta led
by <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> that had governed since dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>
fled to exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> 9-year family
dictatorship.
   Namphy then overthrew <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> in a coup <DATE>June 20, 1988</DATE>. On <DATE>Sept.
17</DATE>, <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> came to power in a coup.
   Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION> partly restored constitutional rights
suspended in <DATE>1987</DATE>. He also appointed a mostly civilian Cabinet and
agreed to the establit of an electoral council to prepare for
free elections.
   But there was widssatisfaction over the pace of his
reforms, and human rights groups accused the of
continuing repression.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Rebellious soldiers wound down
their purge of repressive army commanders <DATE>Thursday</DATE> but continued
hunting henchmen of the deposed Duvalier dynasty, independent radio
reports said.
   The new military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> appealed
for an end to the lawlessness that began over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, when a
coup toppled Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> and sent him into exile in the
neighboring <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   A military communique carried on state television said: ``Formal
instructions have been passed on to the forces of order to arrest
all individuals committing acts of brigandage and pillaging.'' It
said violators would be ``duly tried and punished.''
   The army announced retirements or discharges of 29 officers,
most of whom were removed by rebellious soldiers.
   Radio Metropole, meanwhile, said staff at the army general
headquarters issued a 16-point declaration demanding elections,
higher pay, medical benefits, subsidized housing and commissary
privileges.
   It appeared the unit was speaking for itself, although their
demands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by enlisted men who
carried out the coup <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Radio <ORGANIZATION>Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported that soldiers hunted for members of
the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>, who have long terrorized the population.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> were the dreaded private army of <PERSON>Francois
Duvalier</PERSON>'s regime and that of his son, <PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON>. The 29-year
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> dictatorship ended when the younger <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> was forced
into exile in <DATE>February 1986</DATE>.
   Avril, the former army adjutant, assumed the presidency early
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Since then, rank-and-file soldiers nationwide have revolted
against their commanders, depositing them handcuffed outside army
headquarters in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the capital.
   Radio <ORGANIZATION>Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported the ouster <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of two more
commanders _ in southwestern <ORGANIZATION>Cotes de Fer</ORGANIZATION> and the northern port of
<ORGANIZATION>St. Marc</ORGANIZATION>. That brought to 21 the number of commanders who served
under <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> known to have been forcibly removed.
   Capt. <PERSON>Ernst Ravix</PERSON>, commander of the 40-man <ORGANIZATION>St. Marc</ORGANIZATION> barracks and
reputed Macoutes sympathizer, was ousted one day after soldiers
fired on demonstrators there, killing a 12-year-old boy and
wounding three people. The <ORGANIZATION>Cotes de Fer</ORGANIZATION> commander was not
identified.
   Radio <PERSON>Haiti Inter</PERSON> said that after <PERSON>Ravix</PERSON> was arrested and brought
to <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, soldiers launched a hunt for <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>.
   The High Command on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> announced the retirement of
26 officers and the discharge of three others, most of them already
forced from command.
   <PERSON>Gerard Desmangles</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, was removed by
underlings. Tele-Haiti said the asssistant minister of immigration
also was removed by lower-ranking personnel, but his name was not
reported.
   <PERSON>Bernard Degraff</PERSON>, the government's assistant director of
information, said removal of unpopular officers was proceeding
peacefully.
   ``The ouster movement should cease very soon,'' <PERSON>Degraff</PERSON> said.
``Loss of control ... is still possible, but I have seen an
improvement in the situation.''
   Sporadic nighttime gunfire continued and there were reports of
more reprisal attacks, but for the most part the capital was calm
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Namphy's country retreat in Foret des Pins outside
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> was among the houses reported pillaged.
   ``What is happening now could mean the possible elimination of
Macoutism,'' <PERSON>Jean-Claude Bajeux</PERSON>, a leading human rights activist
and a center-left opposition leader.
   ``Now we can construct democracy. Soldiers are asking for
justice, law and order under the <DATE>1987</DATE> constitution.''
   Namphy suspended the constitution, which was approved by <PERCENT>99
percent</PERCENT> of the voters in a referendum in <DATE>March 1987</DATE>.
   Avril said democracy was ``the ultimate goal of the military.''
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> he named a new Cabinet of 11 civilians and one military
man, but has never mentioned restoration of the constitution or
elections.
   <PERSON>Dr. Louis Roy</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Haitian Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and co-author of
the <DATE>1987</DATE> constitution, said he thought the political situation
remained dangerously unsettled.
   He said the purge of Macoutes under way now should have happened
when <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> was overthrown.
   ``Macoutes were not punished then; they were encouraged by the
government,'' he said.
   Namphy headed a junta that promised a transition to democracy.
However, independently run general elections <DATE>Nov. 29</DATE> were thwarted
when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at least 33 people at
polling stations.
   <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, a civilian, was elected president in <DATE>January</DATE> in
military-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential
candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. Namphy ousted
him in <DATE>June</DATE>.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ The opposition said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> it
believes the military will yield power to a civilian-led
government, but it threatened a general strike if ousted ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril stays in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   At least 24 people had been killed in the seven days of protests
and clashes that have left the government of this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation
in turmoil. Haiti remained under interim military control <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
the day after <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION>'s resignation.
   Soldiers firing from a speeding truck killed five people <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
radio report said. Elsewhere in the capital, news photographers
said they saw police officers fatally shoot a young passer-by on a
street and then prevent witnesses from trying to save his life.
   The state hospital reported treating 100 people, mostly for
gunshot wounds, over the past two days.
   Opposition politicians, meanwhile, sought guarantees from a
caretaker administration that there would be a transition to
democratic rule with early elections for a civilian government.
   <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, has been
ruled mainly by force of arms since it gained independence from
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1804</DATE>, and it would be the first time in its history that
the civilian opposition has ruled.
   Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Herard Abraham</PERSON>, the army chief of staff, assumed
control after Avril stepped down <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. He promised to yield
power within 72 hours to a panel led by a civilian president that
would organize elections for <DATE>October</DATE>.
   Avril, 52, was said to be at his home in suburban
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> might leave the country in a matter of days.
   <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of 11 opposition parties and one
civic group that was influential in <LOCATION>Avril</LOCATION>'s downfall, had
threatened an ``unlimited total paralysis of the country'' unless
Avril resigned by <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   At a news conference <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the group issued a statement
expressing confidence that <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> would give up power.
   However, it called Avril a ``public danger'' and said it would
not lift the strike call until the ousted leader left <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>.
   ``The French and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassies say the matter of <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION>'s
departure is settled, but only popular pressure will force him
out,'' said business leader <PERSON>Antoine Izmery</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION> member.
   Avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly
involving the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and French embassies, the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>
and opposition political parties.
   He had been in power 18 months. His resignation marked the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation's fifth change of government since <DATE>February 1986</DATE>,
when <PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON> ``Baby Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
and ended the 29-year dictatorship of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family.
   Thousands of people streamed into the streets <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to
celebrate <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>'s downfall, but scattered violence soon broke out.
Roving gangs of youths reportedly ransacked the homes of at least
three prominent sympathizers of the Avril and <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> regimes.
   Early <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, soldiers in a speeding pickup truck opened fire on
pedestrians in downtown <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, killing five people, and
then removed the bodies, independent <ORGANIZATION>Radio Metropole</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Later, the radio station said <ORGANIZATION>Army Maj. Renaud St. Bert</ORGANIZATION> was
killed in a lottery booth in the suburb of Delmas. The report gave
no details of the killing but said soldiers fired into the air to
disperse a crowd there.
   Four people reportedly were killed <DATE>last week</DATE> in clashes with
security forces. Radio reports <DATE>Saturday</DATE> said soldiers killed eight
youths who attacked the home of a special police agent in suburban
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Opposition politicians complained of the violence in the
capital. They called for neighborhood self-defense groups to
protect people from marauding gunmen.
   The opposition was at odds with the army over who would be named
provisional president.
   The army's choice was <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Gilbert Austin</PERSON>,
63, who said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> he expected to be appointed. Austin was
appointed chief justice by Avril last year after serving as the
general's justice minister.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION> rejected him <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. It believes he has been
too much under <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION>'s influence. The group has favored the court's
vice president, <PERSON>Gabriel Volcy</PERSON>, but he is 74 and ill.
   The new president is to appoint a Cabinet approved by an
11-member advisory council made up of representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>Roman
Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>, civic, human rights and opposition groups, and one
member of the army.
   <ORGANIZATION>United Assembly</ORGANIZATION> did not name an alternative choice for
president. But conservative politician <PERSON>Gerard Philippe-Auguste</PERSON>
said: ``Our first priority is a new provisional head of state. We
don't have a government yet. When we do, we will tackle the problem
of elections.''
   Speculation that Avril might be on his way out began growing
<DATE>Monday</DATE> after a soldier killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently
accidentally during a demonstration. The killing set off violent
anti-government protests across the country.
   Avril came to power in <DATE>September 1988</DATE> in a coup by
non-commissioned officers. He promised to hand over power to a
civilian government after elections in <DATE>October</DATE>. But critics said a
brutal crackdown in <DATE>January</DATE> on government critics made clear that
Avril intended instead to make himself a dictator.
   After <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> went into exile in <DATE>1986</DATE>, he was
replaced by Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>'s army chief of staff
and <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor.
   A first election attempt in <DATE>November 1987</DATE> was called off after
thugs killed at least 34 voters. In <DATE>January 1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, a
university professor, was elected president, but most opposition
leaders refused to participate. Five months later, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> deposed
him.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> left <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>
today aboard a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> transport plane, two days after the
military ruler was driven from power by widespread unrest.
   The deposed leader and his family arrived this morning at
<ORGANIZATION>Homestead Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> said. An <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Lt. Col.
<PERSON>Darrell Hayes</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> was being driven to <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>,
after which he was ``on his own.''
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> refused comment on
whether the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had granted Avril asylum but said: ``We
are hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> and are
encouraging that effort.''
   After Avril left, the opposition coalition known as the <ORGANIZATION>Unity
Assembly</ORGANIZATION> reportedly picked <PERSON>Ertha Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON>, the only woman
on the 12-member <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, as its choice for provisional
president.
   The army's choice is <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Gilbert Austin</PERSON>, but
he has been rejected by the coalition as too close to <LOCATION>Avril</LOCATION>. The
deadline for announcing a provisional president is <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, when
Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Herard Abraham</PERSON>, who took over from <LOCATION>Avril</LOCATION>, is to transfer
power to a civilian.
   The new president will serve until an election is held.
   Thousands of people milled about <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the capital,
but the mood was more one of disbelief than celebration.
   ``He's gone, he's gone,'' people were heard saying.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest and staunch
critic of the military government, said residents should remain
alert to the possibility of army reprisals.
   ``We can smile, but we can't laugh yet,'' <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION>Radio
Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION>'s departure.
   At least 24 people were killed in seven days of protests and
clashes that have left this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation without a leader and
in turmoil. Most of the victims have been civilians slain by
soldiers or police.
   ``The people have shown how much they love democracy by dying
for it,'' <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> said earlier.
   A leading member of the <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jean-Claude Roy</PERSON>, said
<PERSON>Ms. Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON> was the coalition's choice for provisional
president. Radio reports said <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> _ under the constitution next
in line for the presidency _ resigned from the court to make way
for <PERSON>Ms. Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON>.
   A widower, <PERSON>Ms. Pascal-Trouillot</PERSON> was <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s first woman judge
and is an author. Her best-known book, written in <DATE>1973</DATE>, was ``The
Judicial Status of Haitian Women in Social Legislation.''
   If she is chosen as provisional president she would be the first
woman to hold the post in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s history.
   Earlier, residents of the capital retreated behind shuttered
windows after sundown <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and the streets were deserted.
Soldiers in pickup trucks drove around the city and gunshots were
heard occasionally.
   ``I'm afraid for my husband and I fear the <ORGANIZATION>Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> will come
out of the walls,'' said the wife of a well-known politician,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> were the
feared secret police of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family, which ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> for
29 years.
   Numbering about 30,000, the <LOCATION>Macoutes</LOCATION> were disbanded after
<PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>February 1986</DATE>.
Later, several hundred were integrated into the army and police as
special agents.
   Tele-Haiti, a private television station, urged viewers to stay
indoors <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> because ``there are gangs of marauding gunmen
in the streets'' and politicians and religious leaders urged
citizens to form neighborhood defense groups.
   The state hospital said it treated about 100 people, mostly for
gunshot wounds, over the weekend. Radio reports said soldiers
firing from a speeding truck killed five pedestrians on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   In another incident, witnesses said police looking for the
killers of <ORGANIZATION>Maj. Renaud St. Bert</ORGANIZATION> stopped a passer-by, shot him four
times and sat under a tree for more than an hour watching him die.
   Avril was brought to power in a <DATE>September 1988</DATE> revolt by
soldiers who professed disdain for political killings and other
abuses by the previous military ruler, Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>.
   Namphy had ruled the country _ among the poorest in the
hemisphere _ for most of the 2{ years since the popular uprising
that ousted <PERSON>Jeane-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>.
   This <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation of 6 million people has been ruled mainly
by the military since it gained independence from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1804</DATE>,
and opposition leaders said they did not trust Avril to oversee
presidential elections he promised for the <DATE>fall</DATE>. In a <DATE>January</DATE>
crackdown, the government jailed and beat dozens of dissidents,
exiling seven.
   Protests against <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION> broke out one week ago after a soldier
killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently by accident.
   Avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly
involving the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and French embassies, the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>
and opposition political parties.
   In <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s last attempt at elections, overseen by <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> in
<DATE>November 1987</DATE>, voting was canceled after thugs backed by soldiers
killed at least 34 voters.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Opposition leaders said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
they were puzzled by President <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>'s abrupt dismissal of
his military chief, but they applauded the demonstration of
civilian authority over the armed forces.
   There were reports that the fired military commander, Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>, was under house arrest.
   <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> was president of the three-man junta that ruled <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>
from the time dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> fled to exile in <DATE>1986</DATE>
until <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was sworn in <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE> following an election in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   A close associate of <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> said the general is under house
arrest at his home in <LOCATION>Bon Repos</LOCATION>, 15 miles north of Port-au_Prince.
   The associate, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> that ``some close friends went to see him
(<ORGANIZATION>Namphy</ORGANIZATION>) today. They were turned back. Nobody is allowed in or out.
The house is heavily guarded.''
   Youths chanting, ``Down with <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>, long live the army!'' put
up tire barracades <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on the main east-west highway at
Petit Goave, about 30 miles west of the capital of <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Soldiers dismantled the barricades <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and arrested one of
about 20 youths who began demonstrating in the town, <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti
Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Several rounds of gunfire were heard early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> from the
army barracks of <LOCATION>Petionville</LOCATION>, a suburb of the capital. Radio <ORGANIZATION>Haiti
Inter</ORGANIZATION> reported an explosion near the Champ de Mars Plaza, adjacent
to the presidential palace.
   There was no other information immediately available on the
gunshots or explosion.
   Businesses opened as usual in the capital, and streets were calm.
   ``Who knows what is really happening?'' asked Rev. <PERSON>Antoine
Adrien</PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest and co-leader of the civic group
Honor and Respect for the Constitution.
   ``We were told <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the army and the executive were on
the best of terms, and now this bombshell,'' he said. ``We can only
rejoice if ... the military has submitted to civilian authority.''
   A presidential communique <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> said <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> had retired
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> and two other members of the general staff, Brig. <PERSON>Gens</PERSON>. <PERSON>Carl
Michel Nicolas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wilthan Lherisson</PERSON>. Manigat promoted Col. <PERSON>Morton
Gousse</PERSON> to general and named him provisional military commander.
   The communique said the generals had defied <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s decision
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to rescind an order by <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> transferring and retiring
several high-ranking officers.
   Among those <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> attempted to transfer was Col. <PERSON>Jean-Claude
Paul</PERSON>, who was indicted for drug trafficking earlier this year by a
grand jury in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   Manigat, apparently siding with <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, said the order was
unconstitutional because it was done without consulting him.
   ``The dismissal of Namphy seems to have enforced <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>'s
authority,'' said <PERSON>Sylvio Claude</PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Christian
Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>. ``But, politically, we must wait and see whether
<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> can control the army he has apparently betrayed.''
   Paul commands the 700-man <ORGANIZATION>Dessalines Barracks</ORGANIZATION>, whose soldiers
were blamed for widespread violence against voters that left more
than 30 people dead and forced cancellation of independently
administered general elections <DATE>Nov. 29</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> was declared the winner of <DATE>Jan. 17</DATE> elections organized
by the junta. Manigat was considered the army's candidate in the
election.
   ``It is too soon to say whether there has been a reinforcement
of civilian authority over the military because in any case <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>
must still make concessions to certain sectors of the army,'' said
<PERSON>Victor Benoit</PERSON>, co-leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION>Congress of Democratic
Forces</ORGANIZATION>.
   It was unclear why <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> ordered the transfer and whether the
order represented a power struggle within the army or was linked to
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> charges against <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, who has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration asked <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> to get rid of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>. But
<PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>, it seems, has gotten rid of <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Claude</PERSON> said.
   Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON>Gerard Latortue</PERSON> called the removal ``a
strictly internal matter.''

<LEADPARA>  Amid reports of random attacks by soldiers, a high-level delegation from the
Organization of American States was expected to arrive here today to demand
that leaders of Monday's military coup step aside and restore President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.;   Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the coup leader,
said in a radio address that he would receive the OAS mission. But he
defiantly vowed not to step aside.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Western diplomats in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> estimated that as many as 350 civilians had died
in the insurrection.;   <LOCATION>Radio Lumiere</LOCATION>, one of several independent radio
stations that has managed to periodically broadcast from inside <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, said 30
to 40 supporters of Aristide were massacred <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in a
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> slum.;   On the eve of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation's arrival, the
normally teeming capital of 1 million was a virtual ghost town <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for
the fourth straight working day.;   Businesses closed; A few people wandered
the streets and soldiers stopped cars at checkpoints, searching for weapons.
Businesses were shut down, either out of fear or as part of a protest boycott
against <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>'s ouster.;   The airport remained closed to all but a few
charter flights of diplomats and journalists. There was no indication of when
commercial air service would be restored or commercial activity resumed.;   On
the fourth day since the army's takeover, diplomats on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> depicted
<PERSON>Cedras</PERSON> as being largely the captive of the ordinary soldiers who were
patrolling streets, commandeering cars, and threatening citizens.;   Diplomats
said there was no coherent chain of command in the country to rein in the
soldiers who were set against <ORGANIZATION>Aristide</ORGANIZATION>'s return.;   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where he
lobbied for support on Capitol Hill before flying to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to seek help
from the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON> referred to the coup leaders as "a
small gang trying to kill democracy." He was to meet with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> at
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> this morning.;   Ready for evacuation; Meanwhile, hundreds of
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops remained poised to evacuate thousands of Americans if the
situation worsens in this impoverished <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation. At least 8,000
Americans have registered with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>. Thousands more -- many of
them missionaries -- are believed to be scattered throughout countryside.;  
For the time being, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> appeared to be ruling out military force
in favor of giving diplomatic pressure a chance to restore the 38-year-old
Aristide to the presidency.;   Secretary of State <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON> and other
diplomats attending an emergency 10-hour meeting late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> of the
34-nation <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> hinted that force might be used if Aristide was
not reinstated. But the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration played down that possibility on
Thursday.;   "We have absolutely no interest in using <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces to in any
way interfere with the internal situation in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>," <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Pete
Williams</PERSON> said.;    <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution; In its emergency session, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> adopted
an 11-point resolution urging its members to diplomatically and economically
isolate <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>. Many nations, including the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, have suspended all
aid to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries.;   The resolution stopped
short of endorsing military action but said "all additional measures" would be
taken if peaceful efforts fail to restore Aristide.;   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Venezuelan Embassy</ORGANIZATION> confirmed a report that its army had been placed on alert
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> and told to prepare for a multinational military operation if
diplomatic efforts fail.  </TEXT>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Soldiers fired on student
demonstrators <DATE>Friday</DATE> and wounded at least three, radio accounts and
witnesses said, and reports surfaced that negotiations had begun
for <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s military ruler to resign.
   State TV <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> had met with <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and church
leaders to negotiate peace but had no intention of leaving power
unless he is defeated in elections _ `not through disorder.''
   The protest by about 250 students came on the fourth day of
anti-government protests over the army's killing of an 11-year-old
girl.
   Political sources said opposition parties were negotiating with
Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> and the army over his possible resignation
as leader of this impoverished <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation. ``Finally, after
four years of struggle, there is a real possibility to realize the
demands of <DATE>Feb. 7, 1986</DATE>'' _ the date dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON>
fled into exile after a popular uprising, said <PERSON>Jean-Claude Bajeux</PERSON>,
a prominent political and human rights activist.
   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was not involved in the talks.
   ``We are keeping in touch with them but we are in no way
involved with negotiations. We are not putting together a deal. It
is up to Haitians to decide if there's to be a change in
government,'' the diplomat said.
   A coalition of 11 opposition parties issued a statement <DATE>Friday</DATE>
calling on Haitians to stage ``an unlimited total paralysis of the
country'' if Avril does not step down by <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   They said they proposed that <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> Vice President
<PERSON>Gabriel Volcy</PERSON> act as provisional leader until elections are held.
The parties have repeatedly said they want Avril replaced for now
with a <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> judge.
   Avril, who came to power in a soldiers' revolt in <DATE>September
1988</DATE>, has said he would be willing to step down if most Haitians
wanted him to, although he predicted that would lead to
``revolution and chaos.''
   But a high-ranking government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> has no intention of resigning
soon.
   ``Avril is ready to make concessions, but a hasty departure is
out of the question,'' he said.
   Late <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a commentator on state <ORGANIZATION>National Television</ORGANIZATION> said,
``The president has said he would leave if the will of the people
demand it, but the people's will can only be expressed through
elections and not through disorder.
   ``The president has taken all the measures necessary to provide
for free elections,'' the commentator said on the <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> news,
adding that <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> has met with members of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> high command and
the <PERSON>Roman Catholic</PERSON> and Protestant church to negotiate peace.
   Demonstrations broke out <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the outskirts of
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> and continued until sundown. Protesters put up
barricades of burning tires and soldiers fired in the air to
disperse crowds.
   The capital was deserted <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> but gunfire could be heard
downtown.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Margaret Tutwiler</PERSON>
said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Port-Au-Prince</LOCATION> received an unconfirmed
report that one of those injured <DATE>Friday</DATE> was a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen.
   Radio <PERSON>Haiti Inter</PERSON>, an independent station, said at least three
people were wounded in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s shooting at a state university
campus a half-mile from the <ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, hundreds of protesters, some hurling rocks,
blocked main roads in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, bringing the capital of 1
million to a near-standstill with schools, stores and government
offices closed.
   Heavily armed soldiers milled around the entrance of the white
<ORGANIZATION>National Palace</ORGANIZATION>. Two anti-aircraft guns stood on the front lawn,
facing Champ de Mars Plaza.
   On <PERSON>John Brown Avenue</PERSON>, a main thoroughfare, soldiers and police
were seen climbing out of truck and clubbing youths standing by a
burning tire barricade.
   Radio stations said demonstrations also occurred <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the
northern port of <LOCATION>Cap-Haitien</LOCATION>, where soldiers fired tear gas to
scatter about 4,000 protesters, and in the western port of
<LOCATION>Gonaives</LOCATION>, where 500 students marched peacefully wearing black
armbands.
   Three people were killed <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, including a soldier beaten to
death by a mob, and at least 15 injured in countrywide
demonstrations, according to reports from radio stations, witnesses
and a doctor at the state hospital in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   The protests were triggered by the killing <DATE>Monday</DATE> of schoolgirl
<PERSON>Rosaline Vaval</PERSON> by a soldier in a passing car in Petit Goave, about
30 miles west of the capital. Similar protests over the killing of
three high school students in <DATE>1985</DATE> led to <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>'s downfall in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Shooting broke out in <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> after soldiers and
police began a sweep of the city, dispersing crowds and arresting
protesters, radio stations said.
   <PERSON>Jerry Timmins</PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
said he saw soldiers pull up in a truck and fire on about 250
protesters at the state university's <ORGANIZATION>Human Sciences College</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said some soldiers fired into the air but others fired at
body level. The soldiers beat at least a dozen students, although
their demonstration had been peaceful, <PERSON>Timmins</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Timmins</PERSON> said a soldier fired at him, narrowly missing his head.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, about 3,000 people marched through <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>
in a symbolic funeral for <ORGANIZATION>Miss Vaval</ORGANIZATION>.
   About 10,000 people attended her burial <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in Petit Goave.
That night, a mob rampaged through the town, burning an army
outpost, ransacking a government building and the mayor's house,
reported Radio Lumiere, a Protestant station.
   Mobs also were reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Gonaives</LOCATION>, a resident
said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Tutwiler</PERSON> said that while the airport was reported open, some
airlines have temporarily suspended service to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, which
occupies the western third of Hispaniola island.

FT  20 SEP 94 / US troops fly in to control Haiti: Signs of co-operation by
junta raise hopes for success of occupation mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US troops yesterday spread out unopposed around <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the Haitian
capital, after completing the first stage of a mission President <PERSON>Bill
Clinton</PERSON> defined as 'limited in time and scope'.
By <TIME>last night</TIME> 3,000 troops were expected to have arrived. Signs that <PERSON>Lt Gen
Raoul Cedras</PERSON>, the republic's military ruler, was co-operating with US
military commanders in ensuring an uncontested <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> landing fuelled hopes in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for the success of the operation to restore democracy.
Retired general <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON>, previous head of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> joint chiefs of staff
and a key figure in the negotiating mission led by former <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> president <PERSON>Jimmy
Carter</PERSON>, said this was early evidence that the military junta was prepared to
live up to the letter of the agreement.
The deal between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> delegation and the Haitian military rulers was
reached at the last minute on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night local time</TIME>, as the first US
airborne invasion troops were on their way to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> from their bases. It
stipulated that the members of the junta would quit no later than <DATE>October 15</DATE>
and paved the way for what it is hoped will be a peaceful intervention in
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> forces.
The first US troops from the <ORGANIZATION>Tenth Mountain Division</ORGANIZATION> landed by helicopter
from the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower. US officials said 15,000 troops,
the maximum deployment envisaged, were expected to be in position by the end
of the week.
A succession of helicopters, followed by fixed-wing aircraft, swung low over
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> bay and skimmed over the tree tops into the civilian airport
north of the city.
Gen <PERSON>Hugh Shelton</PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> armed forces in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, landed to
discuss with <PERSON>Gen Cedras</PERSON> the details of co-operation between the occupation
force and the Haitian military. He emerged from the meeting saying that 'the
Haitians are our friends'.
The general's emphasis on co-operation was echoed by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> helicopters which
circled over the city with loudspeakers blaring in <LOCATION>Creole</LOCATION>, 'This is not an
invasion, we are here to work with the Haitian army. This is not an
invasion'.
In <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, the streets emptied during the day as people retreated to
their homes amid widespread anxiety about the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> operation. However, by
<TIME>early evening</TIME> thousands of local people gathered at the port, lured by the
military spectacle and emboldened by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> presence. The crowd chanted
calls for the return of Fr <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON>, ousted as president in
the <DATE>1991</DATE> coup. They were chased away by Haitian police armed with clubs and
semi-automatic weapons.
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> stressed that the force's immediate mission was
'to make sure the leaders keep their word'. The president and members of the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> delegation acknowledged that the agreement placed the junta under no
obligation to leave the island.
This has caused open concern among advisers to <PERSON>Mr Aristide</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr Randall
Robinson</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> human rights activist whose hunger strike this year
influenced <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> policies, said the agreement was 'terribly flawed'.
Senator <PERSON>Robert Dole</PERSON>, the Republican leader, questioned why General <PERSON>Cedras</PERSON>
was 'allowed to stick around until <DATE>October 15</DATE>, maybe stay in the country and
maybe run for president next year'.
But <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Carter</PERSON> pointed out at a joint press conference that
the Governor's <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION> agreement of <DATE>July last year</DATE>, also designed to ensure
the restoration of democratically elected government but never honoured by
the junta, would not have forced them into exile.
'I think they probably will leave - and should leave,' <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said, 'but
this still has to be worked out by all the actors in the Haitian problem.'
The agreement was greeted with huge relief in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where a fully
fledged invasion was widely opposed.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Rank-and-file soldiers who helped
oust Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON> and more than 50 of his military
commanders promised <DATE>Monday</DATE> to protect the rights of the poor.
   ``We are not only defending the enlisted men, we are speaking
for all the poor people,'' an unidentified soldier was quoted as
telling <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION> at army general headquarters in downtown
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   ``People have the right to demonstrate, to express what's in
their hearts, as long as they do it peacefully,'' he said, adding
that soldiers would guarantee the safety of demonstrators.
   Another soldier said the 50 or more superior officers who have
been ousted by their troops since the <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> uprising against
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> will not be allowed to return to the army.
   ``We won't allow it,'' he said, adding that soldiers are still
demanding the ouster of more officers because of their unpopularity
or ties to the 29-year <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> family dictatorship.
   The soldiers were not identified by the radio station.
   Members of <ORGANIZATION>Namphy's Presidential Guard</ORGANIZATION>, led by 27-year-old Sgt.
<PERSON>Joseph Heubreux</PERSON>, said they ousted <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> because they were
``sickened'' by his alleged collusion with thugs of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>
regime who massacred 13 parishioners and wounded more than 77
others people during a Mass on <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE>.
   The soldiers appointed Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> as the new
president.
   Also <DATE>Monday</DATE>, soldiers ordered the dismissal of the director of
the general post office, <PERSON>Jean Malette</PERSON>, after employees went on
strike demanding his ouster. Malette was replaced by <PERSON>Jean-Claude
Jean-Jacques</PERSON>, a managerial level employee.
   Employees of state agencies, following the example of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s
7,000 soldiers, have ousted the unpopular directors of the state
flour mill, telephone company and water authority.
   Jacques <PERSON>Armand Charles</PERSON>, the new state prosecutor, was sworn in
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Palace of Justice</ORGANIZATION>, replacing Namphy-appointee
<PERSON>Mireille Zamor Pluviose</PERSON>.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Haiti Inter and Radio Metropole</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
former members of the <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION>, the private army under the
<PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> regime, killed three peasants who were protesting their
presence in <LOCATION>Verrette</LOCATION>, a village 60 miles north of the capital.
   The alleged <ORGANIZATION>Tonton Macoutes</ORGANIZATION> were accompanied by local police
Chief <PERSON>Dumarsais Charles</PERSON>, the radio stations reported.
   The regime begun by dictator <PERSON>Francois</PERSON> ``Papa Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> in
<DATE>1957</DATE> ended when his son, <PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON>, fled into exile in <DATE>February
1986</DATE>. <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> took over as head of a three-man junta until <PERSON>Leslie
Manigat</PERSON> was elected president last <DATE>January</DATE> in balloting widely
thought to be fraudulent.
   Namphy ousted <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON> in a coup last <DATE>June</DATE>.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> (AP) _ Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Prosper
Avril</PERSON>, who rose to power 18 months ago in a revolt by pro-democracy
soldiers, resigned <DATE>Saturday</DATE> during a popular uprising against his
military regime.
   The embattled Haitian leader turned over power to Maj. Gen.
<PERSON>Herard Abraham</PERSON>, the army chief of staff, who said he would transfer
rule to a civilian-led government within 72 hours. Abraham said the
interim government would prepare for elections but did not give a
date.
   Diplomat sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>
would leave the country within two days. There was no word on where
he would go and how he would get there.
   Immediately after <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>'s resignation, members of a coalition of
opposition parties disagreed over the provisions for <ORGANIZATION>Abraham</ORGANIZATION>'s rule
and there also was discord over who would lead the civilian
government. The opposition members later met with <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> and it
was not immediately known whether they reached agreement. They
scheduled a news conference for <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
   It was <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s fifth change of government since <DATE>February 1986</DATE>,
when dictator <PERSON>Jean-Claude</PERSON> ``Baby Doc'' <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> fled the
impoverished <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation into exile in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   Avril's departure followed five days of mass protests. His
opponents said they no longer trusted him to usher in fair
elections that had been scheduled for <DATE>October</DATE>.
   Thousands of residents poured into the streets of the capital to
celebrate. Youths erected flaming tire barricades at major
intersections, and black smoke filled the sky over the capital.
   The television station Tele-Haiti said teen-agers shouted
slogans outside the house of a special police agent in the slum
suburb of <LOCATION>Martissant</LOCATION>, and that the agent and backers ``wildly''
opened fire, killing six. Radio <PERSON>Metropole</PERSON> said seven were killed.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the capital,
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>, and there were power outages in some neighborhoods.
   Independent Radio <PERSON>Metropole</PERSON> said the houses of some <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> and
Avril sympathizers had been ransacked and their cars burned. On
radio talk shows, callers demanded that Avril be thrown out of the
country.
   Abraham, in uniform, appeared on state television at <TIME>3:05 p.m.
EST</TIME> to announce <ORGANIZATION>Avril</ORGANIZATION>'s resignation.
   ``In light of the resignation of the military government of Lt.
Gen. <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON>, the armed forces of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> accept the heavy
task,'' <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> said in French.
   ``The mission is clear and the objective is precise: to
re-establish peace and order within 72 hours so, in conformity with
the constitution, a provisional government can organize elections.''
   Abraham and the army want to give the interim presidency to
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Gilbert Austin</PERSON>, who had been appointed by
Avril as chief justice last year after serving as the general's
justice minister.
   However, the opposition coalition _ called the <ORGANIZATION>Unity Assembly _</ORGANIZATION>
said he would be a puppet of the army and that it wanted him to
resign as president of the high court.
   ``It is the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> who, according to the
constitution, should be president,'' <PERSON>Austin</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   There had been speculation that 51-year-old Avril wanted to
return to his old job as army chief of staff. However, Tele-Haiti,
an independent television station, said he was retiring from the
army.
   Radio <PERSON>Metropole</PERSON> said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON> left the palace <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>
and was at his private residence in the wealthy suburb of Canape
Vert, on the hills overlooking <LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION>.
   Conservative leader <PERSON>Hubert De Ronceray</PERSON>, one of seven prominent
politicians forced into exile in a government crackdown in <DATE>January</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Avril</PERSON>'s resignation was ``an encouraging first step.''
   ``But <PERSON>Prosper Avril</PERSON> is still a public danger if he stays in
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>,'' said De Ronceray, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   Another exile, <PERSON>Louis Roy</PERSON>, principal author of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1987</DATE>
constitution, said from the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION> that the
Haitian people had ``risen and overthrown a regime which had tried
to destroy its desire for a democratic form of government.''
   But, he added: ``It remains to be seen whether the army deserves
the confidence which has been placed in it.''
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration welcomed the promise by
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s new leader to set the stage for national elections by
turning over power within 72 hours.
   The statement said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> long has called for
improved human rights in <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> and added: ``We obviously hope the
latest developments contribute to a realization of this objective.''
   Tele-Haiti said the interim president would be advised by an
11-member council representing civic groups, churches, the army and
eight provincial districts.
   Earlier, the opposition coalition had said it wanted <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON>Gabriel Volcy</PERSON> as the new provisional head. But
<PERSON>Antoine Izmery</PERSON>, a prominent businessman who belongs to the <ORGANIZATION>Unity
Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, said Volcy refused.
   He said ``it's an all-out war'' if Abraham remains in power for
72 hours.
   However, other political leaders were more conciliatory.
   <PERSON>Mark Bazin</PERSON>, an economist who leads a center-right party said he
was ``reassured about <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON>'s good faith to play according to the
rules.'' He did not elaborate.
   Avril came to power in <DATE>September 1988</DATE> in a coup by
non-commissioned officers. He promised to hand over power to a
civilian government after elections this <DATE>fall</DATE>. But critics said a
brutal crackdown in <DATE>January</DATE> on government critics made clear that
Avril intended to renege on that promise and make himself a
dictator.
   Speculation Avril might be on his way out began growing <DATE>Monday</DATE>
after a soldier killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently accidentally
during a demonstration. The killing set off a spate of violent
anti-government protests across the country that resulted in the
deaths of at least three people.
   <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, the poorest country in the hemisphere, has been ruled by
force of arms for most of its history since independence from
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>1804</DATE>.
   After <PERSON>Jean-Claude Duvalier</PERSON> went into exile in <DATE>1986</DATE>, he was
replaced by Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Henri Namphy</PERSON>, <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON>'s army chief of staff.
He headed a three-man provisional junta that was to rule until
elections for a new government.
   The first election attempt in <DATE>November 1987</DATE> was called off hours
into the vote after thugs killed at least 34 voters and confiscated
ballots. In <DATE>January 1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Leslie Manigat</PERSON>, a university professor,
was elected president. Few Haitians voted, and most opposition
leaders refused to participate.
   Five months later, <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> entered the picture again. His troops
deposed <PERSON>Manigat</PERSON>, who had tried to fire <PERSON>Namphy</PERSON>. Avril replaced
<PERSON>Namphy</PERSON> in the coup of <DATE>September 1988</DATE>.
