<TEXT>
   Who says the only good bug is a dead bug? One of the best bugs to
have in your garden is the ladybug. Each day, it feeds on many
``bad'' insects, such as aphids, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> potato beetles, grape
rootworms, alfalfa weevils, plus others. This helps keep things in
natural balance.
   The black-spotted red ladybird, better known as ladybug, is a
voracious, predatory beetle described as one the most beneficial on
earth.
   Millions of them have been released on croplands, their hearty
appetites helping to reduce aphid populations _ with biological pest
control.
   <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> scientists note the advantages of biological
controls: There is no environmental damage; the pests do not develop
resistance to their predators as they do to chemicals, and a small
initial investment results in a safe, permanent control method.
   In <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, some years ago, park officials released
300,000 ladybugs to fight plant pests. Gardeners in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, scattered more than 2.5 mlllion ladybugs to protect plants. In
<LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Perkins</PERSON> invited thousands of ladybugs to
an aphid feast in their rose test garden.
   National Geographic magazine has reported 4,300 known species of
ladybugs, or which <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> has 370. Remember tne children's
chant: ``Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home, your house is on fire,
your children will burn.'' This was a plea by English farmers
concerned for the safety of ladybugs during the annual burning of
hop fields.
   Given a chance, an adult egg-laying ladybug may consume up to 200
aphids a day. One larva may eat between 200 and 300 during its
development.
   National Geographic noted that ladybugs were put to work by man
in the late 1800s when a species, Rodolia cardinalis, was imported
into <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to combat the cottony cushion scale
insect, saving the citrus industry in <DATE>two years</DATE> at a cost of only
<MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>.
   Ladybugs are sold by the pint, quart and gallon; a half-pint
means about 4,000 ladybugs.
   A major concern is in getting the tiny migratory insects not to
fly away home. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> studies indicate that <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> wing off
after release. Since they don't fly at night, a late afternoon or
early evening release will encourage at least an overnight stay.
   The beetles are very mobile. When there only a few aphids around,
a <ORGANIZATION>Cornell</ORGANIZATION> researcher reported, they migrate, searching for other
areas of food, scouting apple crops, oats, winter wheat, sugar beets
and beans. The researchers imported the predacious European
seven-spotted lady beetle to help protect potato and alfalfa fields.
   There is no correlation between the number of spots and the
beetle's age. The number of spots on a beetle's back is
characteristic of its species, not its age.
   Ladybugs are but one example of millions of harmless insects,
<ORGANIZATION>Cornell</ORGANIZATION> noted. In fact, fewer than <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> of all insects are
pests and those are ``often controlled by natural enemies.'' The
researchers recommend that gardeners and homeowners be certain that
insects are actually doing damage before they take action.
   Insects belong in a garden. They are natural and often harmless,
if not beneficial. Spray only if you detect damage. Beneficial
insects such as ladybugs ot all kinds and green lacewings should be
protected, entomologists say. By learning to identify their eggs and
larvae, we may save time, money, energy and the environment.
   Many ladybugs have been released in recent years to devour aphids
feeding on upstate <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> alfalfa, peaches and potatoes.
   If you see an unattractive, dark insect with orange, blue and
black patches and a deeply segmented body covered with spines, don't
squash it. It may be an immatore lady beetle, hungry and looking for
a meal.
   One catalog (<ORGANIZATION>Burpee</ORGANIZATION>) offers a half-pint for <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY>, a quart for
<MONEY>$17.95</MONEY>, recommending they be released in small batches.

DEMAND FOR COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED INSECT PREDATORS HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER AS 
FARMERS SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PESTICIDES.

<P>
The tools are simple; the task is anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologist <PERSON>Don Norlund</PERSON> is holed up in a bug-filled <LOCATION>Weslaco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, laboratory, 
armed with nothing but cardboard grids and swaths of filmy organza cloth, 
trying mightily to drag the insect industry into the <DATE>20th Century</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the industry is not using neat technology to produce beneficial 
insects," said <PERSON>Norlund</PERSON>, a research entomologist for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. "It is not automated to any extent whatsoever. It's a lot of 
manual labor." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to aldicarb, a pesticide that contaminated watermelons in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and 
alar, a chemical growth regulator that frightened consumers in <DATE>1989</DATE>, an 
increasing number of farmers are searching for non-chemical methods of pest 
control, and breeders of beneficial bugs throughout <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> are having a 
field day. 
</P>
<P>
Demand is outstripping supply for the first time in the industry's short life. 
And nowhere is the bug boom more evident than in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which has a corner 
on the creepy-crawly market. 
</P>
<P>
But it's no simple task to breed beneficial bugs -- like green lacewings -- 
that eat bad bugs -- such as aphids. The process is low tech and labor 
intensive. There are no quality-control standards. Only one in three 
insectaries actually rears the bugs that it sells. 
</P>
<P>
And while interest in so-called biological control -- pesticide-free methods of 
growing crops -- is at an all-time high, some say the infant insect industry is 
not up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Mass rearing methods have to be developed and maintained and quality control 
programs must be worked up," said <PERSON>Marjorie Hoy</PERSON>, professor of entomology at the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. "The industry is going to have to police 
itself . . . or people will go back to chemicals. We don't want this to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Enter <PERSON>Don Norlund</PERSON>, the bug world's <ORGANIZATION>Henry Ford</ORGANIZATION> wanna-be. For the past year, 
<ORGANIZATION>Norlund</ORGANIZATION> has been trying to find a way to mass produce green lacewings, a 
predatory insect that will attack nearly any soft-bodied bug that crosses its 
path. 
</P>
<P>
His project is the nation's first large-scale attempt to automate the bug 
business, to "gear the system up to a commercial level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, feeding the bugs is extremely inefficient. Because they are 
cannibalistic, they must be kept apart in half-inch square compartments in 
small cardboard grids, he said. The grid has no top or bottom, but is covered 
with strips of organza, a thin, stiff fabric commonly used for women's hats and 
bridal gowns. 
</P>
<P>
To feed the lacewings, strips of flannel are soaked in synthetic liquid food 
and laid underneath the grid, and the bugs suck the liquid out through the 
organza. The problem is that up to <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of the food stays in the flannel and is 
wasted. So Norlund and his research group are trying to create a diet for the 
lacewings that resembles insect eggs -- prepackaged, intact, cost-effective and 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Harvesting lacewing eggs for sale is also a problem. The bugs secrete a 
substance that forms tiny "stalks" on which they lay their eggs, presumably to 
keep them off the ground and away from ants, which will eat the pale green 
ovals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to design a cage that . . . would allow you to mechanically 
harvest the eggs off their little stalks," he said. "Right now, it's being done 
by hand. We brush the eggs with a little piece of wadded nylon cloth. It breaks 
the stalks of lots of them, but it also squashes lots. We're looking at ways of 
creating a hot wire to burn the stalk below the eggs and suck the eggs up with 
a vacuum cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
When you figure that it takes up to 20,000 lacewings per acre per season to 
bring aphids, whiteflies, scale and mealybugs under control, you can see why 
technology is so important to the insect industry. 
</P>
<P>
Without it, bug watchers say, insectaries will never be able to supply the 
number of insects necessary to make biological control a viable alternative to 
chemical pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Rincon-Vitova <ORGANIZATION>Insectaries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION> is cooperating with Norlund in 
his attempt to automate the industry. Arguably the oldest, largest and most 
established insectary in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, Rincon-Vitova is also the most 
efficient producer of the dozen species of insects that it rears and sells. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are some of the best producers of beneficial insects in the 
country," <PERSON>Norlund</PERSON> said, "but it's still not the type of technology that you 
need to produce the numbers of beneficials that it will require to replace a 
significant amount of insecticide." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's enough to give Rincon-Vitova customers in all 50 states and six 
foreign countries and to generate more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in sales for the company 
annually -- a good chunk of a market that's estimated at <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> worldwide. 
That figure would be larger, but for the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, where 
biological control is a government, rather than a private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Food and Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> list 68 
suppliers of beneficial organisms in 19 states and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is atop 
the insect heap, with 29 of those enterprises. <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is next with five. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is a pretty progressive state," said <PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rincon-Vitova</PERSON>'s 
vice president for marketing and communications. "There isn't a farmer here who 
doesn't know what biological control is. But there are a lot of places in the 
country where they don't have an inkling, the middle-aged farmers who started 
during the chemical era when pesticides were wonder drugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bug Shortages 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the past several years, grocery shoppers have clamored for 
pesticide-free produce like never before, and many farmers have responded by 
kicking their chemical habits and buying beneficial bugs from insectaries such 
as Rincon-Vitova. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had a predatory mite shortage because of demand from strawberry 
growers," <PERSON>Blehm</PERSON> said. "We've also had lacewing shortages. We had to quit taking 
orders in <DATE>June</DATE>, <DATE>July</DATE> and late <DATE>May</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
A lack of ladybugs has also been a problem since <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Blehm</PERSON> said, but only in 
part because of consumer demand. Ladybugs -- the aphid-eating Hippodamia 
convergens -- do not reproduce well enough on a synthetic diet to make them 
economical to rear. 
</P>
<P>
So suppliers depend on roving bands of bug-pickers who trek through the High 
Sierra in search of the orange-and-black insects. Hippodamia convergens 
hibernate through the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> winters in inches-thick beds at the base of 
pine trees, hidden beneath layers of dead leaves and pine needles. Harvesters 
scoop them up and sell them to suppliers such as Rincon-Vitova and <ORGANIZATION>Fountain</ORGANIZATION>'s 
<ORGANIZATION>Sierra Bug Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which is based in Rough and Ready, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladybugs are getting so scarce, you can't get enough to keep people happy," 
said <PERSON>H. H. Fountain</PERSON>, the company's owner. "From <DATE>1974</DATE> to <DATE>1977</DATE>, we sold three to 
four times as many bugs as we do now. There were a lot more bugs to be had to 
begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Forest fires, logging and urban encroachment are the major culprits in the 
ladybug shortage, <ORGANIZATION>Fountain</ORGANIZATION> said. "Loggers tear the beds up completely to where 
the bugs won't come back," he mourned. "Forest fires will burn them out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Needed 
</P>
<P>
And then there's research support -- or the lack thereof. An estimated <MONEY>$450 
million</MONEY> in mostly private funding is spent each year on research and 
development for chemical pesticides, according to <PERSON>Kenneth Cook</PERSON>, director of a 
Washington-based environmental research group called the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Research 
Economics</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> spends only about <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> each year on 
biological control research. Concern is so great that a recent <ORGANIZATION>National Academy 
of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> study called for an additional <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> annually to be spent on 
research into alternative methods of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"Biological control has been seriously neglected," <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> said. "The <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> 
is an optimistic number. The potential has not nearly been exploited. When you 
look at pesticides, which are ranked by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> as 
one of the great health risks, it's really ludicrous that we're spending as 
little as we are on biological control." 
</P>
<P>
Hoy of <ORGANIZATION>UC Berkeley</ORGANIZATION> has spent years breeding an improved strain of predatory 
mites -- beneficial bugs that clear fields of pest mites. While she has shared 
the better bugs with commercial insectaries, she said there is far too little 
of that give and take. As a result, <PERSON>Hoy</PERSON> said, it's tough to get new bugs from 
the lab to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, you have to convince someone that it's going to work and that 
it's worth their while to learn how to use it and mass rear and sell it," she 
said. "The transfer of information from researcher to consumer is really 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Adding such problems as the ladybug shortage and the dearth of research support 
to the sheer drudgery of insect rearing, makes it easy to see why there aren't 
more producing insectaries. For not only must insect breeders rear beneficial 
insects, they often must rear the pests, too, to give the beneficials something 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising," <PERSON>Blehm</PERSON> said. "Probably <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of the time, effort, labor and 
resources goes to rearing host insects. We could get rid of <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of our space if 
we didn't have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
It's not unlike feeding humans, he said, whereby it takes expanses such as 
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> to sustain an island such as <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. Rincon-Vitova sells 
fly parasites, so it has to breed common houseflies. The company sells 
lacewings, so it has to breed a moth called sitotroga, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a reliable source for insects," <PERSON>Blehm</PERSON> said, "we'd get out of 
production and go entirely into retail and consulting. That's the neat part of 
the business. The growing part is the drudgery. But at this point in time, we 
haven't found anyone as reliable as we are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 THE LADYBUG 
</P>
<P>
Also called ladybird, it was introduced in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the late 19th Century 
to help save the fruit crop from a scale infestation. Since <DATE>1987</DATE>, the bugs have 
been growing scarce as habitats and breeding grounds disappear. 
</P>
<P>
2 DIET 
</P>
<P>
Feeds chiefly on aphids 
</P>
<P>
and scale insects. Does not 
</P>
<P>
reproduce well on a synthetic diet. 
</P>
<P>
3 THE FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
A small round beetle, usually bright red or yellow with black, red, white or 
yellow spots. Belongs to the order Coleoptera and make up the family 
Coccinellidae. There are about 150 species. 
</P>
<P>
4 LIFE CYCLE 
</P>
<P>
Ladybugs hibernate through the winter by crawling under pine needles and 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRYPTOLAEMUS 
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Mealybug Destroyer." An Australian import and member of the 
ladybug family, adults are black with orange head and tail. 
</P>
<P>
PREDATORY MITES 
</P>
<P>
Beneficial varieties feed on pest mites, consuming between 5 and 20 mites -- or 
their eggs -- a day. Adults are orange with a pear-shaped body. 
</P>
<P>
GREEN LACEWING 
</P>
<P>
A voracious predator that feeds on virtually any soft-bodied insect. Adults are 
a delicate green and about three-quarters of an inch long.

<HEAD>Medfly War Killing Beneficial Bugs, Gardeners Battling to Save
Blossoms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Bartje in 19th graf cq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ladybugs, honey bees and crickets are
dropping like flies in Medfly-infested regions of <LOCATION>Southern
California</LOCATION> soaked in pesticide, leaving gardeners to battle aphids
thriving with their natural enemies gone.
   ``It's gross. It's sickening,'' said <LOCATION>San Gabriel Valley</LOCATION>
homeowner <PERSON>Peggy Watson</PERSON>, whose orange trees are covered with aphids.
   Frustrated gardeners are making a bee line for pesticide shelves
at nurseries and garden centers, where there has been a run on <MONEY>$4</MONEY>
tubes containing 1,000 ladybugs.
   ``We have people calling us up asking to reserve ladybugs,''
said <PERSON>Henrick Mar</PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION>San Gabriel Nursery</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pesticides sprayed by helicopters were intended to rid the
region of the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> fruit fly.
   The Medfly, thought to enter the country in illegally imported
fruit, threatens part of the state's <MONEY>$16 billion</MONEY> a year farm
economy because it feeds on and lays eggs in more than 200
varieties of cash crops.
   Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> there was no alternative to
spraying. He said it would continue despite vocal protests and
attempts by municipalities to stop what they view as a potential
health menace.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> is pursuing what is a
time-tested method of eradicating the Medfly,'' <PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON> told
reporters. ``We cannot give up on this. We have to eradicate it.''
   <PERSON>Deukmejian</PERSON> said if eradication efforts fail there will be higher
food prices, quarantines on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> fruit by foreign
governments, loss of jobs and even placement of maggot-infested
fruit on supermarket shelves.
   The blossom-devouring aphid has flourished because the pesticide
malathion has killed off its predators _ ladybugs, lacewings and
tiny wasps. They have been all but eliminated within the nearly 400
square miles of quarantine and spray zones.
   Wild honeybees, which pollinate fruit trees, also have fallen
victim to malathion spraying. ``It's as if they drop dead in
mid-flight,'' said <PERSON>Watson</PERSON>.
   Medfly spraying also has robbed <DATE>spring</DATE> of one of its traditional
sounds: the chirping of crickets.
   Aphids, leaf-scales and whiteflies survive the sprayings because
they live close to petals or beneath leaves, shielding them from
the pesticide droplets.
   ``Malathion spraying causes an imbalance,'' said <PERSON>Lester Ehler</PERSON>,
an entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>. He said
seven or eight sprays over an urban area is enough to kill off
beneficial insects.
   The aphid, enjoying a backyard garden feast without reprisal,
leaves disfigured rosebuds, wilted orchids and mold-coated leaves.
   ``There are aphids on my violets, aphids covering my herbs. It's
horrifying,'' said <PERSON>Marty Asolas</PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION>Bellflower</LOCATION>. ``I have just
decided not to plant anything else because I can't bear to see my
flowers attacked.''
   The aphid infestation was expected by state officials.
   ``We knew this was going to happen. But it is infinitely
preferable to what the Medfly can do to the state,'' said <PERSON>Robert
Dowell</PERSON>, senior economic entomologist for the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of
Food and Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>.
   Aphids have become a hot topic among members of the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Rose
Society</ORGANIZATION>, said the organization's president <PERSON>Bartje Miller</PERSON>. But
members also blame prime aphid breeding weather _ a dry winter
followed by warm <DATE>spring</DATE> showers.
   ``It's a whole combination of factors. I think <ORGANIZATION>Mother Nature</ORGANIZATION> is
just throwing us a curve,'' said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, who is also chairwoman of
<LOCATION>Wrigley Gardens</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   The aphids are ``the worse I've seen in the eight years I've
been here,'' said <PERSON>Clair G. Martin III</PERSON>, curator of roses at the
<ORGANIZATION>Huntington Library</ORGANIZATION>, Art Collections and <ORGANIZATION>Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San
Marino</LOCATION>.
   It could take up to a year or longer after malathion spraying
ends for gardens to become home again to beneficial insects. ``We
don't know what the long term effects are on plant life,'' <PERSON>Ehler</PERSON>
said.
   Entomologists advise gardeners to control aphids and other pests
by hand-washing leaves with soap and water. Using more pesticide
will only prolong the time it takes beneficial bugs to return and
could burn leaves.
   Malathion spraying in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> began in force last
<DATE>summer</DATE> and was recently ordered over a wide area of <LOCATION>Riverside
County</LOCATION> that includes a commercial citrus grove.

   It's a bug-eat-bug world for <PERSON>Jack Blehm</PERSON>
and son.
   Jack and <PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON> breed good insects to eat bad insects at
<PERSON>Rincon Vitova</PERSON>, one of a group of 15 ``insectaria'' nationwide. Every
day, <PERSON>Rincon</PERSON> produces more than 80 million voracious critters from
ladybugs to wasps.
   Business at <ORGANIZATION>Rincon Vitova</ORGANIZATION> has tripled in the past five years as
farmers concerned about the effects of pesticides are turning to
natural alternatives.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE> alone, the Blehms say, they supplied <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>
worth of natural predators to customers across three continents.
   The 15 insectaria have sales totaling <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> annually, the
Blehms estimate.
   Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, plus back
yard farmers.
   Some colleges and universities are adding classes on integrated
pest management _ ways of holding down troublesome pests while
minimizing the use of pesticides. The <ORGANIZATION>Association of Applied Insect
Ecologists</ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, is producing a video that shows farmers
how to work with beneficial insects.
   ``This is the future,'' added <PERSON>Ken Hagen</PERSON>, a professor of
entomology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. ``There is a
great need. The farmers are desperate.''
   State agriculture officials estimate less than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION>'s growers use the method. Controlling pests with
beneficial insects takes longer. And because pesticides kill good
bugs along with bad, farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying
while waiting for the good bugs to do their duty.
   ``The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith,''
<PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON> said. ``He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's
used to a quick knockdown.
   ``With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before
you see a difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is
that his crop is contaminated with bugs.''
   Rincon Vitova sells 15 species including beetles, mites and
parasitic wasps that help control flies around chickens and cattle.
   <PERSON>Jack Blehm</PERSON>, a licensed pest control adviser, provided the
business and production expertise. His partner, <PERSON>E.J. Dietrick</PERSON>, an
entomologist formerly with the biological control division at <ORGANIZATION>UC
Riverside</ORGANIZATION>, provided the field know-how.
   The company employs about 40 workers during peak season from
<DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>September</DATE>. The insects are grown in a series of former ship
cargo containers.
   Rincon Vitova even sells bugs to movie makers. Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, a
studio filming a horror movie placed a request for four gallons of
maggots. ``We shipped them <ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> to their location site in
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON> said.
   More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced
into American agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest
populations, according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, which
must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding
and releasing them.

For <PERSON>Jack Blehm</PERSON> and son, it's a bug-eat-bug world. 
</P>
<P>
Jack and <PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON> breed good insects to eat bad insects at <PERSON>Rincon Vitova</PERSON>, one 
of a group of 15 insect firms nationwide. Every day, <PERSON>Rincon</PERSON> produces more than 
80 million voracious critters from ladybugs to wasps. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers concerned about effects of pesticides are turning to organic 
alternatives, and business at <PERSON>Rincon Vitova</PERSON> has tripled in the last five years. 
In <DATE>1988</DATE> alone, the <PERSON>Blehms</PERSON> said, they supplied <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> worth of bugs 
to customers on three continents. 
</P>
<P>
The close-knit group of insect firms have sales that total <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> 
annually, the Blehms estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, as well as to back-yard 
farmers who want to avoid pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The low-tech bio-pest control is the latest rage in pest eradication. It was 
first used by the Chinese thousands of years ago and was in vogue in the late 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
And the idea is catching on again. Some campuses are adding classes on 
integrated pest management. The <ORGANIZATION>Assn. of Applied Insect Ecologists</ORGANIZATION>, a trade 
group, is producing a video that shows farmers how to work with beneficial 
insects. The state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> approves of the low-tech method. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the future," added <PERSON>Ken Hagen</PERSON>, a professor of entomology at <ORGANIZATION>UC 
Berkeley</ORGANIZATION>. "There is a great need. The farmers are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials estimate that less than <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s growers 
use the method. Controlling pests this way takes longer, and because pesticides 
kill good bugs along with bad, farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying 
while waiting for the good bugs to do their job. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith," <PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON> said. 
"He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's used to a quick knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
"With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before you see a 
difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is that his crop is 
contaminated with bugs." 
</P>
<P>
Rincon Vitova began in <DATE>1948</DATE> and today sells 15 species, including beetles, 
mites and parasitic wasps that help control flies at chicken and livestock 
ranches. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jack Blehm</PERSON>, a licensed pest-control adviser, provided the business and 
production expertise. His partner, <PERSON>E. J. Dietrick</PERSON>, an entomologist formerly 
with the biological control division at <ORGANIZATION>UC Riverside</ORGANIZATION>, provided the field 
know-how. 
</P>
<P>
They took their name from <LOCATION>Rincon Beach</LOCATION>, where they first set up shop, and 
Vitova Insectaries, a Riverside-based firm they bought in <DATE>1972</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Business has grown steadily for <PERSON>Rincon Vitova</PERSON>, which today sells about <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of 
its bug crop to universities and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The firm employs about 40 workers during the peak season, from <DATE>April</DATE> to 
<DATE>September</DATE>, and houses its offices in cottages along railroad tracks. The bugs 
hang out in a series of former ship-cargo containers. 
</P>
<P>
Rincon Vitova even sells bugs to movie makers. Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, a studio filming a 
horror movie placed a request for four gallons of maggots. "We shipped them 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Express</ORGANIZATION> to their location site in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Jake Blehm</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced into American 
agriculture in the <DATE>last century</DATE> to curb pest populations, according to the 
<ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the insects for use before the firms breed them.

   A Mexican mite is being tested
against the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> potato beetle that also devastates tomatoes
and eggplants. A Chinese wasp may stop a butterfly that eats
broccoli, cabbage and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> sprouts.
   Humans increasingly have allies in the enemy camp in the war on
insects.
   Biological controls like these and others using insects against
problem plants have been used commercially for more than 100 years,
racking up hundreds of successes. In the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, though,
interest has grown.
   Last year, for example, the federal government spent more than
<MONEY>$85 million</MONEY> on nearly 800 biological control projects, four times
the number in existence a decade ago, said <PERSON>Jim Cate</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We are now just getting back into an era where entomologists
are realizing you can't solve the problem with pesticides alone,'
said <PERSON>Robert Metcalf</PERSON>, who has worked more than 50 years on pest
controls. ``For a long time there were advocates of the sole use of
each one. Now I think you'll find almost everybody agrees you need
a little of each.''
   ``There are many different crop pests that have been serious and
are not serious because they have been able to find biological
controls,'' said <PERSON>Patrick Logan</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Rhode Island</ORGANIZATION>
entomologist working on potato beetles.
   The mites, Chrysomelobia lapidomerae Eickwort, live on adult
beetles and suck fluid from them. Up to 2,000 can infest each
beetle. They can shorten the beetles' lifespans up to <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT>,
reducing the number of eggs laid, and they hinder the beetles'
flying ability, reducing migration, <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> said.
   University of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> researchers are studying a \-inch
wasp from <LOCATION>northwest China</LOCATION> named Apanteles rubecula, which inserts
its tiny needle into a cabbage butterfly larva and lays eggs. The
wasp larvae eat the pest.
   The wasps have flourished in a patch of collard greens in
<LOCATION>Deerfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, and have attacked an estimated <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the
butterfly larvae in the field, said entomologist <PERSON>Roy Van Dreische</PERSON>.
The needles are too small to hurt humans.
   Most insects became pests after their natural environments were
upset, letting them run rampant. Others were accidentally imported
on vegetables and plants to areas where they had no natural
predators.
   Biological controls seek to restore nature's balance.
   ``It's a totally natural way to regulate (pest) populations,''
said <PERSON>Metcalf</PERSON>, 72, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Illinois</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Urbana</LOCATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Science</ORGANIZATION>. ``It
doesn't pollute, it doesn't cost anything if it works, it's
self-regulating and self-correcting.''
   Still, biological controls aren't always sucessful, and can be
virtually ineffective as with the gypsy moth.
   The gypsy moth escaped from a <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> researcher in <DATE>1882</DATE>
as he was trying to cross it with a silkworm to make stronger silk.
It feeds on oak trees and occassionally neighborhood rose gardens,
but isn't a problem in its native <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> where more than 100
insects prey upon it, <PERSON>Metcalf</PERSON> said.
   In this country, it ``can make a forest look like winter in
<DATE>June</DATE>,'' sad <PERSON>Tom ODell</PERSON>, a research entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest
Research Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hamden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. This year the moth ravaged areas
of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   From <DATE>1905</DATE> to <DATE>1911</DATE>, researchers brought 2 million species of the
moth's natural enemies from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, said
<LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION>. But the effort failed because, ``in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> there are a large
number of natural enemies, each of which controls a small number''
of the moths. Of the 127 species introduced against the moth, only
eight have survived in this country, said ODell.
   ``It's not like some of the other pests where we've been able to
to find a single natural enemy that regulates it,'' <PERSON>Logan</PERSON> said.
   One of 225 successful uses of biological controls was against
the <ORGANIZATION>Cottony Cushiony Scale</ORGANIZATION>, which almost wiped out the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
citrus industry after it was inadvertently brought to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1880s</DATE>, said <PERSON>Cate</PERSON>, who is also a researcher at <ORGANIZATION>Texas A
&amp; M University</ORGANIZATION>.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> entomologist brought the <LOCATION>Vendalia</LOCATION>
beetle, a type of ladybug and a natural enemy of the scale, from
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Metcalf</PERSON>. That worked until after World War II, when
DDT killed off the beetle.
   In fact, many pests became a problem when pesticides killed
their natural enemies, <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> said. But pesticides can also be
ineffective because the harmful insects develop a tolerance to the
chemicals, and development can't keep up.
   ``It costs <MONEY>several million dollars</MONEY> to formulate a new material _
to develop it, test it. It's very slow, very expensive,'' he said.
   The introduction of biological controls also is slow. Despite
the growth in the number of projects over the past decade, the
level of federal funding has stayed relatively stable when adjusted
for inflation, <PERSON>Cates</PERSON> said.
   Also, scientists face delays while they work to show the
government that their controls are harmless to all but the pest.
   The Mexican mite, being tested at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Rhode
Island</ORGANIZATION>, was quarantined for six months before scientists could
prove it was a species known in this country. Then the government
required tests to show it would not harm beneficial insects like
ladybugs or honeybees.
   It took seven years from the time the mite was found until it
was approved.
   Reassuringly, ``There just haven't been any notable examples of
anything going wrong with this process,'' said <PERSON>Metcalf</PERSON>.
   Biological controls also may be victims of their own success.
When they work ``people forget they had a problem,'' said Cate.
``You solve the pest problem and you walk away from it.''
   Companies that invest huge sums in research, ``want a return on
their investment,'' said <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION>. ``Nobody is going to make any money
off importing exotic insects,'' <PERSON>Cate</PERSON> said.
   As a result, smaller, isolated pests, like the potato beetle,
are often overlooked by the large chemical companies.

A SPRINKLING OF LADYBUGS AND MANTISES CAN KEEP THE REALLY NASTY INSECTS AWAY 
FROM YOUR COOKOUTS.

<P>
Wander into your back yard during the <DATE>summer</DATE> months and you can almost hear the 
jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbecue!" roar the ants. "Fruits and vegetables!' add the aphids and white 
ash flies. "People!" say the mosquitoes and wasps, invariably followed by the 
not-so-happy retort from your family, "Let's go inside." 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the solution was simple: Purchase every type of bug death on the 
market, don the gas mask and attack, spraying everything that moves back there. 
And, oh yes, "Dear, I've just sprayed, so keep the kids away until about 
<DATE>December</DATE>, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not OK. Summer is a great time for family get-togethers, and there are 
safe, non-destructo ways to keep bugs at arms length without having to take out 
the radiation detector every time your family enters the back-yard nuclear hot 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many natural things you can use to get rid of the unwanted bugs," 
says <PERSON>Lucy Burkard</PERSON>, the manager of <ORGANIZATION>Green Meadow Nursery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> and a 
fourth-generation greens person. "There are even a few things the kids can 
watch and learn about nature." 
</P>
<P>
Tops on her list? Ladybugs and praying mantises. 
</P>
<P>
Available in many nurseries, especially in early <DATE>spring</DATE> and early <DATE>summer</DATE> (it 
gets too hot to ship them past early <DATE>summer</DATE>, although <ORGANIZATION>Burkard</ORGANIZATION> says they can be 
special-ordered during other months), bugs like this are considered "beneficial 
insects," and attack other bugs. Sort of a good bug with the white hat and bad 
bug with the black hat analogy. 
</P>
<P>
Burkard recommends releasing ladybugs ln the <TIME>evening</TIME>, after watering, "because 
they don't fly at night and will look for prey in the immediate area." OK, but 
even at about <MONEY>five dollars</MONEY> for several hundred ladybugs, what's to stop them 
from leaving my yard for others in the neighborhood? "As long as you have 
enough bad bugs in the area," she says, "the ladybugs will be content to stay 
where they are." 
</P>
<P>
As will the praying mantises. 
</P>
<P>
They usually come two egg cases to a container (again, for about five dollars). 
Within a few days you'll have about 400 babies breaking out and looking for 
food. 
</P>
<P>
"What's fun is to put a thread through the egg case and hang it from a nearby 
tree in the infested area," <PERSON>Burkard</PERSON> says. "Then the kids can come out every day 
and watch the eggs until they hatch.' 
</P>
<P>
OK, sounds great, but what do I do with a back yard full of praying mantises 
and ladybugs (which the mantises won't eat, by the way)? Nothing. When the bad 
bugs are gone, the beneficial bugs will move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Another product <PERSON>Burkard</PERSON> recommends is Safer Soap, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION>Safer Inc</ORGANIZATION>. 
(189 <LOCATION>Wells Ave.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION> 02159. 617/964-2990). 
</P>
<P>
According to <ORGANIZATION>Mark Dockser of Safer</ORGANIZATION>, the company markets more than 50 products 
refined to have a maximum effect on bad bugs while not harming the beneficial 
ones such as honey bees and ladybugs. 
</P>
<P>
The various soaps, he says, are different from their petrochemical counterparts 
in that they are considerably less toxic and break down into harmless 
substances in about 48 hours, which means no potential to contaminate ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
And the products are selective in the insects they kill. For example, some 
soaps go after moths, algae and weeds, yet leave delicate plants such as 
African violets undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, certain ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hit the bug to make the product work," <PERSON>Dockser</PERSON> says, "but if you 
spray both sides of the leaves you have a good chance of nailing everything 
that's around." Unless the infestation is heavy, he says the average back yard 
can go up to two weeks between sprays. 
</P>
<P>
"And," <PERSON>Burkard</PERSON> adds, "some studies indicate that some Safer soaps have affected 
the white ash fly larvae." 
</P>
<P>
Get rid of the white ash fly? Those pesky little things that look like 
thousands of pieces of large dandruff falling from the sky? The answer, she 
says, is yes. 
</P>
<P>
Burkard says the soap (there also are other brands but she says Safer is the 
biggest) comes in ready-to-use packages or in concentrated form to be diluted 
with a hose sprayer. One package should easily do a couple hundred square feet 
of shrubs with no problem and you should start noticing a difference in a 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat, however. Wear protective clothing, perhaps even consider a face 
mask. Nothing in the soap would harm you, but why ingest anything into your 
body you don't have to? 
</P>
<P>
* IN <LOCATION>VENTURA</LOCATION> COUNTY: Ladybugs and praying mantises are available at most large 
nurseries. Safer Soap can be purchased at most lawn and garden centers, 
nurseries and home shopping centers such as the Home Depot and Builder's 
Emporium.

<HEAD>Georgia State Psychologist Finds People Eat More in a Crowd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A roomful of diners is probably a roomful of
people eating more than they would if they were alone, according to
research indicating that people on diets might do well to decline
invitations to eat out.
   ``Eating in a social setting increases the duration of the meal.
You're eating at the same speed but you're eating longer,'' said
<PERSON>John de Castro</PERSON>, who reported on his work in <DATE>August</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition</ORGANIZATION>.
   De <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Georgia State University</ORGANIZATION> psychologist, hired 63
adults in the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> area to keep seven-day diaries of their how
much they ate, what they ate, where they ate it and how they felt
physically.
   People tend to eat <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> more food when eating with others
than when eating alone, and the bigger the group the bigger the
individual's appetite. In addition, the food eaten in social
settings was often higher in fat and that eaten when alone was more
healthful, he said.
   Contrary to de <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>'s expectations, he did not find many
instances of people stuffing themselves out of the watchful gaze of
others. ``I had expected to see people become closet eaters. That
wasn't the case,'' he said.
   The three-year study of nutritional habits is continuing at
<ORGANIZATION>Georgia State</ORGANIZATION>, with more people to be hired to keep diaries. De
<PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said the research could eventually yield a complete picture
of what factors contribute to overeating.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN you visit your doctor, you often take along a specimen in a small jar
that you pass along to the nurse as rapidly as possible.;    The past few
weeks people have been bringing me small jars with specimens. There are two
differences. I don't have a nurse (not a bad idea, though) and most of the
specimens that come to my office are alive and running around the jar;    One
such specimen that arrived this week was one of the more unusual found in the
area. Picture a praying mantis' body with a giraffe's neck and head. The fact
that it slightly resembles a mantis is fortunate because it saves it from
being blasted with pesticides by people who shoot first and ask questions
later.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Troubleshooting
Dan Pratt is a certified nurseryman in Sacramento.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The person who brought in this specimen was asking questions first, and the
answer is that it is a very beneficial insect called a snakefly.;    They are
found over much of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coast, hiding under loose bark on trees or in
litter at the base of a tree.;    The reason for hanging around trees? Both
adult and larvae stages of snakeflies are predators of wood-boring insects
that attack trees.;    Since we have been having a serious problem with borers
attacking so many of our tree varieties, I hope we will see a lot more
snakeflies in the near future.;    There are several other beneficial insects
you should watch for on trees and plants right now. Let's start with the
leatherwing beetles. As the name indicates, the wings are the color of
leather, very old leather. The rest of the body and the head can range from
light orange to almost red. Size varies from a third to half an inch depending
on how well you feed them.;    What do you feed a leatherwing beetle? Aphids,
aphids and more aphids. On cherry, plum and apple trees, where there has been
the all-time greatest crop of aphids. After a visit from the leatherwings
there are just piles of white aphid bones.;    Most people would quickly
recognize the distinct red and black colors of the adult ladybug. It is one of
the most familiar insects, even to those who are not gardeners. There are also
ladybugs that are plain red (no spots) or navy gray and just as effective in
controlling pests.;    Even more effective pest control is performed by the
larval stage of any of the ladybugs. The soft body is shaped like a tiny
alligator, is dull gray-black in color and is covered with short spines and
yellow or orange spots in the middle of the back. Unfortunately, at least a
dozen times a week, I have people bringing in ladybug larvae in those little
bottles, wanting to know what to spray to get rid of these "pests" they think
are attacking their plants.;    The most important part of logical pest
control is knowing what you need to control. When you find an insect that you
don't recognize, put it in one of those little bottles and bring it to the
nursery or to a <ORGANIZATION>University of California Cooperative Extension</ORGANIZATION> office for
positive identification. If it's a bad guy, we will tell you how to control
it. If it's a good guy, we will tell you how to encourage it. If enough of you
bring in specimens, I just may need to get a nurse.  </TEXT>

<PERSON>Sharon Whatley</PERSON> likes to know what her family is eating. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not always easy to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to tell what is sprayed on vegetables and fruit before they 
get to the supermarket, and I wanted to have control over that," said the 
<LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> resident. 
</P>
<P>
She started a garden in her back yard six years ago to ensure that her family 
ate only naturally grown, chemical-free produce. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bugs invaded her pure environment. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began to get garden pests and went to the nursery for advice, they 
suggested I use harsh chemical methods, which defeated the whole purpose of 
having a garden," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatley began searching for alternatives to chemical pest control. She 
conducted research on her own and then hooked up with the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Organic 
Gardening Club</ORGANIZATION>. She now controls pests organically. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Organic Gardening Club</ORGANIZATION> offers members and guests educational 
programs, speakers and demonstrations. The group meets every second <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> of 
the month at <ORGANIZATION>Mercury Federal Savings</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION>. Seventy families are members of 
the 25-year-old club. 
</P>
<P>
Club members say you can trash the chemicals and start fresh. By using 
alternative pest-control methods, back-yard gardeners avoid the harmful effects 
of chemicals in the soil and on the produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Your first line of defense against pests is to have healthy plants," said <PERSON>Bud 
Anderson</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Organic Gardening Club</ORGANIZATION>. "When plants become 
stressed because of lack of water or nutrition or start aging, pests will 
attack them." 
</P>
<P>
Insects are attracted to yellow -- the color of sickly plants. "Yellow means 
food to them," said <PERSON>Sharron Clark</PERSON>, a professor of biology at <ORGANIZATION>Golden West 
College</ORGANIZATION> who will teach a class on alternative methods of garden maintenance 
this <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Problems can be prevented by selecting strong, healthy green plants. After 
planting, be sure to keep the area free of debris and remove any yellowing 
leaves or ailing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Another important element to consider during plant selection is disease 
resistance. You can prevent infestations by choosing plants that can ward off 
certain devastating diseases. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting tomato plants, for instance, look for the VFN label, which 
indicates that the plant is resistant to three main types of deadly soil-borne 
diseases. Seed packages also indicate that plants are resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Pests thrive, too, on young, tender plants. Start seeds in containers and 
transplant them when they're the size of plants found in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"To protect transplants, put a newspaper collar around the stems," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. 
"This will keep cutworms and other pests away. As the plants grow, the 
newspaper will disintegrate." 
</P>
<P>
Once pesky insects are spotted, there are several organic chemical control 
methods that can be used. Insecticidal soaps are a popular, safe way to 
suffocate aphids, white flies and mealybugs, while not harming friendly 
predators such as lacewings, ladybugs and praying mantises. These soap 
solutions can be made at home or purchased. 
</P>
<P>
To mix your own, put a few drops of dish detergent into water and spray it on 
your plants. If you want a stronger solution, mix fresh onion juice, garlic and 
hot pepper into the soapy water. After some experimentation, every gardener 
comes up with his or her own favorite mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Effective, readily biodegradable insecticidal soaps -- like Safer -- can be 
found in most gardening centers. These are designed to kill aphids, mealybugs, 
whiteflies, mites, tent caterpillars, thrips and other destructive pests. Spray 
in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn. 
</P>
<P>
Another chemical that acts as a stomach poison for beetles, thrips, weevils and 
borers is Rotenone, which is an extract from the roots of tropical legumes. It 
is usually found in a combination spray with Pyrethrum. This comes from the 
flower heads of the <ORGANIZATION>Pyrethrum Chrysanthemum</ORGANIZATION>, a form of the daisy found in 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. Pyrethrum kills leaf hoppers, thrips, whiteflies and aphids. 
</P>
<P>
When using organic chemical sprays, keep in mind that their effects don't last 
long, which is why they don't become part of your food. If pests persist, 
sprays must be reapplied. 
</P>
<P>
Another form of controlling pests is through biological means. "So that we are 
not overrun by any one species in nature, organisms feed on one another," said 
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. "You can use such biological controls in your own garden." 
</P>
<P>
A good cure for soil-borne pests such as pill bugs, sow bugs, snails and slugs 
is <LOCATION>Diatamascious Earth</LOCATION>. "This is made up of the shells of a small sea creature 
which is mined from the ocean floor," said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. "When it is mixed into the 
soil, the pests eat them and the sharp edges tear up their insides." 
</P>
<P>
Another control is the bacteria <LOCATION>Bacillus Thuringiensis</LOCATION>, which can kill all 
kinds of caterpillars, fly larvae and worms. "When you see holes in leaves and 
vegetables such as tomatoes and actual caterpillars and worms on your plants, 
spray them with this solution and the pests will soon die from eating the 
leaves and ingesting the bacteria, which poisons their guts," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. This 
product is sold under the brand names Attack and Dipel and is readily 
available. 
</P>
<P>
You can also control pests by introducing certain "good" insects into your 
garden, such as ladybugs, praying mantises, lacewings, spiders and wasps. Many 
of these can be bought at the nursery and set free in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
Barrier methods are also effective in controlling some pests. Whatley has found 
that a shallow pan or dish filled with stale beer and soap stops snails as they 
attempt to climb into her garden. Salt also harms the troublemakers. Stop 
snails by putting salt on cardboard strips and placing them around the 
outskirts of your garden. Avoid getting salt into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Netting is another effective barrier method for plants such as broccoli and 
cauliflower. This prevents the white cabbage butterfly and other similar 
insects from laying eggs on the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Certain companion plants deter pests. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their pungent odor, marigolds ward off many pests," said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, 
who has them planted throughout his garden. Nasturtiums are attractive flowers 
that repel aphids and squash bugs. Plant them near cabbage, lettuce, squash and 
radishes. Some herbs are also useful. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy the odor and taste of sweet basil, but tomato and cabbage worms don't 
like it," said <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. Mint, too, deters many pests that affect cabbage and 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bunch similar crops in the same area. "Nature doesn't have all of the 
same tree in one spot or a meadow filled with pure grass," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. "When we 
plant all one crop in one area, we upset the balance of nature, and this 
encourages pests, because each type tends to feed on similar crops. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, if you have rows of lettuce, the insects who feed on that will 
move readily from plant to plant and destroy your crop. However, if you 
interplant dissimilar crops between rows and within rows, when an insect is 
feeding on lettuce and then moves over to radishes, it is likely to find this 
vegetable distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Many organic gardeners use truly simple solutions: water and picking bugs off 
leaves. Aphids can often be killed with a strong jet of water, while many 
caterpillars, worms and snails can be picked from plants. To catch sow bugs and 
pill bugs, place a piece of wood in the garden and they will crawl under it. 
"Don't kill the blue sow bugs, though," said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. "They have a disease that 
will kill the other ones." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no garden is going to be completely free of pests. "You're not 
insect-proof, you're insect- and pest-deterrent," explained <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>. "You must 
remember that all of the 'pests' are there for a reason -- they actually have a 
place in the earth's continuum. We don't want to destroy everything, which is 
why alternative methods work so well. They create a natural balance in your 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
Since she started using alternative methods, <PERSON>Whatley</PERSON>'s pest problems have 
decreased. "Five years ago, when I used toxic chemical controls, I constantly 
battled pests," she said. "Today I don't have very many problems. My garden is 
really healthy, and I'm able to eat produce that is chemical-free."

   Jake Blehm's biggest business problem isn't selling his
product -- it's explaining to baffled customers what exactly
it is they've just bought.
   Mr. Blehm, owner of Buena Bio Systems Inc. in Santa Paula,
Calif., recently mailed nearly 500,000 trichograma wasps to a
client to fight moth larvae, which attack tomatoes and corn.
The wasps, mailed in the form of larvae inside moth eggs,
emerge two or three days later. Buena Bio Systems glues these
grainy eggs to small sheets of heavy paper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the shipment arrived, the bewildered customer called
<PERSON>Mr. Blehm</PERSON>. "He said, `Hey, where are the wasps you were
supposed to send me. All I got are three sheets of
sandpaper,'" says <PERSON>Mr. Blehm</PERSON>. "I told him to find the
instructions and pull out a magnifying glass. He wrote us a
letter later apologizing."
   <PERSON>Mr. Blehm</PERSON>'s farm produces beneficial insects that devour
crop-destroying bugs. These tiny beasts of prey -- ranging
from ladybugs to praying mantises -- are gaining favor with
farmers as an alternative to costly and environmentally
hazardous pesticides. A smaller sect of farmers raise bugs
that eat weeds.
   Though fledgling, the beneficial-insect industry is
growing fast. It is a small slice of the biological-control
world, but it has grown from nothing five years ago to about
60 firms with combined sales of close to <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> today.
In that time, <PERSON>Mr. Blehm</PERSON> and others in the field have
discovered what people in other businesses have long known:
New products confuse people.
   These entrepreneurs are learning that any company
introducing a product -- be it a six-legged arthropod or a
laptop computer that transmits data over radio waves -- has
to educate the public on what the product is and how it
works.
   Customers aren't the only ones having trouble figuring out
the firms. Some states have lumped beneficial-insect
companies -- which sell only bugs -- into the same regulatory
category as pesticide dealers.
   Another problem: Some state agencies don't distinguish
between beneficial insects that these firms sell, and
micro-organisms and pathogens, which require <ORGANIZATION>Environmental
Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> registration. Led in part by the newly
formed <ORGANIZATION>Association of Natural Bio-control Producers</ORGANIZATION>, firms
are rushing to develop model regulations.
   "All we want," says <PERSON>Synthia Penn</PERSON>, president of the group
and her company, <ORGANIZATION>Beneficial Insectary</ORGANIZATION>, "are regulations that
are appropriate to our industry -- specifically, naturally
occurring arthropods. We pose no threat to the public or to
the environment."
   The firms are scrambling to ease the new-product
confusion. They are trying to establish guidelines to assure
the accuracy of advertising claims and to set uniform
standards for raising, shipping and releasing the insects.
   "Biological control has been sort of a novelty in many
areas, but now people are beginning to take it seriously, and
the credibility is being scrutinized," says <PERSON>Glenn Scriven</PERSON>,
owner of <ORGANIZATION>Biotactics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a company based in <LOCATION>Grand Terrace</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, that deals mainly in predatory mites.
   Adds <PERSON>Marjorie Hoy</PERSON>, an entomology professor at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, "If the industry is
going to grow, it must develop standards and educate
consumers."
   For all its new-product problems, biological control isn't
brand new. In the <DATE>1880s</DATE>, for example, a parasite and a small
lady beetle were imported from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to attack the
cottony cushion scale, an insect that was devastating
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s citrus industry.
   But practitioners are now much more sophisticated. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
scientists import weedeating and bug-eating insects from
around the world to test. Beneficial insects that aren't
collected in the field are raised in roughly a dozen <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
insectaries -- large, environmentally controlled buildings,
similar to greenhouses, lined with racks and trays filled
with insects.
   Some bugs take longer -- sometimes years longer -- than
quick-acting herbicides or pesticides to get results. Some
species are self-perpetuating, and thus are ultimately much
cheaper than chemicals, advocates say. Still others are
native and must be reapplied seasonally.
   <PERSON>Hunter Nadler</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> raisin farmer who runs an
80-acre vineyard, buys roughly <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> of predatory mites,
trichogramma wasps, green lacewings, beetles and ladybird
beetles a year. "It's a lot safer than chemicals, and in some
fields, we've seen increases in production," says a satisfied
<PERSON>Mr. Nadler</PERSON>.
   But not all customers come away as satisfied as <PERSON>Mr.
Nadler</PERSON>. New-product confusion helps some unscrupulous firms
make bogus claims about their insects. Others withhold
information to make a sale -- neglecting to point out, for
example, that parasitic insects attack their pesthosts only
in particular life-cycle phases, such as the egg or larval
stage.
   "People will call a company and say I've got a caterpillar
problem on my lettuce, and some companies ship them insects
no matter what stage the host is in," says <PERSON>Diane Belvanis</PERSON>, a
research entomologist and former employee at a biological
control firm.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Association of Natural Biocontrol Producers</ORGANIZATION> discussed
model industry regulations in a meeting this month with state
officials of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, which has been seeking to revamp its
pesticide rules. States such as <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
also are reviewing ways to regulate the cottage industry.
Meanwhile, a federal effort to coordinate biological control
efforts is under way in the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>'s newly
formed <ORGANIZATION>National Biological Control Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   But even as insect companies struggle with the big issues,
they have to grapple with more minute matters. <PERSON>Reed Finfrock</PERSON>,
owner of <ORGANIZATION>Sespe Creek Insectary</ORGANIZATION>, a three-year-old firm in
<LOCATION>Fillmore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, frets over the difficulties of counting the
minuscule creatures he sells. "How," he asks, "do you get
everyone to agree on how to measure 10,000 bugs?"

GARDENERS: DON'T GIVE BUGS A BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. BAZINET, Kenneth R. Bazinet writes for United Press 
International. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took weeks to till all the soil and clear the dead leaves and other debris 
from the patch of land that -- with any luck -- will deliver tasty vegetables 
or a picturesque flower show. 
</P>
<P>
But don't get lazy now. There are a few unwelcome visitors in the garden that 
have to be taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
That green thing hanging off the tomato plant is not a leaf. And those brown, 
squishy things look like they're building a patio under the lettuce. Those 
pesky garden pests that were not there when the planting began are ruining all 
your work. 
</P>
<P>
"The pests just make your plants and ornamentals a mess," says <PERSON>Micheal D. 
Smith</PERSON>, managing editor of the gardening division of <ORGANIZATION>Ortho Books</ORGANIZATION>. "But there are 
ways to counter them." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of insect and insect-family pests invade gardens at various times 
each year. Most of the tiny terrors arrive by their sensory perception -- they 
tell plants by color, texture and fragrance -- then decide if the particular 
vegetation is something they want in their diet. 
</P>
<P>
A few pests, such as the gypsy moth and various mites, reach a garden by 
accident, perhaps hitching a ride under a car or truck or on a pant leg from 
someone's favorite overalls. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the garden, the pests can maul plants in a variety of ways -- some 
munch away at stems, leafs and petals, others dig around plants, and some even 
suck and sponge away nutrients needed to keep the vegetation healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Different insects, whether they invaded your garden intentionally or by 
accident, require different strategies to get rid of them, depending on the way 
they feed. 
</P>
<P>
Predators are friendly insects that devour the garden-gorging pests. The 
beneficial insects, like the praying mantis, snail-eating ground beetle and 
ladybug larvae, can be imported into the garden, where they police the area for 
the leaf- and flower-munching pests. 
</P>
<P>
Smith warns, however, that if chemicals are going to be used in a garden in 
addition to the predators, extra care should be taken in reading and 
understanding the potency of the pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, understanding the chemical pesticides is important no matter what, 
but in particular, you don't want to kill off the pests' natural predators," he 
says. "You have to take care in understanding chemical pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
Other ways to combat pests include using sticky traps that catch pests as they 
make their way into the garden or up a fruit tree. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is building barriers to keep crawling bugs out, but this is 
a time-consuming project that can involve digging trenches or wrapping aluminum 
stripping around the border of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been research into creating pathogenic diseases that fight off 
and eliminate pests while not harming people, pets or wildlife. The disease 
germs can be introduced into the garden in ways similar to spreading chemical 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says the best way to combat a specific pest is to first identify the 
insect by appearance -- "a photo will do" -- then research what the particular 
pest is known to eat. "From there, you can learn the best way to get rid of the 
pests," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But bear in mind that winning a battle against a pest doesn't necessarily mean 
that the war is over. 
</P>
<P>
"Pests return," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says. "You have to make sure the plants are healthy. You 
don't want leaves with holes in them or browning."

THE SPRING OF OUR DISCONTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene is increasingly common in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. Flowers stand not full 
and robust but drooped over and shriveled. The roses for display on the dining 
table are so distorted from their natural shape that they look more like 
doilies for the place settings. Outside dead bees line the patio; crickets 
aren't chirping. If it is not quite a silent spring around here right now, it 
is certainly a disquieted one. 
</P>
<P>
The problem now is aphids, those parasitic insects that huddle together on new 
shoots, buds and leaves. They are invading local gardens in distressingly high 
numbers. The natural predators that usually keep aphids under control -- 
ladybugs, lacewings and tiny wasps -- have been destroyed in some 400 square 
miles of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. So have wild honeybees, which pollinate fruit 
trees. All this, plus the lack of chirping crickets, have been attributed to 
aerial malathion spraying that has descended upon many local areas during the 
last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
The state has sprayed the pesticide in a campaign to rid the region of the 
crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly. That pest continues to pop up in 
unexpected places, giving farmers fits, local residents sleepless nights and 
state officials heartburn. But one of the certain unfortunate side effects of 
malathion spraying is that it is extraordinarily efficient in eliminating some 
"good" bugs. 
</P>
<P>
Without them, the natural controls crucial to a linked ecosystem begin to break 
down. And so, we are all robbed of one of the great joys of <DATE>spring</DATE> -- a lovely 
and healthy garden. The negative effects were expected, say entomologists, and 
the bad news in the back yard is nothing compared to the damage the Medfly 
could cause to the food supply. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. We can only hope that <PERSON>Rachel Carson</PERSON>'s words from <DATE>1962</DATE> don't return to 
ring in our ears: "It is ironic to think that man might determine his own 
future by something so seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray. 
</P>
<P>
"All this has been risked -- for what? Future historians may well be amazed by 
our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control 
a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and 
brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is 
precisely what we have done. All this is not to say there is no insect problem 
and no need of control. I am saying, rather, that control must be geared to 
realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be 
such that they do not destroy us along with the insects."

<LEADPARA>  LIVING in harmony with nature seems to be developing as the dominant theme of
gardening. The disposable era has made a 180-degree turn. The signs are
everywhere.;    Nurseries advertise beneficial insects for sale. Praying
mantis or ladybugs retail at $4.99 a container (about 1,500 baby ladybugs or
800 baby praying mantis). Some nurseries also pay for the return of empty
plastic plant containers, offering five cents for the one-gallon size to 50
cents for the 15-gallon.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Xeriscaping, the use of such plant material, has become a buzzword in areas
facing water shortages or rationing.;    The latest national magazine of the
<ORGANIZATION>Perennial Plant Association</ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, features an article by
horticulturist <PERSON>Luren Springer</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, who says:;    "The key to growing
perennials successfully is to choose plants that will thrive in the climate
where they are planted. Native plants are making inroads into our perennial
palette. Many of these tolerate heat, humidity, drought and even hail with the
greatest of ease.;    "It's time hybridizers and plants people devoted more
time to selecting and developing better strains of these, instead of the
newest almost-white daylily, variegated hosta or huge bearded iris.";    <ORGANIZATION>Toro
Manufacturing Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> has been promoting a "Don't Bag It, Compost
It" program. The company says <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the solid waste generated in this
country comes from grass clippings and tree leaves and claims compost from a
typical yard can provide up to <MONEY>$100</MONEY> of free humus, fertilizers and soil
conditioners a year.;    Toro, of course, like many other manufacturers, sells
lawn mowers and other equipment designed for such recycling.;    But it wasn't
too many years ago that talk of composting brought guffaws from many college
horticulture instructors. One of my years-ago professors at <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State
University</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Vic Miller</PERSON>, was among the dissenters, saying, "If we would keep
these materials on our own property, we probably would cut our landfill needs
in half.";    <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION> companies catering to gardeners also have been taking
pains to tell how they are working to preserve the environment. For example,
<ORGANIZATION>Smith &amp; Hawken of Mill Valley</ORGANIZATION>, which has offered first-rate equipment for
years, includes this opening declaration in its new catalog: "We plant two
trees for every one we use; we use recycled paper in our offices and our
catalogs, and we sell only ecological beneficial garden products.";    It used
to be fashionable to spray insecticides on a definite schedule. (It's <DATE>May</DATE>, so
spray for mealybugs, aphids and spider mites.) One of my outdated books,
printed in <DATE>1939</DATE>, even recommends spraying pesticides to kill lacewings. Now
pesticide labels often recommend spraying only when pests are noticed and urge
protection of beneficials.  </TEXT>

The 9,000 acres of orange trees surrounding <ORGANIZATION>Fillmore</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Piru</ORGANIZATION> are swarming with 
insects -- and that's good news to <PERSON>Monte Carpenter</PERSON>, manager of the Fillmore 
Insectary. Servicing the pest-control needs of the 350-member <ORGANIZATION>Fillmore Citrus 
Protective District</ORGANIZATION>, the insectary has raised and released 20 species of 
beneficial insects since <DATE>1926</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, <PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON> said, less than <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of the district's total 
acreage has required insecticidal spray. Consequently, some beneficial insects, 
such as ladybugs and green lacewings, have stable and abundant populations. The 
insectary no longer raises them for release in local groves. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation of area growers is what makes it work," <PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON> said. Only 
one or two smaller orchards do not belong to the district, which means that one 
farmer's beneficial insects are not endangered by the management of his 
neighbor's grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you spray for injurious insects, you kill the beneficials as well," 
<PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON> said. Orchards such as those in the <LOCATION>San Joaquin Valley</LOCATION> "are on a 
pesticide treadmill," he added. 
</P>
<P>
With five full-time workers supplemented by two part-time staff members, the 
insectary raises two insect predators that feed on red and black scale, the 
most prolific citrus pests. About 180 million beneficial insects are released 
annually in member orchards. Spraying is reserved for the rare, heavy 
infestation that defies biological control. JANET <LOCATION>BERGAMO</LOCATION>

   In the antenna-to-antenna combat of the insect world, the
predatory anthocorid wields terrifying powers.
   Just ask Bunting Biological Control Ltd. of Great
Horkesley, England. The company is breeding millions of the
three-millimeter Rambos. It aims to sell them this spring or
summer to greenhouse-vegetable growers in need of troops to
deploy against the dreaded Western flower thrip, an avid
muncher of peppers and cucumbers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bunting's brochure describes how the anthocorids operate:
"Both the adults and the nymphs feed by inserting their
proboscis-like mouthparts into the prey and sucking out the
body juices." Not just one or two helpings, either: Bunting
promises that its bugs will drain as many as 15 thrips a day.
The predators also snack on aphids and spider mites. If
nothing else is around, they devour one another.
   But it's a bug-eat-bug business, and greenhouse farmers
can't be too fastidious about the thuggish habits of some of
their allies, known in the trade as "natural enemies" or
"beneficial insects."
   For a few dozen mite-size European and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies,
finding and breeding these natural enemies is becoming a
fast-growing business.
   Although greenhouse farmers began dabbling with natural
enemies in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>, such pest control remained little more
than a curiosity for decades. After World War II, new
chemical pesticides proved so devastating that few farmers
bothered with any other weaponry. Then, in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and
<DATE>1970s</DATE>, some farmers began to doubt that it was healthy for
people who work in glasshouses to spray lots of chemicals
around.
   One of the doubters was Jan <PERSON>Pieter Koppert</PERSON>, a Dutch
greenhouse grower whose respiratory problems prompted him to
experiment with natural enemies for his own use in the late
<DATE>1960s</DATE>. Soon he was selling killer insects to his neighbors.
Now <ORGANIZATION>Koppert B.V.</ORGANIZATION>, owned and managed by the late <PERSON>Mr. Koppert</PERSON>'s
sons, exports brandname bugs as far afield as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. In the past five years, the company's annual
sales have more than tripled to around <MONEY>30 million guilders</MONEY>
(<MONEY>$16.6 million</MONEY>). That, says export manager Cor-Jan van der
Elzen, makes <PERSON>Koppert</PERSON> "the main leader in the world" of
natural enemies. (The company also supplies bumble bees for
pollination work-along with bee food called BeeHappy.)
   Koppert and rival companies -- such as <LOCATION>Bunting</LOCATION> and Chr.
<PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s Bio Systems AS of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> -- remain bullish on bugs.
Tough environmental rules in many countries are pressuring
farmers to use fewer chemical pesticides and making those
pesticides more expensive to develop. At the same time, some
consumers are clamoring for unsprayed fruit and vegetables.
   So far, most people aren't willing to pay the premium for
unsprayed produce. But <PERSON>Joop van Lenteren</PERSON>, an expert on
natural enemies at the <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wageningen</LOCATION>,
the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, thinks the trend is toward fussier
consumers. "In <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>," he says, "they're even more keen on
clean food than we are here."
   To satisfy that demand, bug breeders scour the wilderness
for new predators and parasites. The trick is to track down
the most efficient killers. Frogs, for instance, may eat lots
of insects, but they can't be relied upon to go after any
particular pest. Certain types of mites, on the other hand,
zero right in on thrip larvae.
   So <PERSON>Koppert</PERSON> breeds mites and packs them into plastic
bottles marked Thripex. It advises cucumber growers to
sprinkle the mites over their plants like salt.
   Among other hired guns on the market are aphid midges,
lacewings, ladybird beetles, mealybug destroyers, gypsy moths
and onion maggots. The predatory snail (Rumina decollata)
stands ready to pounce on garden snails.
   Since no one can patent a snail or an insect, competition
can be fierce; new suppliers keep crawling out of the
woodwork. Two years ago, Biolab of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> opened a
state-of-the-art bug plant near <LOCATION>Cesena</LOCATION>, partly financed by
government funds. Koppert is so wary of rivals that it
refuses to let visitors tour its labs or breeding plant. <PERSON>Mr.
van Lenteren</PERSON> says Russian scientists plied him with vodka,
unsuccessfully, to learn bug-production secrets.
   Even a few giant companies are getting involved. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>BASF AG</ORGANIZATION>, for example, sells capsules full of ichneumon flies
to combat the infamous corn borer. <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> doesn't sell insects but offers
chemical pesticides designed for use alongside them.
   Rather than breeding bugs, big chemical and drug companies
generally are more interested in developing bacteria, fungi
and viruses to serve as "biopesticides." County <ORGANIZATION>Natwest
WoodMac</ORGANIZATION>, a British stockbroker, estimates that the world
market for biopesticides -- most of them based on a bacterium
called Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis -- totals <MONEY>$120 million</MONEY> a
year, or <PERCENT>0.5%</PERCENT> of the global market for agrochemicals. Natural
enemies constitute an even smaller business.
   Even <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON>, one of the world's leading
advocates of natural enemies and other types of biological
pest control, doesn't think they can render chemicals
obsolete.
   For now, natural enemies are unleashed mainly in
greenhouses. Outdoors, a bigger variety of pests and
unpredictable weather make it hard for warrior bugs to
perform reliably; most farmers stick to chemical weapons for
their field crops. Still, natural enemies are sometimes used
outdoors for strawberries, apples, cotton and corn.
   <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> thinks more outdoor applications are
possible. He preaches using natural enemies along with
chemical pesticides in a way that minimizes the need for the
latter.
   Toward that end, he and his colleagues in <LOCATION>Wageningen</LOCATION> are
using government grants to study bug warfare.
   Remember <PERSON>Pavlov</PERSON>'s dog? Meet van <ORGANIZATION>Lenteren</ORGANIZATION>'s insect. When a
young woman wore a potent perfume in the lab one day, <PERSON>Mr. van
Lenteren</PERSON>'s students were seized with an inspiration: Why not
teach parasitic wasps to respond to an artificial odor, such
as perfume? The students wafted various perfumes over the
wasps as they laid their eggs. Later the wasps associated
certain scents with egg-laying.
   "Now we know we can train them to many things -- to
shapes, to colors," marvels <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON>. Why bother?
Because, he says, insect breeders will be able to sell bugs
trained to search out a particular enemy more effectively.
<PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> says he's in negotiations to license the
technology to several companies.
   The professor also is teaming up with botanists to try to
make life easier for natural enemies. A case in point is
Encarsia formosa, a parasitic wasp used to counter the white
fly. "Encarsia formosa," <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> admits, "is a
rather stupid animal in several respects." Peering through
their microscopes, entomologists noted that the wasp kept
stumbling into the minute hairs on cucumber leaves as it
looked for white-fly larvae. "It's like a drunken man on a
sidewalk with many lamp posts," <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> explains.
   The obvious solution was to seek out a strain of cucumbers
with hairless leaves. But researchers found that Encarsia
formosa, when set loose on a hairless leaf, zipped around so
fast it was liable to pass over a juicy larva without even
noticing. Somehow, the wayward wasp had to be slowed down.
The answer: promote a type of cucumber with <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> less leaf
hair.
   With such discoveries, <PERSON>Mr. van Lenteren</PERSON> says, "we are
scoring in international journals."
   Suppliers boast about their lab feats, too. One of the hot
areas of research revolves around uses for nematodes.
   Bunting already is promoting its Nemasys brand of
nematodes as a scourge for sciarid flies and vine weevils.
Stored in a special gel, the nematodes come in convenient
packages of 50 million. <PERSON>James Finch</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bunting</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing
manager, concedes it's difficult for customers to be sure of
the count in each pack. "They have to trust us," he says.

APHIDS INFLICTING HUGE LOSSES ON ORGANIC FARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organic farmers in <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION> stand to lose <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in crops 
this year because of the worst outbreak of aphids in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Growers, who blame the outbreak on drought conditions, say that crops most 
endangered by the insect are organically grown lettuce, broccoli, cabbage and 
celery. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mountains, all the vegetation is dry up there, so they come after our 
crop in stronger numbers," said organic farmer <PERSON>Dean Walsh</PERSON>. "This is the worst 
year we've had in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the central coast, organic farmers are trying to exterminate armies 
of the tiny, winged insects. They say they are severely hampered, however, 
because -- unlike other farmers -- they do not use pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had an aphid problem like we've never seen in our lives," said <PERSON>Mary Ann 
Sprinkle</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION>Carpinteria</LOCATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>California Certified 
Organic Farmers</ORGANIZATION>. "Aphids are on things I've never seen them on before." 
</P>
<P>
There is only a small contingent of organic farmers in <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION>. Fourteen 
farmers till 1,200 acres, producing between <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> of 
vegetables and fruit, growers estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Without organic solutions to the aphid outbreak, "you're looking at a 
multimillion-dollar loss for the county," said <PERSON>Bob Scowcroft</PERSON>, executive 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>California Certified Organic Farmers</ORGANIZATION>, which represents 630 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
While other farmers can spray chemicals to rid their produce of the pest, 
organic farmers say they are almost powerless to prevent the damage aphids can 
wreak. They are turning to nontoxic methods to kill the irksome insects: soapy 
water, and other bugs. 
</P>
<P>
Organic farmers have been spraying their fields with soapy water by hand to 
wash aphids off their crops. They also have introduced ladybugs and lacewings, 
which feed on aphids, into their fields to reduce the aphid population. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh runs the largest organic farm in <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION>, a 540-acre ranch in 
<LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, and a 280-acre farm near <LOCATION>Lompoc</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara County</LOCATION>. His farm 
ships about 1 million cartons of organic vegetables to domestic markets each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The green bugs suck vegetables dry, ruining produce that is ready for market. 
Even vegetables believed to be clean of bugs have made their way to supermarket 
stands, only to be found sprinkled with aphids. 
</P>
<P>
About <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON>'s green vegetables were lost to hungry aphids last 
month when 15 acres were infested, he said. Harvested crops had to be dumped 
after supermarkets discovered the insect and rejected the produce. 
</P>
<P>
While organic farmers blame lack of rain for the aphid outbreak, county 
agriculture officials refrain from attributing the outbreak only to the 
drought. They say the bugs are returning as part of a seasonal reproductive 
cycle, but admit the population is unusually large this year. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Phil Phillips</PERSON>, a pest management specialist with the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> 
farm adviser's office in <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>, said lack of rain has broken down the 
resistance of crops to predatory insects such as aphids. Moreover, plant 
physiology changes during periods of drought and actually makes them more tasty 
to their enemies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The plant, when it's under stress, produces more proteins in the plant sap. In 
doing that, it produces a more nutritious meal," <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. Hungry aphids 
see it as "akin to eating filet mignon as opposed to hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
Aphids leave tell-tale signs of their feasting, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. After the bug 
has sucked a plant dry, its leaves curl under or wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
The only spray organic farmers can use is a soapy insecticide that dries out 
aphids, but it has only a "mediocre" deterrent effect, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, organic farmers have begun planting other crops to divert aphids away 
from commercially grown vegetables. They are planting alfalfa, mint and 
marigold flowers, <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> farm is bracing itself for another attack on the cucumber 
and tomato harvest next month, <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before there were farmers, there were aphids," he said. "We're always 
preparing for them." 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMER TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say the most common signs of aphid infestation are: 
</P>
<P>
* Aphids that are visible on the skin or outer leaves of vegetables or fruits. 
</P>
<P>
* Wrinkled, curling or deformed leaves that indicate aphids have been sucking 
the juices out of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
* Discoloration, such as small yellow specks, particularly on the outer leaves 
of cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
* A sticky, filmy residue on the outer leaves and skin. 
</P>
<P>
Produce that does have aphids can still be eaten, growers said. They add that a 
thorough rinse of the vegetable usually gets rid of the bugs.

TINY ASH WHITEFLY LAYING SIEGE TO TREES AND TEMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Carol Mueller</PERSON>, a gardening enthusiast, has abandoned her hobby because a 
swirling white cloud of pinhead-sized flies has invaded every corner of her 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
When the Van Nuys woman must go outside, she wears two bandannas to protect her 
hair and ears. She waves her hands to keep tiny flies off her body and 
frequently coughs and puffs air out her nose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's driving me crazy. They are all over. You wonder if you are breathing them 
in," she said, exasperated. "It's horrifying. When I touch my plants, a cloud 
rises up in my face." 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of <DATE>summer</DATE>, the wrath of the ash whitefly, a pest without 
enemies, reached an explosive crescendo throughout <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, 
attacking millions of trees and prompting an unprecedented outcry from 
fly-tormented homeowners, especially in <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
From Van Nuys to <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> and throughout most of Orange, 
<LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Bernardino</LOCATION> counties, thousands upon thousands of residents 
who have long found cool comfort beneath their shade trees are under siege by 
what is perhaps the most menacing insect to have swept into residential 
neighborhoods, agricultural officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecues have been canceled or ruined. Patio furniture has stayed in the 
garage. Housework has doubled. Many residents have purchased car covers and 
others keep a bucket of cleaning solution on hand to wipe flies and their 
sticky droppings off windshields. 
</P>
<P>
Windows stay closed. The insects stick to hair like dandruff. Simply chatting 
outside with a neighbor is an arm-flailing exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had anything that comes close to matching the citizen-based outcry 
over this," said <PERSON>Bob Atkins</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> deputy agricultural 
commissioner for pest prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"They are everywhere. Everywhere!" said <PERSON>Lynn Olson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION>, whose front and 
back yard trees are teeming with flies. "Some days I feel like taking an ax to 
every tree on the block. It's so frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said his office has received up to 200 calls 
a day from fly-tormented homeowners, forcing officials to install a tape 
recording. Throughout the county, local city officials say they too are 
receiving scores of calls. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no good news for callers. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually nothing can stop the flies, entomologists said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immune to Sprays 
</P>
<P>
They multiply with lightning speed and have wax-coated wings that are almost 
immune to pesticide sprays. Residents who do spray find only a few hours 
respite from the swarms and inadvertently kill insects that can be beneficial 
to gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Others have turned to drilling holes in their trees and inserting intravenous 
capsules that leach pesticides in the hope that lethal doses will eventually 
flow far enough to kill the leaf-sucking flies. Agriculture officials 
discourage the practice because it is only a temporary fly killer and repeated 
boring kills trees. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, some residents are screwing high-pressure nozzles on their 
garden hoses and shooting water on their infested trees in an attempt to blast 
away the pests. 
</P>
<P>
The flies come right back. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is tell people to deep water and fertilize their trees to keep 
them as healthy as possible," <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said. "Unfortunately, that's not what 
people want to hear. We are used to quick kills with pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
The flies attack a wide variety of trees, attaching themselves like white 
crusts and laying eggs on the undersides of leaves. The flies are slowly 
sucking the life out of two of the region's most popular shade trees -- ash and 
ornamental pear. 
</P>
<P>
But they also have an appetite for others, including loquat, pomegranate, 
Christmas berry, peach and plum. They will also latch onto citrus, but it is 
not a primary "host tree," agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Infested trees will "live under stress" for several years before dying. 
</P>
<P>
The flies, which were first detected in <DATE>July, 1988</DATE>, by a Van Nuys 
vegetable-stand owner, have no natural predators in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, the 
first North American region to host the fly. The insect is a native of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 
and the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ash whitefly was identified by state entomologists, it had 
spread throughout <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION>, free from European species of wasps and 
ladybugs that control the flies in their native lands. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say the main hope for ash whitefly control is to import 
the enemy insects. This week, a state entomologist who is in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> sent back 
two boxes of the stingerless wasps and ladybugs to <LOCATION>UC Riverside</LOCATION>, where the 
insects will be studied. 
</P>
<P>
If the predators can survive and breed in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, feed off the 
whitefly and not become destructive pests themselves, they could be turned on 
the ash whitefly as early as next <DATE>spring</DATE>, said <PERSON>Thomas Bellows</PERSON>, <LOCATION>UC Riverside</LOCATION> 
associate professor of entomology and the whitefly expert supervising the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Then, it would take anywhere from two to eight years before residents will 
detect any kind of population reduction, agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Early predictions of devasting effects on the state's $831-million-a-year 
nursery industry have not come to pass, state agricultural officials and 
several large growers said. The infestation has not struck the mammoth 
<MONEY>$634-million</MONEY> citrus industry either. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the flies have been mainly attracted to big, healthy trees growing 
along residential streets and shading the back yards of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Infested trees rain droplets of a molasses-like substance -- the ultimate 
insult, fly excrement. When the flies swarm, the excretion floats through the 
air and settles like sticky dew. Dead, sticky leaves turn moldy and drop onto 
the sticky ground. The sweet substance attracts ants. 
</P>
<P>
"The floor, the furniture, the mini-blinds, everything is coated with sticky 
stuff," said <PERSON>June Amacher</PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION>. "Leaves stick to the cat, my feet 
stick to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Two houses down from <PERSON>Amacher</PERSON>'s, the <LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION> family keeps a bucket of soapy 
water and a squeegee on the porch to wash their car windows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pain. Every time I drive, I have to clean the windows or else I can't 
see," said <PERSON>Troy Huntington</PERSON>, 17. "And if I walk outside barefoot, it doesn't 
feel so good." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Whittier</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sylvia Ochoa</PERSON>, 34, said a recent back yard gathering was ruined 
when flies began swirling around her guests. First, her friends thought the 
nearby hills were on fire because so much ash was floating in the air. 
</P>
<P>
No, <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> told them, it was the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
"Then for some reason the flies were attracted to the ladies with hair spray," 
<PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> said. "It was kind of funny, they all left with white flies stuck to 
their hair." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 miles south, <PERSON>Lorean Wirt</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Cerritos</LOCATION> was dumbfounded several weeks ago 
when she found that her gold car parked beneath the ornamental pear tree was 
covered with a white veil. When she brushed the vehicle, flies swooshed up 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disgusting," the 30-year-old woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she dreads seeing neighbors on her way out to her fly-swathed car. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even want to open my mouth and say hello. I just nod my head, wave and 
get in the car as fast as I can. It's the safest thing to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in <LOCATION>Van Nuys</LOCATION>, the flies were so thick on <ORGANIZATION>Enfield Avenue</ORGANIZATION> that resident <PERSON>Tom 
Spicklemire</PERSON> is reluctant to fire up the barbecue and grill himself a steak. 
</P>
<P>
"The second you take the meat off the grill, flies start landing on it," he 
said. "It's miserable." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carol Mueller</PERSON> across the street echoed the wishes of many who have found 
themselves under ash whitefly siege. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for a cold, wet <DATE>winter</DATE>," she said. "Maybe that will take care of 
the little devils."

   Back in the <DATE>1870s</DATE>, a destructive insect known
as the cottony cushion scale arrived on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> from
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and began sucking on <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s fledgling citrus crops.
   A decade or so later, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> imported some
Vedalia beetles, or Australian ladybugs, natural enemies of the
scale in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, which didn't have problems with the cottony
cushion scale.
   Within months, the scale was vanquished and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> went on to
become famous for groves of oranges, lemons and other citrus.
   ``It's been shipped around the world and it's done a good job
wherever there's been cottony cushion scale,'' says <PERSON>Jack R. Coulson</PERSON>
of the department's <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>, talking about the
beetle.
   Scale pests generally have membranes or scale-like coverings, he
said in a telephone interview. They usually remain in one place
while attacking branches and stems. The cottony cushion scale is
sort of fuzzy looking, hence its name.
   <PERSON>Coulson</PERSON>, who is director of his agency's biological control
documentation center, is one of many involved in <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s 100th
anniversary of the saving of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s citrus industry by the
deliberate introduction of a natural enemy to pests, the <LOCATION>Vedalia</LOCATION>
beetle.
   Nowadays, such use of predators, parasites and disease organisms
to fight unwanted pests is called biological control.
   Festivities at the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s administration building through
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> include exhibits of live insects and fish, including one
that gobbles up unwanted hydrilla vegetation in streams and
irrigation ditches.
   Another success, also in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, involved a colorful but
poisonous weed called <ORGANIZATION>St. Johnswort</ORGANIZATION>, which in <LOCATION>Humboldt County</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1945</DATE> ``literally held this prime grazing land in its grasp,'' wrote
<PERSON>Lloyd A. Andres</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s research center in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, in a
report several years ago.
   The <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> introduced a shiny
blue-green beetle, which in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had fed exclusively
on <LOCATION>St. Johnswort</LOCATION> or closely related plants. By <DATE>1950</DATE>, the weed in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was ``well on its way to being controlled,'' <PERSON>Andres</PERSON> said.
   But the pests and their natural enemies must be matched up
accurately, he said. For example, early shipments of mites, Aceria
chondrilla juncea, to control rush skeletonweed, failed to take
hold. The mites, from <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, were not compatible with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
weed. A second shipment of mites, from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, readily established
themselves.
   In another case, a small parasite from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> was introduced in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to control the the walnut aphid established in coastal
areas but failed in the warmer interior valleys. So aphids were
imported from <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, where the climate more closely resembled that of
the interior <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> areas.
   One of the most promising of today's biological controls involves
half a dozen species of parasitic wasps from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> to
combat the alfalfa weevil. Between <DATE>1981</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>, nearly 20 million
of the beneficial wasps were released at thousands of locations.
   Department experts say the wasps already have significantly
reduced the amount of chemical pesticides used to control alfalfa
weevils.

FLYTRAPS CAPTURE BUGS AND MORE -- STUDENTS' ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Questions erupted the moment <PERSON>Teri Uyemura</PERSON>'s sixth-graders opened their science 
books <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and saw the color photo of a Venus' flytrap devouring a 
housefly. 
</P>
<P>
"How does it kill the fly?" 
</P>
<P>
"Will it bite my finger off too?" 
</P>
<P>
"Does the bug ever escape?" 
</P>
<P>
While the accompanying essay, "Insect eaters of the plant world," did its best 
to explain the phenomenon, Uyemura looked around her class and saw more than a 
few doubters. 
</P>
<P>
What would really drive her science lesson home, Uyemura thought, was a live 
demonstration of how bladderworts, pitcher plants, sundews or the exotic <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' 
flytraps actually captured and gobbled down their prey. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, on her way home from <LOCATION>Washington Middle School</LOCATION>, a sprawling, 
1920s building in <LOCATION>northwest Pasadena</LOCATION>, Uyemura stopped at a local nursery. On 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, she marched into class carrying five bona fide <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytraps 
she had purchased for <MONEY>five dollars</MONEY> each. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get reimbursed for things like that, but I feel the kids have to see 
how it happens, so it's not just something they read in a book," Uyemura 
explained. "If that makes it more exciting for them, then it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura thought it especially important to grab her students' interest this 
week because it marks the beginning of the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester and a new lesson 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
All fall, the sixth grade had studied health science, learning about hearts, 
brains and human reproduction. From now on, they would focus on the natural 
sciences. Uyemura believed that carnivorous plants, which lured insects to 
their death by secreting drug-like poisons, were loaded with enough 
science-fiction-type drama to capture her students' imagination as surely as 
the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap captured bugs. 
</P>
<P>
First came the book lesson. Uyemura called on students to read aloud while she 
wrote down key facts on the blackboard, her chalk slap-slapping against the 
greenish-black surface, her letters as neat and rounded as a sample in a 
penmanship book. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better be writing down all these facts because you're going to need them 
for your reports," Uyemura admonished the class. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man, I thought you said we only had to write down three facts," grumbled a 
voice from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't say that," Uyemura answered evenly, and kept writing about how 
the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap had hinged leaves with reddish centers that secreted a 
sweet-smelling liquid to attract insects. The plant also had tiny trigger hairs 
that caused the leaves to snap shut when the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap sensed prey. 
</P>
<P>
Once ensnared, the plant secreted juices like stomach acids to break the insect 
down into needed nutrients. Botanists who sliced open these plants had found 
leftovers -- tiny undigested insect parts, Uyemura told the class. 
</P>
<P>
In the front of the room, <PERSON>Margaret Gonzalez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lupe Jaramillo</PERSON> scrunched up 
their faces and exchanged looks of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those plants are nasty," added 12-year-old <PERSON>Miesha McCall</PERSON>, who wore a 
pink jacket and fashionable red shoes embossed with gold trim. "I think it's 
gross how they eat those flies." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd put the bug on the end of a straw and stick it near the plant," she added. 
"I don't want it to bite my finger off." 
</P>
<P>
Her friend <PERSON>Aisha Owens</PERSON>, wearing a pink warm-up suit, her long hair braided in 
cornrows, looked at her askance. 
</P>
<P>
"Nuh-uh, it's just a plant. It doesn't hurt if it touches your finger," <PERSON>Aisha</PERSON> 
advised her friend. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither girl had ever seen a Venus' flytrap before, they were familiar 
with the concept thanks to a <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> video game called <ORGANIZATION>Super Mario Brothers</ORGANIZATION>. 
In the game, players lead a little character through a danger-strewn path to 
rescue a princess. One of the recurring obstacles is a voracious <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytrap 
that pops up at unexpected moments to swallow the character. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, it was time to feed the flesh-and-blood flytraps. Uyemura 
divided the students into groups of six and placed a plant in front of each 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Next, she sent a five-student expedition into the woodsy corners of the 
sprawling campus to hunt down aphids, ants, pill bugs and whatever else they 
could scavenge. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the girls were aghast to learn that ladybugs also might be sacrificed 
as plant chow. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, don't kill the ladybug. It's pretty and it's a good bug," begged <PERSON>Tonique 
Delaney</PERSON>, when one of her fellow hunters captured one of the round, red insects 
on a grassy slope. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Camea Gholar balked at touching bugs. But egged on by the others, she 
was soon poking into bushes in pursuit of more insects, as she cradled a lone 
pill bug gingerly in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I got me a whole family," said <PERSON>Shahe Demirjian</PERSON>, opening his palm to show a 
cache of rolled-up gray pill bugs, also known on the playground as roly-polys. 
</P>
<P>
As the kids returned, bearing their bugs in firmly clenched fists and 
scoop-shaped pieces of paper, the excitement mounted. 
</P>
<P>
"The students who captured the bugs get to feed them to the plant," Uyemura 
announced, to a chorus of disappointed moans. 
</P>
<P>
But there were plenty to go around. 
</P>
<P>
"Oooooh, get in there," the students exclaimed, helping the pill-bugs into the 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytraps with the tips of pencils. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going in." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the trigger hairs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, somebody, give me some insects." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment they were silent. Then, a chorus of howls left from their throats, 
as group after group watched the plants snap shut, trapping the unfortunate 
insects inside. 
</P>
<P>
One plant closed around an insect's upper half, leaving the other end wriggling 
while the children clustered around in fascinated horror. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, your plant is hungry." 
</P>
<P>
"That plant tried to bite <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>' finger off." 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura explained that the <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' flytraps would take at least half a day to 
digest their meals. Then they would reopen. Seven kids were so taken with the 
strange plants that they promised to bring <MONEY>$5</MONEY> to school the next day if Uyemura 
would buy them each their own pet plant. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, the lunch bell rang and, still flushed with excitement from their 
botany lesson, the sixth-graders of Room 115 headed off to eat their own meals. 
</P>
<P>
Later, <ORGANIZATION>Uyemura</ORGANIZATION> would assign the class to write essays about what they had just 
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Frayre would phrase his thoughts most eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
Carnivorous plants, wrote Frayre, "are a death wish for insects."

<TEXT>
<P>
The news spread quickly <DATE>Friday</DATE> that more malathion is coming to <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION>, a 
city already subjected to seven aerial pesticide bombardments in the battle 
against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
And the judgment on the streets was just as swift. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they still spraying?" demanded resident <PERSON>Jackie VanGrol</PERSON>, selecting 
groceries in a supermarket. "We haven't found any more flies and this aerial 
spraying just isn't safe. This was a bad decision. They need to consider the 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Another shopper, <LOCATION>Snow Pecinovsky</LOCATION>, agreed with VanGrol, but expressed confusion 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what should be done," <PERSON>Pecinovsky</PERSON> said. "What happens if they stop 
spraying? What will that mean? How dangerous is malathion? I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Although the announcement was not made until early <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> 
many residents and business owners had already heard about the indefinite 
extension. The overwhelming majority opposed further spraying, saying it was 
unhealthy and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a round of spraying overnight <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that had 
been promised to be the last. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous," said B&amp;J Auto Parts store owner <PERSON>Paul Schafer</PERSON>. "I think 
we've opened <ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION>'s box by continuing with the spraying. No one can say 
what's going to be the long-term effect on our health." 
</P>
<P>
In the shop, <PERSON>Shafer</PERSON>'s wife <PERSON>Arlene</PERSON> said the spraying doesn't bother her, but 
customer <PERSON>Paul Parry</PERSON> said the safety of malathion has yet to be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"We've wasted an awful lot of money just to save some fruit," said <PERSON>Parry</PERSON>, a 
<ORGANIZATION>Garden Grove</ORGANIZATION> resident of 35 years. "What about the people? Don't they count? I 
think we need to take a look at our priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Parry called the decision to resume spraying a blatant disregard of residents' 
wants and needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the way our so-called legislators express their concern about the 
citizens, we should get rid of them," <PERSON>Parry</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"One person is worth a million oranges," said <PERSON>Rae Arroyo</PERSON>, local record store 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
"What are they trying to do? So we get our oranges from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> -- big deal. 
Enough is enough. You do it once, twice, three times and it doesn't work. 
Enough is enough. Stop it. The people don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of those interviewed, <PERSON>Shafer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Parry</PERSON> expressed concern over 
malathion's effect on gardening. Shafer showed <ORGANIZATION>Polaroid</ORGANIZATION> pictures taken <DATE>Friday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME> of his aphid-infested strawberry plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Malathion doesn't touch the aphids -- they stay on the underside of the leaf," 
<PERSON>Shafer</PERSON> said. "I haven't seen my shrubs so full of them in at least 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Shafer</PERSON> said he hasn't seen a ladybug in over four months. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen come fall and you want pollination to take place?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-year <ORGANIZATION>Garden Grove</ORGANIZATION> resident <PERSON>Sybil Mermer</PERSON> also worried about what the 
spraying would do to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've killed all the ladybugs and bumblebees -- how are the plants going to 
get pollinated?" Mermer asked. "This just isn't logical. I don't think the 
spraying is going to help one doggone bit." 
</P>
<P>
Of 24 residents interviewed <DATE>Friday, 18</DATE> said they are opposed the spraying, 
citing concerns over long- and short-term effects on health. The others were 
either indifferent or felt they didn't know enough about the subject to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey produced repeated suggestions that the government look into 
alternatives to aerial spraying, including mandatory fruit tree stripping, 
ground spraying, better import controls and bringing in an insect that will 
consume the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should go back to doing what my grandfather and great-grandfather 
did, using natural bugs to get rid of the pests," said <PERSON>Bonnie Dowling</PERSON>, who 
works in <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A brief history of the <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION>'s on-again, off-again war on the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> 
fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
July-August, <DATE>1989</DATE>: Nearly three-dozen fertile Medflies are found in the <LOCATION>Elysian 
Park</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. The state responds with limited malathion spraying, 
sterile releases and fruit quarantining. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Nov. 17, 1989</DATE>: Orange County's first Medfly is discovered in <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION>.

<P>
<DATE>Nov. 30, 1989</DATE>: State helicopters swoop down over an eight-square-mile area 
around <LOCATION>Brea</LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION>'s first aerial malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Dec. 8, 1989</DATE>: State officials, conceding that they greatly underestimated the 
Medfly's hold in the area and its threat to the state's agriculture, 
drastically escalate their attack. They order more sprayings over a wide swath 
of residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Jan. 10, 1990</DATE>: A fertile Medfly is found in <LOCATION>Garden Grove</LOCATION>, triggering spraying 
two weeks later in a 36-mile area that includes nine <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> cities. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>March 20</DATE>: Despite warnings from their scientific advisers, agriculture 
officials announce that spraying over most areas will end by <DATE>May 9</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
May 4: Medfly scientific advisers say spraying should continue and be used more 
aggressively. State agriculture officials, conceding they were too optimistic 
about the <DATE>May 9</DATE> deadline, accept the recommendation in principle. More spraying 
dates will be announced next week.

<TEXT>     They say the end result could be fruits and vegetables sprayed with fewer
pesticides.;   "The silver lining here is that we could end up with healthier
crops," said <PERSON>Kevin Heinz</PERSON>, a research entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, Davis.;   But consumers will feel a price- and supply-pinch all
winter because of the infestation, which has already seen thick clouds of tiny
bugs all but denude markets of seasonal cantaloupes.;   Other produce also has
been ravaged, with prices for head lettuce ranging as high as <MONEY>$1.59</MONEY> at some
markets before dropping to just under <MONEY>$1</MONEY> this week.;   Altogether, the bugs
attack about 500 different plants.;   <ORGANIZATION>Heinz</ORGANIZATION>, one of several scientists working
to find a natural predator to keep the whitefly population under control, says
a small ladybug-like beetle now appears to be the most promising possible
future answer. In laboratory tests, the beetle feasts on poinsettia whiteflies
and their larvae, which have resisted extermination by chemical pesticides and
other predators.;   "Based on all the evidence, the beetle is very promising,"
<PERSON>Heinz</PERSON> said. "But we would have to test it large-scale before I would recommend
a large-scale purchase or massive breeding. I would rather not see farmers
spend <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> to acquire large numbers of these beetles until
we've tested it more.";   If farmers are forced to control the whitefly with
large releases of beetles, they'll have to use fewer of the synthetic
organophosphates and other chemicals that they've used to keep insects under
control in the past. Most insecticides would kill the predator along with
adult whiteflies, but they have not been effective in killing whitefly
larvae.;   If the beetle doesn't prove an effective whitefly fighter,
consumers may see big changes in the future mix of winter produce available in
supermarkets.;   "There aren't a lot of other resources where we can get
iceberg head lettuce," said <PERSON>Judi Decker</PERSON>, an executive of <ORGANIZATION>Lucky Stores</ORGANIZATION>, a
428-market <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> chain.;   It was the precise mix of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Valley</ORGANIZATION>
crops and the order in which they were planted this year that allowed the
proliferation of the poinsettia whitefly, a variety that was new to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
and probably migrated aboard plants shipped in from other <LOCATION>Sun Belt states.</LOCATION>;  
"The hosts this year were an ideal combination," said <PERSON>Keith Mayberry</PERSON>, a farm
adviser at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California Cooperative Extension</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION>.
"We had cotton maturing in the <DATE>spring</DATE>, followed by melons and then cauliflower
and broccoli. That was a routine crop pattern in the past.";   All those crops
proved ideal fodder for the whiteflies, which lay their eggs on the underside
of leaves. The larvae kill their hosts by sucking sap from the leaves.;  
"It's not that we can't grow crops even with whiteflies around," said
<PERSON>Mayberry</PERSON>. "But we may have to terminate crops early if we see they're going to
fail.";   He said farmers in the nearby <LOCATION>Yuma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, area suffered less than
one-tenth as much damage as <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Valley</ORGANIZATION> because they plant a different
crop mix.  </TEXT>

   Root rot and crown rot, army worms and cutworms, blister beetles
and Japanese beetles, lace bugs, mealy bugs and spittle bugs: this
is just a sampling of the ills that plants are heir to.
   Some can be prevented; some treated by natural or chemical means.
   Many experts say that a healthy plant is less likely to succumb
to illness or damage, while others say this may be more coincidence
than direct cause and effect. But it's generally agreed that the
conditions that make the plant healthy are also likely to help curb
the spread of pests and disease.
   <PERSON>Joel Flagler</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION> agricultural-resources
management agent for <LOCATION>Bergen County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, says that for a plant to
be healthy, it must be suited to the conditions under which it will
grow. Soil, moisture and light must all be appropriate. He and
others suggest having soil tested. It can be done through the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension</ORGANIZATION> services
throughout the country. And there are kits for testing soil oneself.
   Some pests can be avoided or controlled through ``companion
planting'' _ planting one plant as a decoy or pest repellent near
another that one is cultivating. <PERSON>Thalassa Cruso</PERSON>, in ``Making
Vegtetables Grow,'' suggests nasturtiums to lure aphids from
cucumbers, marigolds to control root nematodes (microscopically
small worms), and plenty of garlic as an overall repellent. She also
relays suggestions that dill will keep away tomato worms, mint
provides insurance against ants, and radishes protect cucumbers,
squash and melons.
   Rotating crops is another way to keep pests or disease from
getting established. And gardeners can buy certified seed and plants
bred to be disease-resistant. Also, isolate for a while any new
plant you acquire through gift or purchase, so you can determine
whether it is healthy.
   And don't forget the bugs that eat other bugs, and the birds with
their appetite for insects.
   A home gardener who has read up on the subject or had a bit of
experience may be able to diagnose some plant problems: Highly
visible white flies, the fine webs that spider mites leave on the
underside of leaves, Japanese beetles. If a plant is cut off at the
soil line, you may find a cutworm (a type of grub) in the
surrounding soil. Remove and squash it.
   Remove-and-squash is not a particularly attractive idea, but it's
also useful against tomato worms, slugs, Japanese beetles and the
Japanese beetle grub, which resembles a cutworm.
   Other plant ailments are harder to diagnose, and the gardener may
wish to follow the suggestion of ``1,000 Garden Questions, Vol.
II,'' edited by <PERSON>Marjorie Dietz</PERSON>, and send a sample to the nearest
Agricultural Experiment Station for analysis.
   In the case of some pests, a strong blast of water from a hose
may drive them away. A spraying with insecticidal soap is another
possible solution.
   Then there are the pesticides.
   Some _ rotenone and pyrethrum, for instance _ have organic
sources. They come from plants. Others are chemical compounds.
   Garden experts urge one to use any pesticide exactly as directed.
   They warn, too, that what harms the pest may also hurt other
insect or animal life. For instance, <PERSON>Elvin MacDonald</PERSON>, director of
special projects at the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Botanic Garden</ORGANIZATION>, says that
systemic pesticides, working through the soil, may hurt friendly
bacteria as well as harmful ones.
   For anyone inclined to blame geography for his gardening
troubles, <PERSON>Dara Emery</PERSON>, a plant breeder at the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Botanic Garden</PERSON>, offers consolation of a sort: Most plant problems
can occur anywhere. True, he says, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> roses have less black
spot and rust, but mildew and spotted mites still cause problems.
And people in other parts of the country don't have the problem of
salts that get into the soil in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> through needed irrigation.
   Finally, the gardener pestered by pests can always resort to an
old-fashioned solution mentioned by <ORGANIZATION>MacDonald</ORGANIZATION>: Grow enough for
everyone, including the insects.

<TEXT>
   A century after an <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> scout
found an Australian beetle that saved <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s citrus crop, the
government on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> announced an escalation of it bug-vs.-bug
program of biological warfare against nature's pests.
   The department said agreements had been reached to send American
scientists to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> this <DATE>summer</DATE> to search
unexplored areas for natural enemies of destructive insects and
weeds.
   ``We're raising the priority of making biocontrol a vital part of
American food and fiber production,'' said <PERSON>R. Dean Plowman</PERSON>, head of
the <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Taiwanese-born pathologist <ORGANIZATION>Yang Shaw-Ming</ORGANIZATION> will go to <LOCATION>Inner
Mongolia</LOCATION> in search of a fungus that can destroy the leafy spurge, an
aggressive weed which drives grazing cattle and horses away from
rangeland at a cost to ranchers that he estimated at <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>.
   At the same time, five <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> scientists will go
to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to look for enemies of the Russian wheat aphid,
a pest that was appeared in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> three years ago and has spread
into 15 states.
   Working with their Russian counterparts, they also will try to
find biological controls to use against grasshoppers, the leafy
spurge, the Russian thistle and a number of other pests.
   Scientists said the problems that plague farms and backyards
alike often arose because crops brought into this country were
frequently accompanied by pests _ but not by the pests' natural
enemies.
   The announcement was made at a ceremony marking the first big
victory, a century ago, in biological controls.
   Deputy Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Peter Myers</PERSON> recalled that victory.
He said in <LOCATION>1888 California</LOCATION>'s citrus trees were covered by the large
white egg sacs of the cottony cushion scale, threatening the state's
fledlging citrus industry.
   The <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> dispatched a scout, <PERSON>Albert Koebele</PERSON>, to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to look
for a natural enemy of the pest. He found one feeding on scale in a
garden in <LOCATION>North Adelaide</LOCATION> _ the black and orange Vedalia beetle.
   Twenty-eight of the beetles were released in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Nov.
30, 1888</DATE>, and the problem was under control within a year.
   Since then, hundreds of biological control agents have been
introduced in American agriculture, sparing the environment from
tons of chemical pesticides and saving farmers <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>.
   To mark the occasion, an exhibition was opened to show how
predatory beetles, aggressive parasites and deadly disease organisms
are used to keep agricultural pests in check.
   <PERSON>William Metterhouse</PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION>Division of Plant Industry</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
``economically important insects'' have been found abroad.
   He said shade trees across this country would be infested with
the gypsy moth, a caterpillar that eats the foliage of more than 500
tree species, if it were not for nine parasites and two predators
brought in from overseas. Now a virus has been developed by <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> as
a weapon against the gypsy moth, <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said.
   Metterhouse said <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> farmers have had to spray eggplant
fields as often as 15 times a season to control the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> potato
beetle. Now a South American egg parasite is being introduced this
<DATE>summer</DATE> and may solve the problem, he said. Ways are being sought to
use the parasite to control the beetle in potato and tomato fields
too.
   Myers used the occasion to announce success in a 30-year, <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> battle against the alfalfa weevil, the largest biological
control effort in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history.
   The campaign has put a parasitic wasp imported from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> into
virtually every alfalfa field in the country, the department said.
   At one time, farmers spent up to <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> a year on pesticides
but the weevil was so persistent that many farmers gave up growing
alfalfa, an important forage crop. Now farmers need spray only one
year in six.

   A natural insecticide derived from an Asian mahogany tree
will soon give consumers an alternative to the synthetic bug
killers that now dominate the lawn care and home gardening
markets.
   The product, developed by W.R. Grace &amp; Co. and to be
distributed by Ringer Corp., will be introduced early next
year. It is intended to challenge such popular synthetic
pesticides as diazinon, malathion and carbaryl, all of which
are toxic to humans and many animals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The seed extract is the latest example of a growing array
of pest-control technologies that rely on biological
mechanisms instead of manufactured chemicals. As more pests
develop resistance to traditional synthetics, and more
consumers become concerned about pesticide health risks, many
chemical makers are accelerating efforts to produce natural
alternatives.
   The extract, known as azadirachtin, comes from seeds of
the neem tree, a tropical mahogany. The tree can't grow in
most <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> climates, but flourishes in many parts of <LOCATION>south
Asia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. For centuries, farmers in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
have used neem seeds to repel insects in grain storage bins.
   The Grace-Ringer alliance could set the stage for a fierce
marketing battle. Synthetic insecticides generate <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sales
of more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> a year. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, more than <MONEY>30 million
pounds</MONEY> of insecticides were applied to residential gardens
and lawns.
   Stakes are high for the makers of these products.
Diazinon, an organophosphate, is the most widely used lawn
and garden pesticide in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. It is made by <ORGANIZATION>Ciba Geigy
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and marketed in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ortho</ORGANIZATION> unit.
<ORGANIZATION>American Cyanamid Co.</ORGANIZATION> makes malathion, another
organophosphate. The most popular brand of carbaryl, called
<PERSON>Sevin</PERSON>, is made by <ORGANIZATION>Rhone-Poulenc S.A.</ORGANIZATION> Organophosphates and
carbaryls kill by attacking the nervous system.
   In contrast, azadirachtin represents a new class of
insecticide that employs a different mechanism. When the
extract is ingested, the insect generally stops eating within
a day. The extract disrupts hormonal changes in the insect
larva, causing death during molting. Jow-Lih Su, a commercial
development specialist for <ORGANIZATION>Grace</ORGANIZATION>, said the extract's
complicated molecule makes it difficult for insects to
develop resistance.
   Greenhouse and field tests have shown that azadirachtin
liquid spray, applied to plant leaves, controls about 170
types of insect pests, including beetles, caterpillars, fruit
flies, crickets, locusts, aphids, weevils, gypsy moths and
mosquitoes.
   Grace researchers found that honey bees and other
beneficial insects that interact with plants only as adults
aren't affected by the product. Neither are earthworms, which
don't molt or eat leaves. Other independent tests indicate
that the product isn't toxic to birds or mammals, including
humans. Ringer officials say the product is safe for contact
by gardeners as soon as it dries, and residues degrade within
a few days.
   Grace, which spent about four years developing the
product, will sell a patented concentrate of the insecticide
to the professional horticultural market under the trade name
Margosan-O. <PERSON>Peter Boer</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Grace</ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president and
chief technical officer, said the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> company also sees
potential applications for a variety of food crops, turf and
forests.
   Ringer, based in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, will offer the product to
home gardeners as Neem starting with its <DATE>spring 1992</DATE>
mail-order catalog and the following year through retailers.
<PERSON>Fred Hundt</PERSON>, Ringer's marketing vice president, said sales
soon could match the company's total volume of about <MONEY>$10
million</MONEY> a year. Moreover, the product may have strong appeal
for organic growers and home gardeners because it leaves no
toxic residue.
   But the relatively short residual effect may make it
necessary to repeat applications several times in a growing
season. Some gardeners who are accustomed to the strong,
immediate "knockdown" effectiveness of synthetic pesticides
may be annoyed by the delayed impact of Neem.

<P>
If your child thinks carrots come from the grocery store and peanuts are 
manufactured in a factory and sealed in a can, perhaps it's time to consider a 
back-yard garden. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of youngsters here who have no idea how vegetables are grown," 
said <PERSON>Jim Bailey</PERSON>, a former agriculture teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Sunny Hills High School</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Fullerton</LOCATION>. He donates his time and expertise at the <ORGANIZATION>Youth Garden</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Orange 
County Fairgrounds</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The fairgrounds in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> operates a youth garden at its year-round farm. 
Youngsters can see firsthand how carrots, lettuce, beans and tomatoes are 
grown. In addition, more unusual "crops" are also grown here -- grapes, 
berries, peanuts and popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
"Tour groups come by to see how these foods are grown as well as visit with the 
animals at the farm," <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. "We started the garden about <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, 
and 16,000 children have come through since then." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> stressed the importance of youngsters knowing about agriculture and 
where they get their food and what it takes to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
"In <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, many children haven't seen gardens or fields of 
vegetables growing," he said. "It's hard for them to realize the time and 
effort it takes to grow what they eat." 
</P>
<P>
That's unfortunate, according to <LOCATION>Bailey</LOCATION>, because a back-yard garden can be an 
educational experience for youngsters. And in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, the weather 
provides opportunities for year-round growing. Even preschoolers can get 
involved on a limited basis. By the time children are 6 or 7, they can take 
further responsibility for a garden with some adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"With youngsters, start by giving them a seed, like squash, and plant it in a 
cup," <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. "When it's about two inches high, they can transplant it out 
in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Radishes are another good choice for first-time farmers, because they grow 
rapidly. In 28 days, they're ready to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"With children, it's nice to grow something fairly quickly to maintain their 
interest," <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. "With carrots, it can take a lot longer for the 
results. By that point, the child may have given up." 
</P>
<P>
During the warmer <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE> months, recommended fruits and vegetables 
for a back-yard garden include beans, tomatoes, melons, cucumbers, 
strawberries, peas and peppers. In the <DATE>fall</DATE> and <DATE>winter</DATE>, turn to the leafy 
members of the vegetable family: cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> 
sprouts and different types of lettuce. Such vegetables as squash and zucchini 
are other garden favorites of children; they are easy to grow and produce 
multiple offerings from one plant. 
</P>
<P>
But what if your yard is too small? Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't need a lot of room to grow vegetables," <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. "In 
fact, I have a planter at home that is four feet wide and about 15 feet long. 
In it I grow radishes, carrots, beets, cauliflower and several types of 
lettuce. In a space that size, about 60 square feet, there's plenty of room to 
grow enough vegetables to feed a whole family." Gardens can also be grown in 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
A six-inch pot is all that's required to grow about four or five beet plants, 
although a tub is needed to grow honeydew. Herbs are another option for 
container gardening, and many nurseries and seed catalogues feature mini, dwarf 
and compact versions of different vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"With very little space, children can learn about the growing cycle and achieve 
hands-on learning," <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. "They begin to understand concepts of 
germination and the effects of the seasons and the weather. Agriculture is a 
science and there's no end to the experiments you can try. You can water one 
area more than another and see what happens. Or fertilize one section and not 
another. Measure the plants as they grow to see how quickly they shoot up. Do 
they grow better in the sun or the shade?" 
</P>
<P>
Children can also be taught the parts of a plant (roots, stem, seeds, leaves) 
and even "dissect" flowers to locate the stamen, petals, sepal and pistil. 
</P>
<P>
Even garden "pests" can provide learning experiences. Bailey recommended 
turning ladybugs loose in the garden to eat the aphids that may appear. 
Earthworms can help aerate the soil and teach children lessons about how 
different life forms interact. Bailey also recommends using organic materials 
to control insects -- especially if children are involved in tending the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
"At the youth garden, we work with integrated pest control," he said. "That 
means we use ladybugs as well as organic materials to control insects. You can 
purchase organic materials at most nurseries. Just check the bottle to make 
sure it says 'organic.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of back-yard gardening is its minimal expense. Other than 
seeds, the only tools that are required are a can or hose for watering, a 
pointed-nose shovel for digging, a hoe for weeding and making furrows, and a 
rake to break up dirt and spread soil. An occasional feeding of fertilizer is 
recommended to enhance growth. But what you spend on the garden can be saved on 
the grocery bill. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the other opportunities around, why is it important for a child to 
know about gardening? 
</P>
<P>
"First, it's educational," <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. "It's a living science experiment, and 
I also think kids need to be involved in a hands-on working environment. And 
gardening is . . . a different kind of work. You get dirty and you get tired, 
but it's worth it when you see the results of your work. Children are very 
proud when their gardens begin to yield fruit and vegetables. . . . They are 
even more likely to eat something if they've grown it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Children can achieve a sense of satisfaction and learn patience while they wait 
for their gardens to bear, <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said. They also learn responsibility by 
nurturing it -- watering, weeding and taking care of garden pests. 
</P>
<P>
As a former agriculture teacher, <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> said he was pleasantly surprised by the 
number of students who wanted to learn more about agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that youngsters are interested in gardening," he said. "If you 
give them the responsibility and some direction, they can do very well."

MEDFLY: AERIAL SPRAYING OF THE PEST PRESUMES KNOWLEDGE OF ITS BEHAVIOR. PROBLEM 
IS, THE STATE'S ERADICATORS HAVEN'T A CLUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BUNN, David Bunn is research director of Pesticide Watch, a statewide 
citizen-based organization working to reduce the use of dangerous pesticides in 
agricultural and urban environments. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In declaring a Medfly "state of emergency" in <DATE>August</DATE>, Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> 
gave the <ORGANIZATION>State Department of Food and Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> and county agriculture 
commissioners the power to spray malathion at will. Yet the goal of eradicating 
the pest is doomed, no matter how much of the pesticide is rained on <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be eradicators presume to know the exact locations of Medfly 
colonies. But they overlook an important behavioral trait of the pest: The fly 
is territorial. It repeatedly returns to one tree, bypassing the tree with the 
trap that is only 10 yards away. Thus, it is likely that there are pockets of 
Medflies throughout the two counties that trapping will completely miss. Worse, 
when a Medfly is caught, the eradicators don't really know what that indicates. 
Are there five or 5,000 others on the loose? 
</P>
<P>
Eradication also presumes that the pest will stay away for many years. Wrong 
again. Medflies were found in <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> in eight of the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>, 
and scientists agree the fly will continue to populate the area because of the 
enormous volume of travelers moving between <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and other countries with 
Medfly populations. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>State Department of Food and Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, nonetheless, claims its aerial 
spraying in <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> in the early '80s wiped out the Medfly. Top 
entomologists have an alternative explanation for the pest's disappearance: two 
consecutive cold winters. The adult Medfly cannot tolerate temperatures below 
45 degrees or above 105 degrees for more than a few hours. When immature, they 
cannot survive temperatures below 40 degrees for a similar period of time. The 
climate in most of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s valleys and major farming regions is thus not 
hospitable to the pest. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, aerial spraying is unnecessary, because trees do not need to be 
drenched with the malathion bait spray to catch a Medfly. The bait is designed 
to be selectively applied. As such, a short burst of the pesticide from the 
ground is adequate in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
That still leaves the question of whether the Medfly has developed a resistance 
to malathion. The pesticide kills active adult flies but is largely ineffective 
during the winter. Beyond that, nobody knows. The effect of malathion on such 
beneficial insects as bees is less uncertain: It kills them. Similarly, 
predator insects, such as ladybugs, that are crucial to controlling pests that 
damage plants or crops are also destroyed by the spraying. By indiscriminately 
dousing with malathion, the state is preparing the ground for other pests that 
will require more pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Humans, of course, also are affected by malathion spraying. The chemical 
attacks the nervous and immune systems. It may cause cancer or birth defects. 
But like most pesticides in use today, research on its long-term health effects 
is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Following the aerial spraying of malathion on <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1981-82</DATE>, 
numerous suits were filed against the state. More than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> in damages 
was sought. Claims to recover the costs of restoring auto paint totaled <MONEY>$16 
million</MONEY>, of which <MONEY>$3.7 million</MONEY> was paid. The bill for similar damage to cars in 
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> will likely be much more. The price tag of the 
health-related suits could be astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical-intensive strategy of eradicating the Medfly is irrational, 
wasteful and damaging to our health and the environment. The state would be far 
wiser to develop a "control program" that would include the release of Medfly 
parasites and predators, the use sterile flies, occasional fruit stripping, 
posting of chemical traps or limited applications of malathion bait on trees.

<LEADPARA>  MOST people remember old homes by their pleasantries: sunlight streaming
through a kitchen window, a back yard's verdant expanse, the neighborhood
peace. I remember my abodes by the bugs that infested them. You name it, I've
battled it: baby Boston and Texas-size cockroaches, crickets of all
proportions, Seattle bees, Santa Ana's giant flying (or gliding, as
entomologists might say) water bugs. By comparison, my latest problem seems
innocuous: Northern California's nocturnal moths. (hbox) Most nights I come
home to find six or eight of these black dusty creatures flattened against my
living room walls, like smirking sentries from some odd underworld bent on
destroying all hope for a blissful, bug-free peace. (hbox) I guess I should
have seen the signs that first fall after college, when I met one of my
prospective housemates, a Harvard law student, for a pre-rental "interview." I
don't remember his name, but he was short and bearded, wore a navy blue down
jacket, had spent the summer working for a San Francisco law firm and seemed
pleasant enough. But his first question was curious. (hbox) "Do you like
bugs?" he asked. He wanted to know whether I liked bugs? Cockroaches, to be
exact. (hbox) "Oh, yeah, sure, live and let live," I said. After all, this guy
held the keys to an affordable apartment within walking distance of Harvard
Square. (hbox) As it turned out, this lawyer-to-be loved bugs. In fact, he
reveled in them. He slept on a futon on the floor in the bedroom closest to
the kitchen -- just to be near them. Sometimes, late at night, they crawled
right up to him and he liked that, he said. This made my stomach turn. And,
looking back, it also marked the end of my carefree, bug-free existence. From
here on out it was me against all manner of them. (hbox) Battling bugs was new
to me, but it has not been what I would call a life-enhancing experience.
(hbox) Thanks to clean suburban living, I enjoyed a relatively bug-free
childhood. I grew up in a Middle Atlantic state where the mosquitoes weren't
bad, bees never stung me and fireflies were something to admire from the
safety of a white concrete patio. If I saw a spider, I simply yelled, "DADDY!"
and then stuck around just long enough to point out the offending critter and
give a good shudder, before getting on with my day.;    Now, I will admit to a
certain fondness for some backyard insects (ladybugs, for their brilliant
beauty) and I will testify to the fact that my friends and I spent a period of
time enthralled by praying mantises. And, yes, when the 17-year cicadas
descended upon our pristine world, we collected their wings. They, after all,
were exotic.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But all this gentle interaction with the world of bugs led to my adult
aversion to all minute beings that creep, crawl or fly -- indoors. My college
education didn't prepare me for the horrors of a pest-ridden post-graduate
life.;    It's not as if I wasn't careful. I never rented a place where
cobwebs covered the window sills or spiders stared out from the bedspreads,
though, believe me, I saw my share. I never kept open packages of food in the
cabinets. And as for stashing flour, the refrigerator's always been the place
for me.;    New home, new bugs;  No, these pests were feline in their
attachment to my various homes. I might hardly have time to unpack before some
new job called me to another state. But they had already spread their antennae
-- or wings -- into every crack and crevice.;    Even from the perspective of
time and empty Raid cans, it is hard to decide which were worse: <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>'s
flying water bugs or <LOCATION>Southern Maryland</LOCATION>'s chirping crickets. The water bugs
(water bug, an entomologist confirms, is simply a euphemism for cockroach,
though my apartment manager insisted the two were unrelated) raised their ugly
antennae (and wings) in my dishwasher, on my bed and on a painting of a palm
tree hanging innocently in a hallway. They also scurried about after dark on
both my sun decks.;    Once, when my friend <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> was visiting from <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, I
enlisted his help in nabbing a particularly large water bug that was evading
capture by hiding behind the toilet. The water bug took a flying leap into a
nightshirt hanging on the bathroom towel rack, and the best <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> could do was
knock both bug and nightshirt into a grocery sack -- with the help of a stick.
Even this guy just in from the last frontier couldn't bring himself to touch a
water bug.;    Long night of chirps;  Still, the crickets were probably worse.
These were in <LOCATION>Huntingtown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, on the western shore of the <LOCATION>Chesapeake Bay</LOCATION>, an
area known as <ORGANIZATION>Tobacco Country</ORGANIZATION>. It was also, as I soon learned, home to an
all-night shrieking, Mexican-jumping-bean variety of black cricket. I lived in
a converted antique shop on a low hill just off Route 4, close enough to smell
the motorcycle exhaust and close enough to the local fire station to keep tabs
on every emergency run. My landlords told me the molding around the bathroom
floor wasn't yet complete, but I didn't think much of it -- until <DATE>spring</DATE>
arrived, and with it, the crickets.;    At first they were just tiny, silent
things that hopped about the bathroom floor. They were easy to nab. But then
they started growing and multiplying and sending forth chirps at all hours of
the <TIME>night</TIME>. And they didn't confine themselves to the bathroom. I would come
home late at night to find packs of them jumping outside my front door. They
were also jumping inside. And soon they lodged themselves in my bedroom walls
and chirped the night away. I sprayed. I smashed them with rolled newspapers.
I knocked them senseless with an old brown shoe. I had the landlords fix the
molding. Nothing helped. Did I care that crickets are an ancient symbol of
good fortune? No. I moved.;    Which brings me to my current problem: those
nocturnal moths. These are in the cozy condo I recently rented below the
<LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION> foothills. Just a short walk to town, nestled in redwoods and near a
real running stream, it's a rather pleasant place. The only annoyances had
been the neighbors' drifting cigarette smoke and a wandering pet that one
morning left a pile of fish-stinking vomit in the carport.;    Night of the
moths;  But then came the moths. When I first visited the apartment, in broad
daylight, they were nowhere to be seen. But what pests ever rear their ugly
heads when a landlord is present? As soon as I moved in, they were there to
taunt me. And a well-worn flyswatter stashed behind the kitchen door confirmed
their persistence.;    So out came my trusty cedar-scented moth spray. And out
came my sachets of herbal moth repellent. Still, each night I came home and
smashed more moths.;    To learn more about these dark and silent creatures, I
called the <ORGANIZATION>University of California Cooperative Extension Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa
Clara</LOCATION>. "A moth," the receptionist said, searching through her pamphlets.
"That's not like a silverfish or a firebrat is it?";    I don't think so.
Silverfish (and firebrats) tend to slither around in the bathtub, eat paper
and leave behind yellow stains. These are all things I recently learned from a
page of information received from <PERSON>Bill Ng</PERSON>, the extension service's master
gardener.;    Ng also gave me a copy of a pamphlet called "Clothes Moths and
Carpet Beetles," from which I learned that my moths are not clothes moths, but
stored-food moths. I had Leaflet 2524; I needed Leaflet 2711.;    The next
morning I went to the <LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION> library to look for it. "You mean food moths,
the ones that fly around your kitchen?" librarian <PERSON>Barbara Hall</PERSON> asked with a
knowing smile. "The only way I know to get rid of them is to move.";    <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>,
it seems, is a food-moth veteran. Her latest batch of moths infested an
unopened bag of sliced almonds, but once they came in with the dog food and
they adore cold cereal, she says. "The cat loves to catch them," she adds.;   
She hasn't seen any in a while, "but they'll get there eventually. I keep
expecting them. As I say, it seems fairly hopeless.";    How can a problem as
small and silent as a moth be hopeless? I drove to <ORGANIZATION>Ng</ORGANIZATION>'s office for Leaflet
2711, "Common Pantry Pests and Their Control." My moths, it seems, are Indian
meal moths, which "breed in spilled food on shelves and in the cracks and
crevices in every kitchen. . . . Most home infestations result from
carelessness in maintaining clean cupboards or from having open packages
around for long periods of time.";    And herein lay the answer.;    My
apartment's previous tenants (who, I am sad to report, are in the food
business), had spilled flour on the top shelves of both sets of kitchen
cabinets. I spent <DATE>several hours one weekend</DATE> cleaning out one side of this
mess. It was so unpleasant that I couldn't even bring myself to peek into the
other side.;    That night I went home to look. And there it was: more spilled
flour and a scattering of dead moths. The landlords say they will come and
clean it.;    And if the moths still don't go away? There's always <PERSON>Barbara
Hall</PERSON>'s advice: Pack my bags and move.;    Ah, but who can predict what new
pest might lie on this renter's horizon?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Lured like other visitors to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
by the warm climate, record numbers of exotic insects are invading
<LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> and posing an unprecedented threat to the state's
<MONEY>$16 billion</MONEY> a year farm economy.
   As of <DATE>July</DATE>, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants,
Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealy bugs and scales.
   ``We are being literally swamped,'' said <PERSON>Rosser W. Garrison</PERSON>, a
county entomologist who supplied the statistics. ``The variety of
insects is increasing, and the sheer number is increasing.''
   Besides the climate, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> has become a magnet for imported
insects because of the ease of international travel. More than 3.7
million foreigners passed through <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Customs at <LOCATION>Los Angeles
International Airport</LOCATION> last year, and at least some presumably
slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors, officials said.
   One of the new pests, the ash whitefly, already has reached
epidemic proportions in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> and is racing for the
state's agricultural heartland _ the <LOCATION>San Joaquin Valley</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>central
California</LOCATION>.
   The city, a hub for commerce with <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, boasts
a burgeoning immigrant population with a taste for fruits and
vegetables from their native countries.
   ``They have friends and family who are sending them a taste of
home,'' said <PERSON>Robert G. Atkins</PERSON>, a deputy county agricultural
commissioner.
   <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said that although <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION>'s farm production is
negligible, the county acts as the entry for pests to the rest of
the state _ the nation's leading agricultural producer.
   He noted that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s belated response to a <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>
fruit fly infestation drew widespread publicity nine years ago,
eventually costing the state <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> to exterminate and farmers
<MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> in losses. But similar invasions lately have become
almost mundane.
   ``I hate to stress that, because I don't want people to believe
that the bug is any less dangerous,'' <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said.
   Nevertheless, three medfly infestations have occurred in the
county within the <DATE>last 12 months</DATE>, each costing roughly <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to
eradicate and each drawing comparatively scant public attention.
   The county's budget for plant quarantine last year was more than
<MONEY>$784,000</MONEY>, an almost <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> increase over <DATE>fiscal year 1977-78</DATE>,
officials said.
   Treatment methods vary for different types of fruit flies, but
early detection is a fundamental strategy, made possible by checking
more than 160,000 baited traps set throughout the state.
   ``It's almost like battling forest fires,'' <PERSON>Garrison</PERSON> said. ``It's
a lot easier to put it out as soon as it gets started.''
   Discoveries of less notorious pests are charted each month by
Garrison, whose microscopic scrutiny detected five new types of
insects in the county <DATE>last year</DATE> and three so far this year.
   Although agriculture officials have established methods of
dealing with fruit fly infestations, other kinds of insects can be
neither readily identified nor exterminated.
   One of the most ruinous new pests, the ash whitefly, apparently
hitchhiked to the suburban <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> or the
<LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. It has no natural enemies in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and its numbers
are exploding.
   ``It is totally out of control,'' <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said. ``The only thing
limiting the population is the number of trees they have to eat. It
is expanding as fast as it can, and chemical (pesticide) control is
just totally not feasible.''
   Although fruit flies, which lay their eggs in hundreds of fruits
and vegetables, are like a cancer, <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said the ash whitefly acts
more like a low-grade virus. It attaches itself to the underside of
leaves and slowly sucks the life out of trees.
   At first, agriculture officials were unconcerned because they
believed the tiny new invader only attacked ornamental trees like
the ash, <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> said.
   But they later discovered the ash whitefly thrives in dozens of
varieties of trees, including olive, pear, apple and peach trees.
   To combat the ash whitefly, agriculture officials have dispatched
an entomologist to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> to collect several varieties of
<LOCATION>Encarsia</LOCATION>, pinhead-sized wasps that are the insect's natural enemy.
   If tests prove successful, millions of the tiny wasps could be
released come <DATE>winter</DATE>, though it probably will be years before the
wasps can significantly reduce the ash whitefly population.

Surprise, surprise, surprise. What do you know? After six or seven years of 
dousing with malathion it seems the infestations are getting worse.

<P>
Do I remember the dousing of flies in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> that finally developed a 
DDT-resistant fly? I think if we work on it we can do the job again. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see -- maybe we could ship our malathion-resistant flies around the world 
so that we could increase our sales of malathion. We used DDT so extensively 
that we almost extinguished one species of birds before someone got the picture 
that indiscriminate chemical warfare on bugs is not the answer to pest control. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of killing off the good guys with the pest, it makes more sense to help 
the good guys. Killing the ladybugs and any other helpful insect, to say 
nothing of bees, small birds and fish, is not my idea of good sense.

<LEADPARA>  PEST control in the '90s is focusing so strongly on environmentally sound
methods that scientists are working overtime trying to unlock the secrets of
chemicals called pheromones.;    That may well be where the greatest strides
in ecologically safe pest control are realized.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ON THE TRAIL OF A BUG-SCENTED, PEST-FREE
GARDEN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Pheromones are insect sex attractants. Adult females of each species use
these powerful scents to lure males when they're ready to mate.;    The insect
world is truly a jungle. Thousands of different kinds of insects inhabit each
acre of ground. Pheromones serve as "identification cards," separating the
beetles from the moths. Insects use pheromones to keep order among the
species.;    While pheromones might be likened superficially to perfumes,
they're much more complex than that. Each one is different. If it weren't,
male beetles of one species, for example, would try to mate with receptive
female beetles of another. They don't.;    Deciphering a pheromone's intricate
chemical code is the first step in reproducing that chemical synthetically.
Already about 40 synthetic pheromones are helping to control some very
pernicious pests.;    Pheromones don't control pest populations in the
traditional sense. Traps, usually coated with a sticky substance, are
outfitted with a vial containing the pheromone, then hung in the field.;    As
the scent is released, males fly toward a trap in hopes of mating with the
"female" inside. Those amorous few are captured and die; no pesticide is
involved.;    There are several reasons why pheromone traps must be considered
just one weapon in our pest control arsenal. The most important is that
pheromone traps do not eliminate females, and females are the ones that lay
eggs.;    Can't catch all;  Also, pheromone traps can't capture enough of the
available males to prevent successful mating. Even if <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> were
captured, the remainder of the males could, in most species, fertilize all the
females.;    Even though pheromone traps do not provide significant insect
population reduction, they are extremely effective for monitoring pest
populations.;    As monitoring devices, pheromone traps primarily enable
growers to pinpoint the appropriate time to spray for a pest, resulting in
more efficient control with fewer sprays.;    Instead of covering apple trees
with as many as 18 pesticide sprays per season, pheromone traps have reduced
that number to two or three for some insects. Research continues to fine-tune
the system and make the apparatus available to orchardists.;    Spray
schedules adjusted;    A pheromone study throughout <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> several years
ago determined that information being disseminated about the rhododendron
borer was correct. Trapping showed borer emergence to be two to three weeks
later than previously suspected. Spray schedules were adjusted accordingly
with better results.;    In addition to rhododendron borer and gypsy moth,
synthetic pheromones have been developed for bagworm, corn earworm, European
corn borer, grape berry moth, lesser peach-tree borer, cabbage looper, black
cutworm, dogwood borer and Oriental fruit moth. All are serious agricultural
or landscape pests.;    Promising developments in pheromone research are
leading entomologists in the direction of a process called mating disruption.
When an area is saturated with pheromone scents, males are so confused they're
unable to locate receptive females.;    Cost still lower;    Much more of the
pheromone is required to disrupt mating than is used in trapping, but costs
are still lower than traditional control methods and fewer pesticides are
needed.;    Mating disruption has significantly reduced populations of grape
berry moths in vineyards and Oriental fruit moths on peaches. Remarkably,
mating disruption has achieved the same level of control as three pesticide
sprays for the lesser peachtree borer in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. The lesser peachtree
borer is also a major problem on peaches in the Northeast.;    Someday
pheromone trapping and mating disruption techniques will be pest control
methods not only available to home gardeners, but taken for granted.  </TEXT>

FT  29 JAN 94 / Gardening: Bring on the predators - Country View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unlikely saviours of British cereal farming may be the humble beetles
which prey on aphids, cereal's natural enemy.
The traditional response to the threat of aphids has been spraying, usually
two or three times a year and at enormous cost.
But since <DATE>1984</DATE>, British scientists have been testing ways of stimulating the
population of natural predators, such as beetles, ladybirds, hoverflies and
spiders.
Up to 400 species of useful insect predators live in the hedgerows of
southern <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and research has been aimed at identifying which are the
most useful, and how farmland can be managed in a way that benefits them.
Time-lapse videos have shown how efficiently predators thin out pests, how
far they forage, and so on.
Long mounds called 'beetle banks' were built - higher and therefore drier
than surrounding land, and if planted with beetle-friendly tussock grasses
also warmer. From these hospitable surroundings, beetles make forays in
<DATE>summer</DATE> to feed, roving up to 100 yards outwards.
The <ORGANIZATION>Biology Department of Southampton University</ORGANIZATION> has been joined by
scientists from the Game Conservancy, which is interested in beetles and
natural predators as part of its crusade to dissuade farmers from using
'broad-spectum' insecticides which leave areas of land devoid of small
creatures.
Dr <PERSON>Nigel Boatman</PERSON> of the Game Conservancy says beetle banks make sound
commercial sense. Against the savings on insecticides, he calculates that a
beetle bank 400 yards long, big enough for a 50-acre field, would cost only
Pounds 90 (a one-off figure which includes cultivation, seed, and an
adjustment for loss of the crop in the strip).
One must beware of over-simplification. 'Biological controls,' explains
<PERSON>Janice Hickman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Southampton University</ORGANIZATION>, 'are not totally predictable.'
There can be marked differences in annual populations of both pest and
predator and 'biological succession' can see some species being replaced by
others.
<PERSON>Hickman</PERSON> has been working on hoverflies, another excellent aphid predator,
but one which needs plenty of nectar and pollen. Hoverflies lay eggs in <DATE>June</DATE>
and the larvae are ready to munch into action just when needed for <DATE>summer</DATE>
wheat.
Hickman puts predator encouragement into perspective. She believes there
will always be a need for pesticides. She thinks now in terms of integrated
pest management - a mixture of methods including fungus-resistant plants,
phacelias and beetle banks for natural aphid controls, as well as some
fungicides (for mildew) and herbicides (for weeds), neither of which natural
controls can address.
There is certainly huge interest among farmers in encouraging beneficial
insects. The idea has caught the imagination of farmers at a time when
public concern about chemical inputs has coincided with a political
determination to scale down agricultural production.
The instinctive fear that uprooting hedges was harmful is being proved
right. A well-known and successful Essex farmer who has barely used any
insecticides for 10 years, told me his neighbours all agreed their heaviest
yields were in the smallest, hedge-ringed fields. The predator insects have
been playing their part in pest control all along - when not killed off
them-selves.
Beetle banks, after all, are a form of substitute hedgerow, but without the
sheltering benefits. Phacelias are a substitute for old-fashioned
wildflower-infested hedgerows. To advance into the future, today's farmers
may need to step back into the past.

<DESCRIPT>  INSECT; WAR  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  SCIENTISTS in two Bay Area counties started a quiet war last week. The
battlegrounds are ash trees, the soldiers are thousands of insects and the
generals are arborists and entomologists.;    The war began with the release
in Alameda and Santa Clara counties of stingless mini-wasps, or Encarsia
wasps, which attack ash whiteflies. Here's how it works: The mini-wasp, which,
like the whitefly, is the size of a pinhead, lays its eggs in the scales of
young whiteflies. As the wasp matures, it feeds on the whitefly and kills it.;
   The parasite was imported by scientists at the University of California,
Riverside, from Israel, home of the ash tree. Mini-wasps are natural parasites
of the whitefly and control their populations in Israel and other countries
where the trees are native.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IN BUG WARS, PESTS PROVE KEY DEFENSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     When whiteflies infested <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>, probably
accidentally brought in on infected trees, they thrived because they had no
natural enemies here, said <PERSON>Mark Beaudoin</PERSON>, city arborist for <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;   
Efforts to control the whitefly through spraying are useless because the
insects are so prolific, he said. "We'd have to spray every seven days." And
the problem is so widespread that the insects killed by the insecticide would
soon be replaced by others from nearby trees.;    Controlling the whitefly has
been a high priority in the state, <PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> said, because in addition to ash
trees, the pest attacks cash crops such as pear and citrus trees and landscape
plants.;    With state funding, the UC-Riverside scientists imported the
mini-wasps and other natural parasites for the whitefly and studied them to
determine which would be most likely to thrive in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. Last year they
released the chosen mini-wasp in six <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> counties where
whitefly infestations were most intense.;    "The program was very
successful," said <PERSON>Timothy Paine</PERSON>, assistant professor of entomology at
UC-Riverside. The scientists measured the success by releasing the parasite at
five sites and then monitoring them along with five similar sites that didn't
receive the mini-wasps. A graduate student conducting the study found that in
the areas where the parasite was released, the populations of adult and
immature whiteflies "took a huge nose dive. They dropped to very low levels,"
<PERSON>Paine</PERSON> said. In the sites where no parasites were released, whiteflies
flourished.;    Follow-up studies showed that the whitefly populations
remained low, <PERSON>Paine</PERSON> said. "And the parasite is such a good colonizer that as
the whiteflies moved, so did the parasite," he said.;    The success in
<LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> encouraged other counties to try the mini-wasp warriors,
<PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> says. "We were losing the battle (against the whitefly) with
traditional methods.";    To introduce the mini-wasp to the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> chose five sites -- in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION> -- to serve as nurseries for the parasite,
said agriculture biologist <PERSON>Stan Maggi.</PERSON>;    The mini-wasps, which were raised
in a laboratory in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, were released onto infested ash trees. "We
don't expect results this year," <PERSON>Maggi</PERSON> said. "Any tree infected has hundreds
of thousands of whiteflies. It's a long-term project.";    Importing insects
to control pests isn't new. Perhaps the most well-publicized effort was the
release of sterile male <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> fruit flies to control those insects, a
program that has been fairly successful <PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> said.;    Another effort was
undertaken in the mid-1970s to control aphids on linden trees. Aphids, which
feed on plant sap of several species of trees, secrete honeydew that drops
from the trees, making a sticky mess.;    "The aphids don't harm the tree,"
said <PERSON>Bob Zuparko</PERSON>, a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION>UC-Berkeley's Division of Biological
Control</ORGANIZATION> who is studying the linden tree aphid and its parasite for his
doctoral dissertation.;    The honeydew, however, is a nuisance. Zuparko
worked with the group that released the linden tree aphid parasites, a
mini-wasp called Trioxys Curvicaubus, in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berkeley.</LOCATION>;    "The
parasite was released in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and the aphid population went way down,"
<PERSON>Zuparko</PERSON> said. His current study however, reveals that the efforts have not
been a complete success. "The populations are low, but there is still
honeydew," he said.;    Linden tree aphids are not a high priority in <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>, because the city has very few mature linden trees and the trees need to
develop before aphids attack, <PERSON>Zuparko</PERSON> said. Most of the city's lindens are on
one street in <ORGANIZATION>Willow Glen</ORGANIZATION>, with a few single lindens in other neighborhoods.; 
  Young lindens, however, were planted along the light rail line,
significantly increasing the city's linden tree population.;    The linden
tree parasite has made its own effort to branch out. A survey by <PERSON>Zuparko</PERSON> shows
that the mini-wasp has spread from <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> all around the <LOCATION>Bay</LOCATION>,
but has not crossed any hills. As part of his work, <PERSON>Zuparko</PERSON> plans to introduce
the mini-wasp to another area infested with linden tree aphids to further
study how the parasite works.;    Although linden tree aphids feast on only
that tree, other types of aphids attack other trees. Scientists brought in a
mini-wasp to control the tulip tree aphid with little success, said <PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON>,
who manages about 250,000 street trees for the city of <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;    One
effort that appears to be a failure was a parasite released to control the elm
leaf beetle. The parasite "was whipped out before it could get established,"
<PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> said. Scientists don't know for sure what killed the parasite, but it
could have been a fungus, disease or organism that prevented the predator from
flourishing. "We're messing with a complex system here," <PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> said.;   
Yet another tree that has fallen victim to recently imported insects is the
eucalyptus. "It used to be a pest-free plant, but now we have a pest,"
<PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> said. The eucalyptus long-horn beetle came from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, home of
the eucalyptus tree. The beetle found its way to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> on eucalyptus wood
palates used to carry goods imported from Australia.;    Scientists hoping to
control the beetle must travel to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to study the insect and its
natural enemies, and then bring back predators and determine if they can
survive in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. If and when this happens depends on financial support
for the program, <PERSON>Beaudoin</PERSON> said. While the cash-crop attacking whitefly drew
attention and funds from the state, no one gets as excited about the
eucalyptus, he said.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>California Scientists Import Wasps to Attack Problem Flies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists on <DATE>Friday</DATE> released 50 parasitic
Israeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests would
zero in on <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>'s growing ash whitefly population.
   The wasps were sent to work in a suburban <LOCATION>Encino</LOCATION> ash tree in the
first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight
against the problem flies.
   ``This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all
the ash whiteflies,'' said <PERSON>Tom Bellows</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION>, entomologist supervising the experiment. ``This
particular trial is to see if the wasps can live successfully in
our <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> climate.''
   Bellows released the imported predators into what he calls a
``sleeve cage,'' a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a tree
branch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place.
   Otherwise, scientists monitoring the experiment would have to
search the whole tree and beyond to find the wasps, <PERSON>Bellows</PERSON>
explained.
   The ash whitefly infestation is not the only agricultural battle
being waged in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. Record numbers of exotic insect
pests have invaded <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> this year, posing a threat to
the state's <MONEY>$16 billion-a-year</MONEY> farm economy.
   Efforts to eradicate the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> fruit fly, which lays its
eggs in more than 250 types of fruit, has cost taxpayers at least
<MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> so far, county officials said.
   Scientists also are scrambling to deal with invasions by
Japanese beetles, Russian wheat aphids, gypsy moths, fire ants and
other bugs found in faraway lands _ but foreign to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   ``We are convinced that it's because you are the nation's
melting pot,'' said <PERSON>Gera Curry</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>California
Department of Food and Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>.
   The region's booming immigrant population is bringing in
contraband fruits and vegetables from native lands, she said.
   The people responsible don't seem to realize their shipments of
produce also carry alien pests that thrive in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>'s
warm climate, <PERSON>Curry</PERSON> said.
   One of the most ruinous is the ash whitefly, which sucks vital
fluids from tree leaves and deposits a sticky ooze that discolors
fruit, stains patios and ruins car paint.
   The ash whiteflies, which have no natural enemies in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, were first discovered in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> <DATE>last
summer</DATE>. They were apparently imported accidentally from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, where they are common.
   The parasite wasps were imported from <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>, where they act as
the ash whitefly's natural enemy.
   The wasp has no sting, but kills by laying its eggs inside ash
whitefly larvae, <PERSON>Bellows</PERSON> said. After the wasps' eggs hatch, they
eat their way out of the whitefly larvae, killing the pest.
   If the series of experiments set for this month are successful,
<PERSON>Bellows</PERSON> said hundreds of thousands of insect predators will be
released next <DATE>spring</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  LET'S TALK dirty here for a moment. Actually, let's talk "dirt," as in the

what you don't see is my dark brown plant-killing thumb (scientific name:
plantkillus thumbius). I can kill ivy, bamboo, spider plants, air fern, "chia
pet" grass, etc.;   For example, not too long ago my wife went on a business
trip for a week and left me instructions to "water the spider plants ONLY once
on Wednesday." I did. I poured cool water around the base of each plant (not
on the foliage or whatever you call those ugly leaves), and several weeks
later two of the plants appeared arthritic and eventually died.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Also ran in EX2/1, EX3/2; Comment  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In a family gift exchange I was given a chia pet. Remember those? The
container is shaped like an animal -- mine was a sheep and was filled with
grass seeds, that germinate and the blades grow out tiny holes and are
supposed to make the chia look like a real animal. Mine looked like a mildewy
wool rug, and then it died.;   WHEN an elderly gentleman moved from his home
across the street, we were given his air fern. It must have been 10 years old.
It turned into something that resembled the stem after you've eaten all the
grapes off it.;   With this background you can see why I'm not a gardener and
why when I was forced to replace a plant for my mom and dad I dreaded the
project. I sought expertise. I was looking for a patient clerk with a
doctorate in <LOCATION>Landscape Plantology</LOCATION>, a recognized master gardener and an
accredited nursery person all rolled into one.;   No such person exists at the
discount garden centers. They may infer that these people exist within the
walls of their plant departments, but finding them can be another story. This
led me to <ORGANIZATION>Yamagami's Nursery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cupertino</LOCATION>, because it's been around a long
time and advertises "11 <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Certified Nurserymen" on staff. I figured
that if we could find one of the "11," I'd find something to stick in a pot.; 
 We were helped by <PERSON>Ron</PERSON>, the garden center's manager. I told him that what we
needed was a plant to stick in a shaded corner, one that didn't require a lot
of care and was about this big by about this tall. Ron immediately started
walking through aisles and aisles of lush looking plants, talking about the
restrictions we were imposing on the selection and showed us some kind of
bamboo and this little-leafed thing called a shrubby yew pine (Podocarpus
maki). We liked it. Then he spotted some ants. "Aphids," he said.;   HE
EXAMINED the plant's leaves and exclaimed that famous medical term "hmmmm." It
seems that the ants were protecting the aphids (tinybugses) from ladybugs
(flyawayhomius). According to <PERSON>Ron</PERSON>, the aphids produce a sweet, sticky goop
that ants either eat or use for something or other, therefore the ants keep
their "goo providers" from being eaten by the ladybugs.;   <PERSON>Ron</PERSON> said that he'd
need to have Mas, an older gentlemen who also said "hmmmm" when told about the
aphids, spray the plant.;   The good news here is that the shrubby yew pine
survived the trip home. Survived being wrestled from its plastic container.
Survived our mixing planter mix with some kind of fertilizer. Survived -- so
far -- in its pot for SEVEN DAYS.;   I think I'm on to something here. I was
just studying my thumb and I notice that it looks a bit different. It could be
turning green.;   No, wait. Wait a minute! I think I've got aphids.  </TEXT>

   What has a nutty flavor and looks like
brown scrambled eggs?
   Bakuti. That's Nepalese for squished honeybees.
   What looks like ridged french fries, only with eyes and legs,
and tastes great deep-fried?
   Bamboo worms.
   Yuk, you say? How about a nice helping of honey instead?
   Sorry to disappoint you, but it's really bee barf.
   OK, so maybe you can deal with the truth about honey. But that's
not all. Most Americans don't realize they're already eating a
pound or two of insects every year.
   You just can't see them because they're ground up into tiny
little chunks in your strawberry jam, peanut butter, spaghetti
sauce, applesauce and frozen chopped broccoli.
   The insect parts even add to the protein, making some products
more nutritious, said <PERSON>Michael Burgett</PERSON>, an entomologist at <ORGANIZATION>Oregon
State University</ORGANIZATION>.
   He estimates every acre of land in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> contains about 100
pounds of insect protein. In tropical areas, it's about 400 pounds.
   Burgett bemoans the fact that most of the protein is going to
waste. Except for that extra touch of tartness in the jam on your
English muffin, of course.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> says there is no way to
eliminate all bugs from our food, so it sets what are called
``defect action levels'' to control the amount of insect parts,
rodent hairs, molds and other tiny particles that pose no health
hazard.
   ``Essentially, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> is saying you can only have enough bugs
so you can't see them,'' <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON> said.
   ``We have an innate bias against insects I blame on our European
heritage. For our culture, insects are outside the realm of food.
The glaring exception is honey, which is bee vomit, essentially.
It's a plant product mediated by an insect.''
   Burgett is an internationally recognized expert on bees. He
respects bees. He is fascinated with their behavior.
   And, he said, they make delicious cookies.
   ``A pound of bees is about 3,500 bees. You put them in the oven
at low heat for eight hours, then grind or blend the dry husks into
flour. Makes great cookies. About half my students ate the cookies
the first year I made them. Most of them said they didn't taste any
different. So I cheated the second year and put in `Grape-Nuts' to
make them crunchy.''
   But if you really want crunchy, the giant waterbug is the
appetizer of choice. Roasted and eaten whole, it's a favorite in
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON>, who's sampled a variety of insect fare.
   ``You'll find that Asian cultures have incorporated insects in
their diets for a long time. One of the most popular insects in
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is the giant waterbug, which is like a big cockroach. It's
easily collected around lights at night, especially around ponds.''
   In <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, you can judge a restaurant by the bugs on the menu.
   ``In <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, about 50 species of insects are commonly eaten.
That's a lot. And they're eaten by a broad spectrum of society.
I've gone to very nice Thai restaurants and they have excellent
insect dishes on the menu,'' <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON> said.
   American consumers are so finicky about bugs they'll never eat
them, <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON> said. At least they won't ``mass consume'' them in
the numbers needed to make bug ranching a solid commercial success.
   ``They've talked about using termites in the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>. Highly
nutritious with high protein content per body weight. But who's
going to eat them?
   ``Bee keepers in western <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> kill their bees in the fall
because it's too expensive to keep them through the <DATE>winter</DATE>. They
restock from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> in the <DATE>spring</DATE> but all those bee
pupae are going to waste. The major hurdle, again, is who wants to
eat it? There is a gourmet market in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for the male pupae of
the honeybee, but that market is small.''
   If people won't eat cooked bugs, no matter how tasty and
nutritious, at least they could tolerate more bugs in what they do
eat, <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON> said. If the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> would relax the limit for insect
parts, say double it, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> farmers could significantly reduce the
amount of pesticides sprayed every year.
   ``Snap beans are a perfect example. The 12-spotted cucumber
beetle takes tiny little bites out of the beans. It doesn't harm
the bean but consumers want perfection. So the growers spray the
beans to rid them of beetles and bite marks. When growers drive up
to the food processing plant, people sample the beans and bite
marks, and if the ratio is too high, the company will tell the
grower, `We'll have to process this batch differently,' so the
growers makes less money.''
   Farmers are spraying less because pesticides costs are rising
and alternate pest management strategies are working, <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON> said.
Much of the spraying that remains is for appearance, and that won't
change until consumers stop being so squeamish about bugs, he said.
   ``If you say, `I don't want any bugs in my food, and I don't
want any insecticide residue,' then we'll all starve,'' <PERSON>Burgett</PERSON>
said.
   ``I'd rather eat more insects and less pesticide residue,'' he
said.
   Will consumers agree? Burgett is a pessimist.
   ``Consumer acceptance is a big problem. Fifty years ago, it
wouldn't matter if an apple had a moth larva inside, or if the bean
had a beetle bite. Are these people shopping for flawless apples
willing to pay the price for less insecticides? I think not.''
   But he has advice for environmentalists and consumers who want
to reduce the pesticides in our food: ``Bug the government.''

ON CALIFORNIA: NOT THE TIME TO BUG OUT OF MEDFLY WAR 
</P>

<P>
Every night the choppers rise from their landing pads and spread across the 
<LOCATION>L.A. Basin</LOCATION>. Squadrons of them, sortie after sortie, all loaded with liquid 
death for the Medfly. Every night for five months now they've poured malathion 
from the skies, trying -- entomologically speaking -- to bomb the Medfly back 
to the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
We accept this annual war in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. It is one of the peculiarities of life 
here that we can wake up in the middle of the <TIME>night</TIME>, hear the whump whump of 
the choppers overhead, and know immediately what's happening. Just one more 
layer of sticky poison coating the neighborhood. One more night of carpet 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
We accept it, I think, because we understand the stakes involved. The domino 
theory probably was hogwash when it came to the commies, but it's not hogwash 
with the Medfly, or the Oriental fruit fly or the Mex fly. If any of those 
creatures establish a firm beachhead in the <LOCATION>L.A. Basin</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>San Joaquin Valley</LOCATION> 
and all of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> agriculture surely will be next. 
</P>
<P>
And we accept it for another reason: This war has always ended in victory. The 
chopper season arrived, the malathion went down, and the Medfly died. It is a 
strategy that worked. 
</P>
<P>
Except this year. For reasons that no one understands, the war is going badly 
this year. Very badly. We have escalated our response, sending more and more 
choppers into the <TIME>night</TIME> sky, expanding the war zone week after week. Now we 
find ourselves fighting over a huge territory, 300 square miles, and still the 
Medfly has not succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
All this became clear last week when some of the top Medfly scientists decided 
to go public with their fear that the war in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> may be unwinnable. In a story 
by <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON>Maura Dolan</PERSON>, a UC <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> entomologist expressed his view 
this simply: "I don't think they will be able to (eradicate)." 
</P>
<P>
A scientist from out of state agreed and added this: "Once you have an 
established population -- and I would say the evidence in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> is that it is 
pretty well established -- it (eradication) is very unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
These scientists are outside the program. Inside the program, as might be 
expected, you still get optimism of the light-at-the-end- of-the-tunnel 
variety. One of the inside scientists, when asked if the Medfly would be 
vanquished by next <DATE>autumn</DATE>, replied, "Possibly." 
</P>
<P>
Next autumn. That's eight, nine months from now. By then the air war will be 
more than a year old; it will have spanned two Medfly seasons. Some 
neighborhoods will have been sprayed a dozen, two dozen, times. The toll on 
humans will be uncertain and unknown, but the toll on other creatures such as 
ladybugs, butterflies and honey bees will be serious. This is not a benign war, 
and that reality is starting to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
So, with the war going badly, with the ladybugs and butterflies dying, it would 
be easy to heap scorn on the commanders of the spraying war. You could argue 
that <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> has paid too high a price to protect the farmers of the <LOCATION>San Joaquin</LOCATION>. 
Let the farmers fight their own war, you could say. Let the dominoes fall. 
</P>
<P>
You could say that, but you shouldn't. If we lose the air war in <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>, all of 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> will be caught in a true nightmare. Here in the <LOCATION>Basin</LOCATION>, a permanent 
infestation would mean a permanent war. Not an air war, perhaps, but a war in 
every back yard where there are fruit trees. Over the years more malathion 
would be sprayed by homeowners than is coming now from the choppers. 
</P>
<P>
And a permanent infestation in the <LOCATION>San Joaquin</LOCATION> would mean a permanent taint on 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> produce. Apples, pears, peaches, plums, grapes -- everything would 
be run through fumigators before it left the state and everything would be 
suspect. Make just one mistake and a nervous country like <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> would shut its 
doors to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> farm products as it did during the <DATE>1981</DATE> Medfly war. It cost 
<MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> that time and it lasted only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a good idea, then, to win this war. That means we have to keep the 
choppers in the air whether or not things look shaky. And if we win this time, 
there is reason to believe future battles may be easier. The government is 
beefing up its production of sterile fruit flies and within two years they will 
be available as substitutes for much of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
But, as with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, the generals of the bug war are facing an erosion of 
public will. It's my guess that <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> will not tolerate aerial poisons from now 
till autumn. The generals don't have that much time. They must show some 
progress, show they can win, and show it soon. Or get ready for a hasty retreat 
from the onrushing insect hordes.

   A contraption that sucks bad bugs off
strawberry plants may become a handy tool for farmers in the drive
to kill pests without using so many chemicals.
   Three farming members of <ORGANIZATION>Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>northern California</LOCATION>, are using a company-designed
machine called a BugVac this year to vacuum lygus bugs off their
plants.
   The custom-made vacuum machine, mounted on a tractor, moves down
rows of young berries, providing just enough suction to zap lygus
bugs that like to live near the top of the plants.
   Beneficial insects that live lower on the plants are not
disturbed by the machine, explained <PERSON>Driscoll</PERSON> researcher Ed Show.
Green leaves and the ripening fruit also are left unharmed.
   Show adapted the idea from a hand vacuum the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION> developed years ago to test the levels of insect
populations. The researcher's innovation consists of hydraulically
driven fans and suction hoses.
   ``The vacuum doesn't deep clean the whole strawberry plant,''
<PERSON>Show</PERSON> said in an interview. ``We're affecting only the bugs on the
top part of the plant. It will suck up and remove bugs of all
kinds, the good and the bad, but it's not as detrimental to the
beneficial insect community.''
   Perhaps the main benefit from the BugVac is saving the
beneficial insects needed to eat other damaging bugs such as
western spider mites, which have become resistant to pesticides.
   ``We have no effective miticides to control spider mites, so if
we spray for lygus bugs, we create a real spider mite problem
because we knock out the beneficial insects,'' Show says.
   Vacuum cleaning the plants does not eliminate as many lygus bugs
as spraying them with pesticides would. However, growers who tried
the new technique were able to keep the lygus bug population close
to or slightly below what is termed the economic threshold in
integrated pest management _ the level at which the pest population
causes financial losses.
   ``We're learning how many lygus bugs we can get away with in a
field,'' <PERSON>Show</PERSON> said.
   The board of <ORGANIZATION>Driscoll Associates</ORGANIZATION>, which provides its own
patented strawberry varieties to affiliated growers, asked Show to
find ways to reduce or eliminate as much use of pesticides as
possible because of increasing regulatory restrictions, increasing
resistance by bugs to some chemicals and doubts about whether
adequate new chemicals will become available.
   Show decided to adapt the DVac machine, a hand-held or backpack
device used to suck up small numbers of pests in estimating how
badly a field is infested.
   ``Given that basic idea, we built a prototype on bicycle wheels,
pushed it through test plots and found it could catch what seemed
like an impressive number of lygus bugs,'' <PERSON>Show</PERSON> said.
   This was the first season growers used Show's device
commercially, and the three who had machines built seem satisfied
with the results.
   Reiter Affiliated of <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> used a BugVac on 71 acres of
strawberries at <LOCATION>Salinas</LOCATION>, about 125 miles south of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>,
and plans to have two more machines built for use on all of the
company's 225 acres next year.
   General manager <PERSON>Tom Jones</PERSON> estimates the vacuum machine saved
<MONEY>$100</MONEY>-<MONEY>$200</MONEY> an acre over the cost of pesticides, and owner Miles
<PERSON>Reiter</PERSON> said the savings may even be higher.
   ``It's been a real good deal for us,'' <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Mike McCluney</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>, who manufactures the BugVacs, says
he's now built nine or 10 and has orders for at least that many
more with still other farmers considering the device. The cost of
the machines runs between <MONEY>$12,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$17,000</MONEY>.
   ``It definitely does work under most circumstances when properly
used with integrated pest management and other methods,'' <PERSON>McCluney</PERSON>
said. ``It's not just a replacement for a spray tractor but needs
to be in conjunction with predator releases.''
   Use of the BugVac may spread from strawberries to other
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> vegetables, such as lettuce.
   ``There's interest on the part of some other vegetable
growers,'' said Show, adding that he has heard of at least one
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> farmer who uses a similar apparatus to control potato beetles.
   <PERSON>McCluney</PERSON> said he plans a trip to <PERSON>Brawley</PERSON> in southeastern
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ``to see if we can use this new idea to help out with
their white fly problem.''

<P>
<PERSON>Fred Beams</PERSON> was at the beach in <LOCATION>Dana Point</LOCATION> when he noticed a mother and her 
daughter near hysterics about a giant, flying green bug. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just panicked," he said. "They were waving their arms up and down 
trying to get it. They thought it was a bee." 
</P>
<P>
But Beams, the assistant manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Vector Control District</ORGANIZATION>, 
knew the bug was a harmless green fig beetle. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Please don't be alarmed by what they are,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Beams admitted the creature is "one of the scarier beetles. They have that 
green color. In fact, in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, they once used them as money." 
</P>
<P>
Summer is the prime time for spotting the green fig beetle. At this time of the 
year, when the ground gets warmer and the winds are calm, beetles, bugs, 
spiders and ants seem to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the climate so attractive for people here makes it attractive for 
bugs," <PERSON>Beams</PERSON> said. "All insects are temperature dependent. Here it is warm year 
round so they can survive." 
</P>
<P>
Although bugs are more active and reproduce at a greater rate in the <DATE>summer</DATE>, 
many do little to harm people except to scare them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all big and scary and look like they'll take a small child," <PERSON>Beams</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the <ORGANIZATION>Vector Control District</ORGANIZATION>'s worries are over smaller bugs: 
mosquitoes. Almost any still water outdoors can be a breeding ground. <ORGANIZATION>Vector 
Control</ORGANIZATION> workers have been spraying areas such as the <LOCATION>San Joaquin</LOCATION> marshes near 
<LOCATION>UC Irvine</LOCATION> and salt marshes near <LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION> and Seal beaches. 
</P>
<P>
They have a more difficult time tracking places such as unkept pools and golf 
course hazards, which are on private property. So far this <DATE>summer</DATE>, they have 
found 3,500 such pools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of control over people's back yards," <PERSON>Beams</PERSON> said. "It's 
really up to the homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
Unkept pools can produce 150,000 to 200,000 mosquitoes a week, <ORGANIZATION>Beams</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Mosquitoes even have enough room in a coffee can of water to breed 700 to 1,000 
offspring a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For exterminators, most of the problems this <DATE>summer</DATE> have been indoors. Fleas 
and ants have been especially prolific. 
</P>
<P>
"It really kind of hit this year," said <PERSON>Phil Naman</PERSON>, the acting manager of 
<ORGANIZATION>Terminix</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> branch. "When it's hot and dry, they just go crazy. 
Everybody who calls us says they've got the worst cases in the world." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Roger Rankin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, owner of Freckles the dog and Frosty the cat, said 
he has battled fleas with pesticides for so long, "I figure my yard is a toxic 
waste dump by now." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Rankin</PERSON>'s problems go beyond fleas. His big problem this year has been <DATE>June</DATE> 
bugs. Rankin recently planted some cherry brush trees, and soon the <DATE>June</DATE> bugs 
were out to attack. They created blister-like bumps on the the trees' leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had (lots of) <DATE>June</DATE> bugs," he said. "They suck all the goodness out of 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time of the Year for Ants 
</P>
<P>
This also is the time of the year when ants move from back yards and into 
homes. <PERSON>Lee Clifton</PERSON>, the vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Hydrex Pest Control of California</ORGANIZATION>, 
said his company is receiving more calls from hot, dry areas such as <LOCATION>Anaheim 
Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Yorba Linda</PERSON>, where ants are fleeing their normal habitats 
for the cool indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Cockroaches also like to infest homes. One of the most common, the Oriental 
cockroach, also known as the black beetle or black water bug, is found in cool, 
damp areas such as water meter boxes and dense vegetation. And <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> 
has plenty of American and German cockroaches, which can destroy food, fabrics 
and book bindings. 
</P>
<P>
But, <PERSON>Beams</PERSON> said, "I'll take a cockroach any day over a housefly." Houseflies 
carry germs, and can land on exposed food and regurgitate. 
</P>
<P>
Some pests also carry diseases. The most publicized this <DATE>summer</DATE> has been the 
Western black-legged tick, a known carrier of Lyme disease. One <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> 
woman was suspected of having the disease, but a recent test proved negative. 
Even so, the tick has been found in places all over the county that have deer, 
which are known carriers of the tick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ash Whitefly Arrives 
</P>
<P>
Another new arrival is the ash whitefly, first discovered in the county late 
last year. The ash whitefly attaches itself to the underside of leaves and can 
slowly kill trees. The flies secrete a honeydew that causes black, sooty mold 
to form on citrus, peach and other fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly, which is native to the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> region, has grown 
rapidly this <DATE>summer</DATE> because it has no natural enemies in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, 
said <PERSON>Nick Nisson</PERSON>, an entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Agricultural 
Commissioner's Office</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Being new and being exotic, it doesn't really have the parasites to keep it in 
check," <PERSON>Nisson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly also is almost impossible to kill without soaking the entire 
plant in insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasp Will Be Captured 
</P>
<P>
To combat the ash whitefly, state officials are sending an entomologist to 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> next month to capture the <LOCATION>Encarsia</LOCATION>, a smaller than 
pinhead-sized wasp that is the insect's natural enemy. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Roger Rankin</PERSON> isn't particularly fond of any of these creatures. He's having 
enough trouble just identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had these bugs that are green and fly," he said. "Some of these things 
are bigger than baseballs. They'll knock you over. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord knows what can live out there."

IMPORTED BEETLE JOINS THE FRAY AGAINST ASH WHITEFLY INFESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists waging a biological war against the pesky ash whitefly have deployed 
a new soldier in the fight -- a tiny gold-and-brown beetle imported from 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Small swarms of the so-called ladybird beetles have been released over the last 
three weeks in <LOCATION>Granada Hills</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gardena</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>. Entomologists predict that 
the eighth-inch-long beetle -- which poses no threat to humans -- will reduce 
whitefly populations by eating juvenile flies that attach themselves to the 
underside of tree leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers said thousands of stingless, parasitic wasps released 
earlier this year to prey on the whitefly appear to be doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside entomologists do not yet have precise data on the wasps' 
effectiveness, but they have observed the predatory insect reproducing and 
attacking the pinhead-sized whitefly in five <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the results," entomologist <PERSON>Tim Paine</PERSON> said. A colleague, 
<PERSON>Tom Bellows</PERSON>, added that "the wasp appears to be a highly effective natural 
enemy" of the bothersome whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
First discovered in <DATE>Van Nuys two years ago</DATE>, the ash whitefly has spread rapidly 
throughout <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, infesting 20 counties from the Mexican border north to 
<LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The white-winged pest sucks the juice out of leaves and can defoliate entire 
trees. In the process, the bugs produce a sticky excretion that coats cars, 
patio furniture and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the insect has mostly bothered urban dwellers and nursery owners, 
munching on ornamental trees. But entomologists note that the fly is known to 
attack fruit trees, raising concerns about its threat to the state's 
agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
Imported by accident from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, the whitefly has no natural 
predators in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. Pesticides provide only temporary relief, with new 
swarms of whiteflies reinfesting trees shortly after they are sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, entomologists agreed that biological warfare was the only way to 
stop the pest. The speck-sized, stingless wasps were imported from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and are being mass-raised by the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Large releases of the wasps began earlier this year and were made in 18 cities 
in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Bernardino</LOCATION>, Orange and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> counties. In 
recent weeks, researchers returned to the field to determine how their troops 
were faring. What they found was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The wasp attacks the whitefly by laying its eggs inside the whitefly nymph. 
Like a scene from a horror movie, the parasite's egg then develops into a wasp, 
which eats its whitefly host from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
"In some of our research sites, if you pick up the leaves and look at the 
whitefly pupae, you'll see that tremendous numbers of them show evidence of a 
parasite emerging rather than an adult whitefly," <PERSON>Paine</PERSON> said. "The hole the 
whitefly makes when it comes out is very different than the hole the parasite 
makes, so we know when we've got success." 
</P>
<P>
Paine added that the observations were made in climates as different as the 
coast and the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The ladybird beetles were released over the <DATE>last two weeks</DATE> at three sites. 
Further beetle releases are planned as entomologists continue mass-rearing the 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said it will be sometime in the fall before researchers have a solid 
grasp of just how effective the predators have been in reducing the whitefly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the entomologists hope to import still more whitefly enemies -- 
another wasp from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> that might be useful in the cooler climates of 
<LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, and a parasitic fly from <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>.

   Are Going Organic

   ECOLOGICALLY correct yard-care products and services are
springing up like weeds.
   Only about <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> of pesticides are put on lawns, but they
raise special concerns. Children play the most on grass, and
they're "the subgroup of the population most susceptible" to
toxins, notes <PERSON>Susan Cooper</PERSON>, an ecologist with the <ORGANIZATION>National
Coalition Against Misuse of Pesticides</ORGANIZATION>, an environmental
group. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>
underscored concerns by charging that the lawn-care industry
exaggerates pesticide safety.
   Organic offerings include everything from books, such as
"The Chemical-Free Lawn," published last year by <ORGANIZATION>Rodale
Press</ORGANIZATION>, to rapidly biodegradable pesticides. Rincon-Vitova
<ORGANIZATION>Insectories Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oak View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, says its aphid-eating
ladybugs and other insect stand-ins for chemicals are flying
off the shelf.
   <ORGANIZATION>NaturaLawn Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, organic lawn-care
concern, "had to {temporarily} cut off sales last year
because we couldn't handle all the business we were getting,"
says <PERSON>Phil Catron</PERSON>, president. NaturaLawn occasionally uses
chemical herbicide on some tenacious weeds, <PERSON>Mr. Catron</PERSON> says.
But part of the organic approach, he adds, "is educating
people that having a few weeds is not that big a deal."
   Mainstream yard-care concerns also are getting into the
act.
   <ORGANIZATION>ChemLawn Services Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, says it's
test-marketing a program that uses manure for fertilizer and
no pesticides. <ORGANIZATION>Bartlett Tree Experts Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>,
offers an option featuring precisely timed spraying and
pest-attacking insects. The method cuts chemical use by more
than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT>, says <PERSON>Donald Booth</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Bartlett</ORGANIZATION> manager.

   Enlisting a Clay Pit
   To Store Solar Energy
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERS at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION> are planning
a solar energy system based on clay.
   The team plans to capture heat from the sun during the
<DATE>summer</DATE> with solar collectors and use it to warm a
100-foot-deep clay deposit near the school's <LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>,
campus. In <DATE>winter</DATE>, the stored energy would provide as much as
<PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of the heating for a new convention center near campus.
   The technique, which could overcome the difficulty of
storing solar energy, was explored by the the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department
of Energy</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> as a way to heat homes, says team
leader <PERSON>Edward Sunderland</PERSON>. But heat leaked out of the
relatively small systems too fast. The <LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION> system's much
larger 100,000-cubic-meter clay deposit is expected to retain
and give back more than <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT> of its stored heat, says team
member <PERSON>Dwayne Breger</PERSON>.
   The system would employ six acres of solar collectors
similar to rooftop water heaters. The collectors would heat
water, which would be pumped through underground pipes lacing
the clay to warm it. In <DATE>winter</DATE>, the warm clay would heat
water to 140 degrees Fahrenheit before it is pumped to the
convention center.
   The system's estimated cost of about <MONEY>$3.5 million</MONEY> would be
repaid by fuel savings in five to seven years, <PERSON>Mr. Breger</PERSON>
projects. The engineers, whose design work was funded by the
<ORGANIZATION>DOE</ORGANIZATION>, now are seeking funds to build the system. It would be a
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> first, but some 30 such systems already have been built
in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, they say.
                                                                                                       

   Ecology Groups Waver
   Over Seals of Approval
                                                                                                       

   IT'S A FAUSTIAN dilemma that's shaping up for some
environmental groups.
   Many of them recently have been approached by retailers
and other concerns proposing to use the groups' names and
logos in product promotions. The companies are offering
royalties or other kinds of payment and a chance for the
groups to spread their messages among consumers. "Right now,
we're being deluged" with such proposals, says <PERSON>Rosemary
Carroll</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>'s director of development.
   Some groups already make such deals: The <ORGANIZATION>Audubon Society</ORGANIZATION>
licenses its name to makers of binoculars and birdseed. <ORGANIZATION>Black
Sheep Marketing Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, pays a <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> royalty to the
<ORGANIZATION>Rainforest Alliance</ORGANIZATION> to use its name in inserts with shower
curtains picturing rain forests. The World Wildlife Fund has
licensed its name to a maker of T-shirts featuring endangered
species.
   But other groups are wrestling with issues raised by the
proposals and haven't yet decided how to handle them. "Our
name could lose all meaning if we don't protect how it is
used," says <PERSON>Ms. Carroll</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>, which is now
developing a policy on the matter. For example, she adds, the
group probably won't sign a pact with a company that wants to
promote its plastic-free tampons with the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>.
                                                                                                       

   Introducing the Annual
   `<ORGANIZATION>Green Con Award</ORGANIZATION>'
                                                                                                       

   THE <LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> OFFICE of Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> has initiated an
annual "Green Con Award."
   The environmental group wants to spotlight examples of
"companies jumping on the green bandwagon when in fact they
are talking gibberish," says a Friends spokeswoman. The first
winner was British Nuclear Fuels <ORGANIZATION>PLC</ORGANIZATION> for "railing about how
green nuclear power is," she says.
   A British Nuclear spokesman says its recently developed ad
campaign stresses that nuclear plants, unlike conventional
plants, don't pollute the air. "We maintain nuclear power
could contribute to lessening the greenhouse effect," he
says.
   He added that "we don't agree with the criticism that we
are deceiving people. But we derived some amusement from the
award. We would have displayed the trophy in the press
office, but it's so hideous nobody wanted it."

<HEAD>USDA Imports Soviet `Hit Team' of Wasps, Beetles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special hit team of lady beetles and wasps
has been imported from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> to help American farmers
battle the Russian wheat aphid, the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after
evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests.
   In all, three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles
were collected during <DATE>May</DATE> and <DATE>June</DATE> in the southern region of the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, the department's <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Research Service</ORGANIZATION>
reported.
   Actual collecting of the hundreds of specimen was done by insect
pathologist <PERSON>Tadeusz Poprawski</PERSON> and entomoligist <PERSON>Francis Gruber</PERSON>, who
work for the agency's parasite laboratory in <LOCATION>Behoust</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   During their explorations, <PERSON>Poprawski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gruber</PERSON> were based at a
new Soviet-American biological control laboratory in <LOCATION>Kishinev</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Moldavia</LOCATION>. The insects were sent to a <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, for quarantine, rearing of new generations and distribution.
   The department's <PERSON>Richard S. Soper</PERSON> said in a statement that the
wasps and beetles ``are the first exchanges of biological pest
controls to come from recent <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> research agreements with the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.''
   Soper coordinates research on biological pest controls for the
<ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> agency in <LOCATION>Beltsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>. He left on <DATE>Monday</DATE> for the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> to help plan next year's joint studies and explorations.
   The Russian wheat aphid, first spotted in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1986</DATE> in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, has spread to 16 states in just three years,
damaging wheat, barley, rye and oats. Aphids were said to cost
farmers an estimated <MONEY>$123 million</MONEY> last year in grain losses and
chemical controls.
   Officials said two species of Soviet wasps were sent in <DATE>August</DATE>
to a <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> research unit in <LOCATION>Stillwater</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, for evaluation with
other wasps from <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to determine the
best candidates for field tests.
   Some other wasps were shipped to the department's ``mass-rearing
facility'' in <LOCATION>Mission</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, to produce more specimens. And the
lady beetles are being ``multiplied'' in <LOCATION>Niles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich</LOCATION>. Research on
the beetles will be done at the agency's facility in <LOCATION>Brookings</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians who believe that 10 months of Medflies, malathion and 
helicopters have been rough should consider the plight of <ORGANIZATION>Big Foot</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. Last 
week, millions of sausage-sized bugs called cicadas emerged after 17 years 
underground, covering the town and surrounding countryside in a crunchy carpet 
of wailing insects. 
</P>
<P>
Or how about the poor people of <LOCATION>Brownsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>? There, after years of 
"killer bee" headlines and occasional spottings, the long-feared Africanized 
honey bee finally is to arrive in force this <DATE>summer</DATE>. Consider, too, the plight 
of <LOCATION>South Lake Tahoe</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, bracing for an onslaught of 
meat-eating yellow jackets, has distributed kits of poisoned canned fish to 
kill off the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Add to the list munching armies of Mormon crickets in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, fire ants in 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and 11 other states, Medflies in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and, back in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the 
worst aphid infestation in a decade, and it all adds up to one creepy-crawly 
year. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons. Dry weather in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, cyclical insect population 
explosions in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and other entomological mysteries have all 
contributed to this unnerving confluence of bug outbreaks across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are few, if any, direct connections between the infestations, but some 
entomologists find common themes in the uncommon outbreaks. For example, they 
say that concerns about pesticide usage have complicated eradication 
strategies. Also, exotic bugs once confined to faraway lands are hitching rides 
into this country, and officials concede that there is no way to keep the gate 
shut tight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a symptom of our times," said <PERSON>Roy Cunningham</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> entomologist and one of the world's top experts on the Medfly. 
"We're all exchanging our diseases and insects." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said that the sheer variety of this year's outbreaks, coupled 
with a growing public awareness of the costs and effects of the various 
onslaughts, have placed insects in the limelight as never before. 
Entomologists, who once spent entire careers laboring in obscurity in 
bug-filled laboratories, have found themselves thrust into the public arena 
with the livelihoods of farmers and city dwellers hinging on their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON>, chairman of the scientific panel guiding the Medfly eradication in 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, said he cannot recall a time when he has been attacked, praised and 
pursued in such a frenzied manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother never told me it would be like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham is one of five scientists advising the state as it attempts to 
eradicate the Medfly from <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, perhaps the most visible of 
several such campaigns being waged nationally against various pests. 
</P>
<P>
That the <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> finds itself on the front lines of bug battles is not 
surprising. In the <DATE>last few years</DATE>, it has become the nation's unofficial exotic 
pest capital. Three years ago, agricultural officials in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> reported 
finding eight different types of exotic fruit flies in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and Orange 
counties; the bugs hail from as far away as <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and equatorial 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There was even one fly found that experts still have not been able to identify. 
The only place in the world it has been recorded is <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the final irony in how whacked-out things have become," said <PERSON>Eric Fisher</PERSON>, 
one of the state entomologists in charge of identifying exotic pests. 
</P>
<P>
As entomologists scramble to meet the threats from Medflies, cicadas and the 
like, they have been forced to contend with increasing environmental and health 
concerns. For example, protests against repeated malathion spraying in <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> have spooked state officials to the point where some worry that even 
a single urban pesticide spraying soon will be politically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Some of science's best weapons against insects, such as DDT, the old backbone 
of mosquito eradication, have been banned for years because of damaging 
environmental effects. Government regulations to protect water and air have 
also restricted the use of chemicals against pests. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the game have completely changed," <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said. "We have so 
much more to deal with today." 
</P>
<P>
The concerns about pesticide use and science's increasing understanding of its 
effects have forced officials into a delicate balancing act between the risks 
to agriculture and the public health risks. There are often no clear answers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much harder today," said <PERSON>UC Davis</PERSON> entomologist <PERSON>Richard Rice</PERSON>, another 
member of the <ORGANIZATION>Medfly Science Advisory Panel</ORGANIZATION>. "We can't just give up and go back 
to nature, but we also have to be concerned about the health and ecological 
effects. We all wish sometimes for simpler days." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there seems to 
</P>
<P>
be no shortage of pests. Farmers in 32 states are now operating under federal 
quarantines for various pest infestations. One of the most worrisome pests is 
the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first introduction of the Medfly to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>, outbreaks 
have come so frequently that scientists are no longer sure if this current 
infestation -- the biggest ever in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> -- is a new introduction 
or simply a continuation of past outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists figure that the pest originally was brought into the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> by travelers or immigrated in a package of infested fruit from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>. Those countries were infested in the same way years 
ago by the Medfly, whose ancestral home is in <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The state has mounted a <MONEY>$36-million</MONEY> campaign of malathion spraying and sterile 
fly releases to control its spread. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime this <DATE>summer</DATE>, the king of the exotic pests -- the tabloid's "killer 
bee" -- is expected to reach the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> after three decades of migrating 
through <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>. The bee originally was brought from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in 
the <DATE>1950s</DATE> by a geneticist, hoping to breed a better variety of bee. Instead, 26 
swarms escaped and their progeny have been moving northward ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The bees have been migrating at a pace of about 200 miles a year and <DATE>last year</DATE>, 
several swarms were trapped about 150 miles south of <LOCATION>Brownsville</LOCATION>, located at 
the southern tip of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be here," said <PERSON>Dan Clair</PERSON>, an entomologist with the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> facing a double-barrelled infestation from Africanized honey bees 
and fire ants from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. "There's no way to stop them, really." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clair</PERSON> said that, like many other exotic pests, the Africanized honey bees have 
been helped in their migration by environments that are more civilized than 
their natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"They have evolved in the tough environment of the tropics," he said, "and then 
you put them in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>. They just take off." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clair</PERSON> said the prospect of living with the "killer bee" is not as horrifying as 
the name suggests. While the Africanized bee is more aggressive than others, 
they won't attack unless provoked. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people panicking for no reason," <PERSON>Clair</PERSON> said. "It's just unnecessary. 
That's what worries me." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there have been cases of lethal attacks by swarms of 
Africanized bees along its migratory route. 
</P>
<P>
Home-grown pest outbreaks can be equally unnerving. One of the biggest bug 
explosions of the year took place last week in southern <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and northern 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> with the emergence of a bug called the cicada. 
</P>
<P>
The cicada, which can grow in length to 1 1/2 inches, is a black-bodied, 
orange-winged and red-eyed flying creature that lives for 17 years -- the 
longest life span of any known insect. 
</P>
<P>
In one of nature's strangest spectacles, this particular cicada spends almost 
all its life underground, only to emerge at the end for a monthlong orgy of sex 
and egg laying. No cicadas are seen again in the area until another 17 years 
have passed. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing it for as long as we can tell," said <PERSON>Ed Arnold</PERSON>, an 
entomologist with the <ORGANIZATION>Wisconsin Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>. "No one knows why." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the pest is no threat to agriculture. But the male cicadas have a 
loud mating call that in chorus becomes a deafening, buzzing whine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most maddening thing," <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> said. "You think there's something 
wrong with your ears. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a pretty good splat on your windshield too," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Given its mysterious life cycle and the brief but intense havoc the bug can 
create when it emerges, newspapers and television stations have been vigorous 
in their coverage of the cicada onslaught. The emergence process was reported 
like an approaching typhoon. The <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Sun-Times has even set up a cicada hot 
line, which the newspaper says receives at least 60 calls a day. One 
publication presented cicada recipes (sauteed in butter is popular). 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said no steps are taken to control the cicada, as they pose no threat to 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the nation, agricultural officials have found themselves facing 
potentially threatening infestations that could take years or even decades to 
eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of the voracious, two-inch-long Mormon cricket, which since 
the beginning of <DATE>March</DATE> has been pouring out of the mountains of northeastern 
<LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> in roving bands that stretch as long as 10 miles. The cricket 
infestation is <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>'s largest since the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and now covers about 700,000 
acres. If the infestation continues to grow, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>'s <MONEY>$66-million</MONEY> hay crop 
could be chewed to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago, cricket eradication crews stalked the land, dumping a lethal 
mixture of lime and arsenic to kill the pest. It took nearly 15 years before 
the outbreak subsided. This time around, eradication workers have largely 
relied on ground treatment with wheat bran laced with an insecticide called 
carbaryl to kill the bug. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying is less costly and more effective, but federal regulations 
prohibit spraying within 500 feet of water, ruling out the technique in the 
mountain canyons, which are filled with natural springs and streams. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're just putting out fires," one <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> official said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dick Rowe</PERSON>, a deputy director in the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada State Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, 
said the Mormon cricket outbreak probably was caused by four years of drought. 
Rain and cold weather in the <DATE>spring</DATE> is usually enough to chop down the number 
of crickets, but this year's mild weather has allowed the bug population to 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rowe</PERSON> said eradication workers have been scrambling to keep the bugs off 
Interstate 80 and out of towns, such as <LOCATION>Winnemucca</LOCATION>, although they pose no 
serious threat to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, people will freak out," <PERSON>Rowe</PERSON> said. "They're long, black and as big 
as your thumb. That's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
While pesticide spraying can wipe out troublesome infestations, it can create 
problems of its own. <PERSON>Kenneth Hagen</PERSON>, professor of entomology at <LOCATION>UC Berkeley</LOCATION>, 
said some of the worst insect outbreaks he can remember occurred in the <DATE>1940s</DATE> 
and <DATE>1950s</DATE> with the increased use of DDT. 
</P>
<P>
The insecticide killed the pests it was after, but it also killed plenty of 
other varieties, upsetting the delicate ecological systems that naturally 
contain bug populations. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were really spectacular years for outbreaks," <PERSON>Hagen</PERSON> said, recalling the 
hordes of spider mites and aphids that burst across the country.

<P>
Entomologists believe that this year's malathion spraying campaign in <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> has had a similar affect in unleashing the region's worst aphid 
infestation in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
They blame the infestation on the absence of lady bugs, lacewings and tiny 
wasps -- aphid predators that have been devastated by malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside entomologist <PERSON>Robert Luck</PERSON> added that there is always the danger 
that increased pesticide spraying will only create a poison-resistant strain of 
super bugs, which in many cases in the past has led to a vicious cycle of more 
and more pesticide use with less and less effect. 
</P>
<P>
"You can expect resistance at some point," he said. "It's probably just a 
matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists said that despite the variety of infestations across the country, 
the size and number of outbreaks is nothing to panic about.

"These things come and go," <PERSON>Hagen</PERSON> said.

YEAR OF THE BUGS 
</P>
<P>
Yellow jackets (Vespula pensylvanica and Vespula vulgaris) -- <LOCATION>Lake Tahoe</LOCATION> is 
bracing for what entomologists expect to be one of the worst yellow jacket 
attacks in years. The <ORGANIZATION>South Lake Tahoe Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> has begun passing 
out free bug traps. Locals say it only takes a few days for a swarm of the 
meat-eating bugs to polish off a can of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) -- 700,000 acres in <LOCATION>northeast Nevada</LOCATION> have been 
infested with the Mormon cricket, which began pouring out of the mountains in 
<DATE>March</DATE>. The bugs can grow to the size of a church mouse and have been roaming 
around <LOCATION>Winnemucca</LOCATION> and Interstate 80 in bands up to 10 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
Periodical cicada (<ORGANIZATION>Magicicada</ORGANIZATION> septendecim) -- <LOCATION>Southern Wisconsin</LOCATION> and northern 
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> have been inundated with the once-every-17-year emergence of the 
cicada. The bug can grow to an inch-and-a-half long and fills the area with a 
buzzing whine as it partakes of a monthlong orgy of sex and egg laying. 
</P>
<P>
Red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) -- The ferocious fire ant, 
originally from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, has already infested much of the Southeast. In 
the past two years, entomologists have discovered that ant colonies have 
unexpectedly evolved into having multiple queens, leading to far greater insect 
densities. The pest is eventually expected to spread to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens) -- If having the Medfly around wasn't bad 
enough, now the Mexfly has struck. The state has begun aerial malathion 
spraying in <LOCATION>El Cajon</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Compton</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean fruit fly (<ORGANIZATION>Ceratitis</ORGANIZATION> capitata) -- Outbreaks in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> have made the Medfly the most notorious pest in the country this 
year. Only 270 of the tiny flies have been trapped in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in 10 months, 
but at least <MONEY>$36 million</MONEY> has been spent trying to eradicate the bug. 
</P>
<P>
Africanized honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata) -- Watch out! After years of 
screaming tabloid headlines, the "killer" bee is finally expected to cross into 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this <DATE>summer</DATE> somewhere near <LOCATION>Brownsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex</LOCATION>.

<LEADPARA>  In what is described as an important step toward controlling crop-destroying
insects without chemical pesticides, scientists have successfully used genetic
engineering to hasten the work of biological pest controls.;    In two
separate experiments, researchers say they removed toxin-producing genes from
mites and scorpions and inserted them in viruses that kill insect pests. The
toxins paralyzed the insects and prevented them from eating vegetation for
much of the time it took the slowly working viruses to kill the pests.  </LEADPARA>

CROP-EATING BUGS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Ordinarily, the insects would eat crops until they died. But because they
were immobilized, plant damage in one experiment was half what it would
otherwise have been.;    The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and British experiments are described in
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s issue of the British journal Nature.;    Alternative to chemicals; 
Biological pesticides are an attractive alternative to expensive and
environmentally dangerous chemical pesticides, but so far they have only
secured about <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the worldwide pesticide market. The slowness of
many biological controls, compared with chemical pesticides, is one reason.;  
 The findings reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> "take the development of effective
'biopesticides' a long step further," two British experts said in a commentary
in Nature. They are <PERSON>Michael E. Hochberg</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Population</ORGANIZATION> at
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial College</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Jeffrey K. Waage</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>International Institute of
Biological Control</ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION>Ascot</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England.</LOCATION>;    Species-specific viruses; 
<ORGANIZATION>Chemical</ORGANIZATION> pesticides are generally lethal to a broad spectrum of insects,
killing beneficial insects as well as pests. But the viruses that kill insect
pests are limited to a number of species, or only one. They do not affect
larger animals, including humans.;    The new technique makes it possible to
produce an efficient, genetically engineered virus aimed at any single pest,
said <PERSON>Dr. Lois K. Miller</PERSON>, an entomologist and geneticist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Georgia</ORGANIZATION>, whose laboratory conducted one of the experiments. She wrote one of
the papers in Nature, along with <PERSON>Dr. Michael D. Tomalski.</PERSON>;    The British
experiment was conducted by <PERSON>Dr. Robert D. Possee</PERSON> and a number of his
colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology</ORGANIZATION>
operated by the <ORGANIZATION>National Environment Research Council</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England.</LOCATION>;   
Harmless to mammals;    Both groups said the paralyzing toxins added to the
viruses were harmless to mice, and by extension to all mammals, but <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>
said further tests would be undertaken. Both groups also said insects were
unlikely to develop resistance to the genetically engineered viruses.;   
"Those insects infected with the virus and that are exposed to the toxin die,"
said <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>. "So there is little chance of a resistance being passed on to the
next generation.";    Many insect species have developed resistance after
being exposed for long periods to chemical pesticides and also to plants into
which toxic properties have been bred.;    An extended period of testing and
certification by university, industrial and government scientists will be
necessary before the genetically altered viruses can be used commercially in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. "It will take three to five years to move this through the
registration procedures," <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said.  </TEXT>

   Biotech companies that are trying to engineer
insect-killing genes into big commercial crops like cotton,
corn, and potato are getting a worrisome signal from a moth
in Hawaii.
   Plant scientists at several companies including Monsanto
Co., have poured millions of dollars into what appears to be
a successful attempt to take genes from a bacterium called Bt
(for Bacillus thurigiensis) and put them into plants. The
genes produce proteins that kill insects by interfering with
their digestion. Laboratory and greenhouse tests show that a
bug taking a bite out of a plant carrying one of these
bacterial genes will quickly discover it's eaten its last
meal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The genetic engineering feat is so promising, <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION> has
been conducting field trials of cotton plants incorporating
the Bt gene for two years.
   But a group of entomologists from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION>
say they have documented cases in Hawaiian watercress fields
in which the diamondback moth, a common pest, has developed
strong resistance to insecticide sprays containing a Bt
toxin. "The results of our study put to rest the notion that
<ORGANIZATION>Bt</ORGANIZATION> will be a permanent solution to our pest problems," said
<PERSON>Bruce Tabashnik</PERSON>, professor of entomology and one of the
researchers, "There was a perception until recently that
insects won't develop resistance to Bt as they have to
chemical pesticides."
   Prof. <PERSON>Tabashnik</PERSON> said the diamondback moth's resistance to
<ORGANIZATION>Bt</ORGANIZATION> should also be seen as "an early warning that other
insects can develop resistance" to other strains of Bt. A
number of companies -- <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ecogen Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Du Pont Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Calgene Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Entotech Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Agracetus</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>W. R.
Grace &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> -- have developed or are currently testing
different strains of the bacterium against such pests as
cottonplant eating caterpillars, corn borers, and potato
beetles.
   Some of these companies expressed concern over the
evidence collected in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, but said it wasn't conclusive.
Also they have already been pursuing strategies that take Bt
resistance into account.
   Some companies are using the Bt-toxin in the form of
sprays, such as the ones used on the fields in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, and
others, like <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION>, are engineering the gene for the toxin
right into the crop.
   <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION> is considering incorporating into the plants more
than one strain of the bacterium. "There is a low probability
that the insect will develop resistance to both at the same
time," said <PERSON>Randy Deaton</PERSON>, a scientist at its plant sciences
unit.
   Chi-Li Liu, who heads the microbiology operation at
<LOCATION>Entotech</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Davis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, unit of <ORGANIZATION>Novo Nordisk</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>,
said her company is closely monitoring the fields where its
Bt-based insecticide sprays are used. "We don't believe that
if Bt pesticides are properly used by farmers insects would
develop resistance," she said. Entotech recommends farmers
rotate Bt-based pesticides with the traditional
chemical-based products and rotating crops.
   But Prof. <PERSON>Tabashnik</PERSON> believes that the evidence of
resistance developed by the diamondback moth is likely to
damp the heavy reliance of companies on Bt for biological
control of pests. He said there have been other convincing
reports of resistance developing in moths in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>,
and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. The diamondback moth is a pest of
cabbage, broccoli, watercress, and brussel sprouts, among
other crops.
   It's uncertain how long it takes for an insect to develop
a resistance to the Bt toxins. The Hawaiian fields where
Prof. <PERSON>Tabashnik</PERSON> and his co-researchers found moth resistance
had been using sprays containing Bt from <DATE>1978</DATE> to <DATE>1982</DATE>, and
again from <DATE>1988</DATE> to present.

<LEADPARA>  IN most cases, simple common sense practices are the key to keeping insects in
check. So, if you're pestered by household pests, do a little cleanup work.
And above all, don't be embarrassed. Says William Chaney, entomology farm
adviser for the UC Cooperative Extension Service: "I would stress that this
doesn't indicate poor housekeeping on anyone's part. It's just a matter of
circumstance and chance. It can happen to anyone.";    So enough bug talk.
With warm, bug-filled weather just around the corner, here are some tips to
ensure that your home keeps a low pest profile:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box) Keep flour and other foods, even pet foods, in air-tight containers.
Tupperware-style containers are good; plastic bags won't do. Often, moths and
other pests enter a home through an infested store-bought package. So if you
spot worms in a package of food, throw the whole thing out. Don't try to save
part of it, and don't mix a new batch of food into the old. Clean infested
shelves with water and a small amount of Lysol or ammonia.;    (box) Plug
baseboards and areas around sink pipes. Cockroaches love dark, humid places
and are notorious for poking their way through holes around sinks. Also, keep
garbage covered and don't let it accumulate.;    (box) Use caulking around
windows and weatherproof your home with weatherstripping. These measures save
energy -- and create a physical barrier to insects.;    (box) Keep
nectar-bearing plants such as fruit trees, showy flowers and fast-growing
herbaceous plants away from the house perimeter. Ants feed on the sweet
secretions of the aphids that attack these plants. Drought-resistant plants
such as juniper and chaparral are a better choice for house-side landscaping.;
   (box) In clothes closets and drawers, use insect-repelling cedar blocks or
cedar and lavender sachets. Kettle Care of <LOCATION>Kalispell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, sells a sachet
containing a mix of herbs known as insect repellents since Roman times:
lavender, cedar, penny royal and rosemary. The 3-by-5-inch calico sachet (for

756-3485.;    If you can't identify a pest, have questions about pest control
or need the expert advice required for dealing with tough critters like
termites and carpet beetles, call the <ORGANIZATION>UC Cooperative Extension Service</ORGANIZATION>: in
