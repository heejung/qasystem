   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has no plans to send
military forces to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, where Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON>
and more than 30 others are being held hostage by Moslem rebels,
the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   At the same time, deputy spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> criticized
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s involvement with the rebels, saying it has provided some
training for the insurgents. But he said there was no apparent
direct link between <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and the hostage-taking, which occurred
last <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Boucher refused comment on reports that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military assets
were being deployed in the vicinity of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> but said ``there
are no plans for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military intervention.''
   The USS Roosevelt paid a scheduled visit to <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> <DATE>July
20-23</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> said. The carrier is now in port in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>. The
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> has 10 ships in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> on what the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> calls ``routine
exercises.''
   <PERSON>Boucher</PERSON> said there have been no reports of injury to the
estimated 6,000 Americans living in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was keeping up to date on developments after
returning to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after a weekend at his vacation
home in <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.
   ``We fully support the government of Prime Minister (<PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>)
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and hope for a peaceful solution to the situation there,''
said <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Alixe Glen</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said any direct <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> role had been all but ruled
out. Even sending <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experts on hostage negotiations _ discussed
informally on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
representatives of the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> government _ had been ruled out,
sources said.
   ``The Trinidadians would like to find a solution on their own
without any outside assistance. They'd just rather settle it
themselves,'' the official said.
   The administration has hailed <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s government as a model
of democracy, and the attempted coup was viewed with distress in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
late <DATE>Friday</DATE> by seizing the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> and
capturing <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and about 40 other hostages.
   <PERSON>Angus Khan</PERSON>, the ambassador from <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said the negotiations between his government and the
``terrorists over the release of the hostages are very delicate.''
He refused to say more.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ A black Moslem leader said his
rebels captured Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON> and his Cabinet in
the Parliament building <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and claimed to have toppled the
government of this southern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation.
   But government radio early today broadcast a condemnation of the
uprising and said police had moved into the streets of the capital
to bring order in this mainly Catholic and Hindu country. There
were no immediate reports of casualties.
   The attack on Parliament came <DATE>Friday</DATE> as the capital's police
headquarters was blown up and explosions and gunfire were heard in
the direction of the government's television station, which the
rebels seized.
   ``The government has been overthrown,'' leader <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION>, said on
government television.
   He promised ``free and fair'' elections within 90 days in
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a former British colony of 1.3 million people
on two islands that lie off the Venezuelan coast.
   ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no
hope for the present regime to stop,'' he said.
   Bakr's group has an estimated 250 followers. The country has a
1,500-member army and a 5,000-member police force.
   British West <ORGANIZATION>Indies Airways</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> canceled
commercial flights into <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, but the <LOCATION>Piarco
International Airport</LOCATION> remained under control of government security
forces.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Service</ORGANIZATION>'s Radio 610, the government
radio station, said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and his Cabinet were being held in the
<ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building across the street from the
central police station.
   Radio 610 said the police station was blown up and burned out of
control for hours. Announcer <PERSON>Dennis McComie</PERSON> said no one attempted
to put out the fire and there were several explosions of what he
assumed was ammunition in the station.
   Bakr first appeared on television at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> to announce the
uprising by <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON>Dave Denny</PERSON> said, ``We
would deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic government of
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.''
   Denny said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> had reported gunfire and explosions
in the vicinity of the TV station, which is several miles northwest
of the parliamentary building, but only a few blocks below the
hillside <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotel</ORGANIZATION>.
   Denny said he had no word about the situation of Americans in
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. The smaller island of <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> is a popular
vacation site.
   <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said there was no plan for violence, looting or retribution
against civilians.
   Acting President <PERSON>Emmanuel Carter</PERSON> told Radio 610 that people
should pray for a solution to the situation.
   ``Stay at home and let the protected (police) forces do their
jobs,'' he said.
   McComie said at <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> that there had been some looting
and police had moved into the streets for the first time since the
country's leading officials were seized.
   Radio 610 broadcast a statement from <PERSON>David Coore</PERSON>, Jamaican
foreign affairs minister, deploring the uprising. His comments were
heard on Radio 610 on a relay from <LOCATION>Radio Jamaica</LOCATION>.
   ``We call urgently and directly on those responsible for this
totally unacceptable situation to release the hostages
unconditionally and pursue whatever complaints they have by the
regular processes of constitutional democracy which are the
hallmark of our <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Community</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Coore</PERSON> said.
   Caribbean heads of state and their ministers were to meet this
<DATE>weekend</DATE> in the Jamaican capital of <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION> for the annual meeting
the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> common market. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> Foreign Affairs Minister
<PERSON>Sahadeo Basdeo</PERSON> is in <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION>.
   It could not be ascertained how many ministers were taken
hostage with <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and
economist.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, is a former <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> policeman and has
been arrested several times in the past on charges of contempt of
court and illegal demonstrations.
   He lives with 200 to 250 followers, their wives and children in
a commune on the western side of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. Members of the
sect, founded in <DATE>1980</DATE>, are widely perceived in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> as violent
outlaws, though the group's rhetoric is highly moralistic.
   Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> has said he doesn't recognize ``man's law,'' only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   In <DATE>November of 1988</DATE>, police raided the sect's sanctuary and
seized weapons and ammunition. <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said then he was waging a war
against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   The Moslem group is known to have connections to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> that are
said to include some funding. Trinidad published reports say <PERSON>Abu
Bakr</PERSON> has visited <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1962</DATE>. It
is an English-speaking country with a large populace from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   About a third of the people are Roman Catholic and a quarter are
Hindu. Only about <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> are Moslem, most of them <LOCATION>East Indians</LOCATION>.
There is great tension between the black and Indian Moslems.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. Recently, the government
had denied customs approval of a shipment of medical supplies
donated to Bakr by <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Moslem militants said they
captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in the Parliament
building on <DATE>Friday</DATE> in this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> capital. There were reports of
gunfire and explosions in the city.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, head of the black rebel group, said in a nationwide
radio and TV broadcast late <DATE>Friday</DATE> that the government was toppled.
The claim could not be independently confirmed.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> had a station newscaster read a statement on
national television about <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> EDT in which <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> announced the
uprising by the group <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, which is Arabic for the
<ORGANIZATION>Group of Moslems</ORGANIZATION>. He claimed to be holding captive in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>
the prime minister, <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON>.
   An announcer on Radio 610, <PERSON>Dennis McComie</PERSON>, quoted <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> as having
said on TV that ``the government has been overthrown'' and promised
elections within 90 days. Bakr did not mention what he had done
with the prime minister and his Cabinet.
   Bakr was quoted as saying his motive for moving against the
government was ``poverty and the destruction of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. ... We
will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no hope
for the present regime to stop.''
   There has been no official reaction from the government but late
<DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Dave Denny</PERSON> said,
``We would deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic
government of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.''
   He also said, ``Our embassy reports gunfire in the vicinity of
the TV station. Explosions and gunfire have been heard downtown.''
   There were unconfirmed reports of casulaties in this city of
300,000 residents though <PERSON>Denny</PERSON> said he had no word about the
situation of Americans in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s smaller island of
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> is a popular vacation site.
   <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said there was no plan for violence, looting or retribution
against civilians, McComie told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Moslem group claims to have 200 to 250 members. They are
known as a small militant group with connections to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> that are
said to include some funding.
   The rebel statement said the Cabinet also was being held hostage
with <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and
economist, but it could not be ascertained how many were inside the
Parliament building.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION>CBS Radio</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and the entire Cabinet, which had been
meeting at the time, were believed in the custody of the rebels.
   A radio station in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, government-owned <ORGANIZATION>National
Broadcasting Service</ORGANIZATION>, said that police headquarters in downtown
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> also had been blown up <DATE>Friday</DATE> by the rebels. The
rebels are based in <LOCATION>St. James</LOCATION>, outside the capital, and near police
headquarters.
   McComie said the central police station was on fire and there
had been several explosions that he assumed was ammunition. No one
was trying to put the fire out and it was spreading to surrounding
structures, he said, adding that it appeared headed for the
telephone company.
   Trinidadian <PERSON>James Fadelle</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> said he had spoken with a
friend in <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> by telephone earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>.
   ``They're all locked up in their houses. They cannot go
outside,'' <PERSON>Fadelle</PERSON> said. He added that his friend, <PERSON>Peter Lambie</PERSON>,
had told him some civilians had been killed in the downtown area
and two police stations had been blown up.
   McComie said he was in the street by the radio station at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>
when he heard gunshots inside <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, which is the parliament
building. He said he returned safely to the station, but two gunmen
entered and set fire to the engineering department.
   McComie said radio employees were able to extinguish the fire.
   ``We can see people in the streets with guns,'' he said.
   The leader, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>, is a former police officer in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. Little
is known about him. Trinidad published reports say he spent some
time in <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, the larger of the two islands in the nation of
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, has a population of about 1.3 million, and is
just off the northeast coast of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>
gained independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1962</DATE>. It is an English-speaking
country with a large populace from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   About a third of the people are Roman Catholic and a quarter are
Hindus. Only about <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> are Moslem.
   The island in recent years has suffered from a recession, with
closing of oil refineries, devaluation of the local currency and a
new, unpopular <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> value-added tax, according to locals.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, creating controversy and
tensions on the island.
   The 1,500-member army has not entered into the fray yet, and is
said to be in northwestern <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   The broadcast statement said the rebels were in touch with the
army but it was not known what that signified.
   The police force on <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> has about 5,000 members.
   McComie said he and his crew had locked themselves inside the
building and considered themselves ``in considerable danger.''
   Although station personnel felt in danger, they continued to
broadcast a live broadcast of a soccer game at the national stadium
in <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   A security guard at the <ORGANIZATION>Trinidad Guardian</ORGANIZATION> said the newspaper
building had been evacuated. He said that most likely there would
not be a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> edition.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, the Moslem leader whose
rebels captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in a coup
attempt, has been fighting with the government for years.
   Most recently, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> has been involved in a dispute over medical
supplies and pharmaceuticals reportedly donated by <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and
prohibited by customs agents from entering the country.
   One of the first things <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> did after taking the leaders
captive was accuse the government of refusing to let him distribute
free medicine to the poor people of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>.
   Members of his sect, <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, have long been
perceived by many Trinidadians as violent outlaws, although they
proclaim moralistic motives for their actions.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, founded <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for
``Group of Moslems,'' six years ago.
   He has said he does not recognize ``man's laws,'' but only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, he said he understood ``the present suffering of the
people'' and that Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON> had been
overthrown by God.
   ``God has removed him,'' <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said on government television.
``No man, including me, has power. ... He gave us victory over the
prime minister.''
   Bakr, his 200 to 250 followers and their wives and children live
on a commune in western <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
   Bakr, a former policeman, said then his vigilantes were waging a
war against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, he said, ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and
drugs which there was no hope for the present regime to stop.''
   Moslems make up <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of the population of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a former British colony just off the northeast coast of
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. Of the nation's 1.3 million people, about <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> are
of African descent and the same proportion is of East Indian
descent.
   Most of the <LOCATION>East Indians</LOCATION> are Hindu. Most of the <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION> are
Roman Catholic or Protestant. The nation's small Moslem population
is mostly East Indians with some <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION>. But the black Moslem
population has grown since the black power movement began 20 years
ago, and <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s sect is the largest among them.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ A Moslem zealot's attempt to
overthrow the government, and the burning and looting that
accompanied it, have staggered <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> after three decades of
stable democracy.
   The rebels surrendered <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and the six-day coup attempt
ended with the safe release of the hostages, but the casualty toll
in the assault and subsequent violence was at least 38 dead and 150
wounded.
   Now Trinidadians face food and gasoline shortages, economic
disruption from a week of paralyzing curfews and the devastation
left by looters and arsonists.
   This racially and ethnically diverse nation known for sun and
calypso also must deal with tensions created by the violent effort
to destroy a democracy that has endured since independence from
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``As a sociologist, I know that conflict and crisis can either
splinter groups or unify them; it's never in-between,'' said
<PERSON>Anthony Maingot</PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and is a <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> expert
at <ORGANIZATION>Florida International University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   The coup attempt by <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, leader of a commune of 250 to 350
Moslems, began <DATE>July 27</DATE>.
   Bakr and his followers, most of whom are poor and black,
attacked police headquarters with explosives and seized Prime
Minister <PERSON>N.R. Robinson</PERSON> and other government officials in <ORGANIZATION>Parliament
House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Other members of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen simultaneously invaded the
state television complex a mile away and took employees hostage.
   Bakr's immediate demands were the prime minister's resignation
and elections within 90 days.
   ``I don't know that they planned beyond taking <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>,'' the
parliament building, said Col. <PERSON>Joe Theodore</PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> in the crisis. ``He went in with a
half-baked plan.''
   The sports and culture minister, <PERSON>Jennifer Johnson</PERSON>, one of the
hostages, said the rebels were convinced they could improve
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> by establishing a fundamentalist Moslem state. Bakr, whose
newspaper had attacked ``satanic'' <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and International Monetary
Fund economic treatment of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, promised to help the poor.
   There were no signs of popular support for <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s attempt to
overthrow th prime minister.
   Robinson trails in public opinion polls and elections are due
next year.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> has had a boom-to-bust economy over the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>
tied to the world price of oil, its main source of wealth.
   The <DATE>1970s</DATE> oil boom brought prosperity and gave Trinidadians the
highest standard of living in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. The bottom fell out of
the oil market in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s gross national product,
the value of all goods and services, has dropped <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> in
eight years.
   Robinson led the new <ORGANIZATION>National Alliance for Reconstruction</ORGANIZATION> to a
landslide in <DATE>1986</DATE> with promises of recovery, ousting the <ORGANIZATION>People's
National Movement</ORGANIZATION>, which had been in power since colonial days.
   He has tried to diversify the economy, partly by expanding
tourism, to which the island was largely indifferent during the oil
boom. Unpopular austerity measures demanded by the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> in return
for loans included wage freezes, new taxes, public employee layoffs
and devaluations that cut the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> dollar's value from about <MONEY>42
cents</MONEY> to 24.
   Officials say the economy has shown signs of recovery, but that
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s reserved personal style and an unraveling of his
coalition weakened the government.
   ``There is discontent in the country,'' government spokesman
<PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> said. ``Apparently, he (<PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>) took this as a sign
that the people were ready to revolt, but that is not the way
Trinidadians change government.''
   Much of downtown <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> was looted, prompting
international assistance that began with food shipments last week
from <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.
   Tourism and foreign investment are expected to suffer.
   ``We will have to make an effort to win people's confidence,''
<PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> said.
   There were signs of strained ethnic relations during the
violence. Looters shouted epihets at Arab store owners and Moslems
were the targets of anger.
   Most of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people are Hindu or Christian,
each representing more than <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT>. Moslems make up about <PERCENT>6
percent</PERCENT> and, among them, <LOCATION>East Indians</LOCATION> outnumber the blacks 20 to 1.
   Many East Indians scorn black Moslems as a sect outside the
mainstream Islamic community, an attitude resented by the <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and
his followers.
   Confidence in <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s government could be undermined by the
fact that such a small group was able to cripple the nation.
   Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s sect had been involved in court cases and with
police. It was under surveillance and police spokesman <PERSON>Winston
Cooper</PERSON> said ``the Libyan connection was established.''
   Authorities say sect members received money and training from
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, although there is no evidence <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s
leader, was linked to the coup attempt.
   <PERSON>Raffique Shah</PERSON>, managing editor of The Mirror, said he hoped
other would-be rescuers of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> would learn from <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s attempt
and ``see the futility of such action.''
   As the week ended, turmoil in another land offered some hope to
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. The Iraqi invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> pushed oil prices up.

   Nearly 400,000 Moslems make the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> their home, but most are East Indians who disdain the
radical politics of black Moslems like those who are holding
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s government hostage.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, black <PERSON>Moslem Abu Bakr</PERSON> took over <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> and
threatened to kill the prime minister and much of his Cabinet.
   Bakr is a fundamentalist who has developed strong support from
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s poor black community. His <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> sect has
an eight-acre commune in western <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, where more than 250
men, women and children live. There is a large mosque, day care
center, school and kitchens for the homeless.
   Bakr has close ties with <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and has often stated that Islamic
principles must dominate society.
   But few East Indian Moslems support views like <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s and
tensions between Moslems of East Indian and African descent _ two
groups that rarely mix _ have been high.
   Many East Indians consider the black Moslems political
opportunists inspired more by the black power movement than by
traditional Islam. <PERSON>Stokely Carmichael</PERSON>, the black power advocate of
the <DATE>1960s</DATE> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, was born in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   Among the region's political leaders, prominent Moslems include
East Indian President <PERSON>Noor Hassanali</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and Prime Minister
<PERSON>Hamilton Green</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>, a black who converted to Islam in the
<DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   The first Moslems came to the region to work in the sugar cane
fields, either as black slaves in the <DATE>1700s</DATE> or as indentured
servants from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 100 years later.
   Now domed mosques can be found on a dozen <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands, but
the heaviest concentrations of Moslems are on the islands of
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION> on the South
American mainland.
   ``One of the region's strongest religious trends today is the
movement toward Islam among blacks,'' says freelance writer <PERSON>Larry
Luxner</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>. In the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>, many blacks
have converted to Islam.
   Luxner, who has written extensively on Moslems in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>,
estimates that Trinidad-Tobago and <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION> each have 100,000
Moslems and <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> 120,000.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> is mostly a Hindu and Christian nation of
1.3 million people. About <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of the population is Moslem,
with those of East Indian and African descent each make up <PERCENT>40
percent</PERCENT> of the Moslem population.
   Writing in the Arabic magazine <LOCATION>Aramco World</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Luxner</PERSON> said
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> had 85 mosques, <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> 133 and <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION>, formerly Dutch
<LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>, 150. He said <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION>'s 400,000 people were
Moslem, the highest percentage in any country in the <LOCATION>Western
Hemisphere</LOCATION>.
   There are also 2,500 Moslems in <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, most of them
Palestinians who arrived between <DATE>1958</DATE> and <DATE>1962</DATE>, <PERSON>Luxner</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R.
Robinson</PERSON> and the chief negotiator for his Moslem extremist captors
said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that they had reached agreement to end a 4-day-old
hostage siege.
   Robinson, other Cabinet ministers and lawmakers were among 41
hostages reported held by the black Moslems, who stormed the
Parliament building and the government television station on <DATE>Friday</DATE>
in a coup attempt. Robinson suffered gunshot wounds in both feet.
   Word of the accord came in telephone call to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> journalist
<PERSON>Tony Fraser</PERSON> from inside <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and was not immediately
announced to the nation.
   <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON>, the justice and national security minister,
said in the call that the agreement called for <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s immediate
resignation, with elections to be held within 90 days.
   <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> said the government granted amnesty to rebel leader
<PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> and his followers in the revolt, which has left at least
nine people dead and led to looting on this island-nation of 1.3
million residents.
   The official said, however, that the agreement was contingent
``upon the safe return of all members of Parliament'' now held
hostage.
   It was unclear when the hostage release might occur.
   The announcement came hours after government and military
spokesmen said negotiations with the radical Moslem group had
collapsed.
   Earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE>, security forces exchanged gunfire with the
rebels at both the parliament building and the state-run television
station, the two buildings were hostages were being held.
   Speaking from inside <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> late <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. <PERSON>Joe Theodore</PERSON>, head of
the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator <PERSON>Bilal Abdullah</PERSON>, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> has just said.''
   The rebels claim <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s government is corrupt and
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.
They claimed on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to have wired <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> with explosives and
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.
   Government spokesman <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was shot in both
feet and <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> was shot in one leg when rebels stormed
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON> reported that the Moslems were
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since <DATE>Friday</DATE>. He said Anglican
negotiator <PERSON>Knolly Clarke</PERSON> told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   The two sides nearly reached agreement earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE> but a
government official said negotiations stalled over conditions for
releasing the hostages, who include eight Cabinet ministers.
   <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> said 41 hostages were being held and about 100 rebels were
involved in the siege.
   He said 16 hostages, including the government ministers, were
being held in the parliament building. The remaining 25 hostages
are all employees of the government TV station, he said.
   Among the dead were six rebels, two police officers and one
civilian, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said. Six rebels were known to be wounded.
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said three soldiers were wounded, none seriously.
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> there are no
plans for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. Deputy spokesman
<PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> refused comment on reports of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military
maneuvers in the area, but suggested a military solution was ruled
out.
   <PERSON>Boucher</PERSON> said none of the estimated 6,000 Americans living in
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> were reported hurt.
   He criticized <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s involvement, saying the radical North
African Arab nation trained Trinidadian insurgents. But he said no
apparent direct link existed between <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and the hostage-taking
in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   Shaw and <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> called a news conference hours after a gun
battle between security forces and rebels at the state-run <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> Television complex.
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said rebels fired on troops in an apparent attempt to
escape the TV complex. ``We were fired upon; we fired back,'' he
said. ``We won the firefight. They withdrew.''
   Three buildings in the area were set ablaze, witnesses said.
   Sporadic gunfire also broke out at the parliament building,
about a mile away, where the ministers were held. The army said no
attempt was made to storm either building.
   Army chief Col. <PERSON>Ralph Brown</PERSON> said he did not think the hostages
suffered casualties.
   <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> it sent 120 soldiers to neighboring <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>
to assist <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> if needed.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam in <DATE>1980</DATE>, founded
<ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, which means the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION> in Arabic, in
<DATE>1984</DATE>. The group is believed to number 250 to 300.
   <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> said a <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> to noon curfew would remain in effect
islandwide despite a ``significant diminishing'' in looting, which
caused an estimated <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> damage to downtown stores.
   In a statement read on state radio, <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Lucy Hall</PERSON> urged all American tourists in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> to obey the
curfew.
   Caribbean leaders gathering in <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, for a
conference added regional security to their agenda because of
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. Heads of state and other government leaders
from the 13 member nations will open the <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Economic
Community</ORGANIZATION> conference on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Robinson easily won the <DATE>1986</DATE> parliamentary elections. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until <DATE>1991</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Caribbean leaders <DATE>Saturday</DATE> condemned
the attempted overthrow of the government of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> put their armies on alert in case <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s
government asks for help.
   Several Caribbean heads of state and government officials were
in <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> to attend a summit of the <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Economic Community</ORGANIZATION>.
The meeting starts <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N. Robinson</PERSON>, who has been held
hostage since <DATE>Friday</DATE> by black Moslem rebels in <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s capital, is an influential figure within the community
and had planned to attend the summit.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, with a population of 1.3 million, is the
second largest member after <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> in the 13-nation Caribbean
community, which groups 11 island nations as well as <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Percival J. Patterson</PERSON>, acting prime minister of <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, said
his country's defense force was being readied in the event the
community was asked to provide military assistance.
   ``The army has been placed on full alert,'' <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said after
a meeting in <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION> with other <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> leaders who had arrived
early for the summit.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Erskine Sandiford</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> said his island
nation's army had also been placed on alert.
   ``<LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> supports democratic government, and where such
governments are overthrown or threatened by illegal means, we will
not support this,'' <PERSON>Sandiford</PERSON> said. ``If any request is made we
will consider assistance.''
   In <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Eugenia Charles</PERSON> called for an end to
the takeover attempt.
   ``We cannot allow this nonsense,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Charles</PERSON>, who asked
for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> after a bloody
coup there.
   Troops from the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> community provided token support for
the invading <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces, which ousted the Marxist military junta
that took power after killing Prime Minister <PERSON>Maurice Bishop</PERSON> and
several government ministers.
   <PERSON>Lynden Pindling</PERSON>, prime minister of the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>, also pledged
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> ``to render whatever assistance'' possible if <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s
government asks for help from the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> organization.
   Pindling did not indicate, however, whether his administration
was willing to consider military assistance.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON>Sahadeo Basdeo</PERSON>, who had led a
delegation to pre-summit discussions in <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>afternoon</TIME> that he would attempt to return home to assess the
situation.
   ``We are pleading with the rebels to free the prime minister and
to talk about their problems,'' <PERSON>Basdeo</PERSON> said. ``We are pleading for
common sense and rationality to prevail, and for a restoration of
democracy.''
   In <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, Acting Foreign Minister <PERSON>Edden Shand</PERSON>, who was
released by the rebels <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, made a statement on radio opposing
any foreign military intervention.
   In <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and national security
adviser <PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON> were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary <PERSON>Alixe Glen</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION>, the Venezuelan government said it would not
recognize any rebel government in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a former
British colony of two islands which lies off <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>'s coast.
   ``<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> ... energetically rejects this attempt to overthrow
the constitutional government,'' said the statement released
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> by the government news agency <ORGANIZATION>Venpres</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> is one of 48 members of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>, an
association of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and its former colonies. In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> secretary general on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> called the attempted
coup ``unwelcome and unacceptable.''
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, another <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>
member, called for the immediate release of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and other
government hostages.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> there are no
plans for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military intervention to bring an end to the
Moslem-led insurrection against the elected government in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   While refusing comment on reports of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military maneuvers in
the area, deputy spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> suggested that a
military solution had been ruled out.
   At the same time, <PERSON>Boucher</PERSON> criticized <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s involvement with
the rebels, saying it has provided some training for the
insurgents. But he said there was no apparent direct link between
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and hostage-taking which occurred last <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
by seizing the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> and capturing
Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> and about 40 other hostages.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and one other goverment minister were believed to have
been shot in the leg early in the coup attempt, and both have been
getting medical attention, said <PERSON>Bernard W. Aronson</PERSON>, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   Trinidad government spokesman <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> identified the second
victim as Justice Minister <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON>, and said both men
were in stable condition. <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> had been shot in both
feet, not the legs
   <PERSON>Aronson</PERSON>, who spoke in an interview on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' on the <ORGANIZATION>Public Broadcasting System</ORGANIZATION>, also said people were
killed in the coup attempt but said the department did not have a
figure on the casualties. He said none of them was a high-ranking
government official, but he declined to identify the victims
further.
   The <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> crisis has some of the earmarks of the situation in
<LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> <DATE>seven years ago</DATE> when a radical leftist movement took power.
In that case, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and several other <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
countries decided to oust the radicals.
   As in <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION>, the insurgents have shown a willingness to use
extremist methods to advance their cause.
   In both <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, there were signs of involvement by
anti-American elements from abroad. In <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION>, the leadership
there had close links to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> while in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> has been
allied with the rebels. Also, in both cases, a major concern of
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has been the well being of thousands of Americans
residing in the two countries.
   But a major difference between the two situations is that
whereas virtually all of the Americans in <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> were students at
a medical school, the 6,000 Americans in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> are dispersed
around the island and are less vulnerable to a mass hostage-taking.
   The international political climate also has undergone a
dramatic transformation since <DATE>1983</DATE>, a period when Cold War tensions
were at a peak.
   There is little indication that the events in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> will have
an impact beyond that country's borders. This was not the case in
<DATE>1983</DATE>, when members of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of Eastern Caribbean States</ORGANIZATION>
asked for the dispatch of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops.
   Beyond that, American officials said government officials in
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> have indicated a desire to resolve the crisis without
outside help.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Coup leader <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> and 112
militant Moslem followers surrendered <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and freed 46
hostages they seized five days earlier in a failed bid to overthrow
the government, officials said.
   State radio said a wounded hostage freed on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> died on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a hospital. That raised the death toll in the uprising
to at least 10.
   Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON>Winston Dookeran</PERSON> said the rebels, who
appeared not to have any significant support among the people,
``surrendered unconditionally'' and were under heavy guard at an
army base.
   He said they would face ``the appropriate charges,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Dookeran told reporters that Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON>
had not resigned, as he had offered to while held hostage.
   ``Prime Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> is the prime minister of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Dookeran</PERSON> said. ``There is no intention to resign.''
   ``We have made no deals with this extremist group,'' said
<PERSON>Dookeran</PERSON>, who was held hostage on the first day of the coup attempt.
   Bakr released Dookeran on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, saying he wanted the deputy
prime minister to head a caretaker government that would hold new
elections in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation.
   The attempted coup began <DATE>Friday</DATE> when armed rebels stormed the
state television station and the Parliament building, taking top
government officials and other captives.
   Bakr had demanded the resignation of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, whom he accused
of corruption.
   The 63-year-old prime minister was freed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and
hospitalized for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover
as well as exhaustion and glaucoma.
   Bakr blamed <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> for widespread poverty in this former
British colony of 1.3 million people. Bakr was among the rebels who
surrendered at the television station, where the first group of
hostages was freed.
   Government spokesman <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> said 113 rebels, including
<PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>, took part in the coup. He said 46 hostages held at <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>
and the TV building one mile away were released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Shaw and army spokesman Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON> said all hostages and
rebels had been evacuated and taken to separate army bases.
   State radio identified the former hostage who died Wednesdey as
<PERSON>Leo des Vignes</PERSON>, a junior minister. It said he died of a heart
attack in the hospital after being shot in the heel during the
takeover.
   The rebels released him on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the broadcast said.
   The radio said heavy gunfire was reported <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> in
<LOCATION>Champs Fleurs</LOCATION>, about 10 miles east of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. There was no
official explanation, but soldiers have been firing blank bullets
to scatter would-be looters for several days.
   The 29 captives at the TV station were all station employees.
The remaining 17 hostages at the Parliament building included seven
Cabinet ministers.
   In a live broadcast, state radio described the haggard-looking
captives filing out of the television station, one by one.
   Soldiers searched each one in the street, because the militants
had claimed at one point to have wired the captives with explosives
and threatened to blow them up.
   After the prisoner release, witnesses said about 50 rebels left
the television building, dropped their weapons and surrendered to
soldiers.
   Witnesses said <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> emerged wearing a fez, a white tunic and
white trousers. Like the other rebels, he dropped his gun and put
his hands behind his head.
   After boarding an army bus, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> shouted: ``Allahu akhbar!'' or
God is great.
   Hostages began leaving the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building at <TIME>5:10 p.m. EDT</TIME>.
The first to leave was a woman who held a white handkerchief to her
face.
   An army truck rolled up to the red, colonial-style building to
provide cover for soldiers who escorted her down the street.
   A few minutes later, the finance minister, <PERSON>Selby Wilson</PERSON>,
emerged, followed by another man who had a white handkerchief tied
across his face. The two men walked unescorted to a security van.
   The hostages walked along a sidewalk to a security area at the
end of the street, where they emptied their pockets and were
searched before getting onto an army bus. Some of the hostages
jogged down the street; others walked.
   Justice Minister <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON>, reportedly shot in the leg
during the Parliament takeover, walked with a noticeable limp.
Applause broke out as he boarded the bus.
   State radio said the rebels were taken to army headquarters at
Chaguerames in <LOCATION>northwest Trinidad</LOCATION> and the freed hostages to <PERSON>Camp
Ogden</PERSON>, an army base about five miles west of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   A local reporter who spoke with the former hostages at Camp
<PERSON>Ogden</PERSON> said they told him they had not eaten since <DATE>Friday</DATE> but were
otherwise OK. They were all undergoing medical exams in a tent.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Ogden Camp</ORGANIZATION>, freed hostage <PERSON>Grensell Kissoon</PERSON>, told a reporter,
``I'm glad to be alive.''
   TV station worker <ORGANIZATION>Raul Board</ORGANIZATION> held onto a post, saying he feared
he might faint from hunger. ``You know why I'm holding the post?
I'm afraid I might fall.''
   The capital was quiet <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. A 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew
remained in effect throughout most of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> following earlier
widespread looting.
   Bakr's <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> group, which means the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION>
in Arabic, was founded in <DATE>1984</DATE> and is believed to have 250 to 300
members. It is also believed to have received financing from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   Gargano had said 200 troops from neighboring Caribbean nations
were on neighboring <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and ``could be here in 45 minutes,''
but that <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and its sister island of <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> had not asked for
help.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ A group of black Moslems who
kidnapped the prime minister and some Cabinet members in a coup
attempt said <DATE>today</DATE> the captives may be harmed if the government
moves against a rebel-held TV station.
   One report said three people were killed in the first hours of
the rebel strike, which began <DATE>Friday</DATE> on the former British colony
of two islands that lie off the Venezuelan coast.
   ``The government has been overthrown,'' the coup leader, <PERSON>Abu
Bakr</PERSON>, said on government TV <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> after the station was
seized by his followers.
   But government radio said <DATE>today</DATE> that a state of emergency had
been declared and that police were moving into the streets of the
capital of this southern <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation to restore order.
   Gunfire was heard in the direction of the television station,
located in northeastern <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> about two miles from the
Parliament building and the main police station. Buildings also
were burning in eastern <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   Education Minister <PERSON>Clive Pantin</PERSON> said on government radio that he
had not been captured by the rebels and that the mutineers had
already released two unidentified ministers and four civilians they
had been holding.
   The Barbados-based <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean News Agency</ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION>, said three
people had been killed as the coup attempt began with an explosion
at the police station and rebels bursting into <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> firing
weapons.
   It said a news reporter had seen the body of a woman <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>
worker in the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building, and it quoted witnesses as
saying they saw two bodies in front of the building.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official said it appeared
``the active elements of the insurrection are limited to the
television station and the parliament building.''
   ``We understand there has been some looting'' in the streets,
``but nothing affecting the safety of our embassy or foreign
nationals,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s island of <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> is a popular vacation site
for Americans and others.
   In <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION>
Adviser <PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON> were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary <PERSON>Alixe Glen</PERSON>. She said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government had not yet received a request for international aid,
but would consider it once it arrives.
   Bakr, a former policeman who heads a group called <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat
al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, Arabic for the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION>, has said he doesn't
recognize ``man's law,'' only ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   The Moslem group is known to have connections to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> that are
said to include some funding. News reports say <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> has visited
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   Bakr's group has an estimated 250 followers. The mostly Hindu
and Roman Catholic country of 1.3 million people has a 1,500-member
army and a 5,000-member police force.
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said earlier that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would
``deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic government of
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.''
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Alliance</ORGANIZATION> for
Reconstruction won parliamentary elections in <DATE>December 1986</DATE>. The
next elections are due in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   British West <ORGANIZATION>Indies Airways</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> canceled
commercial flights into <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. <ORGANIZATION>Piarco
International Airport</ORGANIZATION> remained under control of government security
forces but was closed early today.
   When <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> broadcast his claim of a takeover, he did not disclose
the whereabouts of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and the other captured officials. It
was not known how many Cabinet ministers were taken hostage with
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and economist.
   But the news director at the captured government television
station went on the air <TIME>this morning</TIME> and said the prime minister
and the other officials were alive and being ``well treated.''
   The news director, <LOCATION>Jones Madeira</LOCATION>, said some of the officials
were being held at the TV station and others at the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>
building, <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>.
   But he warned that the television station's signals were being
tampered with and ``this could endanger the lives of those people
being held.''
   Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON>Anthony Pantin</PERSON> told government radio
he had spoken to <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> by telephone.
   ``He asked me to emphasize the request not to interfere with the
television channels, because if they do something may happen,'' the
prelate said.
   Several government ministers were seen on the rebel-controlled
television. Government radio, the <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Service</ORGANIZATION>'s
Radio 610, said the capital's police station was blown up and
burned out of control for hours.
   It said no one attempted to put out the fire, and there were
several explosions of what was assumed to be ammunition in the
station.
   Bakr first appeared on television at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to announce
the uprising. He said his followers planned no violence, looting or
retribution against civilians, and promised ``free and fair''
elections within 90 days.
   Government radio said before dawn <DATE>today</DATE> that there had been some
looting and police had moved into the streets.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, has been arrested several times in the
past on charges of contempt of court and illegal demonstrations.
   He lives with 200 to 250 followers, their wives and children in
a commune on the western side of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. Members of the
sect, founded in <DATE>1980</DATE>, are widely perceived in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> as violent
outlaws, though the group's rhetoric is highly moralistic.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
<PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said then his vigilantes were waging a war against ``the
menace of cocaine.''
   ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no
hope for the present regime to stop,'' he said in <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s
broadcast.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. Recently, the government
had denied customs approval of a shipment of medical supplies
donated to Bakr by <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R.
Robinson</PERSON> said he was gagged, beaten and shot in the leg by Moslem
fundamentalists who held him and other Cabinet ministers hostage in
an attempt to overthrow the government.
   ``I was incensed at the manner in which we were treated,''
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said in a television interview broadcast <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. It
was his first public appearance since he was freed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``We were roughed up, made to lie face down on the floor, our
pants down, legs tied ... unable to turn except with excrutiating
pain,'' he said.
   Robinson, whose right cheek was badly bruised, spoke from his
hospital bed to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> television.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> spoke briefly of his five-day captivity inside the
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> chamber and of the Moslem insurgents who held Cabinet
members inside the building until they surrendered on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``I really do not wish to re-live those events at this
particular moment,'' he said. ``But it is a fact I was gagged; that
the gag was being pushed down my throat by a gun.''
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said the gag thrust down his throat caused him to
vomit. He said he was shot in the right leg after shouting
``Murderers! Torturers!'' and calling on his two-way radio to the
armed forces to storm the building.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said his leg ``is still in such a state that I cannot
use it.''
   The prime minister, who is losing his eyesight because of
glaucoma, was released by the rebels <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for health reasons.
   ``Now, I could have been out before on medical grounds, but I
was convinced that my duty was to stay with my colleagues until the
fate of all of us was certain,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> did not say whether he signed an agreement with the
rebels, who had insisted on his resignation and early elections as
conditions for the release of the hostages.
   Besides <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and his Cabinet, the rebels also held 26 other
hostages inside the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> Television station.
   Officials said an estimated 38 people were killed during the
coup attempt. Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON> said the government is still
trying to determine the count.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, the leader of the Moslem radicals, and more than 100
of his followers were being held at the <LOCATION>Chaguaramas</LOCATION> military
headquarters. Lawyers were meeting <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to draw up charges
against them that could include murder, treason and kidnapping.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, one of <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s followers was killed in a shootout
with police.
   Police Inspector <PERSON>Winston Cooper</PERSON> said <PERSON>Njassane Omuaali</PERSON>, 21, was
killed during an exchange of gunfire and was among a ``band of
Moslems'' who fired on police.
   But <PERSON>Omuaali</PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON>Elaine Bailey</PERSON>, said her grandson, the
son of <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s first wife, was killed after police seized him.
   ``They grabbed him, kicked him down the stairs and killed him.
They shot him,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Bailey</PERSON>, 75, in a telephone interview.
   She said <PERSON>Omuaali</PERSON> was scheduled to return <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
where he was studying finance and accounting at <ORGANIZATION>Howard University</ORGANIZATION>
on a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> fellowship.
   In another development, <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> sent 40 troops to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> to
assist authorities. More than 100 other troops from <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> were assisting Trinidadian troops.
   A state of emergency remained in effect with a curfew in
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> from <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> to <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> Soldiers and police were still
combing the city for any explosives that could have been left
behind in the coup attempt.

<HEAD>Prime Minister of Trinidad Blames U.S. on Arms Purchase Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities failed to tell his government
of arms purchases in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> by Moslem coup-plotters.
   ``If we had the information possessed by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities in
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, this coup would have been avoided,'' Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur
N.R. Robinson</PERSON> told a news conference.
   Later, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> official, requesting anonymity,
said, ``We did not withhold information which would have enabled
Prime Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> to prevent the coup d'etat.''
   On <DATE>July 27</DATE>, Moslem militants stormed <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the
government-run TV station and took the prime minister and more than
50 others hostage.
   The ensuing six-day siege and accompanying looting left 24
people dead and 500 wounded. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> is a <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island nation
of 1.2 million people off northeast <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. The fighting caused
an estimated <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> damage to the main shopping district in
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   In answer to a question, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said his government has
evidence the rebels had ties to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   ``In fact, the leader of the terrorist organization has
confessed openly about his visits and relations with <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.''
   He declined to say, however, whether the coup was backed by
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, saying the case was in the courts.
   Rebel leader <PERSON>Yasin Abu Bakr</PERSON>, a former policeman who converted to
Islam, and 113 followers were jailed to face charges of treason and
murder after the coup was suppressed. Saying it fearing that <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s
supporters might be plotting another attack, the government
extended a state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation
gives security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, who was shot in the leg by the rebels, said in a
speech to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> that the coup was
launched by ``a new breed of fanatics claiming divine inspiration,
but acting rather under satanic impulse.''
   Robinson walked with a cane as he went to the podium at <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>
headquarters.
   After his speech, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> told reporters that he would raise
the issue of exchanging information about security when he meets
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``We must find out why there was not a proper transfer of
information,'' he said. ``We want to ensure that in the future,
more effective arrangements are made about information exchange.''
   He said it was common knowledge that some of those later
involved in the coup were buying weapons in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> with large
amounts of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency and shipping the arms to the island
nation, a former British colony.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> knew about the arms purchases, he
said.
   ``Oh, yes,'' he said, ``there was much more information that
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities had'' which was not passed along to his
government.
   Federal agents from the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Alcohol</ORGANIZATION>, Tobacco and Firearms
arrested an Moslem, <PERSON>Louis Haneef</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pompano Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, on charges
of supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other equipment to the
coup leaders.
   But <PERSON>Jack Killorin</PERSON>, a spokesman for the bureau in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
said its agents were not aware of any contact between the man
buying the guns and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> until after the coup attempt.
   ``Had it been known that the firearms were going to go to
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> authorities would have been notified,''
<PERSON>Killorin</PERSON> said. ``It simply was not known until <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> authorities
captured the arms and we matched them to the arms shipment in
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.''
   ``We couldn't agree more with the prime minister that
governments should set up avenues of communication to crack down on
this gun running,'' he added.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Black Moslem rebel <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, long
at odds with authorities, says their decision to spend <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> on
a memorial to a dead woman leader was the ``straw that broke the
camel's back.''
   Shortly after his followers seized Parliament house <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>
commandeered the government television station and announced he had
overthrown Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON> and was holding him
hostage with his Cabinet.
   Speaking to the country on television, he accused <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s
4-year-old government of mismanagement and corruption. He singled
out <ORGANIZATION>Robinson</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement on <DATE>June 23</DATE> that a monument would be
built in honor of <PERSON>Jean Miles</PERSON>, a senior public servant who died more
than a decade ago.
   ``That was the straw that broke the camel's back: the allocation
of <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> to create a concrete statue to this woman, while poor
people all over the country are starving,'' he said.
   Bakr, a broad-shouldered, 6-foot-2-inch, charismatic leader, has
long considered himself a spokesman for the poor.
   A former mounted policeman who converted to Islam while studying
in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> founded and has been the leader
for six years of the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> commune. It is on eight
acres of former swamp land on the western edge of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>,
the capital.
   The rebel leader, in his late-40s, is married and has a son and
daughter believed to be attending the <ORGANIZATION>University of Toronto</ORGANIZATION>. His
wife, <PERSON>Annisa</PERSON>, is an executive for the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago
Industrial Development Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   Another major source of friction with authorities is the city
council's contention that <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> built his commune without a clear
title to the land.
   In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, the late Prime Minister <PERSON>Eric Williams</PERSON>
donated the land to East Indian Moslems to build whatever they
wanted. But they never picked up the offer.
   Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> returned from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> and grabbed the land,
saying his black Moslems had a right to it.
   He built a mosque in the center and living quarters for his 250
to 300 followers. Four major buildings include a kitchen for the
poor and a large school.
   The dispute came to a head in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> when <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> was jailed for
several weeks for contempt of court when he failed to answer
charges of illegal occupation brought by the council.
   Over the years, the commune has been raided by police looking
for arms and ammunition. They found a few rifles and small amounts
of ammunition.
   Three months ago, police and defense force soldiers seized a
portion of the commune where <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> was constructing a new building.
Bakr sought a court order to remove the troops.
   A week ago, <ORGANIZATION>High Court Judge Ivol Blackman</ORGANIZATION> ruled against Bakr.
   Another irritant was the government's recent refusal to
distribute free medical supplies and pharmaceuticals Bakr wanted to
donate to people of the island.
   He said he had received the supplies from a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> agency.
However, it was widely believed in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> that they came from
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   Bakr is thought to receive financial support from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and has
visited that North African country several times.
   He has also been highly critical of the government's record on
fighting drugs and even formed a paramilitary squad to raid drug
dealers. This earned him the enmity of the police.
   Moslems in mostly Hindu and <ORGANIZATION>Christian Trinidad</ORGANIZATION> make up <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT>
of the population of 1.3 million people.
   There are only a small number of black Moslems outside <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s
group. Most are East Indians, who consider the blacks as
opportunists guided by politics more than the <LOCATION>Koran</LOCATION>.
   A Moslem leader in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> who knew <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> when he converted to
Islam, said he was ``committed to social justice.''
   Hardon Salamat, head of the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Region Islamic
Congregation</ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that he thinks <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s action
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.''
   Salamat said <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s group receives financing from Moslems around
the world, including those in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Moslem Militants Appear in Court Amid Tight Security</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) - A magistrate ordered a delay
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the start of a hearing for <ORGANIZATION>Yasin Abu Bakr</ORGANIZATION> and 112 other
Moslem militants who captured the prime minister during a coup
attempt.
   Chief Magistrate <PERSON>Melville Baird</PERSON> granted a prosecution request
for an adjournment to allow more time to prepare its case. The
magistrate set <DATE>Sept. 25</DATE> as the new date for the preliminary
hearing.
   Bakr, 48, a former policeman, and the members of his <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat
al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> (Society of Moslems) face the death penalty for
charges that include murder and treason.
   About two dozen female <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> supporters shouted ``Allah
akbar!'' (God is great) as <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and 18 other prisoners filed into
the courtroom, where they were kept in a specially built iron cage
for the 45-minute proceedings.
   For security reasons, the remaining prisoners are to appear
later in four separate groups.
   Heavily armed soldiers in camouflage uniforms ringed the
converted gym in the western town of <LOCATION>Chaguaramas</LOCATION>, 10 miles outside
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, for the Moslems' first court appearance since the
six-day coup attempt ended <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE>.
   Wearing a white tunic and black fez, the Moslem leader bowed to
reporters and said: ``Morning to the press. Morning everybody.''
   Spectators were searched and scanned with metal detectors before
entering the courtroom. An armored tank was positioned outside.
   Prosecutor <PERSON>Theodore Guerra</PERSON> said the newly appointed head of the
prosecution team, <PERSON>Karl Hudson-Phillips</PERSON>, needed more time to prepare
his case. Defense attorney <PERSON>Nathaniel King</PERSON> had no objection.
   Bakr and his followers captured the Parliament and state-run
television station and seized Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON>
and more than 50 others, including several Cabinet members.
   The attack and subsequent looting left 24 dead. <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 63,
was shot in the left leg. Bakr and his men are charged in
connection with eight deaths.
   Bakr had blamed <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s administration for widespread poverty
in this once oil-wealthy <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation off <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and its sister island of <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> remain under a state of
emergency, giving police wide powers of search and arrest, and a
nighttime curfew.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R.
Robinson</PERSON> was freed by his Moslem captors <DATE>today</DATE> but other officials
held hostage were not released, the government announced.
   Attorney General <PERSON>Anthony Smart</PERSON> gave no details of how and under
what conditions the prime minister, who had been shot in both feet
during the uprising, was freed. But the release of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> alone
indicated the 5-day-old standoff between the government and Moslem
extremists was not over.
   ``We continue to pray for the safe return of the rest of the
hostages,'' Smart told state radio.
   He said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was the only one of the 41 hostages released.
   Smart said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, who was freed at <TIME>1:20 p.m. EDT</TIME>, ``is in
good spirits.''
   The siege began <DATE>Friday</DATE> when radical Moslems led by <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>
stormed <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the government-run television station in
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s capital city. Bakr has accused the government of
mismanagement.
   The release came after a day of conflicting reports over the
progress of negotiations to end the hostage siege, which has
plunged this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation of 1.3 million residents off
northeast <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> into chaos.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> had said by telephone that he had
accepted an agreement under which he would resign and <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and his
men would be granted amnesty.
   But government officials said <DATE>today</DATE> that no such agreement
existed and that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> had made the statement under duress.
   <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said <DATE>earlier today</DATE> that the rebels agreed that <PERSON>Winston
Dookeran</PERSON>, the deputy prime minister, would replace <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> when he
steps down. Dookeran was released from the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building
<DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The interim government would be a coalition consisting of
representatives of all major political parties, along with <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> group.
   The group, which is believed to number 250 to 300, has blamed
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> for widespread poverty in this once-oil rich <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
nation near <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. It has little support among the populace.
   Bakr is a former policeman who converted to Islam in <DATE>1980</DATE> and
has long considered himself a champion of the downtrodden. He
founde <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, which means the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION> in Arabic,
in <DATE>1984</DATE>.
   Robinson easily won parliamentary elections in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, security forces exchanged gunfire with the rebels at
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and at the government television station. Three
buildings in and around the TV complex were set ablaze but no
injuries were reported.
   At least nine people _ six rebels, two police officers and a
civilian _ have been killed since the siege began, and the
instability has spawned massive looting in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a
two-island nation of 1.3 million people. State radio said some
looters were shot <DATE>Monday</DATE> but gave no details.
   Bakr has ties to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and it is believed he has received
funding from that country. In a conversation with local radio
today, he said he had no regrets over what he had done.
   ``I hope we can settle it in love,'' he said.
   Asked if the siege could end in violence, he said, ``Everyone
will die at some time in their lives.''

today around the government television station and <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>,
where Moslem extremists held the prime minister and 30 other people
hostage for a fourth day.
   Later today, an Anglican minister negotiating between the
government and the rebels said a settlement was likely.
   The heaviest shooting was centered on the television station,
whose employees were taken hostage <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Automatic rifle and
machine-gun fire was punctuated by what sounded like artillery
booms.
   One witness said he heard four explosions that sounded like
bombs.
   ``A major firefight is going on,'' said a diplomatic source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The shooting at the station appeared to be coming from two
directions, but it was not clear whether security forces had tried
to storm the building.
   Earlier, automatic weapons fire rang out near <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>, about
a mile from the television station, where rebels seized Prime
Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Witnesses said they heard
what sounded like heavy artillery booms.
   A ham radio operator in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> said he monitored a radio
communication indicating security forces had stormed the television
station and were moving on <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   But Col. <PERSON>Ralph Brown</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Trinidad-Tobago Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> denied
the station was attacked.
   He told reporters that troops had fired on the TV station when
the rebels tried to leave the building. ``Some of his men tried to
come out and we are not letting them out.''
   An Anglican minister who was negotiating between the rebels and
the government, the Rev. <PERSON>Knolly Clarke</PERSON>, also spoke with reporters
early this afternoon.
   When asked if a peaceful solution was likely, he said, ``Yes,
today. The end is in sight.''
   One of the rebels inside <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Kwasi Attiba</PERSON>, said by
telephone that a tentative agreement with the government had been
reached to end the siege.
   Attiba said the accord called for <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> to resign immediately
and be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON>Winston Dookeran</PERSON>. Attiba
gave no indication when <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and other other hostages would be
released, and no government official could be reached to confirm
his report.
   An agreement was also reported <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by a television executive,
<PERSON>Jones Madeira</PERSON>, who was held at the station. He said in a telephone
interview that under the plan, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> would turn over power to an
interim government, which would rule until elections in three
months.
   Robinson won the <DATE>1986</DATE> parliamentary elections by a landslide,
and the next elections are not scheduled until <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   The rebels claim <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s government is corrupt and
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich country.
They claimed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to have wired <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> with explosives and
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made.
   Attiba said the gunfire at <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> came from police ``who
have been attempting to thwart'' negotiations.
   Attiba said the rebels were holding eight government ministers
along with the prime minister.
   Energy Minister <PERSON>Herbert Atwell</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> the two sides were
far from a settlement. But <PERSON>Attiba</PERSON> said: ``We are very hopeful for
an amicable solution.''
   Security forces patrolled the capital with orders to shoot
looters on sight.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, leader of a black Moslem commune, stormed Parliament
on <DATE>Friday</DATE> and captured <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and most of his Cabinet. Bakr is
believed backed by <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> but has little general support.
   Simultaneously, the rebels seized the government television
station and its employees.
   Unconfirmed reports said more than 20 people had been killed in
the fighting. A medical officer at the state hospital said <DATE>today</DATE> he
could confirm only five deaths, including that of a police officer.
   Fires burned in the capital of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. There
was scattered gunfire and widespread looting. Convoys of cars and
pickup trucks were loading up with everything from looted powdered
milk to refrigerators, electric stoves and television sets.
   The government sent police and military patrols to re-establish
order and continued a nationwide curfew that was imposed <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Atwell, representing the government, appeared on national
television late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with an official statement saying: ``I am in
no position to offer any hope that the situation will be resolved
speedily and-or amicably.''
   He confirmed reports that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and Justice Minister <PERSON>Selwyn
Richardson</PERSON> had each been shot in the leg.
   State-run radio 610 said <PERSON>Nolli Clarke</PERSON>, an Anglican priest, was
the official mediator with help from Anglican Bishop <PERSON>Clive Abdullah</PERSON>
and Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON>Anthony Patin</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> sent mobile units to take blood donations from
people too frightened to leave their homes.
   Radio 610 estimated damage downtown at <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> as thousands
of people looted stores, shopping centers, warehouses and
industrial plants.
   A spokeswoman for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that American
citizens and tourists on <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> did not appear to be
in danger.
   ``Obviously we support the government and are coordinating
closely with them until the situation is resolved,'' a <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> official said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The official did not want
to be identified.
   Bakr is a former policeman in his mid-40s who converted to Islam
in <DATE>1980</DATE> while living in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   He founded <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, which means the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION> in
Arabic, in <DATE>1984</DATE> and set up a commune on land he said had been
donated to Moslems by the late prime minister, <PERSON>Eric Williams</PERSON>.
   Bakr built a mosque, a school and a kitchen to feed the
homeless. Some 250 to 300 Moslems live there.
   Bakr has visited <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> several times and is believed to have
received assistance from that country.
   He has said the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and the
destruction'' of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, which has high unemployment
and skyrocketing food prices.

   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> expressed ``strong
support'' <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s prime minister, a captive of
black Moslem rebels who took over the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island's parliament.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was spending the weekend relaxing at his
oceanfront <DATE>summer</DATE> home here, but he and national security adviser
<PERSON>Brent Scowcroft</PERSON> were kept abreast of the attempted coup, a
spokeswoman said.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who spent the morning on the tennis courts and boating,
attended the wedding of a second cousin in <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>.
   Deputy press secretary <PERSON>Alixe Glen</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Scowcroft were
``following the situation carefully'' in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a
former British colony off the coast of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> that gained
independence in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``We maintain our strong support for the Democratic government
of Prime Minister (<PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>) <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Ms. Glen</PERSON> said.
   ``It appears that no American citizens are in any danger. The
situation seems limited to one building,'' she said.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> have not yet asked for help, but the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> would consider the request if they do, she said.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and several members of his cabinet were being held
hostage in the parliament in <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> by rebels led by former
policeman <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, leader of a Moslem sect that said it recognizes
no government but ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   Later, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> issued this written statement:
   ``We condemn yesterday's attempt by a violent extremist group to
overthrow the democratic government of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. We call
upon the parties in this attempted coup to release the hostages
under their control and to surrender to the legislative
constitutional authority of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. This violent
attack on the government has no support from the people of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> who have enjoyed a long tradition of democratic
government. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> fully supports the elected government
and is consulting closely with it and other interested governments
in the region.''
   An administration official who accompanied <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> said
the army was still loyal to the prime minister and his
four-year-old government.
   On another international hotspot, <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Glen</PERSON> said, ``The
situation has not changed. We're following it closely.''
   The beleaguered government of President <PERSON>Samuel Doe</PERSON> has been
under siege for weeks in that West African nation. Rebel leader
<PERSON>Charles Taylor</PERSON> claimed <DATE>Friday</DATE> to have established his own
government, even though street fighting continued.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, getting a weekend respite from the drawn out negotiations
with Democrats over the budget deficit, brought his wife, <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>,
daughter, <PERSON>Dorothy LeBlond</PERSON>, and several grandchildren with him
<DATE>Friday</DATE> on the flight from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Pease Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Newington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>
   He also gave his taciturn <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> nominee, <PERSON>David H.
Souter</PERSON>, a ride home to <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. Before heading off to visit
his mother at a <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION> nursing home, <PERSON>Souter</PERSON> said it felt ``damn
good'' to be back in the <ORGANIZATION>Granite State</ORGANIZATION>.
   This was the Bushes' third visit to their vacation home since
Memorial Day.
   President and <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> attended the wedding of a second cousin,
<PERSON>Ruben Andrus Holden</PERSON> V, 37, of <LOCATION>Marshfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, to <PERSON>Pamela Anne
Grindle</PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, at <ORGANIZATION>St. Ann</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>.
   The stone church, which overlooks the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, is where the
Bushes attend <DATE>Sunday</DATE> services. Guests were required to walk through
a portable metal detector.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> will stay behind when the president heads back to the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. The president will return here to
<PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s Point on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> and stay until Labor Day.

<HEAD>Trinidad Still Feeling Aftershocks of Six-Day Hostage Siege</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP Extra</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) - ``Sorry for inconvenience caused
by the criminal acts of frenzied looters,'' reads the sign in the
window of the closed <ORGANIZATION>Hometown Pharmacy</ORGANIZATION>. ``We'll be back as soon as
possible.''
   The suburban drug store was among scores of businesses plundered
after Moslem militants stormed <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the government-run TV
station on <DATE>July 27</DATE> and took the prime minister and more than 50
others hostage.
   Nearly <DATE>two months later</DATE>, Trinidadians are still feeling
aftershocks of the six-day siege and accompanying looting that left
24 people dead and 500 wounded on this tiny nation of 1.2 million
inhabitants off the coast of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.
   The fighting delvered a shock to the ailing Trinidadian
economy, causing an estimated <MONEY>$60 million</MONEY> damage to the devastated
main shopping district of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. Tourism, not surprisingly,
was also hurt.
   But there is a touch of irony in the fact that only hours after
rebel <PERSON>Yasin Abu Bakr</PERSON> and his followers surrendered <DATE>Aug. 1</DATE>, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>
invaded <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, sending oil prices skyrocketing. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> produces
just under <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the world's oil.
   The worst long-term damage may be to the nation's sense of
itself as a land of British-style democracy, multiracial harmony,
oil wealth, cricket and calypso.
   For Harmony Pharmacy owner <PERSON>Jeffrey Marchack</PERSON>, who lost his entire
inventory of <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> worth of drugs and merchandise, the episode
has meant a decision to install an iron grille in the front window
and a cashier's cage.
   Such security measures didn't seem necessary before, he said
nostalgically, because ``we were always known to be happy-go-lucky,
peace-loving people.''
   ``The myth of exceptionalism has been blown apart,'' said <PERSON>Selwyn
Ryan</PERSON>, a sociologist and political pollster at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of the
<LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>. ``The myth that we're a nonviolent society is just
that - a myth.''
   Industry Minister <PERSON>Bhoe Tewarie</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat
al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> (Society of Moslems) were a ``group of extremists''
with no popular support. ``And I think <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> proved
to the world that it is a very stable democracy that was threatened
but never shaken by the events of <DATE>July 27</DATE>.''
   But fearing that supporters of <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and 113 other jailed rebels
might be plotting another attack, the government has extended a
state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation gives
security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   By day, the capital of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> once again teems with
shoppers, street vendors and clogged traffic. Residents are growing
tired of being restricted to their homes at night under a 9
<TIME>p.m.-to-5 a.m.</TIME> curfew.
   ``We cannot expect that their sense of humor, which as been
bearing up quite nicely until now, can be maintained for undefined
periods,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Trinidad Guardian</ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial urging an end
to the curfew.
   Police, usually armed only with billy clubs in this former
British colony, now patrol with automatic rifles. Soldiers wearing
berets and camouflage jungle fatigues guard the bullet-scarred
Parliament building and television station.
   The capital's major hotels are open, but with mostly empty
rooms.
   Bulldozers and dump trucks remove tons of rubble from the main
shopping district, where fires destroyed almost every building in a
two-square-block area.
   The government is offering business loans and planning to
redesign the district, which had become badly rundown.
   But rebuilding could take months, if not years.
   Industry Minister <PERSON>Tewarie</PERSON> insists the coup attempt would not
have any lasting affect the economy. Tourism was hurt in the short
term, he said, but the industry accounts for a tiny proportion of
the nation's wealth.
   Despite the boom in oil prices, <PERSON>Tewarie</PERSON> said, the government has
no plans to significantly increase production because it is wary of
increasing its dependence on oil income.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> has been gripped by recession since oil prices
collapsed in <DATE>1983</DATE>. Bakr, 48, a former policeman who converted to
Islam and drew followers mainly among poor urban blacks, blamed
Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> for the widespread poverty that
resulted.
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 64, was shot in the left leg after the takeover of
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. He has returned to work and now walks with a cane.
   The prime minister, who had introduced wage freezes, spending
cuts and layoffs to revitalize the economy, had become highly
unpopular before the coup attempt. He remains in danger of losing
the next election, due next year.
   Bakr and his men face a string of charges, including murder and
treason, which carry the death penalty. A preliminary hearing was
to begin today in a converted gym.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> has charged an American Moslem, <PERSON>Louis Haneef</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pompano
Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, with supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other
equipment to the coup leaders.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R.
Robinson</PERSON> and the chief negotiator for Moslem extremists said <DATE>Monday</DATE>
they have reached agreement to end a 4-day-old hostage siege.
   Robinson is one of 41 hostages reported held since <DATE>Friday</DATE> by
black Moslem extremists led by <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>.
   Justice and <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON>,
speakig from inside <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> where the uprising began, said the
agreement called for <ORGANIZATION>Robinson</ORGANIZATION>'s immediate resignation with
elections to be held within 90 days.
   <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> said the government had granted amnesty to the Moslem
radicals involved in the insurgency, which has left at least nine
people dead, according to officials.
   Speaking by telephone from inside <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. <PERSON>Joe Theodore</PERSON>, head of
the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator <PERSON>Bilal Abdullah</PERSON>, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> has just said.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON> reported earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
the Moslems were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and
grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since <DATE>Friday</DATE>. He said Anglican
negotiator <PERSON>Knolly Clarke</PERSON> told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> is just off northeast <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, and is a former
British colony that gained independence in <DATE>1962</DATE>. It has been
wracked in recent years by declining oil revenues and economic
doldrums, including high unemployment.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON>
offered <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to resign and call early elections if black Moslem
rebels free him and about 30 other hostages and end their coup
attempt, an official said.
   At least 27 people have reportedly been killed in the violence.
However, there was no official toll.
   Robinson apparently made his offer as he and other government
officials remained wired to explosives and threatened with death.
They were taken captive <DATE>Friday</DATE> when several hundred rebels with
automatic weapons seized control of broadcast buildings and the
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   Government radio said the rebels were optimistic about reaching
a settlement with <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> but that they also wanted immunity from
prosecution.
   However, Energy Minister <PERSON>Herbert Atwell</PERSON> appeared on national
television late <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with an official statement offering no hope
for a quick settlement.
   ``I am in no position to offer any hope that the situation will
be resolved speedily and-or amicably,'' <PERSON>Atwell</PERSON> said. ``The
situation in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> remains a touch-and-go one with relation to
the hostages and their captors,'' he added.
   Acting Police Commissioner <PERSON>Leonard Taylor</PERSON> announced during the
same broadcast that joint police and military patrols had been
dispatched to control widespread looting along the 25-mile-long
corridor from the capital to its international airport and outlying
communities.
   A journalist who was inside the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building when it was
stormed said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> the rebels shot <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> in the leg and also
shot in the leg the minister of justice, <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON>. The two
were being treated by Minister of Health <PERSON>Emmanuel Husin</PERSON>, a medical
doctor who was in the building.
   The journalist, released by the rebels <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   State-run Radio 610 said <PERSON>Nolli Clarke</PERSON>, an Anglican priest, was
assisting in the negotiations at the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of
government troops were patrolling around the building.
   Coup leader <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, a former policeman in his mid-40s, claims
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s government is corrupt and undemocratic. He said on
television <DATE>Friday</DATE> that the coup was intended to stop ``poverty and
the destruction'' of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation with
high unemployment and skyrocketing food prices.
   As negotiations continued <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> area was
beset by fires, scattered shooting and widespread looting in some
areas.
   Hundreds of looters ransacked stores and factories in several
eastern suburbs, making off with food, refrigerators, videocassette
recorders and television sets. Some loaded their cars with stolen
goods and drove off.
   Looters also hit the five-square-block downtown shopping
district, where damage and losses were estimated at <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>,
Radio 610 reported. It did not say how the figure was calculated.
   Anglican Bishop <PERSON>Clive Abdullah</PERSON> broadcast an appeal for the
looting to stop.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter
places to take foodstuffs. I can perhaps ask God's forgiveness for
this,'' he said. ``But when you line up a convoy of vehicles to
take away items like refrigerators, television sets and videos,
that is not right.''
   A spokeswoman for President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that he was ``following the situation
carefully'' and that American citizens and tourists on <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> did not appear to be in danger.
   A government curfew, imposed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by a state of emergency
that mobilized the country's 5,000-member army and 1,500-member
police force, was extended <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to 18 hours, from <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> to noon.
   Some of the 11 Americans staying at the harbor-side <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Inn</ORGANIZATION>
three blocks from the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building said they were more bored
as a result of the curfew restrictions than afraid of the violence.
   ``Unfortunately, I came at the wrong time. There's nothing to
do. The hotel is nice, but I didn't come here to sit inside a hotel
doing nothing,'' said <PERSON>Rhonda Isaacs</PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> now living
in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Isaacs</PERSON> said her two children, 11 and 13, have been spending
their time swimming in the hotel pool or watching television. The
family had intended to return home from a three-week vacation on
<DATE>Aug. 9</DATE>, but now wanted to leave as soon as possible, she said.
   Radio 610 said ``scores'' of people had been injured in fighting
associated with the coup. The Red Cross urgently appealed for blood
donations to treat the wounded, but most residents were too afraid
to leave their homes.
   An administrator at the <ORGANIZATION>Port-au-Spain General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> said at
least five people wounded during the overthrow attempt died <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean News Agency</ORGANIZATION>, quoting police and hospital sources,
said on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that at least 22 people have died in fighting
since the coup attempt began, but exactly where the fighting
occurred remained unclear.
   The offer <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> reportedly made to the rebels was described
by <PERSON>Jones Madeira</PERSON>, director of the government television station and
himself a hostage.
   <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> said in a telephone interview from a television station
seized by the rebels that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> agreed to turn over power to an
interim government that would rule until elections are held in
three months.
   Robinson won the <DATE>1986</DATE> parliamentary elections by a landslide and
the next elections were not scheduled until <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   ``My information is that Prime Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> has agreed to
step down and that an interim government of major political parties
will run the country until elections are held in 90 days,'' he said.
   The rebels were holding <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> with several Cabinet ministers
in the <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> said he and 30 other employees were being
held at the television station, which is several miles north of the
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said 10 other people were inside of <ORGANIZATION>Radio Trinidad</ORGANIZATION> in a
building near the TV station, but it was unclear if they were being
held captive, as reported earlier, or whether they were staying
inside because of snipers.
   Bakr heads a group of about 250 black Moslems called <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat
al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION>, which means the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION> in Arabic.
   Bakr lives in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for several years in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, where
he took up Islam and worked for a while with the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian
Broadcasting Corp</ORGANIZATION>. He returned to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE>, said <PERSON>Haroon
Salamat</PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Region Islamic Congregation</ORGANIZATION>.
   Bakr's group had formed its own paramilitary squad to raid known
drug dealers, <PERSON>Salamat</PERSON> said.
   Salamat told the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> Star that he thinks the coup attempt
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.
   ``All of this _ drugs and social justice _ has concerned him
because he saw the government just ignore the problems. He must
have thought that drastic action was necessary.''
   Moslems, most of them <LOCATION>East Indians</LOCATION>, make up about <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of
the population of 1.3 million people of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation off
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.
   The general population is mainly Hindu and Christian and is
about <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> East Indian and <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of African descent.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a former British colony, suffered serious
economic decline in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> as the world price for oil, the main
export, plummeted.
   Unemployment is estimated at around <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> and food prices

prime minister and the hostages at the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building ``are
wired up with explosives.'' <PERSON>Pantin</PERSON> said the rebels threatened to
blow up the captives if government troops move on the building.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook people
awake on the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> <DATE>early today</DATE> but police
said they had no reports of injuries or damage.
   The quake, the strongest in the area in 78 years, measured 6.9
on the Richter scale and struck at <TIME>2:17 a.m.</TIME> about 50 miles
southeast of the capital of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Earthquake Information Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>.
   ``No damage, no injuries. We just got a little shake and that's
all,'' said Lt. Velfukr Muhammed at police headquarters in the
capital of 55,800 people.
   ``I was in bed at the time and that woke me and everyone else in
the house,'' said <PERSON>Lionel Dixon</PERSON>, news editor of <ORGANIZATION>Radio Trinidad</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   A security guard at the station, <LOCATION>San Keralli</LOCATION>, said the building
shook for about 40 seconds. <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> said some people ran into the
street in the suburb where he lives.
   <PERSON>Frank Baldwin</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> physical science technician in <LOCATION>Golden</LOCATION>,
said the epicenter appeared to have been in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> about 420
miles east of <LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, in a seismic area lying on the
boundary between the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and the South American crustal
plates of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The quake was the area's largest since a magnitude 7.2 temblor
on <DATE>Jan. 23, 1910</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> is an island in the republic of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a
member of the <ORGANIZATION>British Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>. About 1.2 million people live
in the oil-producing republic, which covers an area about the size
of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> and is one of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>'s most prosperous countries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Soldiers removed seven more
bodies <DATE>Friday</DATE> from a bombed police station, the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and a TV
building, raising to at least 38 the death toll from a failed coup
attempt and subsequent looting.
   Moslem extremists held hostages for six days before surrendering
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON> said seven additional bodies
were recovered by noon from wrecked buildings.
   Authorities also said that a fire of undetermined origin
destroyed a storage area and an apartment <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at the
<ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> commune's compound on the outskirts of
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, the capital of this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, the commune's leader, and 112 of his followers were
being held at army headquarters after giving up on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and
releasing their remaining 46 hostages. Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R.
Robinson</PERSON> and several of his Cabinet ministers were among the total
of 55 hostages held by the rebels.
   Government spokesman <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> has said the militants could
face a variety of charges, including murder, kidnapping and
treason, which carries the death penalty.
   <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jazeni Omowale</PERSON>, a 21-year-old student from <ORGANIZATION>Howard
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, had been killed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a
gunfight involving police and soldiers in the capital's Champs
Fleurs suburb. He was believed to be Bakr's stepson. The
circumstances of the gunfight were unknown.
   For the first time since the siege began on <DATE>July 27</DATE>, soldiers
entered the Parliament building.
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said the bodies of three civilians and one rebel were
removed from the building, along with homemade grenades and about
40 handguns.
   He said two other bodies were pulled from the rubble of the
police station. The building was demolished by a car bomb and fire
during the siege.
   A seventh body, that of a rebel, was discovered at the
government's television station, where 29 employees were held
captive. Police sealed off the television station to search for any
explosives left by rebels.
   <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> said earlier at least 30 people were killed in the initial
assault by <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and his men and in subsequent looting. The
discovery of the bodies <DATE>Friday</DATE> and the killing of the American
student brought the total to 38.
   <PERSON>Lennox Williams</PERSON>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION>Port-of-Spain General
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, said autopsies found at least 14 people died of gunshot
wounds. He said most were killed by security forces during looting.
   A state of emergency remained in effect <DATE>Friday</DATE> and soldiers and
police patrolled the capital. An 18-hour curfew was reduced to 10
a.m. to <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>, however, and <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> said banks would open <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to
help residents resume normal business as soon as possible.
   A 150-member regional force was dispatched to this island nation
of more than 1.2 million to guard installations and relieve the
local forces for patrols.
   Food and medical supplies were being flown in from the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.

  [Text] A Trinidadian drug cartel involving hundreds of 
<MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> worth of cocaine in monthly shipments 
between <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> 
has been broken in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> with the arrest of its leader on a 
beach in the mainland republic. 
  <PERSON>George Simeon</PERSON>, leader of a cartel called "Los Trinitarios" 
(The Trinidadians), was captured on the beach in <LOCATION>Sucre State</LOCATION> as 
he received samples of what General <PERSON>Julio C. Pena Sanchez</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Venezuelan Guardia Nacional</ORGANIZATION> described as a future shipment of 
high quality cocaine. 
  The cartel was said to have been shipping between 500 and 
1,000 kilos of cocaine, worth between TT$175 and <MONEY>TT$350 million</MONEY>, 
monthly from <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> through <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> to points 
in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION>. 
  The arrest of the group was the leading item in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>'s 
largest-selling newspaper, <ORGANIZATION>EL NACIONAL</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE>. Simeon, a 
Trindadian, was arrested along with other members of the cartel 
who were held simultaneously in other parts of the country in a 
massive <ORGANIZATION>Guardia Nacional</ORGANIZATION> exercise which also resulted in the 
seizure of six vehicles. 
  General <PERSON>Pena Sanchez</PERSON>, Operations Commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Guardia 
Nacional</ORGANIZATION>, announced the arrests <DATE>last Tuesday</DATE>, following the 
events which occurred on <DATE>Saturday, November 6</DATE>. 
  He said the arrests had been the result of seven months of 
investigations and surveillance by the joint armed forces aimed 
at breaking the cartel, which was based in <LOCATION>Maracaibo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Zulia</LOCATION> 
state and had a network which spread across several states in 
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. 
  A total of 165 officers of the <ORGANIZATION>Guardia Nacional</ORGANIZATION> took part in 
the raid which captured <PERSON>Simeon</PERSON> and a Venezuelan national on the 
<LOCATION>Sucre</LOCATION> beach. Other members of the drug network were captured in 
<LOCATION>Maracaibo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zulia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Acarigua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portuguesa</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rio Caribe</ORGANIZATION>. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Guardia Nacional</ORGANIZATION> has traced the drug route from <LOCATION>Cali</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cucuta</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>; to <LOCATION>Urena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tachira</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Acarigua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Carupano</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sucre</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rio 
Caribe</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, and then to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. 
  Since then, in an apparently unrelated case, another 
Trinidadian, <PERSON>Wharfe Ashton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alton</PERSON>, has been arrested on drug 
trafficking charges after the intelligence arm of the police 
service monitored a drug shipment bound for <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>. Alton was 
shot in the leg as he tried to escape. 
  The big Venezuelan drug bust is the second major report in a 
week involving the discovery of multi-million drug operations in 
which Trinidadians were implicated. 
  <ORGANIZATION>Grenada Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> intercepted an inter-island vessel on 
<DATE>November 5</DATE>, the same day of the Venezuelan operations, and 
found 60 kilos of cocaine hidden in a cargo of furniture. The 
boat had left Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> the afternoon before. An Arima man, 
<PERSON>Sylvon Liverpool</PERSON>, was arrested together with five others.

Muslim rebels still held the prime minister of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> and at least 
38 other hostages <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as negotiations to end the twin-island nation's crisis 
stalled amid reports of widespread looting and an <TIME>early morning</TIME> gun battle at 
one of the hostage sites. 
</P>
<P>
News agencies, quoting an executive of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s state-owned television 
station, said that Prime Minister <PERSON>A. N. R. Robinson</PERSON> had offered to resign and 
call early elections in return for the hostages' freedom. But there was no 
confirmation of that report from other government sources. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Muslim group attempting the coup said that a final 
agreement on amnesty for the armed rebels was close. But a government source 
quoted by the <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean News Agency</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION>) in <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> said that the 
negotiations were snagged over legal terms and by reservations being voiced by 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s police and armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
No further mention was made <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of reports that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and other hostages 
had been wired to explosive devices and threatened with death in the event of 
any armed rescue attempt. <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and 11 Cabinet ministers and members of 
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> are captives inside <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building in 
downtown Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, the capital. Between 26 and 28 other captives are being 
held in two buildings of the state-run <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Television and Radio</ORGANIZATION> 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
A gun battle between the police and members of the armed <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> al Muslimeen 
rebel group broke out early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the television station, <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION> reported. It 
quoted the station's news director, <PERSON>Jones P. Madeira</PERSON>, himself a hostage, as 
saying that two of the Muslims were wounded. A shortwave radio broadcast, 
purportedly made by <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, appealed for a cease-fire, <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also quoted extensively from an interview with <PERSON>Yasin abu Bakr</PERSON>, 
leader of <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> al Muslimeen, Arabic for "Group of Muslims," in which he 
denied "malicious propaganda" that his movement was supported by <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s 
radical leader, Col. <PERSON>Moammar Kadafi</PERSON>, and that the rebels had asked to be flown 
to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> for?" the <ORGANIZATION>CANA</ORGANIZATION> interview quoted <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> as asking. 
"We are all Trinidadians, that is why we are here, that is why we are fighting 
in any case, because it is our country. There is nothing to do with <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone to <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION> from the television station, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> said that 
the armed uprising was launched because "something had to shock us into 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The offer that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> reportedly made to step down and call early elections 
was described by TV news director <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION>, according to an <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"My information is that Prime Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> has agreed to step down and 
that an interim government of major political parties will run the country 
until elections are held in 90 days," <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the parliamentary elections by a landslide in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and the next 
elections are not scheduled until <DATE>1991</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s group of 200 to 250 followers and their families, organized about 
<DATE>six years ago</DATE>, has long been viewed with suspicion by the government as violent 
outlaws. Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>, a former police officer in his mid-40s, has in turn accused 
the government of corruption, squandering state money and failing to focus on 
hunger and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, who was shot in the leg when he refused to sign a 
document that some reports described as a letter of resignation, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> told 
<LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION>, "All is well at the <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>," the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building where the prime 
minister and other officials are held captive. "There has been a great spirit 
of compromise between our members and <PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON> and some of the members of 
Parliament," <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> was quoted as saying. "Hopefully the country will be back 
on its feet in a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
Two other political leaders, <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Leo Des Vignes</PERSON> also were shot in the legs, according to a 
news report from <LOCATION>Port of Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, officials said that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Trinidadian officials have 
consulted in the past two days on the possibility of sending <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> 
experts in hostage negotiations to the island. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Sean Walsh</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is "willing 
to entertain any proposal by the government of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, and will 
examine any request carefully." But <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> has made no formal 
requests for assistance and that officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> believe that <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> 
hopes to resolve the crisis itself. 
</P>
<P>
Any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military assistance was considered highly unlikely, officials said, 
both because <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> is not likely to request such help and because <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 
probably would not approve such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ransacking and pillaging of stores and shopping centers in what 
has become the virtual no man's land of downtown Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> continued 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, according to news reports reaching here. Acting Police Commissioner 
<PERSON>Leonard Taylor</PERSON> acknowledged that "our best efforts haven't provided the desired 
results," but he warned of "stronger measures which will certainly be injurious 
to some citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In a radio appeal to end the looting, Anglican Bishop <PERSON>Clive Abdullah</PERSON> said he 
had been told that whole convoys of vehicles were loading up on refrigerators 
and videos. 
</P>
<P>
A Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> businessman was quoted as complaining that too many of the tiny 
island country's 1,500 military troops and 5,000 police were concentrated at 
the hostage sites, leaving the city wide open to the looters. As the crisis 
entered its third day, he estimated losses at more than <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>. At least 
27 people, including police and military personnel, have reportedly been killed 
in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Abdullah, <PERSON>Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin</PERSON> and Anglican 
clergyman <PERSON>Knolly Clarke</PERSON> have been acting as middlemen in the negotiations 
between the Muslim group and the government. In exchange for ending the crisis 
peacefully, the rebels reportedly have asked for a total amnesty, including 
legal pardons from the <LOCATION>Commonwealth</LOCATION> country's president. 
</P>
<P>
"All the principles have been agreed, and the final arrangements for conducting 
the amnesty are being concluded with the assistance of <ORGANIZATION>Archbishop of Port of 
Spain Pantin</ORGANIZATION> and Anglican Bishop Abdullah," said the Muslim group's spokesman, 
<PERSON>Bilal Abdullah</PERSON>, in a telephone interview with <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION> from the TV station. 
</P>
<P>
A strict <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> curfew continued in <LOCATION>Port of Spain</LOCATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION>Piarco 
International Airport</ORGANIZATION>, the country's main link to the outside world, was 
technically reopened during daylight hours <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, international and local 
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> airlines refused to resume service until the crisis is resolved. 
Charter pilots on nearby <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands such as <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> also 
refused to fly to Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.

<FP=106> [Article by Camini Marajh: "Drug Bust Mystery: Why Always </F>
Abroad?"] 
  [Text] Local law enforcers have denied that there is an 
unwritten policy to have arrests and seizures of drugs coming 
from <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> take place outside this country's 
territory. 
  Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with 
clear <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> connections are taking place 
everywhere--in <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>; 
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and on <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION>--but here. 
  Repeated calls to <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Russell Huggins</PERSON> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Office of Strategic Services</ORGANIZATION> (OSS) Chief <PERSON>Lance Selman</PERSON> went 
unreturned up to late <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
  Law enforcement sources said in both shipping 
incidents--involving the methanol tanker <PERSON>Harold La 
Borde</PERSON> and the schooner Let Me Live--local police 
had prior knowledge that there were drugs on board. A combined 
total of 134 kilograms of cocaine were seized from both vessels 
in places outside <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of National Security</ORGANIZATION> has gone a step further 
and 
rushed to take credit for the drug busts, citing collaboration 
between local authorities and their foreign counterparts in an 
official government press release. 
  Despite this, no one could say why, if information was 
available that there were drugs on board the methanol tanker and 
on the inter-island schooner, the bust was not made here by 
local narcotics or <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> officers, instead of allowing the 
<ORGANIZATION>US Drug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> (DEA) and the <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> Coast 
Guard to break those two smuggling operations. 
  In the case of the <ORGANIZATION>Harold La Borde</ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION> gave 
credit to a local informant who was paid "good money" by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 
counter-narcotics agency for supplying information that led to 
the drug bust and the arrest of four Trinidadians. 
  <PERSON>Pierre Sharette</PERSON>, assistant special agent of the <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> 
office with responsibility for the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, told the SUNDAY 
EXPRESS that month that the mystery Trinidadian had no 
connection to law enforcement agencies. 
  Current bids for credit by local officials recall the 
episode 
two years ago when the <ORGANIZATION>Narcotics Bureau</ORGANIZATION> claimed credit for the 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> arrest by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> authorities of <PERSON>Paul Mansoor</PERSON> with five 
kilograms of cocaine. 
  Vexed by the false claim, a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> source later told this 
newspaper that <PERSON>Mansoor</PERSON> was picked up in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> because he was 
acting suspicously, and not as a result of any tip-off from the 
<ORGANIZATION>T&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> police. 
  Sources say that neither of the shipping incidents was a 
"controlled delivery"--the reason, some people believe, for the 
failure of local authorities to act on the information here. 
  In the latest bust, local authorities said, they tipped off 
the <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION>, who in turn alerted the <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> Coast Guard that drugs 
were stashed in hidden compartments in furniture stored on the 
schooner. Why local authorities did not themselves intercept the 
drugs but allowed the ship to leave the <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION> jetty and sail 
clear out of <ORGANIZATION>T&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> waters has not been explained. 
  A top policeman would say only that "we were aware of it 
(drugs on board the schooner)." Pressed further, he said: "The 
information is very sensitive." 
  He claimed that authorities here "are aware of the local 
connection" in both drug runs. He added only that: "We have an 
idea what's going on (in the drug business)." 
  He refused to say why, if the authorities know who the local 
dealers are, there have been no arrests as yet--or rather, the 
arrests that have been made comprise mainly drug mules held on 
outbound flights at <LOCATION>Piarco International Airport</LOCATION> and low-level 
street dealers. 
  Earlier this month, a Trinidadian was arrested in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
with four kilograms of cocaine. He was a passenger on <ORGANIZATION>BWIA</ORGANIZATION> 
flight 980--Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. 
  Suspicions created since charges last year about a police 
"drug cartel" have slowed the sharing of information even 
between the newly created narcotics unit and <PERSON>Selman</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>OSS</ORGANIZATION>. Each 
agency is reported to be guarding information jealously and 
sharing it "on a need to know basis only." 
  There is no explanation either why there are no busts for 
drugs coming into <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, or how much of 
what comes in remains here. 
  Law enforcement authorities say they are unable to keep pace 
with the sophisticated craft and ingenious methods employed by 
traffickers and predict even tougher times ahead with the major 
shift in <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> drug policy. 
  The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration announced it will slash drug 
interdictions efforts using warships and aircraft in the 
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and pump more aid to <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> to fight cocaine at 
the source. 
  Sharette had told the SUNDAY EXPRESS that <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> 
is being used as a "staging area" by the <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> and Cali 
cartels to move drugs to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. 
  Sharette said <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION> intelligence indicates that single and 
twin-engine aircraft have been making drug airdrops in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> territorial waters. Boats pick up the drug cargo for 
repackaging and shipping to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. 
  Meanwhile, despite <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON>' vow to get tough, cocaine 
cartels 
continue to bring their drugs into <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> and, as 
evidenced by recent seizures and arrests, to take at least some 
of it out.

Language: <FP=105> English </F>
Article Type:<ORGANIZATION>CSO</ORGANIZATION> 

  [Text] Witnesses in drug cases in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> are 
so easily bought off that the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of National Security</ORGANIZATION> is 
putting focus on the seizure of drugs outside of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> as a deliberate policy. 
  This was stated by <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Russell 
Huggins</PERSON> 
in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> yesterday. 
  Noting that there was criticism that the big drug busts were 
not taking place in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, but outside, <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> 
said the seizing of drugs outside of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> was "an 
intentional act." 
  "Witnesses (in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>) are being bought off as 
easy as it is to buy a soft drink in a parlour. We start a case, 
we have four state witnesses and by the time the matter comes 
up, you can't find any of them. They are in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
living it up," he said. 
  He explained that as a result of this the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION> had taken 
a particular approach to the busting of drug deals. 
  "When we find out about it (we arrange) to have it seized 
outside of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and not inside," he said, adding: 
  "We will work with agencies outside of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> 
and I can tell you that it was largely as a result of our effort 
that a drug link between this country and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> was 
destroyed recently." 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> noted that one of the main perpetrators, a 
Trinidadian received a 10-year jail sentence within eight days 
of his arrest. 
  "Now that is the kind of swift justice I will like to see 
here. But we have skilled lawyers who know how to delay justice 
when it suits them," he added. 
  The Minister also referred to a recent bust "as far as 
<LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>" in which both the narcotic units here and the <ORGANIZATION>OSS</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>Organisation of Strategic Services</ORGANIZATION>) played an important role in 
the discovery of shipment of drugs on board a <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> 
craft leaving Piarco. 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> noted that the task of preventing drugs from coming 
into <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> was far more difficult. Those who 
import cocaine have a lot of opportunity to do so, he said, 
adding that the south-eastern coast, given the present size of 
our <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION>, was impossible to patrol on a full-time basis. 
  He recalled that only recently the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> had acquired 
boats with the capability to chase the small fast boats used by 
drug traffickers. 
  Turning to the Point Lisas Port, he noted that it was 
virtually impossible to search 1,000 containers. 
  "The only way you can do it is by random checks and a 
container may slip by and the government and the security at 
Point <PERSON>Lisas</PERSON> are blamed," he noted. 
  He said that while Point <PERSON>Lisas</PERSON> had put in a very good system 
to deal with that, it was virtually impossible to completely 
eradicate the problem. 
  He stressed that good intelligence in detecting the drugs 
was 
still the best option and urged citizens to assist the 
authorities in this regard. 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Government</ORGANIZATION> had provided govenrment 
with 
<MONEY>US$303,000</MONEY>; the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Government</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>French 
Government</ORGANIZATION> had given technical assistance as did the <ORGANIZATION>Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police</ORGANIZATION>. 
  But, he stressed, foreign assistance was extremely difficult 
to access. "Although public pronouncements are made that some 
governments are providing assistance, because of the bureaucracy 
involved, that assistance is extremely difficult to get our 
hands on," he said. 
  He said on regional basis--<ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Financial Action Task 
Force</ORGANIZATION>--was established to deal with the problem of money 
laundering.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ A failed coup attempt by Moslem
extremists and widespread looting that resulted left at least 30
people dead and 150 wounded in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, a government spokesman
said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The authorities expect to find more bodies in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>, where
the prime minister and other government ministers were held
hostage, and in a police station that was gutted by a car-bomb and
fire, spokesman <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> said.
   Previous reports had said about 20 people died in the coup
attempt, which began <DATE>Friday</DATE> with a raid on <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and a
government TV station.
   <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> also confirmed for the first time that Prime Minister <PERSON>N.R.
Robinson</PERSON>, after being shot in the leg, signed agreements to resign,
turn over power to a caretaker government and grant amnesty to the
rebels.
   ``All the agreements were signed under duress, all under
gunpoint, all of which are completely invalid,'' <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> told
reporters at a news conference.
   <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> said that the coup leader, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, and his band of 111
militants had dropped their demands before surrendering on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and releasing their remaining 46 hostages. A total of 55
hostages had been held.
   ``They caved in completely,'' he said. ``They surrendered
unconditionally.
   Officials have said they will press charges against <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and
those who joined him in the coup attempt.
   <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> said soldiers expect to go into <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the nearby
police station on <DATE>Friday</DATE> to search for bodies and unexploded bombs.
Soldiers standing outside the buildings said they were waiting one
day to go inside because of fears of time-delayed explosives.
   The security forces also evacuated 2,000 to 3,000 people from
the vicinity of the government television station, where 29
hostages were held after the building was seized last <DATE>Friday</DATE>. That
building also will be searched.
   <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> said the dead included looters shot by the security forces,
but he gave no breakdown.
   The capital was quiet <TIME>this morning</TIME>. People remained indoors,
under a <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> to noon curfew that remained in effect.
   State radio said <PERSON>Leo des Vignes</PERSON>, a junior government minister
taken hostage <DATE>Friday</DATE> and released a day later, died of a heart
attack <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a hospital. He had been shot in the heel.
   Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON>Winston Dookeran</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that
``appropriate charges'' would be brought against the militants.
   Asked whether the charges would include murder and treason,
<PERSON>Dookeran</PERSON> said it would be up to the judicial authorities to decide.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam and considers
himself a champion of the downtrodden, was under heavy guard along
with the other 111 rebels at army headquarters in <LOCATION>Chaguerames</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>northwest Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   The freed hostages spent the night at <LOCATION>Camp Ogden</LOCATION>, another army
base near the capital of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, for medical exams and
treatment.
   Bakr had demanded <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s ouster, accusing him of corruption
and blaming him for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation of 1.3 million people.
   The 63-year-old prime minister was freed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and
hospitalized for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the attack as
well as exhaustion and glaucoma.
   The defense chief, Col. <PERSON>Joe Theodore</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> had agreed to
surrender <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, four days after the siege began.
   ``I just think they were worn down,'' he said of the rebels.
``They just wanted out. They had come to the conclusion they had
failed.''
   The defense chief said the rebels had agreed to leave all their
explosives and ammunition on the speaker's table in the Parliament
building.
   Officials said the rebels had been armed with AK-47 assault
rifles, vintage World War II rifles, pump-action shotguns, pistols
and grenades.
   The coup attempt began <DATE>Friday</DATE> when armed rebels stormed the
state television station and the Parliament building, taking top
government officials and others captive. They also bombed and
burned down the police station.
   The attack set off a wave of looting.
   Hundreds of people took to the streets, ransacking stores and
warehouses and carrying away everything from food to television
sets. Damage was estimated at <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> and food and medicine
were beginning to run short. It was the country's worst violence
since a black power uprising in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   Dookeran said a state of emergency, including the islandwide
curfew, would remain in effect until the country gets back to
normal.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Moslem militants surrendered
today and began freeing their 42 hostages, ending a six-day coup
attempt that seriously threatened the government and reportedly
left at least 20 people dead.
   The 25 people who had been held hostage since <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the
government television station left the building one by one, were
searched in the middle of the street by soldiers, then taken away
on an army bus, state radio said.
   A short time later, the leader of the coup attempt, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>,
and about 50 rebels left the building, dropped their weapons in the
street, put their hands behind their heads, and surrendered to
soldiers, witnesses said.
   Government spokesman <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> said another group of soldiers
was heading over to the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building, about a mile away, to
take the remaining rebels into custody and evacuate their 17
hostages, who included seven Cabinet ministers and other officials.
   <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON> said it was his understanding that <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and his group of
about 100 Moslem extremists had surrendered unconditionally.
   The hostages initially included the prime minister, <PERSON>Arthur N.R.
Robinson</PERSON>, but he was freed on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> after offering to step down,
call new elections and grant the rebels amnesty. It was not
immediately clear whether the government would fulfill that pledge
since it was made while <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was held captive.
   Details of the final negotiations that produced the rebel
agreement to surrender and free all their hostages were not
immediately available.
   Earlier today, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> had described the coup attempt as a ``small
family squabble'' and said that an accord had been reached to end
the standoff.
   Speaking in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
from the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> had indicated that the hostages
would be freed soon.
   ``The negotiations are over. We already have a signed
agreement,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION>. ``We are making preparations now for
the evacuation of all the people, all the people at the television
house and the people who are at the Parliament building.''
   At least 20 people were reportedly killed in fighting and
looting associated with the coup attempt. The capital was reported
quiet today, but a government spokesman said there were explosions
overnight.
   ``It's very calm,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON>Bernard Pantin</PERSON>. He said
he did not know the cause of the explosions but said they were not
near the Parliament or the television station, where the captives
were being held.
   Bakr had blamed <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> for widespread poverty in the once
oil-rich nation of 1.3 million people near <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. He said in
today's interview he was seeking a ``new beginning in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.''
   Bakr's <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat al-Muslimeen</ORGANIZATION> group, which means the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Group</ORGANIZATION>
in Arabic, was founded in <DATE>1984</DATE> and is believed to have 250 to 300
members. It is also believed to have received financing from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador, <PERSON>Charles Gargano</PERSON>, said no sign of popular
support surfaced for <ORGANIZATION>Bakr</ORGANIZATION>'s extremist sect.
   ``This is not a revolution,'' he said. ``It is a hostage
situation.''
   Although <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> interview that everyone being held
by his followers would be freed, he also denied that the people
were in fact hostages.
   ``We don't have any hostages, sir. We never had any hostages,''
he told the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> interviewer. ``You'll have to rephrase that
question.''
   Asked whether the people in question were then free to leave,
<PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> responded: ``There's a curfew. They can't walk about in a
curfew.''
   A 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew remained in effect throughout most of
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> following earlier widespread looting.
   When the interviewer expressed disbelief that only the curfew
was stopping the prisoners from leaving, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> also mentioned that
bus service had been disrupted.
   He said of the coup attempt, ``It was a small family squabble...
I'm saying that emphatically.''
   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was allowed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to leave the besieged Parliament
building. It was not clear whether he would continue as prime
minister.
   Fifteen government officials were held hostage in the Parliament
building and 25 others in the government TV station.
   At least nine people were killed when <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and his followers
took over both buildings on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 63, was hospitalized
for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover, as well as
for exhaustion and glaucoma.
   The government had said earlier that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was shot in both
feet. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   Smart would not discuss the conditions under which <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was
freed, or say whether his health was a factor. <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> said in today's
interview that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was freed as a ``humanitarian gesture.''
   <PERSON>Gargano</PERSON>, interviewed before <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s release, said the
government remained united and in control. He said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s
deputy, <PERSON>Winston Dookeran</PERSON>, and eight other ministers who escaped
rebel capture were running <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   Smart said the government continued to enjoy the ``complete
loyalty'' of the 1,500-member military and 5,000-member police
force.
   In a joint telephone call <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> from inside <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s chief negotiator, <PERSON>Bilal Abdullah</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Minister of
Justice</ORGANIZATION> and National Security <PERSON>Selwyn Richardson</PERSON> all said a
settlement had been reached.
   <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> said the agreement called for <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> to resign and
for elections to be held within 90 days. But government spokesman
<PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON> said there was no agreement: ``These are statements of
people being held at gunpoint. People are made to make statements.''

  [Text] <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, 8 Jan, <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>'s police commissioner, <PERSON>Jules Bernard</PERSON>, has issued a stern 
warning to Muslim leader <PERSON>Yasin Abu Bakr</PERSON> [name as received], 
whose followers staged a coup attempt here in <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
  "I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as 
the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law 
and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action 
to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and 
tranquility of the society," <PERSON>Bernard</PERSON> said after <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> said 
his group felt as "oppressed" as it had when it staged the 
insurrection. 
  "It is important that all persons who may be inclined to 
embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the 
police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such 
activities." 
  Bakr, during a news conference, expressed dissatisfaction 
over the long time the court of appeal took in delivering the 
judgment in the dispute over lands the Muslimeen claims at 
Mucurapo in the northern township of <ORGANIZATION>St James</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The Muslim leader said his organisation had many options 
open 
to it regarding the land dispute with the government. 
  "We can't just starve to death and do nothing. The 
government is treating us unjustly. We have many options and we 
would not sit and do nothing. We will use the best option 
available to us," he told reporters. 
  He said that the organisation was not doing anything to 
create tension. 
  Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> added,"we are feeling oppressed and we would like 
to 
defend ourselves. "The same kind of oppression resulted in the 
<DATE>1990</DATE> insurrection." 
  The Muslimeen held parliamentarians hostage in <DATE>1990</DATE>, 
complaining of victimisation and economic hardships. Bakr and 
113 followers who gave themselves up afterwards were freed in 
<DATE>1992</DATE> after a high court found that an amnesty which they 
received from acting President <PERSON>Emmanuel Carter</PERSON> was valid. 
  Previous governments and the <PERSON>Muslimeen</PERSON> have been at 
loggerheads over the ownership of the land, which eventually 
ended up in the courts. 
  Bakr, at the news conference, also complained that the state 
had failed to pay compension for the destruction of several 
buildings on the Mucurapo lands which were gutted by fire, 
shortly after the six-day siege of parliament.

   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is preparing
emergency assistance for this beleaguered <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> country, but
there are no plans to send military reinforcements, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
ambassador said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``We haven't been asked and we aren't considering any type of
military support,'' Ambassador <PERSON>Charles Gargano</PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, a few blocks from the state <ORGANIZATION>Television House</ORGANIZATION> where a
radical Moslem group has held hostages since <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The group also seized the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament House</ORGANIZATION> and is holding
hostages there, including government officials. Prime Minister
<PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> was freed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, five days after being
seized, the attorney general said.
   Because of widespread looting, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> could face food
shortages, and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is preparing emergency supplies,
<PERSON>Gargano</PERSON> said.
   He said a force of some 200 Caribbean soldiers were standing by
on <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> to help if requested.
   The ambassador, who has been staying in the <ORGANIZATION>Embassy</ORGANIZATION> along with
12 other diplomatic personnel and six Marine guards, said he is in
regular contact with Trinidadian officials.
   He said there are no signs of splintering in the government or
security forces, and there is no popular support for the rebels.
   ``The government is in total control of the country,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Gargano</PERSON>, named in <DATE>1987</DATE>, said the crisis ``came out of the blue
for us. In fact, we were quite shocked. This country appeared to be
a model of democracy.''
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stakes here are high, he said. He said there are 2,000
to 4,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, including many Trinidadians who
hold dual citizenship.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> is a major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade partner in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> and has
been a pro-American democracy for its three decades of nationhood,
he said.
   ``Things have been moving apace in terms of democratization in
this hemisphere. We would like to see it continue as a strong
democracy,'' <PERSON>Gargano</PERSON> said.
   He said the Moslem group led by former <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> policeman <PERSON>Abu
Bakr</PERSON> has been controversial in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and has made anti-American
statements.
   ``Our impression is that it was a tiny fanatical sect,'' he
said, estimating <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s followers at 250 to 350 people.
   He said some members of the group have traveled to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and
``there is some evidence of training given to some members.'' He
said they also have received funding from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Gargano</PERSON> added
there was no evidence of Libyan involvement in their move against
the government.

Captive Prime Minister <PERSON>A. N. R. Robinson</PERSON>, suffering a festering leg wound and 
imperiled eyesight, was released by black Muslim rebels <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but 40 other 
hostages were still being held as efforts to free them dragged into a fifth day 
without progress. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing prime minister was led to an ambulance in front of <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, the 
twin-island nation's besieged Parliament building, by one of his captors and 
another hostage, according to Atty. Gen. <PERSON>Anthony Smart</PERSON>, a senior member of the 
Cabinet team that has been negotiating with the rebels via radio, telephone and 
a clergyman intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was taken first to the Trinidadian army's <PERSON>Camp Ogden</PERSON>, then to an 
unidentified hospital, <PERSON>Smart</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> "is in good spirits," but he is reported to be suffering from 
an apparently infected gunshot wound in one leg. <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> also reportedly is 
experiencing eye problems resulting from his lack of glaucoma medication since 
the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building was seized by the rebels in a coup attempt <DATE>Friday</DATE> 
<TIME>evening</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Smart refused to give details of the talks that led to <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s freedom, but 
he indicated that the release did not represent a breakthrough in the overall 
hostage negotiations, which ran aground after near-agreement <DATE>Monday</DATE>. A 
government spokesman, <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON>, said the hostage takers' "demands are 
escalating, and some of the demands are clearly impossible to meet." 
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is far from over," Smart declared. 
</P>
<P>
The first hint of the surprise development <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> came in an <TIME>early morning</TIME> 
telephone conversation between the leader of the rebels and journalists. 
Speaking from the besieged <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Television</ORGANIZATION> (TTT) building, the 
chief hostage taker, <PERSON>Yasin abu Bakr</PERSON>, offered to release <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> on 
humanitarian grounds, with no strings attached, "because he is sick." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> virtually bombarded local and foreign reporters with phone 
calls to the government's temporary press headquarters in the Holiday Inn 
Hotel, a few blocks from <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>. The calls revealed a growing tone of 
desperation among his estimated 120 armed comrades and at least some captives. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> charged that a coterie of Cabinet ministers had 
torpedoed a signed agreement to end the crisis, which he contended was reached 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"They have now pulled a new coup, and they are holding everyone ransom," <PERSON>Abu 
Bakr</PERSON> cried in an anxious, angry voice during one call several hours before 
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s release. "They are blocking it because they want <PERSON>Mr. Robinson</PERSON> dead." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was not spelled out by <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> or government officials, but it 
reportedly included <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s pledge to resign; formation of an interim 
government including <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, and total amnesty for the rebels, who are 
believed to have received military training and financial support from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old former police officer, who founded the black Muslim group 
<ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> al Muslimeen six years ago, called for former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Jimmy 
Carter</PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> to come to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> so he would have someone 
"straightforward" to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
In another call to journalists, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> complained that the police and army 
troops who have surrounded the two hostage sites are trying to starve his group 
into submission. He charged that the army ignored his calls for food and water 
until <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, when they placed provisions in the street in front of the 
television building and dared the hostage takers to come out for them. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> also had tried to split the hostage 
takers by cutting off all lines of communication between the television 
buildings, where 25 of the captives are held, and <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, where 15 remain at 
gunpoint, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> contended. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON>, acknowledged that all lines 
to the two buildings have been cut and expressed astonishment that the rebel 
leader had secured a phone line to the press hotel. Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> explained that he 
had "a genius" in his group who engineered the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the hostages, television news director <PERSON>Jones P. Madeira</PERSON> and reporter 
<PERSON>Raul Pantin</PERSON>, seconded <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>'s agitated complaints when he passed the 
telephone to them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I spoke to the army yesterday afternoon, I said, 'Everybody's dying of 
starvation in here,' " <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> recalled <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. "What are they trying to do, 
get me killed?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives are threatened here, but not by the imam," said <PERSON>Pantin</PERSON>, using <PERSON>Abu 
Bakr</PERSON>'s title as an Islamic religious leader. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> if he is fearful of the outcome of the siege, he 
replied only: "Everyone will die at some time in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Charles A. Gargano</PERSON> provided some insight into the 
situation for five American journalists who visited the <ORGANIZATION>American Embassy</ORGANIZATION> on 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his own contacts with the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> government concerning 
the crisis, <PERSON>Gargano</PERSON> said, "The last communication we had with the government 
(early <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>) is that they are still discussing the situation, and it has 
been going up and down." He expressed hope that a peaceful solution would be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Although declining to provide details of his conversations with local 
officials, <PERSON>Gargano</PERSON> said the Americans already are "looking at programs where we 
might be able to assist with such things as emergency food shipments." 
</P>
<P>
After a weekend of widespread looting, virtually all supermarkets and food 
shops in Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> have been stripped bare, and a severe food shortage has 
developed.

<FP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Judy Diptee</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] Foreign missions in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> have come 
together to assist the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> in tackling the illicit drug 
trade. 
  Officials at the <ORGANIZATION>French Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>UK High Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>US Embassy</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian High Commission</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>last week</DATE> that 
they hold ad hoc, informal meetings to consider the requirements 
of the <ORGANIZATION>T&amp;T Government</ORGANIZATION> and how best they can each serve these 
needs. 
  The objective of these meetings, they say, is to exchange 
information so that projects are co-ordinated and to ensure that 
efforts are not duplicated. 
  The French have been identified as the experts on money 
laundering, the Canadians on training and equipment, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> on 
drug interdiction and the British on training. 
  <PERSON>Jacques Venne</PERSON>, delegate for the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Caribbean Technical 
and International Police</ORGANIZATION> Co-operation (SCTIP) attached to the 
<ORGANIZATION>French Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, said that <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> was designated the 
regional centre of SCTIP operations on <DATE>September 27</DATE>. Director of 
SCTIP (International) Jean-Louise Ottavi visited for the opening 
on his way to <LOCATION>Aruba</LOCATION> to attend an <ORGANIZATION>Interpol Conference</ORGANIZATION>. 
  This country, he said, was chosen because of its 
geographical 
location and because of this <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION>'s interest in dealing 
with the illicit drug trade. The Jamaican office, he added, was 
closed in favour of reinforcing the newly-opened centre in 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Paris Government</ORGANIZATION>, he said, has already released "a good 
budget" for training a special team of police officers in money 
laundering, starting from the end of <DATE>October</DATE>. The officers are 
expected to undergo an intensive training session in <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION>. 
  Emphasising that his <ORGANIZATION>Embassy</ORGANIZATION> offers assistance on the basis 
of discussions with this <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Venne</PERSON> said: "We are here as 
advisers, not to say what to do." 
  Head of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Strategic Services</ORGANIZATION> (OSS) <PERSON>Lance Selman</PERSON> 
pointed out that the Customs and <ORGANIZATION>Excise Division</ORGANIZATION> as well as the 
banking sector needed to be educated about money laundering. 
"One can't talk of counter-narcotics and not money laundering. 
In the final analysis it is money that drives the trade," he 
commented. 
  His office, <PERSON>Selman</PERSON> said, has been mandated to develop the 
capabilities to deal with money laundering. 
  Stating that his country's contribution has been "very 
modest" to date, Canadian High Commissioner <PERSON>Jean Nadeau</PERSON> said on 
<DATE>Friday</DATE> that <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has been offering participation in short-term 
observer/attendance programmes. These exercises, he explained, 
involved exposure to the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</ORGANIZATION> in their 
drug control operations. 
  Two T&amp;T officers will be attending such a session later 
this 
month. Besides training sessions, <PERSON>Nadeau</PERSON> said, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> has 
donated a small amount of communications equipment to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of National Security</ORGANIZATION> and has made a financial 
commitment to assist in the renovation of the <ORGANIZATION>Narcotics Unit</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Indirectly, the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Government</ORGANIZATION> has also provided 
assistance to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, he said, through a <DATE>1992</DATE> 
contribution of Can<MONEY>$800,000</MONEY> to the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Drug Control 
Commission</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>CICAD</ORGANIZATION>) and Can<MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>UNDCP</ORGANIZATION>). 
  <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Nadeau</PERSON>, is also discussing with <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> the setting up [of] a communications trunking system 
linking the protective services and perhaps Customs and Excise. 
  Press officer at the <ORGANIZATION>British High Commission Simon Bond</ORGANIZATION> said 
that the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> is placing emphasis on training especially in money 
laundering within the Customs and <ORGANIZATION>Excise Division</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "In the past we have given small-scale material assistance 
to 
the police and <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION>. But more significant from the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s 
point of view is training. We also give advice in terms of 
legislative drafting in the drug area," Bond said. 
  Besides donating vehicles and equipment to the protective 
services, the <ORGANIZATION>US Government</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> funded a US$18,000 drug 
prevention programme aimed at young people.

<FP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Linda Hutchinson</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, 25 Jan, <LOCATION>CANA</LOCATION> -- The 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Government</ORGANIZATION> will accelerate its efforts to 
recover money owed to it by at least six <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Community</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION>) countries, a government minister reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 
  "This process was started by the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Finance</ORGANIZATION> in 
<DATE>1993</DATE>. In <DATE>1994</DATE>, the minister of finance will attempt to 
accelerate the process through direct contact with his 
counterparts in the defaulting countries," Junior Finance 
Minister <PERSON>Ken Valley</PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "These efforts are expected to culminate in <DATE>1994</DATE> with the 
full regularisation of the arrears." He named <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>St. Vincent</PERSON> 
and the <LOCATION>Grenadines</LOCATION> as countries not currently servicing all of 
their liabilities to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. 
  "In some instances, no terms and conditions were determined 
for the repayment of the advances," he reported. "It is also the 
case in many instances that the countries defaulted several 
years ago. At this point, therefore, it has become necessary to 
verify the outstanding balances before the full recovery can be 
negotiated." At the end of <DATE>December last year</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>517 <MONEY>million 
dollars</MONEY> was due to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> by its <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION> partners. 
The money represents only the bilateral portion of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>'s debt portfolio. The multilateral arrears under the 
collapsed <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION> multilateral clearing facility amounted to 
almost <MONEY>33 million dollars</MONEY> at the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>. 
  Out of the indebted countries, only <LOCATION>Belize</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Kitts</LOCATION> are 
fully current and to-date they have repaid principal sums of <MONEY>TT 
65,620 dollars</MONEY> and <MONEY>1,555,914 dollars</MONEY> (one TT dollar = 17.5 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
cents) respectively on the original loan balances, the minister 
said. <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Barbuda</LOCATION> owed <MONEY>U.S.2.5 million dollars</MONEY>; <MONEY>Dominica 
1.3 million dollars</MONEY>; <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> over <MONEY>600,000 dollars</MONEY>; <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> 
97,000 dollars; <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> 388,000 dollars; and <PERSON>St. Vincent</PERSON> and 
the <ORGANIZATION>Grenadines</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>100,000 dollars</MONEY>. The <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago 
Government</ORGANIZATION> was expected to sign, early this year, a bilateral 
agreement with the Government of <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>, whose bilateral 
liability to the government here and the central bank was 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S.</ORGANIZATION><MONEY>487 million dollars</MONEY> or <PERCENT>94 percent</PERCENT> of the total debt. The 
<LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> debt was restructured in <DATE>1989</DATE> but subsequently fell into 
arrears. In <DATE>August last year</DATE>, a team of government officials 
from <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> met with Guyanese counterparts to negotiate a 
memorandum of understanding for the consolidation of the debt. A 
memorandum was signed by both governments and forms the basis of 
a bilateral agreement between both countries. 
  The agreement provides for the liquidation of the arrears of 
<MONEY>34.5 million dollars</MONEY> which was due from <DATE>August 1990</DATE> to <DATE>July 
1993</DATE>. The agreement provides for a rescheduling of these arrears 
over a twelve-year period with a six-month moratorium on 
principal repayment. The <DATE>1993</DATE> agreement also provides for two 
semi-annual payments of <MONEY>10.5 million dollars</MONEY> in <DATE>1994</DATE> and similar 
amounts in <DATE>1995</DATE> and <DATE>1996</DATE>. 
  "Payments falling due under this agreement may be reduced by 
a range of debt conversion techniques including debt-equity 
swaps," said <ORGANIZATION>Valley</ORGANIZATION>. In pursuit of debt-equity swap 
opportunities, in <DATE>March this year</DATE>, the government is mounting an 
investment and trade mission to <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>. The aim of the mission 
is to identify businesses in <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> in which the participants, 
both from the private and state enterprises sectors, will be 
prepared to make equity investments." 
  With regard to the recovery of the amounts due to the 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Government</ORGANIZATION> and central bank by the 
government and <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank of Barbados</ORGANIZATION>, both governments last 
<DATE>December</DATE> signed a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum 
provides for the set-off of the government of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>'s share of the liability of the cargo airline Caricargo 
to the <ORGANIZATION>Barbados National Bank</ORGANIZATION> against the debt of the Government 
of <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank of Barbados</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>. 
  Caricargo's debt to the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Barbados</ORGANIZATION> is <MONEY>Bds59 million 
dollars</MONEY> (one <ORGANIZATION>Bds</ORGANIZATION> dollar = 50 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cents) with <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>'s share being <MONEY>29.5 million dollars</MONEY>. 
  The debt set-off will result in <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>' <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>25 million 
dollar liability being reduced by <ORGANIZATION>U.S.</ORGANIZATION><MONEY>15.3 million dollars</MONEY>.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Linda Nunes</PERSON> smiled approvingly as a clutch of agitated soldiers grasped their 
automatic rifles and bolted past the front porch of her small clapboard house 
near the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Television</ORGANIZATION> (TTT) station where radical Muslim 
rebels were holding 29 hostages behind a barricade of booby-trapped vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged government worker seemed unperturbed by the occasional bursts 
of small-arms fire just a block away. 
</P>
<P>
"Come in and wash your face and have a glass of rum," she called out in a 
traditional gesture of Trinidadian hospitality to a group of harried foreign 
journalists who had paused to take cover. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting placidly in her porch rocker with a half-emptied glass in her hand, 
<PERSON>Nunes</PERSON> said she would be happy if the soldiers stormed the station and the <ORGANIZATION>Red 
House Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building where 42 more members of the radical <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> al 
Muslimeen rebel group were holding Prime Minister <PERSON>A. N. R. Robinson</PERSON> and 17 
other senior government officials captive. 
</P>
<P>
But even though she shared widespread feelings against the unpopular prime 
minister for austerity policies that have pinched the incomes of most 
Trinidadians, she hoped he would not be killed or forcibly ousted from power 
during the hostage ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the sonuvabitch either," she said, her rocker thumping 
emphatically on the porch floorboards. "But we'll vote him out our own way, not 
by hostage takin'. Don't be takin' the choice out of my hands!" 
</P>
<P>
Her implacably democratic feelings were shared by many in the devastated 
capital city, even among those who virtually wiped out Trinidadian commerce and 
industry with five days of rampant pillaging when law and order broke down on 
the first night of the hostage crisis. The rebel leader, <PERSON>Yasin abu Bakr</PERSON>, had 
counted on such disaffected people to join his aborted revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Why he did not succeed in turning the violent seizure of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the 
broadcast center into a full-scale revolution was clear as the waters of the 
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> to the country's leading sociologist, <PERSON>Dr. Selwyn Ryan</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Trinidadians play cricket, and cricket is a game of rules that must be 
respected," he said as if that explained the matter. "People who play cricket 
don't make revolutions. It isn't cricket." 
</P>
<P>
As for the lawlessness and looting that left Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s once sparkling 
Independence Square commercial center looking as burned out as downtown <LOCATION>West 
Beirut</LOCATION>, the editor of a leading local newspaper had an equally benign and 
probably correct explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not complicated by racial hostilities or an uprising of the 
dispossessed or that sort of thing, because all races and classes appeared to 
take part," he said. "It was simply people taking something for nothing in the 
absence of visible law and order. That's not peculiar to Trinidadians." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Muslimeen rebels themselves, hardly anyone in <LOCATION>Port of Spain</LOCATION> 
thought the seizure of the hostages was a revolutionary act. Most of those 
interviewed on the streets agreed with Col. <PERSON>Joseph Theodore</PERSON>, the armed forces 
chief, when he called it a simple act of terrorism, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"(Abu) <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> expected the people to rise up like revolutionaries and help him," 
said a businessman who declined to give his name. "Instead they rose up and 
helped themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The wild carnival atmosphere of the looting during the first three days of the 
hostage crisis already has provided the material for legend. <PERSON>Lennox Murray</PERSON>, a 
local devotee of traditional <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> calypso music, said he knows several 
calypso composers and singers who are already at work immortalizing some of the 
Herculean looting feats they witnessed on the flame-lit streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of it, Mon! ," <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> exulted. "Usually take six Trinidadians to move a 
refrigerator 10 feet. Now we see one man take a fridge six blocks on his head. 
What a song!" 
</P>
<P>
The question of why the looters burned down so many buildings, including some 
of the city's most modern office structures, remains a puzzle, but like 
everything else that happened here <DATE>last week</DATE>, there were many uninformed 
rumors. A cab driver named <PERSON>Joe Winter</PERSON> said he knew for a fact that Libyan arson 
squads had come ashore from ships to accompany the looters. 
</P>
<P>
Winter also claimed positive knowledge that a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> task force lurking just 
offshore "blew them Libyan boats sky-high right out of the water." When 
challenged with the obvious fact that no warships were in sight, <DATE>Winter</DATE> blandly 
amended his report. "They were submarines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although <DATE>Winter</DATE>'s rumors were wholly fabricated, talk of a Libyan connection 
had a basis in fact. Abu <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> is known to have visited <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and received 
financial support from its radical leader Col. <PERSON>Moammar Kadafi</PERSON>, according to 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> police who have had him under surveillance for six years. 
Some of his men received military training in <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> as well, the police said. 
But they said that they have found no evidence that <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> had anything to do 
with <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>'s violent takeover of the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
Before founding the radical Muslim sect and turning to violence, <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> was a 
respected, law-and-order mounted policeman. For lack of a better explanation of 
<PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>'s recent behavior, The Guardian, a local newspaper, reported that he 
underwent an abrupt change of personality after being medically discharged from 
the police. The medical reason for the discharge, the newspaper said, was that 
<PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> had become addled after his horse kicked him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the final outcome for <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> and his 111 fellow hostage takers, now 
in military custody and likely facing charges of treason and murder, they will 
not have a home to return to if their freedom ever is restored. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings of the nine-acre religious commune that the sect built on squatter 
land north of Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> burst mysteriously into flames two days after the 
crisis ended on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. No one seemed to know who started the fires, but 
they centered on the plush four-bedroom apartment of <ORGANIZATION>Abu Bakr</ORGANIZATION> in a building 
that contained the commune's shops. 
</P>
<P>
Before the fire, journalists were taken on an army-sponsored tour of the 
commune and found it totally, and apparently hurriedly, abandoned by the wives 
and children of the insurgents. Discarded clothing and other possessions of the 
radical Muslims littered the buildings and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like <LOCATION>Jonestown</LOCATION> without the bodies," said <PERSON>Bernard Diederich</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Time 
magazine</ORGANIZATION>, who covered the <DATE>1979</DATE> mass suicide in <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION> of the followers of the 
Rev. <PERSON>Jim Jones</PERSON>, another rebel who claimed a religious mission to purify a 
corrupt world.

and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>'s attorney general <PERSON>Keith Sobion</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
government will not be pressured into making a decision on a 
land dispute with the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> al Muslimeen. 
  Leader of the Muslimeen, <PERSON>Yasin Abu Bakr</PERSON>, who led the <DATE>1990</DATE> 
coup attempt on a former government here, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> his 
organisation had suffered "injustices" at the hands of the state 
and would not sit idly by should the appeal court not deliver 
judgement on the land dispute. 
  In a statement following a strongly-worded warning by the 
commissioner of police, <PERSON>Sobion</PERSON> said government was committed to 
the rule of law, and fully respected the role and function of 
the judiciary. 
  "It will not be party to any attempt to subvert the rule of 
law or indeed to manipulate the judiciary. Moreover, the 
government is confident that the judiciary will not itself 
rebuff any attempt, whether by the government or otherwise, to 
subvert or manipulate its processes. Any suggestion to the 
contrary is patently groundless. The government itself will not 
be pressured into making any decision relating to this matter," 
he said. 
  Sobion noted that there were essentially two issues relating 
to the lands at <ORGANIZATION>Mucurapo Road</ORGANIZATION>, in the northern township of <LOCATION>St. 
James</LOCATION>. The first is about the status of persons living there, 
and [the other] is the liability of the state for the demolition 
of certain buildings shortly after the end of the six-day siege. 
  Following a press conference called by <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Commissioner of 
Police Jules Bernard</ORGANIZATION> condemned the statements as threats, saying 
the police were ready to deal with anyone who threatened to 
disturb the peace.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Moslem radicals freed an ailing
and wounded Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, four
days after they took him and 40 other people hostage in a coup
attempt, the attorney general said.
   The other hostages, including 15 government officials, were
still held, Attorney General <PERSON>Anthony Smart</PERSON> said. He refused to say
what conditions led to the 63-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Robinson</ORGANIZATION>'s release.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Roman Popadiuk confirmed
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> was freed and said, ``We hope the situation can be
resolved in a quick and peaceful manner.''
   But <PERSON>Smart</PERSON> told reporters, ``This crisis is far from over.''
   He said the government in this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> nation of 1.3 million
residents was continuing efforts to win the release of the others
held by former policeman <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> and his band of Moslem extremists.
   ``These discussions are at a very delicate stage,'' with lives
at stake, he said.
   The hostages were seized <DATE>Friday</DATE> by extremists who captured the
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building and the government TV station about one mile
away. At least nine people were yle.''
   Attorneys representing the families of <PERSON>Raymond Belknap</PERSON> and <PERSON>James
Vance</PERSON> claim those lines on the band's ``Stained Class'' album
contain the subliminal message ``do it'' that prompted the youths
to shoot themselves in a deserted church playground <DATE>Dec. 23, 1985</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Belknap</PERSON>, 18, died immediately. <PERSON>Vance</PERSON>, then 20, blew away most of
his face but lived three more years, undergoing several operations,
before he died on <DATE>Thanksgiving Day 1988</DATE> of complications from his
injuries and the various medications he was taking.
   The band and <ORGANIZATION>CBS Records</ORGANIZATION> deny any hidden messages exist. They
counter that the supposed ``do it'' sounds are an exhalation of
breath, and a combination of drums, guitars and vocals.
   ``The sounds I hear are essentially my own exhalation of breath
at the end of the line I am singing,'' <PERSON>Halford</PERSON> testified.
   ``There are no subliminals of any nature'' either in the song or
on the album, he said.
   Halford testified that the song ``Better by You, Better than
Me,'' was the only song on the <DATE>1978</DATE> album that wasn't written by
band members.

<HEAD>Gunmen Fire on President's Car, No One Injured</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Assailants shot into President
<PERSON>Noor Hassanali</PERSON>'s limousine, but the president was not inside and his
wife narrowly escaped the attack unharmed, police said.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>A.N.R. Robinson</PERSON> refused to speculate on a motive
for the attack but told Parliament <DATE>Friday</DATE> that ``all measures to
catch the perpetrators have been put in place, and I urge the public
to remain calm.''
   The attack occurred <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when <PERSON>Hassanali</PERSON>'s wife,
<PERSON>Zaylahar</PERSON>, 65, was returning home in the limousine. Police
Superintendent <PERSON>Sorzano Araetes</PERSON> said three men attacked 200 yards
from the couple's home on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>.
   ``A white <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> vehicle pulled up alongside and shots were fired
into the presidential car, barely missing the president's wife,''
and other bullets hit the side of the limousine, <PERSON>Araetes</PERSON> said.
   The chauffeur also escaped injury, he said.
   Araetes said police found the attack car <DATE>Friday</DATE>, with AK-47 shell
casings inside.
   Hassanali, 68, a retired <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> judge, became president in
<DATE>1987</DATE> and has avoided controversy. The post of is ceremonial.
   <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, a two-island state of 1.2 million people in

<HEAD>Trinidad Coup Attempt Underscores Caribbean Vulnerabilty</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Behind the sun, sand and carefree
islanders of the tourist brochures lies another Caribbean of
hardship and frustration that is a breeding ground for radicalism.
   It became visible when Moslem extremists tried to overthrow the
government of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   ``<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> was a ticking time bomb, but it is only one of a
number of such situations in the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Larry Birns</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Economic decay throughout the region provides fertile ground for
civil unrest, analysts say.
   ``Economic prosperity solves a broad range of societal problems,
and economic despair breeds them,'' <PERSON>Birns</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON>, leader of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen, said he and his
followers seized Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> and 54 other
hostages on <DATE>July 27</DATE> because of the poverty that has replaced
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s oil bonanza of the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   Most of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>'s two dozen islands have similar problems
because of shrinking world markets for bauxite, oil, bananas, sugar
and other traditional exports.
   Unemployment in the region averages <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>, foreign debt in
the billions drains tax revenues, inflation erodes buying power and
living standards fall.
   Foreign investment, trade agreements like the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration's <LOCATION>Caribbean Basin Initiative</LOCATION> and expansion of
tourism have not stopped the decline.
   ``Unfortunately, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> thinks in terms of <MONEY>hundreds
of thousands of dollars</MONEY> to solve <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> problems when it's going
to take <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY>,'' said <PERSON>Birns</PERSON>, whose
organization often criticizes <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy in the region.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam, demanded
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s resignation and blamed him for the country's economic
plight. Most of <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s support came from poor blacks.
   Robinson won a landslide election victory in <DATE>1986</DATE>, but <PERSON>Birns</PERSON>
said the prime minister had become a ``political pariah,'' largely
because of austerity measures dictated by the <ORGANIZATION>International
Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> as a condition for new loans.
   Consumer price increases, layoffs and reduced spending on
schools and hospitals demanded by the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> have provoked riots in
<LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>, as well as several
Latin American countries.
   Libyan leader <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON> stepped into this picture,
analysts say, with handouts for <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and radical political parties
with potential to destabilize governments.
   ``It's a well-known fact that <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> has funded leftist
activities in <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> and separatists
organizations in <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>John Collins</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> advisor to the <LOCATION>Puerto Rican</LOCATION> government.
   ``The left-of-center parties in these small islands use support
from <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON> to exploit the economic underdevelopment which exists
in their countries to mount opposition to the right-of-center
parties that are pro-U.S.''
   The six-day hostage siege in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, which prompted widespread
looting and claimed at least 38 lives, has prompted Caribbean
leaders to review regional security measures.
   ``Our determination that this must not happen again must be
given explicit effect,'' Prime Minister <PERSON>Erskine Sandiford</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION> said at last week's annual meeting of the 13-member
<ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Economic Community</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Eugenia Charles</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> said a regional
security agreement dating to the <DATE>1983</DATE> U.S. invasion of <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION>
should be expanded to allow <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION> armies to intervene when an
elected government is threatened.
   In <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s case, <ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION> sent a multinational force of 150 on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, two days after the siege ended, to aid the army and police.
   <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>'s independent <ORGANIZATION>Stabroek News</ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial that the
attempted coup was ``an affront to the aspiration of the region's
people.''
   ``We know the shock waves have reverberated throughout the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>, where many governments face a difficult economic
situation, and we imagine this will spur them all to greater and
more purposeful efforts to define a democratic future for <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>
peoples,'' it said.
   <PERSON>Anthony Maingot</PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> who teaches sociology at
<ORGANIZATION>Florida International University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, acknowledged the
region's vulnerability, but said democracy was firmly entrenced.
   ``This is the largest gathering of Third World democracies in
the world,'' <PERSON>Maingot</PERSON> said.
   He noted that in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> ``is still
there, the elected government is still there and parliamentary
democracy is still intact. This is the silver lining of the cloud.''

<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Government</ORGANIZATION> will issue new passports from the 
beginning of next month to combat passport fraud. 
  "In <DATE>1993</DATE> alone, over 300 cases of passport fraud came to our

reported, " Chief Immigration Officer <PERSON>Arthur Harper</PERSON> told 
reporters on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
  <PERSON>Harper</PERSON> said passports were being stolen to get the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> visas which were then inserted into a fradulent passport 
and sold to members of the public for as high as 10,000 <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> dollars (one TT dollar - <MONEY>17.5 US cents</MONEY>). 
  The Immigration chief said the passports which were being 
printed by a firm in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>, had a number of 
built-in security features and were virtually tamper-proof. 
  Persons over 16 years old who have never owned a passport or 
whose passport has expired will have to pay <MONEY>150 dollars</MONEY> while 
persons under 16 years would have to pay <MONEY>75 dollars</MONEY>. 
  The holders of unexpired passports who are over 16 years 
will be required to pay <MONEY>100 dollars</MONEY> for the new passport and 
persons under 16 years will pay <MONEY>50 dollars</MONEY>. 
  <PERSON>Harper</PERSON> said all passports issued before Immigration started 
handing out the new ones will be declared null and void on <DATE>June 
30, 1995</DATE>.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Looters hauled away carloads of
television sets and other appliances while vigilante squads guarded
some homes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> during the chaos of an armed uprising by Moslem
extremists.
   Fires broke out in several parts of the capital, <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>,
and a thick cloud of acrid smoke hung over the city.
   A government-imposed curfew took effect in mid-afternoon, and
the streets were deserted _ except for looters.
   ``Everybody is trying to secure themselves because people don't
know what's going to happen,'' said <PERSON>Trinidanian Ian Mckenzie</PERSON>, who
was watching looters on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION>. ``We don't
want our country this way. We are a democratic country.''
   In middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods, residents banded
together to stave off attacks. Several homes in the <LOCATION>Westmoorings</LOCATION>
suburb, about six miles northwest of the capital, were ransacked,
and residents fenced off the area to keep intruders away.
   A witness said he said two men _ armed with 12-gauge shotguns
and a .38-caliber revolver _ trying to shoot open a large safe by
the side of a road.
   Widespread looting broke out along the Churchill-Roosevelt
highway, the main artery between the airport and the capital.
People pulled their cars up to warehouses and filled them with
refrigerators, televisions and radios.
   Supermarkets, pharmacies, clothing, hardware and appliance
stores were systematically stripped by convoys of vehicles. Looting
also spread outside the capital to the villages of <LOCATION>Barataria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San
Juan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mount Hope</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>El Socorro</LOCATION>.
   Anglican Bishop <PERSON>Clive Abdullah</PERSON> broadcast an appeal over
government-run radio for looters to stop.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter
places to take foodstuffs. I can perhaps ask God's forgiveness for
this,'' he said.
   ``But when you line up a convoy of vehicles to take away items
like refrigerators, television sets and videos, that is not right.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and police patrolled downtown Port-of-Spain around the
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building, known as <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, where Prime Minister
<PERSON>Arthur Robinson</PERSON> was being held hostage by black Moslem rebels.
   But in many parts of the city, no police were visible. Some
people kept an eye out for police while friends looted stores.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, a witness in the <LOCATION>Picadilly</LOCATION> area of eastern
<LOCATION>Port-of-Spain</LOCATION> said about 50 policemen fired shots into the air to
stop the looters. But people ignored them and continued to plunder
stores.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ Moslem extremists who stormed
into <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> firing automatic weapons held the prime minister
and other officials hostage <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s archbishop said
the rebels had wired the captives with explosives.
   The rebels said they had overthrown the government in the attack
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, but Education Minister <PERSON>Clive Pantin</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
that the government had not fallen and was in control of the
situation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> said several people were wounded, and a news
report said three people were killed.
   After bursting into the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>,
the rebels from the Black Moslem group took Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur
N. Robinson</PERSON> and members of his Cabinet hostage. Some captives were
apparently being held in the <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> building called <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>
and others in a TV station.
   Archbishop <PERSON>Anthony Pantin</PERSON> said on government radio he talked to
coup leader <PERSON>Abu Bakr</PERSON> for 25 minutes <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. He said
<PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> told him the TV building was surrounded by men with guns and
he would detonate the captives and himself if an attack was
launched.
   ``He has informed me that the prime minister and other
parliamentarians in the <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> are wired up with explosives,''
<PERSON>Pantin</PERSON> said.
   Police superintendent <PERSON>Leonard Taylor</PERSON> imposed a curfew until <TIME>1
p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Acting President <PERSON>Joseph Emmanuel Carter</PERSON> declared a
state of emergency <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and put the country's

<TEXT>
<P>
An end to <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s hostage crisis drew tantalizingly close <DATE>Monday</DATE>, but 
negotiations collapsed at the 11th hour as renewed gunfire was heard at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building, where the prime minister of this twin-island nation and 
about 45 other people are being held captive. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials had called an <TIME>evening</TIME> news conference to announce the 
imminent release of the hostages and freedom for their black Muslim captors, 
but as the conference began an embarrassed official declared: "We came here 
expecting to give you word of an agreement, but as of now we cannot." 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to square one," conceded Maj. <PERSON>Dave Williams</PERSON>, a spokesman for the 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> spoke, there was a prolonged burst of gunfire from the vicinity of 
<ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building where wounded Prime Minister <PERSON>A. N. R. 
Robinson</PERSON> has been held by rebellious Muslims since <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. Also being 
held are Cabinet ministers, members of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and others. 
</P>
<P>
Later, some wire services reported that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and the chief negotiator for 
the Muslim extremists said they had reached agreement to end the standoff. But 
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> denied that an agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfight broke out after negotiations already had become snagged over a 
demand by rebels in <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> to take their loaded weapons with them into 
officially approved sanctuary at their nine-acre religious enclave in <LOCATION>Mucurapo</LOCATION>, 
north of Port of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In a confused series of announcements, government spokesmen <DATE>Monday</DATE> first 
estimated the number of hostages at up to 100, then scaled the number back to 
60 to 80, and finally, late <DATE>Monday</DATE>, issued what they called a "firm figure" of 
41. 
</P>
<P>
The government's chief information officer, <PERSON>Gregory Shaw</PERSON>, said there are 25 
hostages in the television building and 16 at <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> hostages 
number eight government ministers, including <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, six other members of 
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, the former ambassador to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and a top civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
As for hostage takers, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said they are believed to number about 45 in 
<ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> and 75 in the television complex, where a prolonged gun battle 
involving rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and automatic weapons erupted at 
mid-morning <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The morning clash occurred when some of the hostage takers attempted to shoot 
their way out of the television annex building and were driven back inside by 
troops who have surrounded both hostage sites, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no explanation of the renewed gunfire around <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, which occurred 
shortly before the beginning of a 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. But the 
occurrence of two armed clashes at a time when the government felt it was 
making progress in negotiations for the release of the hostages suggested a 
pessimistic outlook, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it remained uncertain whether negotiations with the rebels, which began 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, were still in progress <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Government spokesman <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION>, said 
only that "up to this time (<TIME>7 p.m. Monday local time</TIME>), the government has not 
agreed to demands of the group that have been holding the prime minister and 
his colleagues and other persons at gunpoint since they burst into Parliament 
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw stressed several times that "intensive efforts are continuing to ensure 
the safety" of the hostages. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Knolly Clarke</PERSON>, an Anglican clergyman who talked to <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> 
by telephone <DATE>Monday</DATE>, reported that the prime minister told him he would be the 
last to leave <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION>, only after all the other hostages were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> had been shot in both feet but was reported in 
stable condition and under treatment by <PERSON>Dr. Emmanuel Hosein</PERSON>, the health 
minister and a fellow hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Although some pillaging of stores and shopping centers continued <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Port 
of Spain</LOCATION> and its environs appeared calm. Officials clamped a 24-hour curfew on 
the capital's center, where the hostage sites are located, and a 6 p.m.-to-noon 
curfew on the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts from the one radio station still operating stressed that "security 
personnel have shoot-on-sight instructions" for dealing with looters, who 
already have plundered an estimated <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> worth of goods. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of casualties remained uncertain, but a local newspaper, the 
Express, said city hospitals reported 314 persons treated for injuries. A total 
of 169 required surgery, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams minimized casualties in the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>, saying only that three 
soldiers had been hit, none seriously, by gunfire. He said he believed six of 
the hostage takers, all members of the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> al Muslimeen black Muslim group, 
had been killed. Unofficial estimates of the number dead in <LOCATION>Port of Spain</LOCATION> ran 
as high as 100. 
</P>
<P>
The black Muslim group, long a focus of concern to the government because of 
what it perceived as the organization's tendency toward violence, is itself 
showing signs of schism, <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams cited the attempted breakout at the television complex at a time when 
the <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> hostage takers appeared to be in agreement with the government as 
evidence of what he called "some degree of splintering in the ranks of the 
hostage takers." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> group appeared to have broken ranks with the television 
group when they began demanding the right to keep their arms -- the demand that 
caused the hoped-for agreement to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, as outlined by the government spokesman, the television 
complex and <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> captors would be granted amnesty and be allowed to return 
in stages to their Islamic religious commune, itself a source of longstanding 
conflict with the government. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said the first step would be release of the television hostages, who 
would be taken to the Trinidadian army's Camp <PERSON>Ogden</PERSON> for physical and 
psychiatric examination. Their captors would then be freed to return unarmed to 
their commune. Next, the hostages in <ORGANIZATION>Red House</ORGANIZATION> would be released in the same 
fashion and their captors freed to go back to the Muslim enclave in <LOCATION>Mucurapo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the failed agreement included any conditions requiring the resignation 
of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> and appointment of an interim government including Muslim leader 
<PERSON>Yasin abu Bakr</PERSON>, the spokesmen said they were "not aware of any such condition 
being on the table." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a clear account of events from the government or local news 
outlets, rumors abounded. Among them was a report that a battalion of troops 
from the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaica Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> had been flown in from <LOCATION>Kingston</LOCATION> to assist local 
forces in policing the capital, as well as a rumor that some American troops 
had landed. 
</P>
<P>
Both were denied by Col. <PERSON>Ralph Brown</PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Tobago 
Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>. "We've got things under control, and we don't need any help," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>, has been the center of controversy since <DATE>1985</DATE>, when he 
founded the black Muslim group on the premise that "the nation was corrupt in 
the hands of evil men," said the Express newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Following a stint in jail for contempt of court, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and formed 
close ties to that country's radical leader, Col. <PERSON>Moammar Kadafi</PERSON>. Following his 
return to the islands, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> was arrested after a police raid uncovered an arms 
cache at the Muslim commune. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy flared again last year when the government charged that his 
group was occupying the commune illegally and sent a crew to demolish some 
buildings there. Last week, just three days before he led the hostage-taking 
raid on the television complex and <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> building, <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> lost a high-court 
test to claim rights to the land. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesmen both emphasized that 
the estimated 6,000 American citizens in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, most of them 
tourists, appeared to be in no immediate danger. However, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> 
issued an advisory suggesting that Americans on the island remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Violence in the country appears to be restricted to the capital, <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> 
Deputy Press Secretary <PERSON>Steve Hart</PERSON> noted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to comment on reports that American naval vessels were in the 
vicinity of the islands, although the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> routinely keeps several ships in a 
large naval training area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials noted the ties between <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and the group holding the 
hostages, but added that no evidence exists of Libyan involvement in the 
current attack. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer <PERSON>David Lauter</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 Muslims make the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> their home. But most are East Indians 
who disdain the radical politics of black Muslims such as those holding 
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>'s government hostage. Many East Indians consider black Muslims to be 
political opportunists, inspired more by the black power movement than by 
traditional Islam. <PERSON>Stokely Carmichael</PERSON>, the black power advocate of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> in 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, was born in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. Prominent Muslims among the region's 
political leaders include President <PERSON>Noor Hassanali</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Prime 
Minister Hamilton Green</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Guyana</LOCATION>. The first Muslims came to the region to work 
in the sugar cane fields in the <DATE>1700s</DATE>. Now, domed mosques can be found on a 
dozen <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> (AP) _ A <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> couple who decided to
celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their first foreign
vacation haven't gotten the romantic island getaway they planned.
   ``I feel like I've been a hostage here,'' grumbled <PERSON>Melvin Hazel</PERSON>
on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``We're eating a good meal and no one's pointing any guns at
me,'' said his wife, <PERSON>Darlene</PERSON>, confiding: ``I have a lot of sense of
adventure.''
   They're among some two dozen Americans still stranded on this
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island where Moslem extremists stormed Parliament and the
state television building on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, seizing the prime minister and
other officials.
   Some of the Americans have since left the island on one of a few
packed flights by regional carriers. But most have been unable to
leave.
   ``Doesn't the American government have any responsibility for
us? They've shown no intention of helping us,'' said <PERSON>Nancy Schnair</PERSON>,
here with husband <PERSON>Howard Schnair</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> on a planned combined
business-vacation trip.
   <PERSON>Lucy Hall</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said American visitors to
the island were being contacted and assured their government was
concerned about them.
   ``We can't help them because we don't run any airlines,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Hall</PERSON> said of American requests for help getting off <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. She
said some 2,100 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens, the great majority of them
residents, are on the islands.
   ``I just want to be somewhere else,'' said <PERSON>Chris Bigalkie</PERSON>, here
on business as regional vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Drew Industrial Division</ORGANIZATION>.
``We don't have anything like this in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, his
hometown).''
   The Schnairs, another couple on a combined business-pleasure
trip _ <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joyce Beckwith</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> _ and the Hazels of
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> spent much of <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> sitting on the airy veranda of
the <ORGANIZATION>Hilton Hotel</ORGANIZATION> overlooking this capital city.
   They heard the volleys of gunfire and explosions and saw fire
erupt from the state television complex, where rebels were holding
hostages.
   Hazel, who works in construction, said he and his wife, with
three children in their 20s, wanted to celebrate their 30th
anniversary in style. They had once met some Trinidadians who sang
the praises of their island, and they thought this would be the
perfect place for a long-delayed second honeymoon.
   They arrived <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and spent <DATE>Friday</DATE> sightseeing. But when
their taxi driver returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> to take them to dinner at
a seafood restaurant as they requested, he advised them not to go
downtown because of the violence.
   They scrubbed plans to visit sister island <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, and now are
only anxious to go home.
   ``They really messed it up for us,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Hazel</PERSON>.

<FP=106> [Article by <ORGANIZATION>Ria Taitt</ORGANIZATION>] </F>
  [Text]Nation Security Minister <PERSON>Russell Huggins</PERSON> has 
estimated the annual value of the illegal drug trade at "well 
over <MONEY>one billion dollars</MONEY>." 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> was speaking at a news conference in the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament 
Committee Room</ORGANIZATION> yesterday just prior to yesterday's sitting of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. The media conference was called to answer 
journalists' queries arising from the Bill to amend the 
Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> said the proposed amendments would allow <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> 
and 
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> to ratify the <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> Convention. This, he added, would 
give this country greater access to funding for the fight 
against the drug trade from donor countries such as the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
  He said the passage of this legislation signals to the 
international community that "we are serious." 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> said one of the more important features of the Bill 
was its provisions relating to money-laundering, which, he said, 
could destroy the financial system of a country. 
  "One has to understand dealings in drugs take place in cash. 
So you have a lot of cash to clean. Cash can be cleaned by 
buying a boat from someone for <MONEY>$90,000</MONEY>. You pay in cash and then 
you sell it back for <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY>. You are prepared to take the 
<MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> loss because you now have <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> certified (clean) 
money." 
  He cited the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as an example of a case where there has 
been a proliferation of jewelry stores and "when you go down 
inside them they don't have a piece of jewelry; they are simply 
being used as fronts." 
  He said that in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> drug lords had used the 
importation of potatoes as a laundering device. 
  He said laundering could occur in any establishment: "Where 
you had the import of used cars, that is another method of doing 
it. 
  You bring down cars and you pay more for them and sell them 
for less. That is one of the ways in which it is done. Another 
way is to buy up postal orders every month." 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> said one of the biggest busts in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, "US <MONEY>$6 
billion</MONEY> in cash," had been organised in this way. "A massive 
laundering operation which took four years to bust and with all 
the resources they have. 
  I mention this simply to let you know that you shouldn't 
look for miracles from our people. We are trying to put a unit 
together and are having some hiccups with the Organised Crime 
and Narcotics Unit." 
  But he stressed that there were dedicated people working on 
it, adding that it took time to really bust a drug operation. 
"Time and a lot of ground work. A drug lord does not bring you 
into his trust overnight," he said. 
  "He said between <DATE>November 1993</DATE> and this year, the <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> authorities had participated in the seizure of 200 
kilos of cocaine shipped from <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. The intelligence given 
for its seizure came from here," he said. 
  Stressing that in order to hurt the drug-trafficker one had 
to deal with money-laundering, <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> pointed to some of the 
shortcomings of the original legislation, which, he said, did 
not go far enough. 
  Before now, he said, it was not an offence for a 
drug-trafficker to launder his own proceeds, though it was an 
offence for someone to help him. 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> said the proposed legislation, apart from addressing 
this, would also limit the number of places where the 
drug-trafficker could hide his assets because the Bill allowed 
for the recognition and enforcement. 
  The Bill was passed unanimously at <TIME>9:45 p.m.</TIME>

   The Americas:
   Trinidad Fiasco Spotlights Libya's Terror Network

   When the 112 AK-47-toting members of the Jamaat al
Muslimeen, or People of Islam, seized the Parliament of
Trinidad and Tobago along with the prime minister and 40
other hostages -- allegedly to rid Trinidad of a corrupt and
unpopular government -- news accounts portrayed it as an act
of terrorism by a fringe Moslem fundamentalist group.
Subsequent reports revealed that the group received training
in Libya and that Yasin Abu Bakr, the group's leader,
acknowledged traveling to Libya and called Col. Moammar
Gadhafi "our friend." The U.S. State Department, though
critical of Libya's involvement, says no apparent direct link
exists between the terrorists and Libya.
   That is surprising. A 1986 State Department report charged
that "Libya has also actively recruited members of . . .
leftist leaders from Antigua, Barbados, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the French
Departments {who are} invited to Libya for seminars at which
they are urged to undertake violent action rather than
peacefully participate in the political process." The report
concluded that "Libyan activities should be a matter of
serious concern for the entire hemisphere." Since then,
Libyan involvement in the Caribbean has continued if not
increased. Moreover, it appears Col. Gadhafi has enlisted
terrorist groups from the Middle East and Europe with close
ties to Libya.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>April 1987</DATE>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> expelled a Libyan diplomat "for
allegedly being involved in activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status" -- a euphemism for spying or terrorism.
The "diplomat," <PERSON>Abdul Salim Ashur</PERSON>, was later arrested. In his
possession authorities found evidence of a "huge terrorist
operation directed against the Lesser Antilles": read
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Arab Press Service</ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON>Mr. Ashur</PERSON>'s
plans called for <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s financing and arming of radical
groups in <ORGANIZATION>French Guiana</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and, yes,
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> (as well as other <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands).
   Throughout the region, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> has set up "People's Bureaus"
and Islamic schools and centers that act as front
organizations to conceal <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s active recruitment and
financing of regional subversives. Since <DATE>1986</DATE>, delegates from
leftist Caribbean organizations have attended the
"International Center for Combating Imperialism" conference
held every year in <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION>. Through these instruments, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>
has succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with a
well-trained cadre of terrorists.
   Two months ago, 15 pro-Libyan terrorists were indicted in
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> for various terrorist acts, including three
bombings of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> offices in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> between <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>.
The group, the <ORGANIZATION>Santamaria Patriotic Organization</ORGANIZATION>, was formed
in <DATE>1986</DATE> following the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>. One of
the terrorists, <PERSON>Domingo Solis Solis</PERSON>, was reported to have
joined the El Salvadoran communist <ORGANIZATION>FMLN</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in their
military offensive last <DATE>November</DATE>.
   Middle Eastern radicals operate in <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> as well.
In <DATE>May 1987</DATE>, Venezuelan authorities arrested <PERSON>Mahmoud Abed
Atta</PERSON>, reportedly a senior agent of terrorist <PERSON>Abu Nidal</PERSON>, and
had him deported. Another man with reported <PERSON>Abu Nidal</PERSON> links,
<PERSON>Hussein Bouzildi</PERSON> was arrested by Peruvian authorities two
months after the <ORGANIZATION>Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement</ORGANIZATION> bombed a
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Information Service Center</ORGANIZATION> to mark the anniversary of
the <DATE>April 1986</DATE> U.S. bombing of <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION>.
   Besides Tupac Amaru, other Latin American radical groups
receive Libyan support, including <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>'s Alfaro Lives,
Carajo], <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s 19th of <ORGANIZATION>April Movement</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s
Movement of the Revolutionary Left. All have sent guerrillas
to training camps in <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and received financial support
from Col. <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON>.
   Perhaps the most disturbing terrorist event in the
hemisphere with possible Libyan connections is the bombing by
the <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine cartel of a Colombian Avianca plane <DATE>last
November</DATE> in which 107 people were killed. Though no evidence
directly implicates <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, major aspects of the case suggest
an indirect role.
   <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION> informed Colombian authorities that guerrillas of
the Basque separatist group, ETA, carried out the bombing for
the <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cartel. The subsequent investigation revealed
the guerrillas used Semtex, a Czechoslovakian-made explosive
that cannot be detected by airport security checkpoints. The
<ORGANIZATION>ETA</ORGANIZATION> receives financial support from <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and many of its
members go there for training. Moreover, <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>'s
President <PERSON>Vaclav Havel</PERSON> disclosed in <DATE>March</DATE> that the previous
communist government sold <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> 1,000 tons of Semtex. Quoting
from government sources, the Bogota-based newspaper <PERSON>El
Tiempo</PERSON>, reported that "the same detonator was used to blow up
the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> plane on a flight from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1988</DATE>." <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> has been directly linked to
that bombing as well.
   The coup attempt in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> is the tip of the iceberg.
The social dislocation and resentment accompanying economic
restructuring have weakened already fragile Caribbean
democracies and simultaneously created an unstable political
environment susceptible to exploitation by radical groups. We
should expect more terrorism traced backed to <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Alleged Arms Supplier For Trinidad Revolt Arrested Here</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the arsenal used in a failed coup attempt
in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> by Moslem extremists was purchased at gun shows and
shops throughout <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION>, says a complaint against the
alleged chief supplier.
   <PERSON>Louis Haneef</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pompano Beach</LOCATION> was arrested early <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during
a raid on his home, said federal agents.
   The federal complaint against <PERSON>Haneef</PERSON> also includes a warrant for
the leader of the revolt, <PERSON>Yasin Abu Bakr</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>
policeman who took the island nation's prime minister prisoner for
six days in <DATE>July</DATE> before surrendering.
   Of the 135 weapons confiscated in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> after the revolt
collapsed, 105 were traced to purchases made in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Haneef</PERSON>,
said <PERSON>Joe Vince</PERSON>, assistant special agent in charge of the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>
office of the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Alcohol</ORGANIZATION>, Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``He was supplying the weapons that were used in the
insurrection - there is no question about it,'' the agent said.
   The arrest shows the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will not tolerate gun
smuggling, said <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Dexter Lehtinen</PERSON>.
   ``We are no longer going to allow <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION> to be used as a
Mecca for people to purchase weapons to be used for narcotics
traffickers ... or people planning rebellions anywhere in the
<LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> or in the Americas,'' <PERSON>Lehtinen</PERSON> said.
   Haneef bought at least 200 assault rifles and other firearms and
the <ORGANIZATION>ATF</ORGANIZATION> is seeking the missing guns, said <PERSON>Vince</PERSON>. He also purchased
250,000 rounds of ammunition, along with electronic equipment that
included hand-held radios.
   One key question was where <PERSON>Haneef</PERSON> obtained the approximately
<MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> in <MONEY>$100</MONEY> bills he used to buy the weapons in <LOCATION>Dade</LOCATION> and
Broward county gun shows and weapons shops, <PERSON>Vince</PERSON> said.
   Trinidad officials said <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> and many of his men had visited
<LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and received training and money there, although they have
found no evidence <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON> was behind the coup attempt.
   Haneef's money was drawn on a bank in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> nation of
<LOCATION>Bahrain</LOCATION>, but its original source was still part of the
investigation, he said.
   The federal complaint, along with <PERSON>Haneef</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>, names <PERSON>Billaal
Abdullah</PERSON>, another leader of the revolt, and <PERSON>Riad Ali</PERSON>, both of whom
are also imprisoned in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>.
   Haneef was originally from <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, and changed his name from
<PERSON>Louis Cole</PERSON> when he became a Moslem, <PERSON>Vince</PERSON> said. He added that the
complaint would eventually be presented to a grand jury for
indictments.
   The men are accused of gun control and arms export violations,
said <PERSON>Vince</PERSON>.
   The investigation began in <DATE>October 1989</DATE> when a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> police
officer became suspicious of large gun purchases <PERSON>Haneef</PERSON> made at a
weapons show, according to an affidavit by <ORGANIZATION>ATF</ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON>Thomas Bailey</PERSON>.
   Haneef was interviewed and said the weapons were for a gun club,
but the agency began surveillance. He ultimately bought about 200
weapons, including AK-47 and Ruger Mini-14 assault rifles,
shotguns, M-1 carbines and large-caliber pistols.
   The weapons and ammunition were allegedly smuggled out of the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> aboard a freighter, hidden in hollowed-out
wall boards, <PERSON>Vince</PERSON> said. He said investigators had obtained a
warrant in hopes of placing an electronic tracer on the shipment,
but it had left port before they got there.
   The rebellion in <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> broke out in <DATE>July</DATE> when <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON>'s forces
seized the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament House</ORGANIZATION> and state television, holding hostages
including Prime Minister <PERSON>Arthur N.R. Robinson</PERSON> and other government
leaders.
   They demanded <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s resignation, new elections and amnesty,
but eventually surrendered on the sixth day of the crisis. Bakr and
other revolt leaders are now in jail facing treason, murder and
other charges.
   <PERSON>Vince</PERSON> said he did not expect <PERSON>Bakr</PERSON> to be extradited to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, but
said the warrants would remain in force in any case.

<FP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Wesley Gibbings</PERSON>: "Dollar Laundering Law Coming, </F>
Says Huggins"] 
  [Text] Government is considering the introduction of 
banking regulations which will make deposit declarations for 
large sums of money mandatory. 
  National Security Minister <PERSON>Russel Huggins</PERSON> made the 
revelation 
yesterday, saying the measure would be one instrument in the 
campaign against money laundering. 
  The matter arose while <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> steered a motion on the 
granting of diplomatic immunity to the <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Financial 
Action Task Force</ORGANIZATION> through the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. 
  <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> was responding to a query from Opposition Senator 
<PERSON>Wade Mark</PERSON> who said commercial banks should not be left on their 
own to monitor a situation that provided vital clues to the 
scale of money laundering activities in the country. 
  "Don't leave it up to commercial banks," <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> said. "One 
important area of money laundering is the commercial banking 
sector." 
  Mark described the current arrangement as a "gentleman's 
agreement." Bankers have however reported some success with the 
system and a number of depositors, according to banking sources, 
have reportedly been turned away as a result. <PERSON>Huggins</PERSON> said 
regulations would be taken to Parliament on the matter "soon." 
  He also defended the country's invitation to the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> 
to set up office here, saying it offered a range of resources to 
enable this country to battle money laundering more effectively. 
  He told Senators that the body was not a policing agency and 
that it was established to offer technical advice and expertise 
to counter the incidence of money laundering in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> 
and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION>. 
  Independent <PERSON>Senator Martin Daly</PERSON> expressed scepticism about 
the institution and said a trial period of two years should be 
built into the motion granting it diplomatic immunities and 
privileges. He however refused to pursue the amendment when the 
vote was taken. 
  Huggins also addressed fears by <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> that the industrial 
relations climate of certain regional institutions left much to 
be desired. 
  The Opposition Senator contended that the managers of some 
institutions often hid under the cover of diplomatic immunity in 
order to commit serious breaches of the constitutional rights of 
workers. 
  Huggins however said the terms of such diplomatic 
arrangements were dictated by international conventions and 
practices. The motion was passed unanimously. Last <DATE>Friday</DATE>, it 
gained similar consent from the <ORGANIZATION>Lower House</ORGANIZATION>.
