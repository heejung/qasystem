   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third year running, <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON> led <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' list of
private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as
it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seibu Railway Group</ORGANIZATION>, has a personal net
worth of at least <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY>, over <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY> less than estimated
last <DATE>summer</DATE> due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major
currencies, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The estimate was far greater than that made by Fortune magazine
in its <DATE>September 1988</DATE> ranking of those it considered the world's
richest people _ which valued <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s holdings at a mere <MONEY>$2.8
billion</MONEY>.
   In last year's list, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s net worth was
<MONEY>$18.9 billion</MONEY>.
   The magazine reports in its <DATE>July 24</DATE> issue that <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, has an estimated net worth of <MONEY>$14.2 billion</MONEY>. In last
year's survey, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> placed Mori's worth at about <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>.
   The third-richest on the list was American <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON>,
founder of the third largest retailer in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart
Stores Inc</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> and his family are worth an estimated <MONEY>$8.7
billion</MONEY>, up from <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' <DATE>1988</DATE> estimate of <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>.
   After the Waltons came <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers, owners of the
<ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>, were: <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>,
candy, real estate; <PERSON>Hirotomo Takei</PERSON> and family, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, publishing,
real estate; <PERSON>Kitaro Watanabe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, real estate, hotels; <PERSON>Haruhiko
Yoshimoto</PERSON> and family, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, real estate; <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gad Rausing</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, liquids packaging; and <PERSON>Eitaro Itoyama</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, land.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth over <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ranked second,
with 41, and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the <DATE>1988</DATE>
survey, with 47 individuals, followed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s 32 and <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION>'s 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich were people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list including
<PERSON>Pablo Escobar Gaviria</PERSON>, leader of the notorious <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> family, worth more
than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>, and <PERSON>Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha</PERSON>, with more than <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY>.
   In compiling its list, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> does not consider royal families
and heads of state in compiling its list of wealthy people and
individuals ``because their wealth derives more from political
heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal fortunes, not
capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>
or <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Kim Il Sung</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Tsutsumi Heads Forbes List of Billionaires for Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON> is a bit poorer than he was
last year _ make that less wealthy _ but the Japanese railroad
magnate still ranks as the world's richest person, according to
Forbes magazine.
   Tsutsumi, head of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Seibu Railway Group</ORGANIZATION>, has a personal
net worth of at least <MONEY>$18.9 billion</MONEY>, making him the world's richest
person for the second straight year, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The magazine, in a report on the richest people outside the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s fortune at approximately <MONEY>$20
billion</MONEY> last fall in its first survey of the world's richest people.
   The story appears in the magazine's <DATE>July 25</DATE> issue.
   The designation for <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> again puts Forbes at odds with
Fortune magazine. In its compilation of the world's billionaires
last <DATE>October</DATE>, Fortune estimated <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON>'s holdings in railroads,
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller _ but still
substantial _ <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>.
   The second richest person on <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' list is also Japanese.
<PERSON>Taikichiro Mori</PERSON>, a former economics professor who owns 68 office
buildings in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, is worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>, the magazine estimated.
In the previous survey, <PERSON>Mori</PERSON>'s fortune was put at <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY>.
   Following the two Japanese are the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>,
who have built a <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> fortune in real estate, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, a South Korean with interests in candy making,
hotels and real estate, is ranked No. 4 (<MONEY>$8 billion-plus</MONEY>), and
<PERSON>Kenneth Cole Irving</PERSON>, a Canadian with interests in oil distribution,
paper and land, is No. 5 (<MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>).
   The survey identifies 119 non-American individuals or families
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY>, up from 90 in the previous list.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still accounts for more billionaires than any
other country, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> noted. The magazine said at least 47 American
individuals and 20 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> families are worth more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>,
compared with 32 individuals and families in second-place <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and
16 in third-ranked <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>.
   The leading American billionaire is <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, the head of
major retailer <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores</ORGANIZATION>, who ranks seventh worldwide with a
net worth of <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> estimates.
   Not all the fortunes listed in <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>' list were amassed in a
respectable way.
   Three of them belong to people the magazine identified as
Colombian drug dealers, two individuals and one family, who are all
part of the notorious <LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine cartel.
   Two of the Colombian cocaine fortunes, those of <PERSON>Pablo Escobar
Gaviria</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> family, are each more than <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>
said. It estimated the third, amassed by <PERSON>Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha</PERSON>,
at between <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> and <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>.

   A Japanese developer again topped a list of the
world's richest people, but the annual tally has one conspicuous
deletion this year: <PERSON>Donald J. Trump</PERSON>.
   Despite the financial troubles of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer, the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> continues to contain the world's largest number of
billionaires _ 62 _ according to estimates by Forbes magazine. In
addition, there are 37 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> families with fortunes over <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>,
<ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> says in its <DATE>July 23</DATE> issue.
   Forbes, in estimates released <DATE>Monday</DATE>, says the world's
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was <PERSON>Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, whose railroad and real estate empire includes
golf courses, ski resorts and hotels. Forbes estimated his net
worth at <MONEY>$16 billion</MONEY>, up about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> from last year.
   That estimate was far greater than that of rival business
magazine Fortune, which put Tsutsumi's net worth at <MONEY>$3.1 billion</MONEY>
last <DATE>September</DATE>.
   Fortune said the world's richest person is the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>,
at <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>. Forbes excludes heads of state from consideration.
   Following the 56-year-old <PERSON>Tsutsumi</PERSON> on the Forbes list was
Japanese developer <PERSON>Taikichiro Mori</PERSON>, a former economics professor
who now owns 78 office buildings. Forbes put Mori's net worth at
<MONEY>$14.6 billion</MONEY>.
   Ranked third was the family of <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>,
the third-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>retail chain. Forbes estimates that the
Waltons, who also were third-ranked last year, are worth <MONEY>$13.3
billion</MONEY>, up from <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   America's du <PERSON>Pont</PERSON> family was fourth, with a net worth estimated
at <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY>. They were followed by <PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gad Rausing</PERSON>, two
Swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth <MONEY>$9.6 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Kitaro Watanabe</PERSON>, a Japanese real estate owner, was sixth at <MONEY>$9.2
billion</MONEY>. He was followed by <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers, owners of
the <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION> real estate company, at <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Kenkichi Nakajima</PERSON> and his family, founder of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s largest
maker of pachinko machines, a gambling game similar to pinball,
were eighth at <MONEY>$8.4 billion</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Shin Kyuk-ho</PERSON>, who owns a candy and real estate
empire, was ninth at <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>; and <PERSON>Forrest E. Mars</PERSON>
and family of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, of Mars candy fame, were 10th at
an estimated <MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY>.
   Other American families with net worth exceeding <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>
included the <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> and Cox families, which derive their
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting; the Bass family of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>; the <PERSON>Mellon</PERSON> family of banking fame; the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> family,
whose wealth comes from <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON>, founder
of the computer software company <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>John Werner Kluge</PERSON> remained the richest American individual,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>, founder of the media company
<ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION>, has an estimated net worth of <MONEY>$5.2 billion</MONEY>, placing him
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the Newhouses.
   As for <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> put his net worth last year at <MONEY>$1.7
billion</MONEY>, but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real
estate and airline empire plummeted. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the magazine said he
was worth about a half <MONEY>a billion dollars</MONEY>. Some sources peg it even
lower.
   Forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this year's list
was the number of wealthy Germans. The magazine identified 38 West
German billionaire families _ far more per capita than in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> or
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The list includes 40 Japanese and 99 American individuals or
families with a net worth over <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   Forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or
families worldwide, up from 226 last year. The compilation is based
on recent stock valuations, comparable real estate valuations and
currency exchange rates, among other factors.
   The magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families
and heads of state because their wealth ``derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort.''
   But it doesn't exclude drug dealers. Among the billionaires it
lists are <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Pablo Escobar Gaviria</PERSON>, the head of the
<LOCATION>Medellin</LOCATION> cocaine cartel, at about <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>, and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON>
family, at about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>.

   The legion of American billionaires has
broadened to include 51 people, despite the <DATE>1987</DATE> stock market crash
that realigned the fortunes of many of the nation's wealthiest.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of
the ultra-affluent totaled <MONEY>$84.8 billion</MONEY> _ nearly <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> more
than the combined wealth of <DATE>last year</DATE>'s 49 billionaires.
   The other 349 people who constitute <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' list of the 400
richest Americans were worth about <MONEY>$135.2 billion</MONEY>.The average
fortune is <MONEY>$551 million</MONEY>, up <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> from last year.
   Topping the list released <DATE>Monday</DATE> is 70-year-old <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, who
held the No. 1 spot for the fourth straight year even though his
net worth shrank by <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> following the crash.
   <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, head of the Arkansas-based <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> discount store
empire, scoffs at his <MONEY>$6.7 billion</MONEY> fortune. He calls it ``just
paper _ all I own is a pickup truck and a little <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stock.''
   <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> is the world's fifth-richest person after
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON>, worth <MONEY>$18.9 billion</MONEY>; <ORGANIZATION>Taikichiro Mori</ORGANIZATION>,
<MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>; and <PERSON>Haruhiko Yoshimoto</PERSON>, <MONEY>$7.8 billion</MONEY>; and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s
<PERSON>Kenneth Cole Irving</PERSON>, <MONEY>$8 billion</MONEY>.
   But last year's <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE> financial market crash slashed fortunes
and caused 22 former members to be dropped from the list because
their fortunes slipped below <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' <MONEY>$225 million</MONEY> cutoff.
   The list appears in the <DATE>Oct. 24</DATE> edition of <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION> and is based
on holdings as of <DATE>Aug. 30</DATE>.

Newhouse Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Donald Newhouse</PERSON>, <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY> each; and <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>
industrialist <PERSON>Henry Lea Hillman</PERSON>, <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY>.
   Underscoring the adage that the more you have, the more you can
lose, billionaires were among those hit hard by the crash.Among the
big losers were <PERSON>David Packard</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Hewlett-Packard</ORGANIZATION>, media
magnate <PERSON>Keith Rupert Murdoch</PERSON> and retailer <PERSON>Leslie Wexner</PERSON>, each of
whom lost up to <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of their fortunes.
   Among those new to the billionaire club are flamboyant <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
real estate developer <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>, who claims a net worth of <MONEY>$3.47
billion</MONEY>, though <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' estimate is in the <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> range.
   Joining Trump as list rookies are: <PERSON>Sumner Murray Redstone</PERSON>, who
boosted his balance sheet with the takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$1.4
billion</MONEY>; press-shy <PERSON>Charles Feeney</PERSON>, who runs Duty-Free Shoppers at
airports, <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Charles Sammons</PERSON>, head of the privately held
<ORGANIZATION>Sammons Enterprises</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 15th largest cable TV operator,
<MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Charles de Ganahl Koch</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Hamilton Koch</PERSON>,
brothers involved in oil services, <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY> each, and <PERSON>Ronald O.
Perelman</PERSON>, takeover strategist and head of <ORGANIZATION>Revlon</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>.
   Four businessmen returned to the ranks of multimillionaire when
their fortunes sank below <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>: <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Tisch</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Loews Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, each estimated at <MONEY>$850 million</MONEY>; <PERSON>Milton Petrie</PERSON>, the
philanthropist and head of <ORGANIZATION>Petrie Stores</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$750 million</MONEY>; and
financier <PERSON>Carl Lindner II</PERSON>, <MONEY>$950 million</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>William Henry Gates III</PERSON>, who dropped out of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and founded
the <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> software company, remained the youngest self-made
billionaire at age 32. His net worth is estimated at <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY>.
   The oldest person new to the list is <PERSON>Mansfield Freeman</PERSON>, who
holds a stake in <ORGANIZATION>American International Group</ORGANIZATION>. With a fortune of
<MONEY>$240 million</MONEY>, he made the list for the first time at age 93.
   Among the 52 who disappeared from the list, 22 vanished because

   Charity began at home for <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stores
founder <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, who ended a four-year reign as Forbes
magazine's richest American by sharing his <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> fortune with
his four children.
   <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Co</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>John Werner Kluge</PERSON>, with an estimated net
worth of <MONEY>$5.2 billion</MONEY>, climbed into first place on <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' annual
list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.
   The prototypical member of <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old
male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net
worth of <MONEY>$672 million</MONEY> last year, more than the gross national
product of <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   The compilation contains 346 men and 54 women. Of those, 159
inherited their wealth. Eight states lack a resident on the list.
   Among alma mater represented, <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> educated 22 of the richest,
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> 17 and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> 12; the 45 with
master's degrees in business had an average net worth of <MONEY>$895
million</MONEY>, while the 10 high-school dropouts had an average of <MONEY>$854
million</MONEY>.
   Overall, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>' richest are worth an estimated total of about
<MONEY>$269 billion</MONEY>, up nearly <MONEY>$50 billion</MONEY> from <DATE>last year</DATE>, a <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>
increase that substantially outpaced last year's <PERCENT>4.4 percent</PERCENT>
inflation rate.
   That total wealth would come just short of bailing out te
nation's failed savings and loans over the <DATE>next 30 years</DATE>, the cost
of which was estimated by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$285 billion</MONEY>.
   The list, released <DATE>Monday</DATE>, appears in the <DATE>Oct. 23</DATE> issue of
<LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION> and is based on estimated holdings as of <DATE>Sept. 8</DATE>.
   At the pinnacle is <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>, 75, of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, whose
holdings rose an estimated <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> from the previous year thanks
to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular
telephones, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that
``klug'' in German means smart.
   <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, who milked cows during the
Depression to support his family, split his <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> and other
assets equally with his four children. While the family's total
holdings increased from <MONEY>$6.7 bilion</MONEY>, the individual family members
tied for 20th on the list, each at <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY>.
   Moving up to second from 12th place is investor <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>,
59, of <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, the head of <PERSON>Berkshire Hathaway</PERSON>, whose stock
market-based fortune nearly doubled, to <MONEY>$4.2 billion</MONEY>. Behind him is
<PERSON>Sumner M. Redstone</PERSON>, head of moviehouse operator <ORGANIZATION>National Amusements
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and TV-cable giant <ORGANIZATION>Viacom</ORGANIZATION>, with <MONEY>$2.88 billion</MONEY>.
   The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum
net worth to make the list rose to <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$225 million</MONEY>.
   America has more billionaires than any other nation _ <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is
second with 41 _ but the richest of the world's rich are foreigners.
   Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private
individual in the world, according to <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>. He is topped by six
Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian publisher <PERSON>Kenneth Roy
Thompson</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON>, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, is worth about <MONEY>$15 billion</MONEY>, making him the
richest, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.
   Eighteen new billionaires joined the Forbes American list,
including <PERSON>Laurence</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Tisch</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Loews Corp.</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY>
apiece, entertainment mogul <PERSON>Kirk Kerkorian</PERSON> at <MONEY>$1.29 billion</MONEY>,
indicted junk bond financier <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON> at <MONEY>$1.27 billion</MONEY> and
<ORGANIZATION>Trans World Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON>Carl Icahn</PERSON> at <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> also is among the individual standouts, adding <MONEY>$700
million</MONEY> to his empire of hotels, casinos and an airline for a <MONEY>$1.7
billion</MONEY> total.
   For the second straight year, the youngest self-made billionaire
is 33-year-old <PERSON>William Gates</PERSON> III at <MONEY>$1.25 billion</MONEY>. Gates dropped
out of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> to found <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, a computer software company, in
<DATE>1972</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> beer and baseball magnate <PERSON>August Anheuser Busch Jr.</PERSON>,
who died <DATE>Sept. 29</DATE> at age 90, is included on the list with <MONEY>$1.5
billion</MONEY>. Forbes said it compiled its profiles before he died.
   The youngest person on the list is <PERSON>Caroline Marie Getty</PERSON>, 32,
daughter of the late <PERSON>George Getty</PERSON>, with her <MONEY>$330 million</MONEY>
inheritance. The oldest remained 94-year-old <PERSON>Mansfield Freeman</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Greensboro</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vt.</LOCATION>, whose <MONEY>$360 million</MONEY> worth includes a stake in
insurer <ORGANIZATION>American International Group</ORGANIZATION>.
   Among the losers were real estate investor and builder <PERSON>Fred
Trammell Crow</PERSON>, whose net worth, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> estimated, sank to <MONEY>$300
million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$775 million</MONEY>, thanks to softness in commercial real
estate. Penthouse publisher <PERSON>Bob Guccione</PERSON> slipped into something
less comfortable and dropped off the list.
   About <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>, or 82, of those listed live in or near <LOCATION>New

19. Twenty-one people on the list own at least one-third of a major

<HEAD>Wealthy Wal-Mart Founder Just Another Neighbor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER M. FULFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's ranked as the richest man in the
nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>,
a town of about 8,700 people, <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> is just another neighbor.
   ``He's just a part of the community,'' said <PERSON>Curt Loyd</PERSON>, executive
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Bentonville Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. ``He's a neat
person. He calls <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION> home, and that is special to us.''
   <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>
stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again
shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the
world's top billionaires. According to Forbes magazine's <DATE>July 24</DATE>
edition, the <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> family's estimated worth is <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY>, up
from its <DATE>1988</DATE> estimate of <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>.
   ``He is unavailable,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Don Shinkle</PERSON> of the
silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,
based in <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
   <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said he received about 10 calls from reporters <DATE>Monday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers. <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said
news coverage about <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for
comments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman declined to
comment.
   ``He feels any attention to <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> is to the individual and
he prefers attention to <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> (the founder of) the company,''
<PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said.
   ``He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings. It just
puts him in a position he doesn't want to be.''
   But <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal
modesty. Just after the <DATE>1987</DATE> stock market crash, in which <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s
family-owned chunk of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stock lost millions in value, he
quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another
topic that it was only paper. Walton then changed the subject.
   Walton was first listed by <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> as the nation's richest man in
<DATE>October 1985</DATE>. Three years ago, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> also began listing the world's
wealthiest people. Walton made that listing as the richest American
every year since. This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese
businessmen.
   <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> stays busy visiting many of the more than
1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single
five-and-dime at <ORGANIZATION>Rogers</ORGANIZATION> more than two decades ago. He is out of the
office up to four days a week, the spokesman said.
   ``He spends most of his time talking to associates and
customers,'' <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said, ``and he always comes back with many
ideas from them.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> calls its sales help associates instead of employees.
   When <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> first made the Forbes list of richest Americans,
recalled Little Rock investment banker <PERSON>Warren Simpson</PERSON>, calls came in
from all over about the billionaire from the <LOCATION>Ozarks</LOCATION>.
   ``They wanted to know about the stock and the company,'' said
<PERSON>Simpson</PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION>Stephens Inc.</ORGANIZATION> ``You'd think that he'd be
living in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> or LA, not <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. But now people
just accept it.
   ``When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'''
<PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said.

   Being a woman has not made it difficult to govern
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON> says, but it may have caused
some difficulties for her political opponents and Moslem
fundamentalists.
   ``I don't often think of myself as a woman prime minister,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Bhutto</PERSON> said in a televised interview <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with <PERSON>David Frost</PERSON>.
   ``I just think of myself as someone who's leading the government,
who's got a job to do, not an easy one, and who would like to have
the prayers of well-wishers everywhere in completing the task in
strengthening the rule of law and improving the quality of life for
the people of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Bhutto</PERSON>, 35, is the first woman in modern times to lead a
Moslem country and is the world's youngest prime minister.
   ``I think it may be a little difficult for my opponents or the
fundamentalists to have a woman prime minister,'' she said.
   ``Of course, it's different being a woman. There's a greater
formality or distance which must be followed so I try to make the
best of it.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Bhutto</PERSON> won power in <DATE>November</DATE> in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s first free
elections in more than a decade. She arrived in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
for a week's visit.

<TEXT>     The net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans hit <MONEY>$288 billion</MONEY> -- the
highest ever recorded by <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>. The list appears in the magazine's <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE>
issue.;   The recession made ex-moguls of some, mostly in real estate, where
values have dropped and vacancies skyrocketed, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said in a report
released <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. A record 71 billionaires populate the list, up from 66 <DATE>last
year</DATE> and 13 in the magazine's first ranking in <DATE>1982.</DATE>;   Fifty-eight of the 400
are women. The list's average age is 64.;   Amid the recession, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>
undertook something of an apology for wealth in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. The magazine, which
describes itself as a "capitalist tool," said in an essay that the rich are
having a tough time, too.;   "Since <DATE>1989</DATE> the economy has slowed -- for blacks,
for whites, for rich, for poor," <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said. "The median net worth of the
Forbes 400 has stagnated since <DATE>1989</DATE>, not even keeping pace with inflation.";  
<ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> found that the fortune of <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>, a 77-year-old German immigrant who
founded <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Co.</ORGANIZATION>, keeps growing. At an estimated <MONEY>$5.9 billion</MONEY>, it's up
<MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> from last year.;   No. 2 is <PERSON>William Henry Gates III</PERSON>, 35, a
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> dropout who in <DATE>1975</DATE> formed <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, now the biggest computer
software maker. The bulk of his estimated worth of <MONEY>$4.8 billion</MONEY> comes from
company stock, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> said. Last year, he ranked 16th with <MONEY>$2.5 billion.</MONEY>;  
Gates replaces <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> investor tapped to clean up
scandal-tainted <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Inc</ORGANIZATION>. Buffett's estimated stock-market fortune grew to
<MONEY>$4.2 billion</MONEY> from <MONEY>$3.3 billion</MONEY>, but he slipped to eighth on the list.;   Ahead
of him are <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON> and his family.
Walton divided his wealth equally among himself and his four children. Each is
estimated to be worth <MONEY>$4.4 billion.</MONEY>;   Next are industrialist <PERSON>Henry Lea
Hillman</PERSON>, <MONEY>$3.3 billion</MONEY>; <ORGANIZATION>Amway Corp.</ORGANIZATION> partners <PERSON>Richard Marvin DeVos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jay Van
Andel</PERSON>, <MONEY>$2.9 billion</MONEY> each; and publishing brothers <PERSON>Samuel Newhouse Jr.</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Donald Newhouse</PERSON>, <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY> apiece.;   The magazine said financier <PERSON>Michael
Milken</PERSON>'s criminal guilty plea didn't erase his junk-bond driven fortune. He's
"making about <MONEY>30 cents</MONEY> an hour at prison labor, to add to net worth estimated
over <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>," <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said.;   <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said it bases the rankings on
inheritances, stock ownership and conservative estimates for private companies.  </TEXT>

   Although <PERSON>Sam M.

   If you wondered why oil is worth fighting for,
take a look at Fortune magazine's latest ranking of the world's
billionaires.
   The two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons,
the magazine reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Sultan <PERSON>Haji Hassanal Bolkiah</PERSON>, oil-rich leader of the tiny
<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> sultanate of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, retained Fortune's top title for the
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>,
unchanged from <DATE>1989</DATE>.
   Saudi Arabia's <ORGANIZATION>King Fahd</ORGANIZATION> and clan, a focus of the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>
crisis, ranked second with assets worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>, also unchanged
from last year.
   Fortune spokeswoman <PERSON>Emma Dockendorff</PERSON> said those estimates were
based partly on oil prices in mid-July, when one barrel of crude
fetched about <MONEY>$18</MONEY>.
   Prices have since surged to about <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a barrel following <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s
<DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> move to protect neighboring
<LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>. That price jump would make the sultan and the king
potentially even wealthier.
   The ranks of Fortune's richest _ bankrolled by assets ranging
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings _ swelled by 25 names this
year to 182 individuals and families, controlling a combined empire
worth <MONEY>$471.3 billion</MONEY>.
   That's up about <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> from last year and enough to erase the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> budget deficit, trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings
&amp; loan bailout tab.
   Fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its <DATE>Sept. 10</DATE>
issue. It said the average entrant's wealth was only slightly
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation.
   But the average fortune was still worth about <MONEY>$2.6 billion</MONEY>,
which if invested in <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> bills would earn
<MONEY>$534,000</MONEY> a day.
   ``True, you shouldn't feel too sorry for folks who have their
own islands and castles, use Reniors for wallpaper and control, in
the aggregate, <MONEY>$471.3 billion</MONEY>,'' Fortune said.
   As competitor Forbes magazine did in its annual list released
last month, Fortune ditched the Sultan of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Donald J.
Trump</PERSON>, whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt.
The magazine had estimated his holdings at <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> last year.
   Fortune placed <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> in a separate category of fallen tycoons,
who also included troubled takeover strategist <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON> and
convicted financier <PERSON>Michael Milken</PERSON>.
   Ranked third on Fortune's list was the reclusive Mars family of
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, whose holdings include <ORGANIZATION>Mars Inc.</ORGANIZATION> candy bars,
<ORGANIZATION>Uncle Ben</ORGANIZATION>'s Rice and Kal-Kan pet food, worth <MONEY>$12.5 billion</MONEY>.
   Fourth was <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, the wealthiest woman,
with an untaxed personal fortune of <MONEY>$11.7 billion</MONEY> in riches ranging
from 267,000 acres of <ORGANIZATION>Royal</ORGANIZATION> real estate to racehorses, crown jewels
and a vast stock portfolio.
   Fifth was the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> family of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, owners of a
large media empire, worth <MONEY>$11.5 billion</MONEY>; sixth was the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON>
family of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, with extensive real estate holdings valued at
<MONEY>$11.1 billion</MONEY>; tied for seventh were <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
richest industrialist, and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> retailing mogul <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>,
both valued at <MONEY>$7.3 billion</MONEY>; eighth was <PERSON>John W. Kluge</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, owner of media giant <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, valued at <MONEY>$7.0
billion</MONEY>; ninth was <PERSON>Tsai Wan-lin</PERSON> and family of <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, owners of a
construction and insurance empire worth <MONEY>$6.5 billion</MONEY>; 10th was the
<ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> family, owners of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper chain, at <MONEY>$6.2
billion</MONEY>.
   American newcomers included the <PERSON>Stephens</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>,
owners of investment banking, energy and real estate holdings worth
<MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY>; the <PERSON>Parfet</PERSON> family of <LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, owners of a
large stake in the <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn Co.</ORGANIZATION> drugmaker, worth <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY>; and
<PERSON>Philip Knight</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Nike Inc.</ORGANIZATION> athletic footwear maker, <MONEY>$1.3
billion</MONEY>.
   Foreign newcomers included <PERSON>Alicia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Esther Koplovitz</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>,
owners of a <MONEY>$2.2 billion</MONEY> construction and banking fortune; <PERSON>Hiroshi
Termachi</PERSON>, owner of a <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY> Japanese ball bearing business;
and <PERSON>John Spyros Latsis</PERSON>, European head of a Saudi Arabian shipping
and oil-refinery network worth <MONEY>$1.8 billion</MONEY>.
   The magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called
``published information or appraisals of asset values.'' To
qualify, each prospect needed a net worth of <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> or more
after subtracting debt.
   Fortune said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> remained home to the greatest
number of billionaires at 58. Twenty were from the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, 15
from <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, nine from <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, and eight in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, down from
12 last year.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, whose personal fortune is a
closely guarded secret, is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s richest person worth an
estimated <MONEY>$5.87 billion</MONEY>, according to a list of the nation's 200
richest people.
   The list was front-page news in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, with racy
tabloid headlines ranging from ``Filthy Rich'' in the Sun to
``Millionaires Galore'' in the Daily Mail.
   Money Magazine, which complied the list, said the
second-wealthiest Briton as 92-year-old Sir <PERSON>John Moores</PERSON>, founder of
the <ORGANIZATION>Littlewoods</ORGANIZATION> soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time
gamblers based on soccer results. It estimated his fortune at <MONEY>$2.99
billion</MONEY>.
   It listed the third-wealthiest Briton as supermarket chain owner
<PERSON>Garfield Weston</PERSON>, 60, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Associated British Foods</ORGANIZATION>, with an
estimated personal fortune at <MONEY>$2.64 billion</MONEY>.
   In fourth place is the 36-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Westminster</ORGANIZATION>. His
inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real
estate in central <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping
acres of remote northern moorland. The magazine said his personal
fortune was about <MONEY>$2.46 billion</MONEY>.
   Money Magazine says <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has seven billionaires, 18 families
and individuals worth more than <MONEY>$440 million</MONEY> each, and 20,000
millionaires as measured in pounds.
   The magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes
her the world's eighth-richest individual. It said the world's
richest person is the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, with an estimated fortune
equivalent to <MONEY>$24.64 billion</MONEY>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Guinness Book of Records</ORGANIZATION> lists the richest person in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Sam Moore Walton</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> discount
stores in <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, whose personal wealth was estimated in
mid-1987 at <MONEY>$4.5 billion</MONEY> ``and rising.''
   Money Magazine said financier Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON> _ fifth in its
list of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s wealthiest 200 with an estimated <MONEY>$1.76 billion</MONEY> _
was the only British billionaire to have made all his money since
the end of World War II in <DATE>1945</DATE>.
   The youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old <PERSON>Sophie Mirman</PERSON>,
with an estimated <MONEY>$52.8 million</MONEY>. She and her husband, <PERSON>Richard Ross</PERSON>,
created the popular Sock Shop chain.
   Among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``Dynasty'' star <PERSON>Joan
Collins</PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON>Jackie Collins</PERSON>, the author of a string of
best-selling raunchy novels. It said they are worth an estimated
<MONEY>$26.4 million</MONEY> between them.
   Editor Sue <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said it took six months to compile the list,
``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively
to analysts in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s financial district.
   ``The people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because
we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible
minute. Many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said.
   Asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy
maintained by her <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bankers, <ORGANIZATION>Coutts and Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Thomas</PERSON> said:
``We found out as much as we could about the different headings
under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties,
her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection,
her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we
talked to a lot of people with information.
   ``We arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for
all the people on our list.''
   It said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. Five
percent of those listed came from abroad and only <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> belong
to the British aristocracy. The self-made rich outnumbered those
who inherited their wealth by 2-1.

It will take a lot more than the collapse of the Japanese stock market to
knock <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Taikichiro Mori</PERSON> off his perch as the world's wealthiest
person.
Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the world's billionaires shows that
despite falling property prices the 88-year-old Japanese real estate tycoon
still boasted a personal fortune of Dollars 13bn. <PERSON>Yoshiaki Tsutsumi</PERSON>, 58, a
railway and golf course tycoon, remains the second richest with a Dollars
10bn fortune arising from a 40 per cent stake in the family-run company,
<LOCATION>Kokudo</LOCATION>.
By contrast, <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON>, the 36-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> dropout and founder of
<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, may be the richest American, but he is only worth Dollars 6.4bn.
But despite <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s pole position, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> tops the list with 101 individuals
or families out of 291 worth Dollars 1bn or more. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is second with 44
billionaire fortunes and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> comes in third with 34. For the first time,
<PERSON>Richard Branson</PERSON> joins the billionaires list; <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> says he is worth about
Dollars 1.2bn.
But it is <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> which has unearthed a surge of capitalist energy; up

</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>, who placed second in <DATE>1988</DATE>, has an estimated net worth of more than <MONEY>$5.2

</P>
<P>

status to inheritances, <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> said. They include the <LOCATION>Waltons</LOCATION>; the <PERSON>Dorrance</PERSON> 
family, founders of <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>, and the granddaughters of the late <PERSON>J.

<HEAD>Attorney For Nation's Richest Man Appealing $11.5 Million Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, the nation's
richest man and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> sought
to repeal an <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY> fine against his client in connection
with a personal injury suit.
   The motion filed in <ORGANIZATION>352nd District Court</ORGANIZATION> argues that the
sanctions violated a stay issued by the 2nd <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION>
and <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s constitutional rights of appeal.
   ``This unreasonable ruling must be reversed. When a judge enters
an order so patently wrong, the party suffereing the abuse should be
vindicated at the very first opportunity,'' attorney <PERSON>Vic Anderson</PERSON>
said in the motion.
   The issue surfaced this <DATE>summer</DATE> when <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> was asked to give a
deposition in a lawsuit filed by <PERSON>Andrew Carrizales</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>
against <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> and manager <PERSON>Jerry Rand</PERSON>. Carrizales claims that
while shopping at the company's Sulphur Springs store in <DATE>1986</DATE> he
slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on the floor.
   When <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> failed to provide testimony, former <ORGANIZATION>352nd District
Court Judge John Street</ORGANIZATION> ordered him to appear in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION> for a
deposition. But the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> said Street's ruling was a
clear abuse of discretion.
   Street modified his order and required <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> to submit to a
videotape deposition at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ark</LOCATION>. Walton refused and Street imposed sanctions against him for
violating the modified order.
   Fines began at <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> on <DATE>Nov. 28</DATE> and reached <MONEY>$1.28 million</MONEY>
before dropping back to <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> a day. Walton eventually showed
up for a deposition in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 15</DATE>.
   However, <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>2nd Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>
granted a stay of Street's order five days after it was issued <DATE>Nov.
18</DATE>. The stay dissolved on <DATE>Dec. 12</DATE> and <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> showed up two days
later.
   Walton is currently listed as the nation's richest man by Forbes
magazine, with a net worth of about <MONEY>$6.7 billion</MONEY>.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mars candy-bar clan is worth <MONEY>$12.5 billion</MONEY>,
surpassing the <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse</ORGANIZATION> publishing dynasty as the richest family in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, Fortune magazine reports.
   If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could
buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end
to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times.
   The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of
the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about
itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms.
   ``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is
as loose with information as its McLean, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, neighbor, the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Fortune</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in an advance press release about its <DATE>1988</DATE>
Billionaires List, to be carried in the <DATE>Sept. 12</DATE> issue available on
newsstands next <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on
what comparable food concerns have sold for recently.
   ``Thus, <ORGANIZATION>Forrest Mars</ORGANIZATION> and his three children, <PERSON>Forrest Jr.</PERSON>, <PERSON>John
and Jacqueline</PERSON>, overtake the <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> publishing magnates as the
richest Americans,'' Fortune said.
   Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The
richest remains the Sultan of <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>, whose oil wealth makes him
worth <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>. Next is King Fahd of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and family,
worth <MONEY>$18 billion</MONEY>.
   Fourth is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Queen Elizabeth II with <MONEY>$8.7 billion</MONEY>; next
is the <LOCATION>Newhouses</LOCATION>, whose communications holdings are worth <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY>; in sixth place is retail king <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, founder of
<ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stores, and family, worth <MONEY>$7.4 billion</MONEY>; seventh is
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> family, with <MONEY>$6.3 billion</MONEY> in assets that range
from swank <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> real estate to interests in railroads and
utilities.
   Eighth is <PERSON>Kenneth Irving</PERSON> and family, a Canadian clan that owns
400 companies worth <MONEY>$6.2 billion</MONEY>; ninth is <PERSON>Kenneth Thomson</PERSON> and
family, Canadian owners of a publishing, retailing, energy and real
estate empire worth <MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY>; and in 10th place is <PERSON>Gerald
Grosvenor</PERSON> and family, British land barons worth <MONEY>$5.4 billion</MONEY>.
   Of the 129 individuals and nuclear families that comprise this
year's list, there are 51 in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, 38 in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, 19 in
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> _ including 12 Japanese _ 13 Arabs and eight others, Fortune
said.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> has changed its

retained the head of the old party in a compromise vote.
   Delegates to the closed session said <PERSON>Rezsoe Nyers</PERSON> was chosen as

dissatisfied reformers reluctantly agreed to support him.
   Hours before beginning the closed session, the party congress
adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break
with the Marxist-Leninist orientation of its Communist predecessor.
   Despite the stated commitment to democracy, reformist delegates
have expressed concern that the new party does not differ
sufficiently from its predecessor. The choice of <ORGANIZATION>Nyers</ORGANIZATION> to continue
as leader was expected to increase the anxiety of some who wanted a
clean break with the past.

   The wealthy are getting a dose of what many
Americans already know: rougher economic times.
   Forbes reported <DATE>Monday</DATE> that the nation's 400 richest individuals
suffered a decline in net worth this year for the first time since
the magazine began compiling the list eight years ago.
   Fifty-three of the <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> 400 list lost anywhere from <MONEY>$100
million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$880 million</MONEY>, the magazine said in its <DATE>Oct. 22</DATE> edition.
The minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking, which had
risen steadily from <DATE>1982 to 1989</DATE>, dropped from <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> last
year to <MONEY>$260 million</MONEY> this year.
   Some names such as casino monger <PERSON>Donald J. Trump</PERSON> were evicted,
another symbolic boot to the <DATE>1980s</DATE> era of living on borrowed money.
Forbes said <PERSON>Trump</PERSON>'s fortune, estimated at <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, was
possibly within ``hailing distance of zero'' because of looming
loans and a slow economy.
   Trump, who previously has denounced <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> for downgrading his
ranking on the list, did not return a telephone call for comment.
   ``It's not just the year <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s and some other
overleveraged fortunes hit the wall,'' the magazine said. ``This
year the entire Forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and, on
balance, start going down.''
   ``This year all kinds of things went down: real estate, media,
banks, public stocks, private companies, you name it,'' <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>
said.
   It said the declines ``reflected a general scaling down of
capital values, brought about in good part by a worldwide shrinkage
of credit and sinking stock markets.''
   That's not to say the wealthiest are hurting unbearably. The
estimated worth of the Forbes 400 totals <MONEY>$272.5 billion</MONEY>. That's
actually up <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> over last year's total, but the magazine
said the reason was its discovery of previously hidden sources of
wealth among some members of the list.
   Forty-three names were added to the list this year, meaning 43
old names came off. Six died, including the magazine's own namesake
<PERSON>Malcolm Forbes</PERSON>. The fortunes of 35 fell too far to be included.
   In addition, <PERSON>Alfred Dreyfus Goldman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>, with a <DATE>1989</DATE>
real estate fortune estimated at <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>, was removed from the
list because of an inheritance dispute with his brother. <PERSON>William
Barron Hilton</PERSON> was dropped because part of his <DATE>1989</DATE> total of <MONEY>$1.25
billion</MONEY> actually belongs to a foundation.
   As in <DATE>1989</DATE>, the richest person on the list was <PERSON>John Werner
Kluge</PERSON>, 76, thrice-married entertainment entrepreneur who made his
<MONEY>$5.6 billion</MONEY> fortune by building up <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a wide-ranging
telecommunications company.
   No. 2 is <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> investor <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>, 60, who bought his first
stock at age 11 and parlayed a savvy for picking stocks into a <MONEY>$3.3
billion</MONEY> fortune.
   Third is debt-financed takeover specialist <PERSON>Ronald O. Perelman</PERSON>,
47, a <LOCATION>Wharton</LOCATION> business school alumnus who borrowed money to build
an empire that ranges from the <ORGANIZATION>Revlon</ORGANIZATION> cosmetics company to <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON>
camping products to savings &amp; loans. Forbes pegged his worth at
<MONEY>$2.87 billion</MONEY>.
   More notable, however, were the people whose net worth tumbled.
The biggest victim was <PERSON>Sumner Murray Redstone</PERSON>, owner of the
entertainment giant <ORGANIZATION>Viacom International Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, whose fortune
dropped from <MONEY>$2.88 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>.
   Others in the big-loser category included
publishing-entertainment baron <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION>, whose fortune fell
by <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.1 billion</MONEY>; cable TV mogul <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>, whose
worth fell <MONEY>$460 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY>; and convicted <ORGANIZATION>Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.</ORGANIZATION> junk-bond pioneer <PERSON>Milken</PERSON>, whose worth plunged
by <MONEY>$570 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>, largely because of <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> in
criminal penalties and losses from <ORGANIZATION>Drexel</ORGANIZATION>'s collapse early this
year.
   Among new names on the list, the wealthiest was <PERSON>Fred A. Lennon</PERSON>,
a highly secretive <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> industrialist who made his <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY>
fortune selling valves and pipe fittings.
   The magazine said it based the figures on intensive research
into inheritances, stock ownership and what it called conservative,
common-sense estimates.
   Forbes has sought to make the 400 ranking its trademark, much
like arch-rival Fortune magazine has done with its annual ranking
of the 500 biggest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industrial companies.

SAM <PERSON>WALTON</PERSON>: The Inside Story of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Richest Man by <PERSON>Vance H. Trimble</PERSON> (<PERSON>E.P. 
Dutton</PERSON>: <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>; 319 pp.). <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, billionaire head of the Arkansas-based 
<ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> retailing chain, readily admits to being aided by good luck -- a luck 
that extends, it turns out, to his first biographer, who has written a virtual 
hagiography. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>," by fellow <PERSON>Arkansan Vance Trimble</PERSON>, is unauthorized in name only: 
The real-life <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> no doubt resembles the inspiring, hard-working, just-folks 
executive depicted here, but the author's rose-colored perspective is a bit 
hard to take. Trimble, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, often places 
problematic details in a positive light. He is little troubled, for example, by 
the tendency of new Wal-Marts to drive existing mom-and-pop stores out of 
business. It should be noted, too, that <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> never was <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s richest man, 
Forbes magazine having failed for years to separate <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>'s fortune from that of 
his family -- a fact this book's publisher conveniently glosses over. <PERSON>Chris 
Goodrich</PERSON>

   Publisher <PERSON>Malcolm Stevenson Forbes</PERSON>, as
usual, made <ORGANIZATION>Forbes Magazine</ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 400 richest people in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and as usual, he chose not to disclose his own wealth.
   Forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret, and
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know
where he falls on the list.
   Saying no official wealth estimate is available, the magazine
has made him No. 113 on the list, between <PERSON>Laszlo Nandor Tauber</PERSON>,
worth <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>, and <PERSON>John Thomas Lupton</PERSON>, worth <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY>.
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``One thing I can say for sure, he's definitely worth between
<MONEY>$225 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$6 billion</MONEY>,'' said <PERSON>Harold Seneker</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> editor.
   Being publisher has its privileges for the Far Hills
million-or-billionaire. In short, he doesn't publish how much he's
worth because he doesn't have to.
   ``There is no (dollar figure) for him simply because he feels
it's his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his
net worth,'' said <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> spokesman <PERSON>Ray Healey</PERSON>. ``He just chooses to
keep it to himself.''
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``I don't think he even knows what it is and I don't think he's
in any hurry to have it figured out,'' said <PERSON>Don Garson</PERSON>, director of
corporate communications for <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>.
   It would be unfair to <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION> to print his worth, <PERSON>Garson</PERSON> said,
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are
presumed estimated, and <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION>' would be presumed factual since it
is his magazine.
   While the <DATE>Oct. 24</DATE> issue includes outsiders' estimates of Forbes'
worth, they range dramatically. The <ORGANIZATION>London Daily Mail</ORGANIZATION> guesses <MONEY>$400
million</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Newsday</ORGANIZATION> estimates his worth between <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$700
million</MONEY>, and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Daily News simply says he's a
``billionaire.''
   In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Forbes Magazine</ORGANIZATION>, which his father launched in
<DATE>1917</DATE>, <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION>, 69, owns <ORGANIZATION>American Heritage</ORGANIZATION> magazine, <ORGANIZATION>Somerset Press</ORGANIZATION>,
a 400-square-mile <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> ranch, a <LOCATION>South Sea island</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>

   Actor <PERSON>Robert Duvall</PERSON> has prepared himself for
roles by hanging out with bums on the <LOCATION>Bowery</LOCATION>, riding horses with
the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION> and tramping through a <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> swamp with an
alligator hunter.
   He's not sure if it was all worth it.
   ``You could do all the research in the world _ sometimes it pays

   <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON>, who won an Oscar for ``Tender Mercies'' and starred in

for detail in his characters and in films in general.

<TEXT>
   In a state that has no limits on political
contributions, <PERSON>Douglas Wilder</PERSON>'s campaign for governor of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
is happy to have the support of <PERSON>John W. Kluge</PERSON>, named by <ORGANIZATION>Forbes
Magazine</ORGANIZATION> as the richest man in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   ``It's great,'' <PERSON>B.J. Northington</PERSON>, a Wilder campaign aide, said
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``He's given us, what, <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>?'' Indeed, he has, in two
checks so far this year of <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> each. Kluge raised an
additional <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> for Wilder at a <MONEY>$5,000-a-couple</MONEY> get together at
his <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> estate.
   But <PERSON>Northington</PERSON> was quick to say that <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>'s Republican
opponent, <PERSON>J. Marshall Coleman</PERSON>, has received more than <MONEY>$900,000</MONEY> in
campaign contributions from <LOCATION>McLean</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, developer <PERSON>Dwight Schar</PERSON> and
his family.
   Big money is a hallmark of the campaign to succeed <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s
Democratic Gov. <PERSON>Gerald Baliles</PERSON>, who cannot run for re-election.
   <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> has raised more than <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> and <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>, bidding to
become the first black elected governor of any state, has taken in
close to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>. The election is <DATE>Nov. 7</DATE>.
   Money can be easy to raise in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, too easy, according to
<PERSON>Larry Sabato</PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We have no limitations in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>,'' he said. ``People can
give millions if they want.''
   Sabato defends political action committees as a preferred
alternative to individual contributions in the range of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   ``They're making an investment,'' he said of such contributors.
``I've yet to find a person who believes the line they're doing it
for good government.''
   <PERSON>Alson Smith</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> who is
one of the state's premier political fund-raisers, said he
supported efforts to limit individual contributions to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>.
   ``We couldn't get that to fly,'' he said, adding that attempts
to set the limit at <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> were no more successful.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> described <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON> as ``a good friend of mine'' and said,
``I've never asked him for a dime for anybody.''
   He said he thought <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON> was ``basically a Republican.''
   The 75-year-old <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON> is described as a self-made man who
parlayed a <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> radio station into the <ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION> radio and
television empire.
   Forbes estimated his fortune at <MONEY>$5.2 billion</MONEY> and said his
holdings rose about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> from the previous year thanks to a
tripling in the value of his investment in cellular telephones.
   He took the role of richest man in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> from <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, head
of the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stores discount chain who dropped down on the
individual list because he divided his <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> fortune among
himself and his four children.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> met when the billionaire had ``a
little mixer'' on his yacht.
   ``He started off without a dime,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>. ``He
felt <PERSON>Doug Wilder</PERSON> had brought himself up by his bootstraps.''
   That prompted the first <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> check from <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON> to the <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON>
campaign. The story of the second check was told by <PERSON>Patricia Kluge</PERSON>
at the fund-raising reception at their estate.
   According to <PERSON>Mrs. Kluge</PERSON>, <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> called her husband and said he
was aware of his support for <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> but ``I'm going to win and I
think we should get to know each other.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Kluge</PERSON> said that after that conversation her husband wrote
another <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> check to the <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> campaign.
   What would <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>'s money buy if Wilder is elected governor?
   There has been widespread speculation that the billionaire's
wife yearns to sit on the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION>.
   Smith brushed off such suggestions, saying that given <PERSON>Kluge</PERSON>'s
wealth, ``There's nothing <PERSON>Doug Wilder</PERSON> can do for <PERSON>John Kluge</PERSON>. What
can anybody do for <PERSON>John Kluge</PERSON>?''

<HEAD>Discount Chain's Founder Undergoes Cancer Therapy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, the 71-year-old founder of
the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> discount chain empire, has undergone treatment for
bone-marrow cancer, a company spokesman said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Walton, once the richest person in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, has received two
sessions of chemotherapy and some radiation therapy since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
for multiple myeloma, said <PERSON>Don Shinkle</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Wal-mart</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   Myeloma is a malignant tumor in the bone marrow. It is generally
made up of abnormal plasma cells.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> was expected to recover fully
from treatment he underwent in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>M.D. Anderson Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   It is the second time <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> has faced cancer. In <DATE>1982</DATE>, he was
diagnosed as having leukemia and also was treated at <PERSON>M.D. Anderson</PERSON>.
The leukemia has been in remission for several years.
   ``Along with <PERSON>Mr. Sam</PERSON>'s doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the statement said.
   ``His doctors have advised him that they have had good success
treating this type of cancer if it's detected in time,'' <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON>
said. ``He's in very good spirits.''
   <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> probably would spend another couple of weeks
in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. ``The bottom line, we hear from the doctors, is that
they caught this in time, in the early stages,'' he said.
   Walton had experienced aches and pains for several months, but
felt better after the therapy, <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said.
   ``I feel so much better already,'' <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> said in a two-page
memo to <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> employees.
   <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said the memo was issued because <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> wanted employees
to hear news of his illness from him, ``rather than have them to
hear a lot of rumors, because many might be exaggerated or untrue.''
   <PERSON>Shinkle</PERSON> said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> may be initially slowed down, but that he
expects to resume visiting outlets in a few weeks, a common <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>
practice. After this week's treatments, <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> visited a <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Wholesale Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> has been known to drop in on local <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> managers with
little advance notice to stay in touch with the retail business at
the customer level.
   The memo also described <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> accomplishments during the
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, which <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> credited to the employees of the chain's 1,300
stores. It said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> looked forward to more success.
   Based on his holdings of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stock, <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> has been listed
for the past several years by Forbes magazine as one of the
wealthiest men in the nation. He was the wealthiest until he split
his stock among family members.
   Walton stepped down as chief executive officer of the retail
chain in <DATE>1988</DATE>, and chose <PERSON>David Glass</PERSON> to oversee the chain.
   The chain blossomed under <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s philosophy of tight
management and general marketing principles that the customer is
always right.
   Born in <ORGANIZATION>Kingfisher</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> grew up as the son of a
farm-mortgage banker. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Missouri</ORGANIZATION>
with an economics degree in <DATE>1940</DATE> and joined <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney Co.</ORGANIZATION> as a
management trainee in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. After serving three years
in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, he went to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and opened a <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON>
five-and-dime. In <DATE>1962</DATE>, <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and his brother <PERSON>James L. Walton</PERSON>, opened
the first <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Discount City</ORGANIZATION>.
   Three of his four grown children are involved with the company
in various capacities.

MADE IN <LOCATION>AMERICA</LOCATION>: MY STORY
By <PERSON>Sam Walton
Doubleday</PERSON>, Dollars 22.50. 269 pages
Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON> found out.
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap
entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where business
practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve. A
vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
<PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> chain of discount supermarkets who died
of cancer in <DATE>April</DATE>, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most. When,
in <DATE>1985</DATE>, Forbes magazine declared him <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s richest entrepreneur, the
paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, mainly occupied by
chicken farmers, where <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> made his home. What they found was a happily
married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at
the local <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Inn</ORGANIZATION>, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two
hub-caps. Folksy was an understatement.
Since then, some aspects of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>'s business - its anti-union policies,
the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops
 -have been subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the less
wholesome adventures of the four <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> children. But no one has ever been
able to make Sam himself look bad. The worst that has been said is that he
was rather dull.
Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find his
autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if
charming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makes
no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one
stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .
. . .'
A few snippets are more revealing about the character. There cannot be many
billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and
have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
Meanwhile, the competitive energy which <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> applied to his business
is inescapable. In one of many contributions from friends and family, <PERSON>Don
Soderquist</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, tells of finding <PERSON>Sam one</PERSON>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> on his hand and knees at the local <ORGANIZATION>Kmart</ORGANIZATION> store, analysing
his rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the
couple was on holiday in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> their luggage vanished while her husband was
off on a similar scouting mission.
But it is <PERSON>David Glass</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>'s current chief executive, who perhaps
captures the entrepreneurial <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> spirit best. Explaining the annual
contest in which <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> executives choose one 'volume producing item' to
promote, he recalls the time <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> (who usually won) selected minnow buckets
for carrying bait. Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice. 'So I
would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .
put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow
bucket. I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit. It
drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'
But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the
truth. <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged
himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern
sweet called <ORGANIZATION>Moon Pies</ORGANIZATION>.
For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.
Occasionally, it just grates. 'I had bought a bank in <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, for about
about Dollars 300,000,' <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank
with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits. But it helped me learn a lot about
financing things.' Oh, come on <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>, is that the whole story?
The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when
<PERSON>Walton</PERSON> admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written
this book'. Given the pleadings of publishers - <PERSON>Doubleday</PERSON> paid about Dollars
4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he
can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it. But these are unlikely to be
circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end of
the day, <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>'s heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.

<TEXT>
   The store manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> in this
community on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> tells a story that gives an
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing
phenomenon.
   Manager <PERSON>Don Bost</PERSON> remembers one day <DATE>last summer</DATE> when a secretary
telephoned from <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters in
<LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark</LOCATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> was about to land at a nearby
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring
him to the De Soto store.
   Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> has kept in
close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by
other <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> executives and most make a point of spending a lot of
time in the field.
   Says <PERSON>Ed Nagy</PERSON>, district manager for 9 stores in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>
metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'
because they're always out.''
   By all accounts, <PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON>'s personality permeates operations
throughout the company.
   Everyone, from <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Operating Officer
<PERSON>David Glass</PERSON> down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the
gospel according to <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>, as he is called.
   To paraphrase <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>'s primary rules of retailing, ``Rule No.1 is
the customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just in case the
customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.''
   If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are
because that's the way <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> is, people who know him say.
   He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.
   He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.
   He also regularly reminds <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> ``associates'' that
hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via
high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.
   Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company
effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union
organizing effort in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   One of the most sensitive subjects for <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> is the fortune he's
amassed.
   A close associate says <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> would ``probably give anything'' not
to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest
people. The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake
in <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> stock is worth about <MONEY>$6.8 billion</MONEY>.
   ``<PERSON>Sam Walton</PERSON> is more interested in his backhand than he is in his
bank account,'' says <PERSON>Don Shinkle</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
   <PERSON>Samuel Moore Walton</PERSON> turns 71 on <DATE>March 29</DATE>. He was born in
<ORGANIZATION>Kingfisher</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.
   He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Missouri</ORGANIZATION> with an economics
degree in <DATE>1940</DATE> and joined <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney Co.</ORGANIZATION> as a management trainee in
<LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. After serving three years in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, he went to
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and opened a <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON> five-and-dime store, eventually
becoming the company's biggest franchisee.
   The seeds of the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> empire were sown when <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and his
brother <PERSON>James L.</PERSON>, or Bud, opened the first <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Discount City</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1962</DATE>. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
retail trade.
   Bud is a senior vice president and board member of <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>.
Three of the four grown children <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> had are
involved with the company in various capacities.
   Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as
ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with
leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since
handing over most responsiblities to <PERSON>David Glass</PERSON>. Sam is still
chairman of the board.
   Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> can flourish
without <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>. The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, ``We
have great people.'' The <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> family will always be involved, he
adds.
   Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what
we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won't
matter.''

Forbes magazine released its annual list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people 
today, spelling out what some have suspected with glee for months: <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> 
has hit very hard times, and he's not the only high-flier who crashed with the 
<DATE>1980s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
While the flashy developer was dropped right off the Forbes 400 list, 
<ORGANIZATION>Metromedia</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>John Kluge</PERSON> grew even richer. 
</P>
<P>
The rags-to-riches German expanded his fortune by <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>, to a staggering 
<MONEY>$5.6 billion</MONEY>, enough to retain his crown as the richest of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the top 400 saw their net worth dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the great <DATE>1980s</DATE> credit binge, capital values almost everywhere 
are being marked down. Just as homeowners feel less wealthy than a year ago, so 
do most of the nations' rich," the magazine said. "In <DATE>1990</DATE> the rich have been 
getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump is the most noteworthy loser," it said. "Once a billionaire, <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s net 
worth may actually have dropped to zero." 
</P>
<P>
Another loser is <PERSON>Merv Griffin</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>Resorts International</ORGANIZATION>, which owns the 
struggling casino next door to <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION>'s struggling <LOCATION>Taj Mahal</LOCATION>, went bankrupt.
