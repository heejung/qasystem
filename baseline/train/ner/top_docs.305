<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED merger between <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> mining groups <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus Minerals</ORGANIZATION> has
run into problems with the authorities. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> justice department is using
anti-trust regulations to request more information about their molybdenum
businesses.
Both groups said they were willing to work with the deparment to resolve any
anti-trust difficulties, but <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> said that 'there can be no assurance that
the companies will be able to satisfy any objections the department of
justice may have to the merger'.
Molybdenum, is a versatile and cost-effective alloying agent in special
steels, cast irons, nickel, cobalt and titanium-based alloys. In the
chemicals sector, molybdenum is used in catalysts, lubricants and pigments.
Cyprus owns the <ORGANIZATION>Thompson Creek</ORGANIZATION> molybdenum mine in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, which produced 40m
lb last year, and the mothballed <LOCATION>Tonopah</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> has two mines
in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>: the <LOCATION>Henderson</LOCATION>, which produced 33m lb in <DATE>1992</DATE>, and the <LOCATION>Climax</LOCATION>,
also mothballed.
Amax and <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> announced in <DATE>May</DATE> that they wanted to merge their core
operations into a group with assets worth Dollars 5bn and revenues of
Dollars 2.8bn. This would be the second-largest copper producer and the
second-largest coal producer in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
However, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s aluminium operations would be spun off to shareholders as a
separate company. Amax hoped to clear regulatory hurdles and obtain
shareholder approvals by the end of this year.

   <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus Minerals Co.</ORGANIZATION> expects to report <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> earnings of about <MONEY>$4 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>15 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of about <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Kenneth J. Barr</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said. 

   For the <DATE>year-earlier fourth quarter</DATE>, the mining company reported a loss of <MONEY>$415.8 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$218.7 million</MONEY>. 
The loss included a charge of <MONEY>$432.5 million</MONEY> from a write-down of assets. 

   For the year, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION> will report earnings of <MONEY>$19 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>80 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of about <MONEY>$800 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mr. Barr</PERSON> said in an interview. 
For <DATE>1985</DATE>, the company reported a loss of <MONEY>$452.1 million</MONEY>, including the <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> charge, on revenue of <MONEY>$706 million</MONEY>. 

   The company, which mines coal, industrial minerals and metals, has "recovered nicely" from several financial blows since it was spun off by <ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July 1985</DATE>, the executive said. 
The setbacks included the cancellation of its major metallurgical coal contract by <ORGANIZATION>LTV Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in <DATE>July 1986</DATE>, and declines in prices and demand for industrial minerals, coal and metal, he said. 

   Contributing to the mining company's move to profitability in <DATE>1986</DATE> were the acquisition of the Sierrita copper and molybdenum mine in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> at the <DATE>end of the first quarter</DATE>, cost reductions at its <ORGANIZATION>Thompson Creek</ORGANIZATION> molybdenum mine in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and the company's success at setting a floor under its molybdenum price despite industry overcapacity, <PERSON>Mr. Barr</PERSON> said.

   <ORGANIZATION>Amax Inc.</ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of <MONEY>$280.8 million</MONEY> for the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> after large write-downs to restructure its molybdenum business. 

   The minerals and energy concern had a loss of <MONEY>$49.7 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>year-earlier quarter</DATE>. 

   Allen Born, president and chief executive officer, said the restructuring should allow the molybdenum business, which has been unprofitable in recent years, to break even in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 

   The write-downs include the closing of the company's Kitsault mine in <LOCATION>Prince Rupert</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION>, and the closing of underground operations at its Climax mine in <LOCATION>Climax</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>. 

   The company also announced that it formed an operating unit, <ORGANIZATION>Climax Metals Co.</ORGANIZATION>, to consolidate its molybdenum and tungsten buinesses. 

   For the full year, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> earned <MONEY>$51.2 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>53 cents</MONEY> a share, up sharply from the <MONEY>$14.3 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>five cents</MONEY> a share, earned in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 

   In addition to the large molybdenum write-downs, the <DATE>1987</DATE> results include a <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> write-down of some domestic oil and gas properties and gains of <MONEY>$279.1 million</MONEY> from the sale of the concern's <PERCENT>47%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Australian Consolidated Minerals Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a gold mine operator; <MONEY>$43.9 million</MONEY> from an overfunded pension plan, and <MONEY>$38.3 million</MONEY> from the sale of oil and gas properties in the <LOCATION>Dutch North Sea</LOCATION>. 

   The <DATE>1986</DATE> results included a charge of <MONEY>$80.9 million</MONEY> for discontinued operations and a gain of <MONEY>$80.1 million</MONEY> from an overfunded pension plan. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> shares closed <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <MONEY>$16.25</MONEY>, up <MONEY>37.5 cents</MONEY>, in <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> composite trading.

   Copper producer Cyprus Minerals Corp. reported
fourth-quarter earnings dropped to 12 cents a share from 88
cents a share a year earlier, primarily because of a $40
million after-tax write-down on a molybdenum mine.
   In contrast, Magma Copper Co. said its fourth-quarter
earnings more than tripled to 49 cents a fully diluted share
from 14 cents a share as productivity improved and production
costs declined.

<TEXT>
   Cyprus said in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> that it earned <MONEY>$8.4 million</MONEY> on
revenue of <MONEY>$478.5 million</MONEY>, compared with <MONEY>$37.4 million</MONEY> on
revenue of <MONEY>$437.3 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>1989 fourth quarter</DATE>. For the
year, the company reported earnings of <MONEY>$111 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$2.38</MONEY>
a share, after asset write-downs on coal, copper, molybdenum,
silver and beryllium facilities totaling about <MONEY>$63 million</MONEY>
after taxes. Revenue was <MONEY>$1.87 billion</MONEY>. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION>
earned <MONEY>$164.9 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$3.87</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$1.79
billion</MONEY>. Results for <DATE>1989</DATE> have been restated for a
tax-accounting change.
   Cyprus said <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> operating earnings rose in its
copper-gold-molydbenum group and its coal operations as
higher copper prices helped offset increased production
costs. Molybdenum prices and demand, however, declined
significantly, leading the company to decide to mothball its
<LOCATION>Tonopah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, mine this month.
   Magma, based in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, reported net income of
<MONEY>$20.4 million</MONEY> on sales of <MONEY>$178 million</MONEY>, compared with
earnings of <MONEY>$5.9 million</MONEY> on sales of <MONEY>$190 million</MONEY>. Copper
sales declined, but prices increased slightly in the quarter.
Productivity rose as the company's copper smelter reached
capacity and production costs were cut, in part by increasing
the amount of copper refined by energy-saving solvent
extraction methods.
   For the year, the company had net of <MONEY>$84.4 million</MONEY>, or
<MONEY>$2.02</MONEY> a fully diluted share, up <PERCENT>44%</PERCENT> from <DATE>1989</DATE> earnings of
<MONEY>$58.5 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$1.43</MONEY> a share. Sales rose <PERCENT>18%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$767.3
million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$650 million</MONEY>. During the year, the company
increased its cash to <MONEY>$133.6 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$49.4 million</MONEY> while
paying off bank debt of <MONEY>$37.5 million</MONEY> and spending <MONEY>$20.7

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Amax deal enriches Cyprus
Minerals' core - Laurie Morse examines prospects of a new power in the coal
and copper industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>MR Milton Ward</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus Minerals</ORGANIZATION>, has enhanced his reputation as
something of a corporate fox. On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, he snapped up the assets of
undervalued <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> mining group, at a point when analysts believe
copper and aluminium markets could be close to the bottom.
<PERSON>Mr Ward</PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON>Mr Allen Born</PERSON>, agreed to a merger as <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>
struggled with Dollars 2.54bn in long-term debt, declining revenues from
sagging metals prices, and lack of sufficient capital to expand its core
business.
Both men are respected veterans of the mining business, and their alliance,
analysts say, show they are taking a realistic view of world competition and
market conditions.
'We are going to see more of these strategic alliances within the mining
industry, as companies cope with the globalisation of the business and the
effect the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> has had on world commodity prices,' says <PERSON>Mr
Vahid Fathi</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. 'Mining is in a very
dynamic situation right now.'
<PERSON>Mr Ward</PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> a year ago after nearly two decades at the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
natural resource company <ORGANIZATION>Freeport McMoRan</ORGANIZATION>, has earned a reputation as an
effective cost-cutter.
He and <PERSON>Mr Born</PERSON>, who went to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>Placer Dome</ORGANIZATION>, will share the new
company's chairmanship, but <PERSON>Mr Ward</PERSON> will be chief executive officer.
In acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> and creating <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus-Amax</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Ward</PERSON> has continued to focus
on two primary businesses - coal and copper. The deal involves the exchange
of one <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> share for two <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, subject to adjustments for price
fluctuations in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> stock.
The new company will be <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s second-largest copper producer, with
reserves of 2.6bn tons of mineable ore. Last year, <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> produced 660m
pounds of copper, and has a Dollars 200m capital expenditure programme under
way to reduce copper production costs.
From <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION> will get 1bn tonnes of new coal reserves and, combined,
the two companies will produce about 60m tons of coal annually. Cyprus will
add its new 40 per cent interest in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>McIlwraith McEacharn</ORGANIZATION> to the
deal. That company, whose markets are mainly Pacific Rim countries, produces
11m tons of coal a year.
<ORGANIZATION>Cyprus-Amax</ORGANIZATION> will also have a 40 per cent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Amax Gold</ORGANIZATION>, which has
annual production of about 250,000 ounces and reserves of about 8.6m ounces.
Cyprus has shed some gold operations in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, but gold
will be included in the combined company's commodity portfolio. Cyprus is
already in talks to acquire several high grade gold deposits in locations
around the world.
The new company will also have dominant positions in lithium, which is used
in aluminum smelting, and molybdenum, used as an alloy in steelmaking.
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s oil and natural gas subsidiary will be part of the merger, but <PERSON>Mr
Ward</PERSON> admits the business is not a good fit with his commodity strategy.
Notably, the new company will not have aluminium operations. <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s large
<ORGANIZATION>Alumax</ORGANIZATION> arm will be spun off independently to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> shareholders before the
merger.
'It is a very nicely structured deal. Cyprus didn't have to take the
aluminum business,' says <PERSON>Mr Tom Hess</PERSON>, research analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Northern Trust
Co</ORGANIZATION>.
With most metals markets in the middle of a 13-year decline, analysts say
the Cyprus/Amax deal has substantial potential once metals prices begin to
recover. In the meantime, Dollars 100m in immediate cost savings are
projected, through staff redundancies and closing <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office.
The merger will also allow a fresh look at <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s remaining businesses,
which <PERSON>Mr Ward</PERSON> is expected to streamline, aiming to be a lowest cost
producer, as he has done at <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>.
'<PERSON>Milton Ward</PERSON> is going to have huge potential to the upside over the next
several years, and very little potential for downside. If metals prices go
lower, other companies, with higher costs, will be forced to curtail
production first,' notes <PERSON>Mr Hess</PERSON>.
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Alumax</ORGANIZATION> spin-off is receiving close Wall Street scrutiny. 'It will be
a pure aluminum play,' says <ORGANIZATION>SG Warburg</ORGANIZATION> metals analyst <PERSON>Mr. Victor Lazarovici</PERSON>.
'It has more primary metal to sell in proportion to its size than any other
company.' While the company recorded an operating loss in <DATE>1992</DATE> because of
expenses related to the start up of its new <LOCATION>Quebec</LOCATION> smelter, <ORGANIZATION>Alumax</ORGANIZATION>, which
turned in Dollars 2.4bn in sales last year. is one of the world's lowest
cost aluminium producers.
It is valued at around Dollars 850m. If aluminium prices rise 30 per cent,
that valuation could jump to about Dollars 1.6bn, analysts say, and such
market responsiveness could, they add, make it a popular bet on the
direction of the world economy.

   DENVER -- By the time Cyprus Minerals Co. moved into its
brand new, copper-colored office building here three years
ago, it had already outgrown the space. The copper and coal
company's five-year diversification program had led it into
the gold, zinc, talc, iron ore and lithium businesses,
requiring more staff and more room.
   Now, it turns out, the building may be the right size
after all.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After struggling with a myriad of mineral and metal
ventures that didn't pan out, <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> says it is returning to
basics and concentrating on copper and coal. "We're going to
refocus on our core businesses," said <PERSON>Calvin A. Campbell Jr.</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>'s chairman, when he was named to the additional posts
of president and chief executive officer two weeks ago,
succeeding <PERSON>Chester B. Stone</PERSON>, who retired suddenly in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   The change in strategy comes none too soon if <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON>
is to rescue the company's reputation as a shining example of
the rejuvenation of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mining industry. Spun off from
<ORGANIZATION>Amoco Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July 1985</DATE>, the company overcame high labor and
operating costs, low-quality mines and a dependence on a big
contract with troubled <ORGANIZATION>LTV Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to report record profit of
<MONEY>$164.9 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>. But since then, rising costs,
declining ore grades, aging facilities and some hurried
acquisitions have eroded <DATE>earnings quarter after quarter</DATE>.
   Recent efforts to streamline costs and unload
underperforming assets haven't been enough. Cyprus's copper
production costs have crept higher, to <MONEY>80 cents</MONEY> a pound in
<DATE>1991</DATE> from <MONEY>70 cents</MONEY> a pound in <DATE>1989</DATE>. Attempts to convert small
zinc and gold operations into large, viable businesses have
failed, leaving those operations with high overhead. And
troubled acquisitions have required big write-offs. "Whenever
they seem to be resolving the problem, another problem comes
in," says <PERSON>Vahid Fahti</PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Kemper Securities Group
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
   As a result, some observers believe <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON>'s surprise
retirement after less than a year at the helm wasn't entirely
voluntary. Although the company says the move was <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON>'s
decision, the swift departure indicated the board was eager
for a speedier turnaround. The directors believe the company
needs a clearer long-term focus, leaner operations and more
accountability from lower-level managers, <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said
in a recent interview. Mr. Stone couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Some analysts support this strategy. "The company now has
to move from making acquisitions to internal growth," said
<PERSON>Anthony Rizzuto</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>First Boston Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "It's not
going to be able to diversify its way out of its problems."
Nonetheless, <PERSON>Mr. Rizzuto</PERSON> lowered his opinion on the stock to
hold from buy, citing concern about its short-term prospects.
   Even with the management change, a turnaround isn't likely
to occur this year. In <DATE>1991</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION>' net income fell <PERCENT>61%</PERCENT> to
<MONEY>$42.7 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$111 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>, including a <MONEY>$26
million</MONEY> write-down on the sale of its talc unit to <ORGANIZATION>RTZ Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Revenue fell <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$1.68 billion</MONEY> from <MONEY>$1.87 billion</MONEY>. The
company is predicting <DATE>1992</DATE> will be even worse because it
won't be able to refine copper concentrates until <DATE>June</DATE>, when
it finishes rebuilding its copper smelter, which caught fire
last <DATE>November</DATE>. "It ain't going to be a good year," <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON>
said in summing up the situation in an interview just before
his resignation.
   The troubles are quite a change for <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, which enjoyed
a few heady years after the spinoff. Back then, the company
quickly collected some 20 bargain-basement acquisitions,
including copper mines, smelters and copper-rod plants that
others didn't want, and turned the castoffs into good
producers. The first <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in acquisitions has already
returned about <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY> in profits, some analysts
estimate. Meanwhile, the company improved its labor contracts
and labor relations and sold off some poorly performing coal
properties and other assets.
   But some of <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>'s later acquisitions outside the copper
area defied the company's apparent Midas touch. A <LOCATION>Tonapah</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, molybdenum property acquired in <DATE>1988</DATE> proved to have
lower grades of ore than the company expected, which became
particularly problematic when molybdenum prices fell. A coal
mine at <LOCATION>Kanawah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>, bought in <DATE>1989</DATE>, had several problems,
including deeper coal seams than anticipated. The company
wrote down the value of both in <DATE>1990</DATE>, for a charge of about
<MONEY>$65 million</MONEY>. "They weren't always sufficiently careful in
these later acquisitions," says <PERSON>Kenneth Friedman</PERSON>, an analyst
at <ORGANIZATION>R.G. Dickinson &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   Also plaguing the company have been weak metals prices:
zinc prices have fallen <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> in four years; molybdenum is down
<PERCENT>32%</PERCENT>. Copper prices declined to <MONEY>$1.06</MONEY> a pound in <DATE>1991</DATE> from
<MONEY>$1.20</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   Some analysts have reported long lists of challenges for
the company, including finding more reserves, lowering costs
and getting out of unprofitable businesses. But other
analysts aren't all negative: Stronger prices would minimize
<LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>'s high-cost disadvantage, says <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON>, who
thinks metals prices will rise as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and world
economies improve. In addition, says <PERSON>Peter Ingersoll</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Bros</ORGANIZATION>. Inc., the rebuilt copper smelter could
significantly lower costs, and the company has invested
heavily in equipment that has increased productivity at its
coal operations, readying them for a time when prices rise
again.
   <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> isn't going to wait for rising prices to pull
<LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> out of its doldrums, though. A former <ORGANIZATION>Exxon</ORGANIZATION> executive,
he left his most recent post as president of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago-based
Goodman Equipment Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a mining-equipment manufacturer, to
run <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>. He has been on the board since the spinoff in
<DATE>1985</DATE> and was named chairman in <DATE>May 1990</DATE> when <PERSON>Kenneth Barr</PERSON>
retired as president and chairman at <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>'s mandatory
retirement age of 65.
   <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> says the company's most immediate problem is
getting costs under control. That will require "reductions in
people and things," he said, declining to elaborate on how
many jobs would be eliminated or what might be sold. The gold
operations, which many mining experts thought would be sold
first, won't go, he said. He said he couldn't comment on
whether the company's molybdenum, zinc or iron ore operations
will stay.
   One thing that's certainly destined for cuts is corporate
staff. To trim costs, <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said he will decentralize
<LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, leaving fewer people in the new <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> office
building and making mine managers more accountable for
operating results. "We're going to be taking a tougher
approach than we had," said <PERSON>Gerald Malys</PERSON>, chief financial
officer.
   Another priority: improving marketing with better customer
service. Every sales contract will be examined to determine
if there are better delivery schedules, different payment
plans, new packaging or other changes that customers would
like. "You aren't just selling a ton of coal," <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON>
said. "You're selling a whole relationship."
   Meanwhile, the company will focus its <MONEY>$18 million</MONEY>
exploration effort this year on finding additional copper and
coal reserves, and it is ready to spend the money to acquire
the right properties. New copper reserves will probably come
from outside of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, he said, and the company is
currently looking at a large coal deposit in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr.
Campbell</PERSON> said.
   Cyprus needs higher-grade copper ore reserves to help
reduce production costs, and the company needs to at least
double its coal production in order to be cost-competitive,
he said. "Cyprus spent its early years being very, very
clever in spotting a good deal," he said. Likewise, "we want
to be fortuitous now."

    <ORGANIZATION>Amax Inc.</ORGANIZATION> estimated that its
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> net loss narrowed to <MONEY>$49.7 million</MONEY> from a <MONEY>$103
million</MONEY> loss a year earlier.
   For all of <DATE>1986</DATE>, the metals and minerals concern said it had net income of <MONEY>$14.3 million</MONEY>, the company's first full-year profit since <DATE>1981</DATE>, including a gain of <MONEY>$110 million</MONEY> related to pension-plan accounting changes. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> said its "modest" <DATE>1986</DATE> profit is equivalent to <MONEY>five cents</MONEY> a share after preferred dividends. 

   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> had a full-year loss of <MONEY>$621 million</MONEY>, which included a provision of <MONEY>$360 million</MONEY> for losses on properties and investments. 

   The company didn't give any sales figures. 

   Allen Born, president and chief executive officer, told analysts in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, "We've stopped the bleeding." 
<PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> attributed the <DATE>1986</DATE> profit in part to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s disposal of "non-core businesses" such as iron ore, lead, copper mining and refining, nickel and most of the agricultural-chemical business. 

   The company's core businesses are aluminum, coal, gold and molybdenum. 
"We're now concentrating our resources and technology in businesses where <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> has relatively low production costs and sustainable competitive advantages," <PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> said that in addition to generating <MONEY>$450 million</MONEY> in cash from asset sales, the company has trimmed corporate costs, lowered interest expense and reduced the work force. 

   The estimate of the most recent <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> loss includes a charge of <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> for a reduction in the book value of the <ORGANIZATION>El Mochito</ORGANIZATION> mine in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> and a <MONEY>$44 million</MONEY> tax benefit from the elimination of some taxes that had been anticipated. 

   The <DATE>1985 fourth-quarter</DATE> loss included a charge of <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> for losses on tungsten and base-metal properties and investments, a loss of <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> on the anticipated disposition of the agricultural-chemicals business, and a net gain of <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> from the sale of the iron-ore business. 

   In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> shares closed at <MONEY>$16.625</MONEY>, down <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>.

   <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus Minerals Co.</ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed in principle to buy <ORGANIZATION>Foote Mineral Co.</ORGANIZATION> for about <MONEY>$90 million</MONEY>. 

   Foote is <PERCENT>82%</PERCENT>-owned by <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has said it would seek to sell some businesses to reduce the huge debt incurred in its successful effort to squelch a takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION>Ivanhoe Partners</ORGANIZATION>, an investment group led by <PERSON>T. Boone Pickens</PERSON>. 
The sale of <ORGANIZATION>Foote</ORGANIZATION> would be <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s first sale under that plan, although the company has also said it is considering selling its <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> stake in <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Australia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a gold mining concern. 

   The Foote sale, however, will make only a small dent in <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$2.1 billion</MONEY> long-term debt. 
The company borrowed about <MONEY>$2.1 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>September</DATE> to pay a <MONEY>$33</MONEY> a share special dividend to stockholders. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pickens</PERSON> then dropped his bid for <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>, but still holds about a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> stake. 

   For <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, on the other hand, the deal represents a new ingredient in its minerals production mix. 
Foote, based in <LOCATION>Exton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, produces lithium carbonate, which is used as an alloy in aluminum, as an ingredient in lubricants and in the manufacture of batteries. 
Most of the metals and minerals <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> produces are subject to cyclical price swings, but lithium has had very few price decreases in the past two decades, and demand for the metal is growing. 

   Currently, Denver-based Cyprus mines gold, molybdenum, copper, coal and a number of industrial minerals. 

   In the past six months, <PERSON>Foote</PERSON> has restructured its business, selling and closing its ferro-alloy facilities and its hard-rock lithium production facilities, leaving only the operations that produce lithium from brine. 

   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Foote</PERSON> had a loss of <MONEY>$8.1 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$106 million</MONEY>. 
However, its lithium division earned <MONEY>$6.2 million</MONEY> before taxes on sales of <MONEY>$42 million</MONEY>. 
In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> earned <MONEY>$21.1 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>81 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$815 million</MONEY>, including an extraordinary charge of <MONEY>$13 million</MONEY>. 

   Under terms of the proposed acquisition, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION> would pay about <MONEY>$10.32</MONEY> a share for <ORGANIZATION>Foote</ORGANIZATION>'s 7.3 million common shares outstanding. 
Preferred stock holders will receive cash equal to 3.5 times the amount paid for common stock, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION> said. 
There are 396,454 preferred shares outstanding. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> closed at <MONEY>$22.75</MONEY> a share, up <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY>. 
Foote rose <MONEY>$2.75</MONEY> a share to close at <MONEY>$8.50</MONEY> on the <ORGANIZATION>American Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>$35.50</MONEY> a share, down <MONEY>$2.625</MONEY> on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Cyprus said it would use its current lines of credit to purchase the lithium producer. 
The company said it would merge <PERSON>Foote</PERSON> with an newly formed <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> unit. 
The acquisition is subject to approvals by the boards of <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Foote</PERSON> and shareholders of <ORGANIZATION>Foote</ORGANIZATION>.

  [Abstract] Zeolites with a pentacyl structure, such as 
TsVK, TsVM, TsVM, and ultrasil, are the main catalysts used in 
hydrodeparaffinization or selective hydrocracking of n-paraffin 
hydrocarbons. To produce high-quality transformer oils from 
paraffin raw materials, these catalysts must possess not only a 
high splitting activity but also a sufficient hydrogenating 
activity. Most hydrogenating heterogeneous catalysts contain 
either noble or rare earth metals or else group VI metals. 
Catalysts containing a nickel-molybdenum complex have a higher 
hydrogenating activity than do catalysts into which metals have 
been added by coextrusion or impregnation. Deposition of a 
nickel-molybdenum complex on solid carriers (aluminosilicates or 
zeolites) helps increase their hydrogenating activity and thus 
helps decrease the content of hydrogenating metals in the 
catalyst. A catalyst's isomerizing activity and its ability to 
redistribute hydrogen (thereby reducing the yield of unsaturated 
compounds) increases in the presence of small quantities of 
wide-pore zeolites (mordenite or ultrastable Y). Tungsten helps 
increase a catalyst's hydrogenating activity in relation to 
polycyclic aromatic compounds, and zinc and chromium reduce 
metals' migration and thereby increase their dispersion and the 
stability of a catalyst's operation. Zinc facilitates 
aromatization of paraffins, and chromium compounds possess an 
independent hydrogenating activity. These and other laws were 
used to develop a new catalyst, SGK-5, which is designed to 
replace the combination SGK-1 plus type <ORGANIZATION>AKM</ORGANIZATION> hydrogenating 
catalyst. SGK-5 contains nickel and molybdenum as its 
hydrogenating components. SGK-5 is simpler to use than the SGK-1 
+ AKM combination; however, it has not been possible to fully 
hydrogenate unsaturated compounds in the presence of SGK-5 
(despite the fact that it has a higher hydrogenating activity 
than the SGK-1 + AKM combination). For this reason, studies were 
undertaken to increase the hydrogenating activity of SGK-5. 
Eight different versions of SGK-5 were produced and compared. 
The comparative tests established that catalysts containing 16 
to <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> (wt) nickel-molybdenum complex have a high 
hydrogenating activity coupled with a high yield of target 
fraction. When the nickel-molybdenum complex exceeds <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>, 
the zeolite content decreases, which has an unfavorable effect 
on the product pour point. Catalysts based on type TsVN zeolite 
were found to result in a target fraction with a low pour point. 
Type TsVM-III zeolite and wide-pore zeolites resulted in 
somewhat of an elevation of the product pour point; however, the 
addition of dealuminized mordenite had a favorable effect on 
yield of the target fraction. Roasting just at 340?C did not 
result in adequate activation of the zeolite component of the 
catalyst or (consequently) the necessary product pour point. 
Staged roasting at 340 and 500?C proved optimum. Tables 2;

   DENVER -- Cyprus Minerals Corp. expects to report its
operations broke even in the fourth quarter after a fire at
its smelter in Miami, Ariz., shut down the company's refining
capacity, president and chief executive officer Chester B.
Stone Jr. said in an interview.
   Cyprus will report a loss of about $32 million for the
quarter. The loss will reflect a $26 million write-down on
the pending sale of its talc business to RTZ Corp., a
provision for future reclamation costs at a coal mine in
Kentucky and smaller writeoffs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the year, the mining company will report net income of
about <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> on revenue of about <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY>. In <DATE>1990</DATE>,
the company earned <MONEY>$111 million</MONEY>, after <MONEY>$63 million</MONEY> in
write-offs, on revenue of <MONEY>$1.87 billion</MONEY>. For the <DATE>1991 fourth
quarter</DATE>, revenue will be more than <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON>
said. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, the mining company reported <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> net
of <MONEY>$8.4 million</MONEY>, or about <MONEY>12 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of
<MONEY>$478 million</MONEY>.
   But <DATE>1992</DATE> will probably be an even tougher year for the
company, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> said, as <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> won't be able to refine
its copper concentrates for at least the first six months of
the year while it builds a new smelter at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   The company realized a copper price of about <MONEY>$1.06</MONEY> a pound
in <DATE>1991</DATE>, compared with <MONEY>$1.19</MONEY> a pound in <DATE>1990</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> said.
   Cyprus's <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> smelter caught fire in <DATE>November</DATE>. The timing
of the fire and closing of the smelter put the company at a
disadvantage because rates charged for smelting copper at
toll smelters have increased to <MONEY>40 cents</MONEY> a pound from about
<MONEY>15 cents</MONEY> a pound in the past year because of a world-wide
shortage of smelter capacity.
   As a result, the company will stockpile its mine
production for the next six months rather than pay high tolls
to have it refined at other smelters, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> said. That
will cut income from copper sales in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   In addition, the company expects costs of copper
production to increase in <DATE>1992</DATE> because it anticipates mining
lower-grade ore at all three of its copper mines and it
expects higher stripping costs at two of the mines.
   Also affecting earnings were soft coal prices, depressed
by the recession, the chairman said. Cyprus closed its Empire
Mine in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> this month because of weak demand.
   Iron ore and molybdenum prices are also soft, and the
company's goal for <DATE>1992</DATE> is to have break-even cash flow at
those operations, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> said. The company's lithium
business, however, has bucked the downward trend in other
businesses. Earnings from lithium production rose to about
<MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> before tax in <DATE>1991</DATE> from about <MONEY>$17 million</MONEY> in
<DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The company will be looking for more global opportunities
and joint ventures, such as the coal exploration agreement
Cyprus signed with <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>'s state-owned oil company,
<ORGANIZATION>Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> said.

   <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration Resources Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said it signed a letter of intent to sell its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> copper producing and smelting unit for <MONEY>$125 million</MONEY> to <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus Mineral Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Englewood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>. 

   Inspiration's move follows the action of other nonferrous metal producers in recent years to leave the copper business because prices until recently had been so depressed. 
It also signals the company's intent to sharply reduce its bank debt and concentrate more on distribution of agricultural chemicals, analysts said. 

   "It's a smart move for <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration</ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders because it puts the company into a good position to reduce debt and recognize profit on other assets," said <PERSON>Daniel A. Roling</PERSON>, senior mining analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION> unit. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Roling</PERSON> noted that Inspiration is one of the biggest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agricultural products distributors, with more than 250 retail operations of its <ORGANIZATION>Terra International</ORGANIZATION> unit in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>South and Southeast</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Reuben F. Richards</PERSON>, Inspiration chairman, said the sale would reduce the company's debt to less than <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of capitalization from <PERCENT>42%</PERCENT> at the end of <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
<PERSON>James Simon</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration</ORGANIZATION>'s director of corporate affairs, said the sale would provide a after-tax gain of <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. 
The sale is subject to a final agreement and regulatory approvals by <DATE>July 1</DATE>. 

   In the <DATE>1987 third quarter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration Resources</ORGANIZATION> earned <MONEY>$8.4 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>12 cents</MONEY> a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$235 million</MONEY>. 

   In <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the purchase will make it the nation's second-largest copper producer, giving it total annual production of more than <MONEY>525 million pounds</MONEY> a year. 
It also will give <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> its first smelter and rod plant, allowing it to better control its copper costs. 

   The minerals concern recently has sold or agreed to sell portions of its industrial minerals unit for a total of <MONEY>$125 million</MONEY> so that it can concentrate on copper, molybdenum and gold. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the subsidiary, employs about 980 people. 
In addition to the smelter, and rod plant, the unit has pit mines, a dump leaching operation, two concentrators, an acid plant, and a tankhouse in <LOCATION>Claypool</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. 
In <DATE>1987</DATE>, it produced 105.6 million pounds of refined copper, or more than <PERCENT>53%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration Resources</ORGANIZATION>' total refined copper output. 

   If the sale is completed, <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration Resources</ORGANIZATION> would retain its <ORGANIZATION>Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, which mines copper and other metals. 
Cyprus has been a major supplier of copper concentrates to <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration</ORGANIZATION>'s smelter, <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration</ORGANIZATION> said. 

   Metals analyst <PERSON>Mr. Roling</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Inspiration</ORGANIZATION>'s departure from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> copper-producing business would leave <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Asarco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>BP America Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>BP Minerals America</ORGANIZATION> unit, formerly <ORGANIZATION>Kennocott Copper Corp.</ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION>Magma Copper Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Manuel</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, as major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> copper producers. 
In <DATE>March 1987</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION> spun off <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT> of the stock of <ORGANIZATION>Magma Copper</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> shareholders, retaining <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> ownership. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Roling</PERSON> said the average price of copper rose to <MONEY>76 cents</MONEY> a pound last year from <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY> in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <MONEY>61 cents</MONEY> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 
Last <DATE>December</DATE>, copper was selling for as much as <MONEY>$1.46</MONEY> a pound, but has since dropped to less than <MONEY>$1</MONEY> a pound. 

   Inspiration's <PERSON>Mr. Simon</PERSON> noted that at the end of the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, the company had long-term debt of <MONEY>$242.5 million</MONEY> with <MONEY>$84.6 million</MONEY> in current debt. 
"Our aim in this sale is to reduce our exposure to base metals and single commodities and strengthen our balance sheet," he said. 
"Then we can focus on extending our expertise in manufacturing and distribution in other areas."

   Cyprus Minerals Co. reported net income fell 63%, on a
1.4% decline in revenue, due to lower copper and molybdenum
prices and higher costs at some of its mines.
   For the first quarter, net income declined to $30.1
million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $80 million, or
$1.96 a share, in the year-earlier period. Year-ago earnings
included a $5 million gain from the sale of clay operations.
Revenue declined to $429.5 million, from $435.8 million.

<TEXT>
   Denver-based <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> said it is seeing improvement in
copper production costs, but the mining company doesn't
expect <DATE>1990</DATE> earnings to be higher than <DATE>1989</DATE> earnings. For all
of <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION> earned <MONEY>$250.1 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.79
billion</MONEY>.
   The large earnings drop indicates how vulnerable the
company's earnings still are to fluctuations in copper
prices, despite efforts to diversify into other kinds of
mining ventures over the past five years. Each <MONEY>one cent</MONEY>
increase in copper production costs, or <MONEY>one cent</MONEY> decrease in
the price of copper, results in a 10-cent a share decline in
annual earnings for <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>R. Wayne Atwell</PERSON>, analyst at

   <ORGANIZATION>Amax Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> under a proposed tender offer valued at <MONEY>2.85 billion Canadian dollars</MONEY> (<MONEY>US$2.42 billion</MONEY>), or <MONEY>C$36.125</MONEY> a share. 
The move would make <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> one of the world's six largest base-metal producers. 

   The surprise pact between <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, a big <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, Conn.-based aluminum, coal, and gold mining concern, and <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>, a large producer of nickel, copper, and zinc, appears designed to thwart a yearlong creeping takeover of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Noranda Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a resource giant indirectly controlled by <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> financiers <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter Bronfman</PERSON>. 

   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>'s shares soared on the news, closing at <MONEY>US$31.125</MONEY> each, up <MONEY>US$5.50</MONEY> on volume of 561,200 shares. 
In heavy <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> closed at <MONEY>C$36.625</MONEY>, up <MONEY>C$6.375</MONEY>. 

   The <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> closing price, <MONEY>50 Canadian cents</MONEY> above <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s bid price, reflected some investors' expectations that <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> might make a counteroffer, alone or with another company. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION>, which was told of <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s bid, gave no indication of its intent. 

   "We're reviewing the options," said <PERSON>Alfred Powis</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION>, which currently owns 18.8 million, or about <PERCENT>24.9%</PERCENT>, of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>'s 75.8 million common shares outstanding and has said it seeks control of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Powis</PERSON> said a counteroffer "may be a possibility," though <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> also has "the option of laughing all the way to the bank" by tendering shares to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s bid, which he said would give <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> a profit of about <MONEY>C$221 million</MONEY> on its shares. 
Most analysts described <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s offer as fair, and at least one large <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> holder said he expects the offer to succeed. 
"I think it's a fair price. 
If I had to bet, I'd say they {<ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION>} will tender their stock," said <PERSON>William Harnisch</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Forstmann-Leff Associates</ORGANIZATION>, an investment management firm that owns about 10 million <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> shares, or <PERCENT>13.2%</PERCENT> of its common. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Harnisch</PERSON> said "There's another <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> out there who I can think of, without blinking an eye," who will likely tender to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s offer. 
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s hand is further strengthened by the block of 9.2 million <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> shares that Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> bought back last year. 
<ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president, and chief executive officer, <PERSON>William James</PERSON>, himself a former <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> executive, said the shares will be tendered to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s bid. 

   "It's a great offer, it's for all the shares, and it's all cash," said <PERSON>Mr. James</PERSON>, who began talks with <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <ORGANIZATION>Allen Born</ORGANIZATION>, in late <DATE>June</DATE>. 
People familiar with the deal said <PERSON>Mr. James</PERSON> "had been looking for somebody" to help fend off the advances of <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION>, which is mainly interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Kidd Creek</LOCATION> zinc, copper, and silver operations in northern <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>. 

   In announcing the <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> offer, which is subject to approval by regulators as well as holders of at least two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>'s common shares, <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> also invoked a shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," effectively blocking <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> from adding more than <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> to its existing stake unless it makes a competing bid to all shareholders. 
<ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION> said it hasn't yet decided whether it will fight the "pill" in the courts. 

   The deal helped fuel speculation in other publicly-traded metal and mining company stocks. 
<ORGANIZATION>Inco Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a big nickel company, was the most actively traded stock on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>, rising <MONEY>$1.625</MONEY> to <MONEY>$33.75</MONEY> on volume of 3.4 million shares. 
Much of the <ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> volume occurred when a Canadian securities firm, <ORGANIZATION>Gordon Capital Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, traded a 2.8 million-share block at <MONEY>$33.75</MONEY>. 
"We are not aware of who the ultimate owner is, or the seller," said an <ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. 
"We don't have reason to believe right now that it isn't for passive investment." 

   Analysts said the purchase would be a good fit for <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, which relies on aluminum for much of its earnings. 
<PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON>, who took over as president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, has instituted a major restructuring of the once-ailing company, shifting its focus from copper, iron ore, lead and nickel, among other metals, to aluminum, coal and gold, plus molybdenum. 

   If acquired, <PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> wouldn't be likely to add anything to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings this year, but it could add as much as <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> next year. 
He estimated annual interest charges for the proposed purchase at about <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> doesn't plan to sell any <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> assets to help finance the purchase, which would raise <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s debt level to about <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> from <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY>, or to <PERCENT>56%</PERCENT> of total capital from the current level of about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> said permanent financing isn't yet in place, but <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> has received commitments from backers, and it doesn't expect to require a <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> loan guarantee that <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s capital markets group -- dealer manager for the offer in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> -- has agreed to provide. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON> said he doesn't yet know what role the feisty and independent-minded <PERSON>Mr. James</PERSON> would play in the combined company, but he noted that <PERSON>Mr. James</PERSON> is 61 years old. 
"Hopefully, he'll play a strong role," he said. 

   Under the accord, <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> also granted an option to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> to acquire debentures convertible to 9.875 million <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> shares at the bid price, subject to <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> acquiring <PERCENT>56%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>'s stock under its offer. 

   At least one analyst was skeptical about the <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> announcement. 
"I don't see why anybody would buy a nickel company at the top of the market," said <PERSON>Ronald Shorr</PERSON>, metals analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> "Even producers are admitting this might be the first year in several years that inventories will increase. 
I don't know where additional demand is going to come from." 

   He said "smart managements made acquisitions three years ago, when things were at their bottoms. 
Amax looks like they've done the opposite. 
I haven't been recommending the stock, but if I had been, I think I'd have egg on my face." 
The transaction, he added, contradicts <PERSON>Mr. Born</PERSON>'s efforts to improve the company's capital structure.

   <ORGANIZATION>Amax Inc.</ORGANIZATION> announced plans <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to
acquire <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$2.4 billion</MONEY> in cash,
capping a complete financial turnaround for the worldwide mining
company.
   If approved by shareholders, the deal will expand <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s mining
operations and mark its return to nickel production. Toronto-based
<ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> is the world's second-largest nickel producer.
   <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest coal and aluminum producer,
said it has secured financing needed to pay <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY>, or
<MONEY>$36.12</MONEY>{ a share, in Canadian currency for <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>.
   The offer is worth about <MONEY>$2.4 billion</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$30.50</MONEY>, in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
dollars, an <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. The acquisition is subject to
approval by Canadian regulatory authorities.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> is an excellent organization with quality people
and assets. Its acquisition will complement <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s current metals
businesses and position the company well to serve growing
markets,'' said <PERSON>Allen Born</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, chief executive and
president.
   Amax earned <MONEY>$741 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$4.2 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. In
the <DATE>first six months of this year</DATE>, the company reported <MONEY>$245.1
million</MONEY> in profits on revenue of <MONEY>$2.06 billion</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> shares closed up <MONEY>12{ cents</MONEY> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at <MONEY>$25.50</MONEY> in
consolidated <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> trading. Trading in
Falconridge shares was delayed until after the <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> announcement.
The stock shot up after it began trading, closing at <MONEY>$36.62</MONEY>{, up
<MONEY>$6.37</MONEY>{, on the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the <DATE>last year</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> sought to expand operations and <PERSON>Born</PERSON> said
it was interested in acquiring natural gas properties.
   The possibility of expansion seemed unlikely in <DATE>1985</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>
ended four years with <MONEY>$1.7 billion</MONEY> in losses.
   In addition to ill-advised ventures into silver and energy, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>
rejected lucrative takeover offers from <ORGANIZATION>Standard Oil of California</ORGANIZATION>,
now <ORGANIZATION>Chevron Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Its interest payments on debts totaled <MONEY>$200
million</MONEY> a year.
   Born was hired in <DATE>1985</DATE> from a Canadian mining company to help
turn the company. Amax then sold about half the subsidiaries
contributing to its <DATE>1984</DATE> losses, pulling out of iron ore, nickel
and agricultural chemicals production. The work force was cut to
nearly half its <DATE>1981</DATE> peak of 20,385 workers.
   In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> began making new acquisitions, particularly in
coal and aluminum. The combination of cuts and purchases returned
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> to profitability in <DATE>1987</DATE> and its work force has grown again to
about 20,000 worldwide.
   <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> is an international resource corporation that
explores for, develops, mines, processes and markets metals and
minerals. Its major product is nickel, but it also mines
ferronickel, copper and zinc.
   <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> has 9,500 employees with major operations in
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, a supplier of metals and energy, has as its major products
aluminium, coal, gold and molybdenum.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> deal is conditioned on acceptance of <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s
offer by at least two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> shareholders. No
deadline has been set for tendering the company's 79 million fully
diluted shares, the <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said.
   If the deal goes through, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to make an additional
offer to acquire all untendered shares. Amax recently moved its
headquarters from <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, but maintains corporate
offices here.
   Falconbridge immediately implemented a shareholder rights plan
to defend against hostile offers. The measures would give existing
shareholders the right to purchase additional stock at a bargain
rate if another party acquires at least <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>
stock.
   The so-called ``poison pill'' plan will expire in 120 days if
the deal is not approved by shareholders, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>
said in a joint statement.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the company abandoned the nickel
business because it was only a refiner and not a miner. She said
<ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION> presented <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> with a ``quality position'' in which it
will both mine and refine nickel.

<TEXT>
   Past glories and future dreams of this
economically depressed mining town two miles up in the <LOCATION>Rocky
Mountains</LOCATION> are pinned to a bill now inching its way through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The measure aims to bless the <ORGANIZATION>National Mining Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> and
Museum, now housed in the old <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION> junior high school here
in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>, with a federal charter.
   Such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for
inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other
official documents _ and museum boosters believe that will lure
thousands of mining buffs.
   Tourist dollars are badly needed in <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION> where
unemployment stands at <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>, the highest in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. The
state's average unemployment rate was <PERCENT>6.4 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>October</DATE>, the
last month tallied.
   <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> is the highest town in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and an historic
mother lode of legends and lore from the bygone silver and gold
rush days.
   ``We think having the hall of fame and mining museum will
provide a cornerstone for revitalizing <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>,'' said state Rep.
<PERSON>Ken Chlouber</PERSON>. ``We may be one of the richest six cubic miles on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> because of our minerals, but we have to diversify.''
   Fifty-four mining museums are scattered around the country,
according to the industry. They range from one-room displays to the
new <MONEY>$1.1 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>New Mexico Museum of Mining</ORGANIZATION> at Grants, which
spotlights uranium; the <ORGANIZATION>World Museum of Mining</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Butte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>,
which showcases copper; the <ORGANIZATION>American Mining Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, and an exhibition coal mine at <LOCATION>Beckley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va</LOCATION>.
   But none claims a national designation, say backers who want The
<ORGANIZATION>National Mining Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> and Museum to become an educational
center for the entire industry.
   The museum, set up as a non-profit corporation, was chartered by
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE> and has members in 31 states. Industry giants such
as <ORGANIZATION>AMAX</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ASARCO</ORGANIZATION> support the idea, and many
mining executives serve on the board of trustees.
   Bills designating the <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> site as the nation's official
mining museum were introduced in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> a year ago.
   On <DATE>Feb. 4</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved
one version and sent it to the full <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> with 40 co-sponsors.
   An identical resolution is stalled in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> with only half
the 218 co-sponsors required to move it through the legislative
process.
   Museum advocates are chomping at the bit, counting on the
federal charter to help them raise <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> to construct
initial exhibits.
   For more than a century <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> has been synonymous with
mining. In the <DATE>1800s</DATE>, thousands of adventurers dug gold and silver,
found in the town's namesake veins of lead, from surrounding
mountains.
   Legendary characters such as gambler and gunfighter <PERSON>Doc
Holliday</PERSON>, suffragette <PERSON>Susan B. Anthony</PERSON>, the ``unsinkable'' <PERSON>Molly
Brown</PERSON> and English writer <PERSON>Oscar Wilde</PERSON> were attracted to the boom
town 100 miles west of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, then a nondescript little frontier
settlement.
   In this century, <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s sought-after metal was molybdenum,
used to strengthen steel. <ORGANIZATION>AMAX</ORGANIZATION>'s Climax mine north of town, which
provided steady paychecks through two world wars and the Great
Depression, employed 3,200 people in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   But <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s mining collapsed in <DATE>1982</DATE> because of declining
steel-making and a world molybdenum glut. Climax now keeps just 48
men on a skeleton maintenance force.
   Town leaders, accustomed to <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s boom-bust history, at
first didn't believe large-scale commercial mining was finished.
But as <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION>'s unemployment soared and For Sale signs
sprouted like weeds, committees were formed to plot economic

<TEXT>
   Past glories and future dreams of this
economically depressed mining town two miles up in the <LOCATION>Rocky
Mountains</LOCATION> are pinned to a bill now inching its way through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The measure aims to bless the <ORGANIZATION>National Mining Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> and
Museum, now housed in the old <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION> junior high school here
in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>, with a federal charter.
   Such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for
inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other
official documents _ and museum boosters believe that will lure
thousands of mining buffs.
   Tourist dollars are badly needed in <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION> where
unemployment stands at <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>, the highest in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. The
state's average unemployment rate was <PERCENT>6.4 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>October</DATE>, the
last month tallied.
   <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> is the highest town in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and an historic
mother lode of legends and lore from the bygone silver and gold
rush days.
   ``We think having the hall of fame and mining museum will
provide a cornerstone for revitalizing <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>,'' said state Rep.
<PERSON>Ken Chlouber</PERSON>. ``We may be one of the richest six cubic miles on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> because of our minerals, but we have to diversify.''
   Fifty-four mining museums are scattered around the country,
according to the industry. They range from one-room displays to the
new <MONEY>$1.1 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>New Mexico Museum of Mining</ORGANIZATION> at Grants, which
spotlights uranium; the <ORGANIZATION>World Museum of Mining</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Butte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>,
which showcases copper; the <ORGANIZATION>American Mining Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, and an exhibition coal mine at <LOCATION>Beckley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va</LOCATION>.
   But none claims a national designation, say backers who want The
<ORGANIZATION>National Mining Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> and Museum to become an educational
center for the entire industry.
   The museum, set up as a non-profit corporation, was chartered by
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE> and has members in 31 states. Industry giants such
as <ORGANIZATION>AMAX</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ASARCO</ORGANIZATION> support the idea, and many
mining executives serve on the board of trustees.
   Bills designating the <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> site as the nation's official
mining museum were introduced in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> a year ago.
   On <DATE>Feb. 4</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved
one version and sent it to the full <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> with 40 co-sponsors.
   An identical resolution is stalled in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> with only half
the 218 co-sponsors required to move it through the legislative
process.
   Museum advocates are chomping at the bit, counting on the
federal charter to help them raise <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> to construct
initial exhibits.
   For more than a century <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> has been synonymous with
mining. In the <DATE>1800s</DATE>, thousands of adventurers dug gold and silver,
found in the town's namesake veins of lead, from surrounding
mountains.
   Legendary characters such as gambler and gunfighter <PERSON>Doc
Holliday</PERSON>, suffragette <PERSON>Susan B. Anthony</PERSON>, the ``unsinkable'' <PERSON>Molly
Brown</PERSON> and English writer <PERSON>Oscar Wilde</PERSON> were attracted to the boom
town 100 miles west of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, then a nondescript little frontier
settlement.
   In this century, <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s sought-after metal was molybdenum,
used to strengthen steel. <ORGANIZATION>AMAX</ORGANIZATION>'s Climax mine north of town, which
provided steady paychecks through two world wars and the Great
Depression, employed 3,200 people in <DATE>1981</DATE>.
   But <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s mining collapsed in <DATE>1982</DATE> because of declining
steel-making and a world molybdenum glut. Climax now keeps just 48
men on a skeleton maintenance force.
   Town leaders, accustomed to <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s boom-bust history, at
first didn't believe large-scale commercial mining was finished.
But as <LOCATION>Lake County</LOCATION>'s unemployment soared and For Sale signs
sprouted like weeds, committees were formed to plot economic
strategy.
   <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> is 60 miles east of <LOCATION>Aspen</LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION>, and
surrounded by some of the nation's most spectacular scenery,
including two of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s highest peaks, <LOCATION>Mount Elbert</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mount

IN A dramatic policy U-turn, the Indian federal government has decided to
allow private sector participation in the exploration for and mining of 13
minerals hitherto reserved to public sector operations. The minerals are
iron ore, manganese, chrome, sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc,
molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and the platinum group.
Under the new order, Indian public and private sector mining companies will
be allowed 50 per cent foreign equity participation on an automatic basis.
But the government will be ready to sanction higher foreign capital
participation depending on the merits of each case. However, mineral and
metal processing units with any level of foreign equity will now be allowed
to develop captive mines (mines tied to metal processors).
While the new national mineral policy is part of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s economic reform
programme, it is also a response to the need to introduce foreign technology
and funds to develop 'world grade mines to produce minerals at
internationally competitive rates'.
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has had success in recent years in discovering new mineral deposits
through modern exploration techniques, but the public sector, in many cases,
could not mobilise resources to develop mines. For example, <ORGANIZATION>Hindustan
Copper</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only copper producer, was forced to postpone the development
of Malanjkhand underground copper ore mine with estimated reserve of 275m
tonnes because of lack of finance.
Things may now look up for Hindustan Copper and other public sector
undertakings. According to <PERSON>Mr Balram Singh Yadav</PERSON>, minister of state for
mines, the government has received a good number of enquiries for mineral
exploration from leading mining companies in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The government is hoping that joint ventures with foreign companies as
partners will focus on the exploitation of those minerals in which the
country is deficient or does not have exportable surpluses. An objective of
the new policy is to promote the export of Indian minerals with as much
value added as possible.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Yasushi Uchida</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] The <ORGANIZATION>Central Research Institute of Matsushita 
Electric Works, Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric</ORGANIZATION>), jointly with 
Professor <PERSON>Koichi Niihara</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Science Research 
Institute of Osaka University</ORGANIZATION>, has developed new nano-composites 
in which nm-size, microfine molybdenum particles are uniformly 
dispersed in a matrix of yttria/partially stabilized zirconia 
(Y-PSZ or Y-TZP). With the addition of nano-microparticles of 
molybdenum to comparatively strong and tough PSZ to form the 
composite, ``the material manifested strength and toughness 
equivalent to those of super-hard alloys and corrosion 
resistance nearly equal to that of ceramics,'' according to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Functional Material Laboratory of the Central Research 
Institute</ORGANIZATION>. Within the next two to three years, <ORGANIZATION>Matsushita 
Electric</ORGANIZATION> plans to use the composite for electric tools' cutting 
edges and barber's equipment, including electric razors. 
  Nano-composites are reinforced ceramics created by forming 
residual stress fields with nm-size microparticles either in the 
ceramic crystalline grains themselves or in their boundaries. 
Nano-composite research activities have flourished because 
drastic improvement of bending strength and toughness is 
possible by the formation of the composite. Previously, the 
research concentrated on composite materials that combined 
dissimilar ceramics, e.g., alumina and silicon carbide. 
  With the aim of ``developing materials that are 
simultaneously strong, tough and corrosion-resistant,'' 
<ORGANIZATION>Matsushita Electric</ORGANIZATION> focused its attention on nano-composites 
containing ceramics and metal because previous nano-composites 
consisting of two ceramics had been poor in toughness. PSZ 
containing 3 mol-percent yttria (Y[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) 
was chosen as the ceramic matrix material. PSZ has excellent 
toughness and strength, since it undergoes the 
structure-reinforcing phase transition of its crystalline grains 
from cubic to monoclinic, when external stress is applied. The 
actual PSZ material used was <ORGANIZATION>Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>'s 
``TZ-3Y,'' with an average particle diameter of 300 nm. 
  The research group selected molybdenum for the metal 
component because of its high melting point, approximately 
2,600?C. In super-hard alloys, metallic properties, as 
opposed to ceramic, are dominant, because their metal component, 
cobalt, with a low melting point of 1,500?C, tends to cover 
the ceramic grain boundaries. Therefore, super-hard alloys have 
excellent toughness, but poor corrosion resistance. By using a 
high-melting metal, the group hoped to be able to overcome the 
poor corrosion resistance, the weakness of super-hard alloys. 
Thus, molybdenum was chosen because its readily wettable, 
micro-fine powder was commercially available. 
  The molybdenum powder, ``Mo-H-D,'' made by <ORGANIZATION>Nippon 
Shinkinzoku 
K.K.</ORGANIZATION>, was obtained. The powder's average particle diameter was 
650 nm, and the particle size distribution curve showed two 
peaks, at 200 nm and 1,000 nm. 
  For the production of the new composite, the two raw 
material 
powders were mixed and then ball-milled together for 24 hours in 
acetone; the blend was sintered by the hot press method for one 
hour at 1,400-1,600?C, under 30 MPa pressure. The resulting 
sinter density was higher than <PERCENT>99.5 percent</PERCENT>. 
  In the micro-structure of the sinter, molybdenum particles 
approximately 800 nm in diameter were seen precipitated in the 
grain boundaries of PSZ poly-crystals, also approximately 800 nm 
in diameter. Furthermore, 20- to 30-nm-diameter molybdenum 
nano-particles were also seen precipitated within PSZ particles. 
It is conjectured that PSZ crystal grains ``form nano-particles 
by incorporating molybdenum micro-particles inside.'' 
  The mechanical properties of the newly developed composite 
are strongly influenced by the amount of added molybdenum. The 
composite's bending strength increases as the molybdenum 
addition increases from zero through 30 volume-percent, above 
which the strength does not change significantly (Figure 2). The 
composite's toughness, on the other hand, hardly increases until 
the molybdenum amount reaches 30 volume-percent, and rapidly 
increases as soon as the molybdenum amount exceeds 30 
volume-percent. The explanation: ``As long as the molybdenum 
amount is 30 volume-percent or less, the composite's strength 
improvement is governed by the nano-particles. 
  When the nano-particles precipitate inside zirconia 
particles, the structure of zirconia becomes finer, and the 
composite's strength increases. On the other hand, as more 
molybdenum is added, molybdenum in the grain boundaries begins 
to grow to become sub-?m-sized particles; hence, greater 
toughness. The composite's toughness becomes high because 
molybdenum in the boundaries can prevent the progress of any 
cracks that have been generated in the sinter, in addition to 
the <ORGANIZATION>PSZ</ORGANIZATION>'s phase-transition reinforcing mechanism.'' 

<FIGÊID=JPRS-JST-011L-17A>           Figure 2. Bending Strength, Fracture Toughness Values of </FIG>




  The composite's mechanical properties, when 50 
volume-percent 
molybdenum was added, were determined as follows: bending 
strength was 1,800 <ORGANIZATION>MPa</ORGANIZATION>, and toughness was 17.5 
MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/]. These values were 1.8 and 4.2 times, 
respectively, the values with no molybdenum added. According to 
the group: ``We have never seen a nano-composite that has 
simultaneously manifested bending strength of 1,000 <ORGANIZATION>MPa</ORGANIZATION> and 
toughness of 10 MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/].'' The group confirmed the 
excellent corrosion resistance of the composite with a salt 
water spray test; thus, the group concluded that the material 
should have no problem in an ordinary environment. 
  The group feels that it needs to improve the composite's 
hardness, which decreases with the increase in the molybdenum 
quantity. When 40 volume-percent molybdenum is added, the 
composite's Vickers hardness HV is only 7-8 GPa, compared with 
19 GPa for alumina and 12 GPa for Y-PSZ. The reason was the 
hardness of molybdenum itself, which is only 2 GPa. The group 
plans to overcome this weakness of the composite by improving 
the control of the composite's micro-structure, i.e., the 
precipitation sites and numbers for nano-particles.

   Most mining companies are expected to post lower earnings
for the second quarter, compared with the year-earlier
quarter, as a result of lower metals prices, higher costs,
geological problems and weather-related slowdowns.
   But many analysts expect some modest increases in prices
and an improvement in earnings for the third quarter,
compared with the second quarter, though year-to-year
comparisons are likely to remain negative.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For copper companies, sluggish molybdenum prices combined
with a <PERCENT>13.5%</PERCENT> decline in average copper prices from the
year-earlier quarter to produce significantly lower earnings.
Demand for copper was weaker during the latest quarter,
generally as a result of the North American recession,
resulting in an average price of about <MONEY>$1.03</MONEY> a pound,
compared with <MONEY>$1.19</MONEY> a pound a year earlier. Prices slipped
below <MONEY>$1</MONEY> for <DATE>June</DATE>, the lowest monthly average price since
<DATE>August 1988</DATE>, says <PERSON>John E. Gross</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>West Nyack</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>,
publisher of the Copper Journal.
   Problems with chemical-leaching processes at some
refineries as a result of wet and cool weather increased
costs at some copper companies, especially those with
electro-winning processes, analysts say.
   <PERSON>Peter Ingersoll</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> estimates
<ORGANIZATION>Cyprus Minerals Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will report <DATE>second-quarter</DATE> net income
of less than <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>56 cents</MONEY> a share
a year earlier. J. <PERSON>Clarence Morrison</PERSON>, an analyst at
<ORGANIZATION>Prudential Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, puts <ORGANIZATION>Magma Copper Co.</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>
a share, compared with <MONEY>56 cents</MONEY> a share a year earlier. The
two analysts estimate that <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will report
earnings of <MONEY>$1.85</MONEY> a share to <MONEY>$2.05</MONEY> a share, down from <MONEY>$3.30</MONEY> a
share a year earlier.
   "Comparisons of year-to-year earnings will be very, very
difficult" for most companies until the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr.
Morrison</PERSON> predicts.
   Copper-producer <ORGANIZATION>Asarco Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the largest producer of zinc,
silver and lead in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, also will feel the pinch of
lower prices for those minerals. Zinc prices dropped <PERCENT>39%</PERCENT> from
last year to about <MONEY>53 cents</MONEY> a pound in <DATE>June</DATE>, while lead
prices declined about <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT> to an average for the quarter of
about <MONEY>26 cents</MONEY> a pound. And silver prices declined to about
<MONEY>$4.13</MONEY> an ounce for the quarter from about <MONEY>$5.01</MONEY> an ounce a
year earlier. Asarco estimates that its earnings fall <MONEY>four
cents</MONEY> a share from each penny drop in lead and zinc prices
and <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> a share for each <MONEY>$1</MONEY> drop in silver prices. As a
result, <PERSON>Mr. Morrison</PERSON> estimates <ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> will report net income
of <MONEY>40 cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>$1.21</MONEY> a share a year
earlier.
   Analysts, however, see some signs now that copper prices
may have bottomed out for the year. Production problems
throughout the world, including a mine collapse in <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>; a
strike at <LOCATION>Chuquicamata</LOCATION>, the largest mine of the Chilean
government-owned <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION>; and a rock burst at <ORGANIZATION>Codelco</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>El
Teniente</ORGANIZATION> are starting to balance out world supply and demand
for copper, says <PERSON>Mr. Morrison</PERSON>.
   Moreover, slightly higher prices early in <DATE>July</DATE> have given
some indication that the mining industry may have weathered
the worst of the recession. While shipments of building wire
have declined <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> for the year to date, compared with the
year-earlier period, orders increased in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>,
says <PERSON>Mr. Morrison</PERSON>. Most economic trends that affect copper
companies, especially automotive and construction sales, have
begun to turn around. "Rebounding may be too strong a word,"
says <PERSON>Mr. Gross</PERSON>. "But many indicators are showing steady
improvement."
   The export market is providing additional support for
copper prices. Year-to-date exports of copper, especially to
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> Rim countries, have risen <PERCENT>86%</PERCENT> to 120,148 short
tons, compared with 64,500 short tons in the <DATE>1990</DATE> period,
says <PERSON>Mr. Gross</PERSON>. Exports to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> more than doubled to 68,940
tons, while exports to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> rose a hundred-fold to 1,800
tons from 18 tons, he says.
   During the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>, a slightly lower average gold
price, <MONEY>$361</MONEY> an ounce, compared with <MONEY>$366</MONEY> a year earlier,
affected gold company performance somewhat. But, analysts
say, earnings declines will be larger than the price drop
might indicate, because year-earlier earnings reflected
forward sales put in place a couple of years ago when prices
were much higher. Recent hedging opportunities have been much
more modest. "Certainly, the first six months of this year
haven't been a favorable environment for aggressive foreign
sales," says <PERSON>John Phizackerley</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION>. If current
strength does lead to a sustained rally, with gold prices
reaching <MONEY>$385</MONEY> an ounce, producers will step up their forward
sales programs, he says.
   In addition, some cost increases, ore grade declines and
write-downs of old, uneconomical mines are eating into
earnings, says <PERSON>John Tumazos</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Also, a number of companies have
brought new mines into production with capital costs much
higher than their older producing mines, he says.
   <PERSON>Mr. Tumazos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Phizackerley</PERSON> estimate <DATE>second-quarter</DATE>
earnings at <ORGANIZATION>Battle Mountain Gold Co.</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>four cents</MONEY> a share to
<MONEY>five cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>nine cents</MONEY> a share a year
earlier. They expect <ORGANIZATION>Homestake Mining Co.</ORGANIZATION> to post a loss of
<MONEY>two cents</MONEY> a share, compared with net income of <MONEY>38 cents</MONEY> a
share last year. <PERSON>Mr. Phizackerley</PERSON> puts <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
earnings at <MONEY>33 cents</MONEY> a share, down from <MONEY>35 cents</MONEY> a share,
while <ORGANIZATION>Amax Gold Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is expected to post earnings of <MONEY>11 cents</MONEY>
a share, up from a year-earlier loss of <MONEY>seven cents</MONEY> a share.
The year-earlier figure included a write-off of <ORGANIZATION>Amax Gold</ORGANIZATION>'s
investment in <ORGANIZATION>Canamax Resources Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   Coal companies similarly will post a decline in earnings
for the quarter. Utilities worked off inventories left over
from the mild <DATE>winter</DATE>, keeping spot prices soft. In addition,
geological problems at several mines combined to depress
earnings at <ORGANIZATION>Pittston Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Westmoreland Coal Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Addington
Resources Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, analysts say.
   Bucking the trend, <ORGANIZATION>Ashland Coal Inc.</ORGANIZATION> continued to expand
production, and will report higher earnings, analysts say.
<PERSON>Raphael Villagren</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> puts <ORGANIZATION>Ashland</ORGANIZATION> earnings at <MONEY>52
cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>48 cents</MONEY> a share a year earlier,
and <PERSON>Addington</PERSON> earnings flat at <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> a share, compared
with a disappointing year-earlier quarter. He and <PERSON>Marc Cohen</PERSON>
at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> believe <ORGANIZATION>Pittston</ORGANIZATION> will report net
income of <MONEY>27 cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>52 cents</MONEY> a share,
and <LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION> will show a loss of <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> a share to <MONEY>15
cents</MONEY> a share, compared with net income of <MONEY>63 cents</MONEY> of share.
<PERSON>Mr. Villagren</PERSON> believes <ORGANIZATION>Nerco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will report net income of
<MONEY>23 cents</MONEY> a share, down from <MONEY>54 cents</MONEY> a share, while <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON>
estimates <ORGANIZATION>Nerco</ORGANIZATION> will earn <MONEY>35 cents</MONEY>. But, <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> says, his
<ORGANIZATION>Nerco</ORGANIZATION> estimate "may not be conservative enough."
   As the <DATE>summer</DATE> has warmed up, putting more demand on
utilities, spot prices have bottomed out and inventories are
in better balance, says <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON>. If this <DATE>summer</DATE> is hot,
coal prices may modestly increase through the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>,
he says.

ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS had only themselves to blame for present excess supply,
high stocks and low prices, suggested <PERSON>Mr Ivor Kirman</PERSON>, marketing director of
<ORGANIZATION>Inco Europe</ORGANIZATION>, yesterday.
He said metals businesses could broadly be classified into two groups -
those run by optimists and those run by realists. 'Metals (industries) which
were run by optimists typically have expanded capacity too fast, now have
more than 30 per cent over-capacity and have built up substantial finished
stocks. Examples include aluminium and charge chromium (ferrochrome).
'Metals run by realists typically have capacity only marginally over current
demand and have built up limited stocks. Examples include copper and
nickel,' <PERSON>Mr Kirman</PERSON> pointed out at a <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Mining Investment</ORGANIZATION> seminar in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
The aluminium industry was already heading for over-capacity before its
position was further worsened by the collapse of the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and
the sudden jump in its aluminium exports, he insisted.
<PERSON>Mr Kirman</PERSON> said the 'realists' were clearly in better shape to weather the
present recession and would be the first to benefit from any price recovery.
'The optimists are currently suffering and will have to wait for their
reward until later in the decade.'
Experience suggested that when stocks of a metal were less than about six
weeks consumption there was the potential for any significant demand
improvement to lead to a dramatic price rise, <PERSON>Mr Kirman</PERSON> pointed out.
Conversely, if stocks exceeded three to four months consumption, there would
be enough metal to meet restocking demand and prices were unlikely to flare
up. 'Between the two is an interesting area where price will be most
strongly influenced by the actual behaviour of producers, converters and
fabricators.'
At present copper stocks represented five to six weeks of consumption;
nickel stocks six to eight weeks; zinc, six to eight weeks; aluminium eight
to ten weeks; charge chrome 12 to 15 weeks and molybdenum 40 weeks.
On this basis, 'nickel and copper are in relatively good shape, aluminium
less so, charge chrome and molybdenum look like sad cases requiring a long,
sustained demand boom to move prices dramatically'.
<PERSON>Mr Kirman</PERSON> said that the greatest uncertainty in the metals markets was about
'distress' exports from the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. Confusion was likely to
last at least another year. 'While it reigns, decision making in the metals
industry will be even riskier than usual.'
<ORGANIZATION>Inco</ORGANIZATION>, the western world's biggest nickel producer, estimated that the
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of Independent States</ORGANIZATION> produced about 300,000 tonnes of nickel
last year and consumed domestically 160,000 tonnes. This left 30,000 tonnes
for export to the former eastern bloc countries and 110,000 for export to
the west. This year <ORGANIZATION>CIS</ORGANIZATION> production would be down but domestic consumption
was likely to fall even further.

<FÊP=106> [Report based on data of the <ORGANIZATION>Russian Federation Committee on </F>
Metallurgy</ORGANIZATION>: "Analysis of Work of Nonferrous Metallurgy 
Enterprises in <DATE>January 1994</DATE>"] 
  [Text] Production of output from nonferrous metallurgy 
enterprises continued to drop in <DATE>January 1994</DATE>. Thus, as compared 
with <DATE>December 1993</DATE>, production of tungsten concentrate declined 
by <PERCENT>79.3 percent</PERCENT>; of hard alloys--by <PERCENT>67.0 percent</PERCENT>; of refined 
copper--by <PERCENT>41.5 percent</PERCENT>; of sponge titanium--by <PERCENT>32.2 percent</PERCENT>; of 
zinc--by <PERCENT>13.6 percent</PERCENT>; and of primary aluminum--by <PERCENT>3.9 percent</PERCENT>. 
There was increased production of only molybdenum 
concentrate--by <PERCENT>0.6 percent</PERCENT>--and lead--by <PERCENT>12.4 percent</PERCENT>. A 
similar picture is observed when compared with production in 
<DATE>January 1993</DATE>. 
  In <DATE>January 1994</DATE>, some plants remained "on vacation" because 
of insolvency caused by rising prices for coal, raw materials, 
and transport and the decline in consumption of metal output. 
  On <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s domestic market, consumption of aluminum 
declined 
by half and consumption of copper, zinc, lead, and tin declined 
by <PERCENT>25-30 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1993</DATE> as compared to <DATE>1992</DATE>. Export of 
nonferrous metals did not compensate for the reduced domestic 
consumption largely because of higher prices for energy 
resources and fuel; their proportion in the prime cost of 
nonferrous metals is higher than for ferrous metals. The 
effectiveness of exporting nonferrous metals at present is the 
result of revising and lowering export duties. 
  The financial status of enterprises continues to be 
difficult. If we compare the balance assets and liabilities of 
enterprises for industrial activity, a general trend is 
identified: the proportion of real estate in assets is 
declining, while the proportion of sources of inhouse capital in 
liabilities is decreasing. And in contrast, in both assets and 
liabilities debtor and creditor indebtedness is rising, which 
prevents enterprises from operating normally. 
  For example, the proportion of sources of inhouse capital 
declined by a factor of 1.4 of its former level, and creditor 
indebtedness increased by a factor of 1.8 in polymetal industry 
enterprises during the first nine months of <DATE>1993</DATE>. 
  In <DATE>December 1993</DATE>, in terms of the level of labor payment, 
the 
nonferrous metallurgy of Roskommetallurgiya [<ORGANIZATION>Russian Committee 
on Metallurgy</ORGANIZATION>] was sixth among the sectors of industry (182,000 
rubles [R] as opposed to an average level in industry of 
R145,700). The highest average monthly wage remained in the 
aluminum industry and the lowest in the solid alloy industry, 
while the number of people working in those sectors increased by 
<PERCENT>6.5 percent</PERCENT> and decreased by <PERCENT>7.1 percent</PERCENT>, respectively. 
  Of the total amount of work time losses because of 
production 
stoppages at nonferrous metallurgy enterprises which presented 
reports in <DATE>1993</DATE>, special metallurgy enterprises accounted for 
two-thirds (more than 2 million worker days), and of that the 
<ORGANIZATION>Belokalitvinskiy MPO</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Metallurgical Production Association</ORGANIZATION>] 
accounts for almost 1.2 million worker days. Significant losses 
of work time occurred at enterprises of the solid alloy industry 
too, for the most part because of the lack of sale of output: 
the Pobedit plant had downtime almost every month which totaled 
about 140,000 worker days during the year, while the figure was 
61,700 worker days at the <LOCATION>Kirovograd Plant</LOCATION>. Wages at both 
enterprises were low. 
  The number of people working at Roskommetallurgiya 
nonferrous 
metallurgy enterprises in <DATE>1993</DATE> declined by <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT>, and <ORGANIZATION>PPP</ORGANIZATION> 
[industrial production personnel]--by <PERCENT>1.0 percent</PERCENT>. At 
enterprises which are working well and expanding by producing 
output different from their specialization the figure actually 
increased: it more than doubled at the <ORGANIZATION>Nadvoitsy Aluminum Plant</ORGANIZATION>; 
it increased by <PERCENT>22.5 percent</PERCENT> at the <ORGANIZATION>Kyshtym Copper Electrolyte 
Plant</ORGANIZATION>; and it increased by <PERCENT>18.5 percent</PERCENT> at the <ORGANIZATION>Bratsk Aluminum 
Plant</ORGANIZATION>. 
  At enterprises with low labor payment, the number of 
employees as a rule declined: by <PERCENT>25.3 percent</PERCENT> at the Dzhida 
Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine; by <PERCENT>20.3 percent</PERCENT> at the <ORGANIZATION>Samara Steel 
Mill</ORGANIZATION>; by <PERCENT>20.1 percent</PERCENT> at the <ORGANIZATION>Vishnevogorsk Mine Administration</ORGANIZATION>; 
and by <PERCENT>15.6 percent</PERCENT> at the <ORGANIZATION>Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant</ORGANIZATION>. 
  According to the <DATE>1993</DATE> results, most nonferrous metals were 
sold at the MBTsM [<ORGANIZATION>Moscow Nonferrous Metals Exchange</ORGANIZATION>] (<PERCENT>86.8 
percent</PERCENT> of all sales). The dynamics of growth in exchange prices 
for virtually all nonferrous metals were positive. Their level 
is still lower than the level of prices on the <ORGANIZATION>London Metals 
Exchange</ORGANIZATION>.

(092+096)] 
  [Text] This article presents data on cast fast cutting 
steels for the manufacture of high-pressure chambers and bed 
plate inserts for high-pressure equipment. 
  In the instrument industry , high-pressure chambers 35 mm in 
diameter are manufactured from VK6 alloy, and 72 mm chambers are 
made from R6M5 alloy. Bed plate inserts for high-pressure 
equipment are made from VK15 alloy. References 1 and 2 present 
basic data on the behavior of hard alloys and fast cutting 
steels in the synthesis of superhard materials. The study and 
industrial testing of cast molybde num alloys have shown that 
equipment manufactured from these alloys are completely 
functional and may replace hard alloys. [.sup]3[/] 
  The metal under study was obtained in a high-frequency 
induction furnace and poured into bars and rods.[.sup]4[/] 
The characteristics of the metal were studied after casting, 
annealing, hardening, tempering, and chemical-thermal 
processing. Cast metal costs less and has increased 
impact-fatigue durability compared to deformed metal. Cast steel 
R4M6S is chara cterized by the following chemical composition: 
<PERCENT>1.2-1.6%</PERCENT> C, 4.8-5<PERCENT>.2%</PERCENT> Cr, 6.0-6<PERCENT>.5%</PERCENT> Mo, 
1.2-1<PERCENT>.4%</PERCENT>Si, 1.2-1<PERCENT>.7%</PERCENT> 
V, <PERCENT>3-4%</PERCENT>W; st eel R4M6K5S also contained <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> <ORGANIZATION>Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
Samples were 
also manufactured for study from a steel of this composition 
with the addition of <PERCENT>0.06-0.12%</PERCENT> Ti and the same amount of 
rare-earth metal. 
  Cast steel has a porous structure with a carbide eutectic 
along the edges of the grains, at the base of which lies the 
complex carbide Me[.sup]6[/]C. There are differing 
opinions about the effect of silicon on the carbide 
phase.[.sup]3[/] The silicon grinds down the grain and 
increases the hardn ess of the steel. The tungsten and 
molybdenum content in the _a_-phase is not increased due to 
their displacement from the carbides. The silicon reduces the 
amount of residual austenite; consequently, after hardening, 
steels R4M6S and R4M6 had residual austenite contents of 
<PERCENT>28-31%</PERCENT> 
and <PERCENT>33-36%</PERCENT> respectively. The silicon reduces the 
hardening and 
tempering temperatures by 10-15?C. An increase in carbon 
content in the steel leads to an increase in the carbide phase, 
the hardness, and the formation of carbide 
Me[.sup]2[/]C. 
  The formation of carbides in tungsten steels is more intense 
than in molybdenum steels, and the high carbon content in 
tungsten-molybdenum steels is desirable. The addition of 
rare-earth metals makes it possible to obtain new steel 
qualities: the rare-earth metals cause the grains to be ground 
down through the effective formation of nucleation centers. The 
effect of rare earth metals on hardness, residual austenite, and 
the impact viscosity of tungsten-molybdenum steels is similar to 
their effect on molybdenum steels.[.sup]3[/] The temperature 
_a_ -_g_ of transformations in tungsten-molybdenum steels is 
lower than in tungsten steels. 
  The compression yield limit was determined by loading and 
unloading with measurement of the residual deformation. In 
steels with cobalt, silicon and a high carbon content, the 
temperature of the formation of ledeburite was reduced; 
consequently, the hardening temperature of these steels was 
lower than in steels without cobalt, silicon, and with a low 
carbon content. 
  To establish the annealing temperature, the critical points 
Ac[.sup]1[/] and Ar were determined; 
the temperature of isothermic annealing is 840-860?C and 
720-740?C. In annealed steels the carbide phase consists of 
complex carbides of tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, and 
vanadium. The microhardness of the tungsten carbides is 
12,450-15,500 <ORGANIZATION>MPa</ORGANIZATION>. The basic properties of the steels are as 
follows.

  To optimize the hardening and tempering, samples of 
different 
sizes and shapes were used. Hardening was done at 
1190-1240?C in air, in oil, and after is othermic curing at 
480-620?C. Direct hardening in oil leads to the formation of 
cracks in the transition to thin cross sec tions. Hardening in 
air did not provide uniform hardness. Gradual hardening 
eliminated the formation of cracks and provided a high level of 
hardness. Due to the formation of the carbide phase in 
isothermic curing, the amount of residual austenite was reduced 
and was <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> in steel R4M6S as opposed to <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> for 
hardening in 
oil. Approximately the same was found in other brand s of steel. 
  After hardening from optimal temperatures, the structure was 
porous with a carbide eutectic at the edges of the grains. An 
increase in hardening temperature led to a reduction in 
hardness, but the growth of the actual grain remained virtu ally 
unchanged due to the effect of the ledeburite eutectic, which 
slowed the growth of the grain. 
  In the cast state, after annealing the amount of carbide 
phase in R4M6S steel was <PERCENT>20-21%</PERCENT> with up to <PERCENT>92%</PERCENT> 
tungsten, 
molybdenum, and vanadium and <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> chromium. The ferrite 
contained <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> chromium and a very small amount of the 
other 
alloy components. In cobalt steels virtually all the cobalt was 
in a solid solution and had no effect on the carbide phase. In 
the hardened state some of the carbon a nd alloy components 
entered the solid solution. The martensite contained up to 
<PERCENT>0.6%</PERCENT> 
C, 2.8-3<PERCENT>.7%</PERCENT> W, 3.6-4<PERCENT>.8%</PERCENT> Mo and virtually all the 
chromium and 
cobalt. Stable vanadium carbides hardly entered the solid 
solution. 
  Tempering done at 530-620?C made it possible to obtain a 
<ORGANIZATION>HRC</ORGANIZATION> hardness of 63-68.5 depending on the steel composition. 
Steels hardened from optimal temperatures after triple tempering 
for one hour at 540-560?C had the maximum hardness. The 
microstructure of the tempered steels consisted of martensite, 
carbides, and a small percentage of residual austenite. The 
structure of the tempered steels contai ned <PERCENT>26-30%</PERCENT> excess 
carbide phase. Increasing the hardening temperature above the 
optimal temperature led to an increase in the degree of alloying 
of the _a_ phase. The fine-disperse vanadium carbides which 
were 
formed in tempering were near the grain edges. 
  Testing of the steels for stabilization of the austenite 
showed that untempered samples became stable in 4-8 hours in 
the area of the martensite transformation. To avoid austenite 
stabilization, parts should be tempered immediately after 
hardening. 
  In order to increase the operating capacity of chambers and 
protect them from the effects of high temperatures, they were 
subjected to boronizing in the smelt stage at a temperature of 
950-1000?C for eight hours. After boronizing the chambers 
were placed in a bath for final quenching and after curing they 
were gradually hardened with subsequent triple tempering. The 
structure of the boronized layer was spiny, in contrast to 
deformed steels with a granular structure.[.sup]5[/] 
  Industrial testing of the set of high-pressure chambers and 
bed plate inserts of cast tungsten-molybdenum steels for 
high-pressure equipment revealed a stability no lower than that 
of hard alloys. The chambers and equipment that had undergone 
boronizing had a higher stability. The R4M6S and R4M6K6S steels 
alloyed with rare earth metals exhibited a rather high stability. 
  Conclusions. Cast tungsten-molybdenum steels with 
rare-earth metals have a high level of hardness, are durable, 
and are thermal shock resistant. Transformations which occurred 
during thermal processing were studied. The main properties of 
the steels and the annealing, hardening, tempering and 
boronizing processing of the steels were determined. The 
experimental steels withstood the cyclic loading described above 
and were found to be suitable for the manufacture of 
high-pressure chambers and bed plate inserts used in the 
synthesis of ultrahard materials.

   The metals and minerals company said it is closing the tungsten operation because of poor market conditions and because <LOCATION>Canada Tungsten</LOCATION> has adequate inventories to sustain its planned reduced level of sales for "a considerable period of time." 
A company spokesman said the suspension wouldn't have a material effect on <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s financial results.

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>AMAX</ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> aluminium producer, is halving its quarterly
dividend to <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> a share because of 'abnormally low' prices for the
metal.
The company will also take charges totalling Dollars 399m after tax, partly
offset by a Dollars 192m income tax benefit.
<PERSON>Mr Allen Born</PERSON>, chairman, estimates <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>, which makes about two-thirds of its
earnings from aluminium, will suffer a <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> loss of about Dollars
50m before special provisions.
The company reported a net loss of Dollars 49m, or <MONEY>57 cents</MONEY> a share, for the
first nine months of <DATE>1992</DATE>, compared with net earnings of Dollars 40m, or <MONEY>46
cents</MONEY>, in the same period of last year.
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> will take a charge of Dollars 97m (Dollars 61m after tax) to adjust the
carrying value of various non-core assets and provide for additional
'streamlining and downsizing' costs. Mr Born suggested these adjustments
would benefit future annual pre-tax operating earnings by Dollars 25m.
The company is accounting for the full impact of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Accounting
Standard Board</ORGANIZATION> pronouncements in <DATE>1992</DATE>. The effect of the employee benefits
costs obligation of Dollars 338m after tax would be partly offset by a
Dollars 192m benefit resulting from the adoption of the new rules for income
taxes.
<ORGANIZATION>Southern Peru Copper Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, which owns two mines and a smelter in
<LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, is paying a Dollars 7m dividend for the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> compared with
<ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 4m in each of the previous <DATE>1992</DATE> quarters.
In <DATE>1991</DATE> it paid shareholders - <ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> (52.3 per cent) <ORGANIZATION>Marmon Group</ORGANIZATION> (20.7 per
cent) <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> (16.3 per cent) and <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining</ORGANIZATION> (10.7 per cent) -
dividends totalling Dollars 60m.
Last year, the Peruvian company produced 300,200 short tons of copper, 3.1m
troy ounces of silver and 6.7m lb of molybdenum.

   DENVER -- Cyprus Minerals Co. said its president and chief
executive officer, Chester B. Stone, resigned after less than
one year at the helm of the struggling mining company.
   Mr. Stone, 56 years old, took early retirement to pursue
other interests, the company said in a news release. He
wasn't available for comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cyprus's Chairman <PERSON>Calvin A. Campbell Jr.</PERSON> will assume the
presidency until the board appoints a successor, the company
said. The board will meet next week. <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> owns
<ORGANIZATION>Goodman Equipment Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a mining-equipment manufacturer, and
has been on the <LOCATION>Cyrpus</LOCATION> board since <DATE>1985</DATE>. He was elected
chairman in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   In a telephone interview, <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON>
had been talking about retirement for some time, and had a
program in his computer for plotting his retirement strategy
and finances. <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said retirement was <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON>'s
decision.
   In discussing <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus</ORGANIZATION>'s future, <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said he
expects the company will begin to "hit hard at operations and
hit hard at costs." Earlier this month, the company cited
higher costs as part of the reason <DATE>1991</DATE> earnings declined to
<MONEY>$42.7 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.68 billion</MONEY>, from net income of
<MONEY>$111 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.87 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> was named chief executive officer last <DATE>spring</DATE>
when <PERSON>Kenneth J. Barr</PERSON> retired at <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>'s mandatory retirement
age of 65. <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> had been named president, also
succeeding <PERSON>Mr. Barr</PERSON>, in <DATE>May 1990</DATE>. He had been with <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>
since <DATE>1978</DATE>, running several of the company's operations and
serving for a time as chief financial officer.
   Cyprus has been struggling over the past two years with
rising costs and some troubled operations. Ore grade has been
declining at its copper mines and the company was having
problems with its smelter at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, which it planned
to shut down this <DATE>spring</DATE> for rebuilding. A fire at the
smelter in <DATE>November</DATE> forced it to close early, and that will
reduce <DATE>1992</DATE> earnings, <PERSON>Mr. Stone</PERSON> said two weeks ago.
   In addition, poor performance at a couple of acquisitions,
including the Kanawah coal mine in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tonapah</LOCATION>
molybdenum mine in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, has plagued the company over the
past couple of years. Cyprus wrote down its investment in the
two operations in <DATE>1990</DATE>, taking write-offs of <MONEY>$63.2 million</MONEY>.
"Perhaps <LOCATION>Tonopah</LOCATION> and Kanawah wouldn't have happened if a more
thorough analysis had been done" before they were purchased,
<PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said yesterday. "Proper controls have to be put
in place and never done away with."

   Phelps Dodge to Report Per-Share Net
   Of $4 for Fourth Quarter, $13 for Year

<LP>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Phelps Dodge Corp. said it expects to
report fourth-quarter earnings of about $3 a share, in line
with analysts' projections.
   A year earlier, the mining concern had a loss of $4.03 a
share, including a charge of $6.62 a share, or $237 million
after taxes, for write-downs on nonproducing mines and
smelters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Douglas Yearley</PERSON>, chairman, said in an interview that the
company expects <DATE>1990</DATE> earnings to total about <MONEY>$13</MONEY> a share,
compared with <MONEY>$7.46</MONEY> a share in <DATE>1989</DATE> and with analysts'
estimates for <DATE>1990</DATE> averaging <MONEY>$12.82</MONEY> a share. Revenue for the
year just ended will be close to <DATE>1989</DATE> revenue of <MONEY>$2.7
billion</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said.
   Operating earnings fell slightly in <DATE>1990</DATE> because of
increased costs and spot copper prices that averaged about
<MONEY>$1.19</MONEY> a pound, compared with <MONEY>$1.25</MONEY> for <DATE>1989</DATE>. Copper averaged
<MONEY>$1.18</MONEY> a pound in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, compared with <MONEY>$1.14</MONEY> a
year earlier.
   Although the copper price slipped in <DATE>1990</DATE>, it remained
higher than analysts and some industry officials expected, in
spite of the slowing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy. <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said that was
because less than <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of world copper production is used in
the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. Some of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s developing countries are "booming,"
he said. In addition, the amount of copper used in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
construction has increased, as homebuilders use more wire for
electrical, telephone and audio systems than in the past, he
said.
   While "we continue to be optimistic about copper prices
for the decade," <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said, "we're less sure about
<DATE>1991</DATE>." One major unknown, he said, is the impact of the 280
million pounds of copper a year that will be added to the
world's supplies by <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> mine, which started
production two months ago.
   <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> substantially increased
its copper ore reserves in <DATE>1990</DATE> by verifying reserves at its
<ORGANIZATION>Morenci Coronado</ORGANIZATION> deposit in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and its La Candelaria
deposit in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. The company says there are about 400
million tons of <PERCENT>1.14%</PERCENT> copper ore in the Chilean property and
about 150 million tons of <PERCENT>0.7%</PERCENT> copper ore at the Coronado
deposit.
   The company also expanded the life of its Tyrone copper
mine in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> by locating more ore. <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> had
planned to close the mine in <DATE>1990</DATE> but now plans to operate it
through <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   Capital spending rose to about <MONEY>$290 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE> from
<MONEY>$217 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE> and is expected to remain at <MONEY>$290
million</MONEY> this year. <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> is expanding its exploration
efforts to include zinc, lead, nickel, gold, platinum, silver
and chromium deposits, among other minerals and precious
metals, <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said. "Our core business is copper, and
that isn't going to change," he said, "but we would love to
find diversification in base and precious metals. The company
operates two small gold mines now, one in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> and one in
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and is evaluating a joint venture project in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>.
It also produces gold, silver and molybdenum as byproducts of
its copper output.
   <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION>'s non-mining <ORGANIZATION>Industry Group</ORGANIZATION> continued to earn
about <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> after tax last year, providing a stability
that levels out earnings swings resulting from changes in
copper commodity prices, <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said. "It earns our
dividend," he said. The company pays a regular dividend of <MONEY>$3</MONEY>
a year, or <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY> a quarter.
   Although <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> truck and construction industries slipped
into a recession in <DATE>1990</DATE>, more than <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of the group's
business is international and benefitted from healthier
overseas economies, he said. For instance, <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said,
infrastructure development in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> contributed to a "banner
year" for the international cable companies that <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION>
holds an interest in. But he said he expects some "softness"
in the magnet wire business in <DATE>1991</DATE> because much of that
business depends on consumer appliance sales.
   <PERSON>Mr. Yearley</PERSON> said the company would like to add assets to
the <ORGANIZATION>Industry Group</ORGANIZATION>, which produces carbon black, truck wheels
and rims, and cables and magnet wires, and holds investments
in foreign mines and wire and cable manufacturers. But
recently, acquisition prices of target companies have been
too high, he said. The company rebuilt its cash by year end
to <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> after significantly reducing cash through a
special dividend of <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a share, or <MONEY>$352 million</MONEY>, it paid to
holders in <DATE>1989</DATE>.

   The recession began to take its toll on many mining
companies' profits during the fourth quarter. The slowing
economy hit aluminum companies hardest, as declines in the
construction and automotive industries pushed prices down and
swelled inventories. Gold lost the boost it received in the
third-quarter from the Mideast situation, and silver prices
dipped nearly 10%.
   But copper prices held up surprisingly well in the face of
the recession, analysts say, leading a few to speculate that
the world's copper supply-and-demand balance has shifted
significantly and, changing their expectations for copper
prices in the future.

   Alumina and aluminum-ingot prices fell. Although ingot
prices dipped only about <MONEY>1.5 cents</MONEY> a pound from the year-ago
quarter to about <MONEY>77 cents</MONEY>, the price had declined about <MONEY>30
cents</MONEY> since <DATE>September of 1990</DATE>. Prices for can sheet and other
fabricated aluminum products softened even more as orders
slowed and inventories increased. Analysts expect further
softening through the first six to nine months of <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   The decline in alumina prices affected <ORGANIZATION>Aluminum Co.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, which produces that raw material for aluminum as
well as aluminum ingots. On top of that, <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>
that it will take an after-tax charge of <MONEY>$275 million</MONEY> for
asset writedowns, environmental cleanup, and a loss on the
sale of its Astech division.
   "This is the third year in a row with disappointing
<DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> results" for <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>J. Clarence Morrison</PERSON>
at <ORGANIZATION>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, who estimates the
company will show a <MONEY>$1.24</MONEY> operating profit and a loss of
<MONEY>$1.94</MONEY> for the quarter after the charge compared with a profit
of <MONEY>$1.88</MONEY> a year ago. He estimated <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION> averaged only 70 to
<MONEY>72 cents</MONEY> for the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE> for its ingot sales,
primarily as a result of forward sales. <PERSON>Thomas Van Leeuwen</PERSON> at
<ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</ORGANIZATION> said he expects the company to
report <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> earnings of <MONEY>$1.40</MONEY> before the charge.
   <PERSON>Mr. Van Leeuwen</PERSON> estimates <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds Metals Co.</ORGANIZATION> will show
<MONEY>$1.95</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>$2.51</MONEY> and <ORGANIZATION>Alcan Aluminium Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> will
report <MONEY>40 cents</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Alcan</ORGANIZATION> also is
expected to report a <MONEY>$160 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>70 cent</MONEY> per-share,
extraordinary gain from the sale of shares of <ORGANIZATION>Shin Nikkei Co.</ORGANIZATION>
to the public. R. <PERSON>Wayne Atwell</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co.</ORGANIZATION>, expects <ORGANIZATION>Alcoa</ORGANIZATION> to report <MONEY>$1.42</MONEY> before the charge, <ORGANIZATION>Alcan</ORGANIZATION>
to report <MONEY>36 cents</MONEY> (before the gain), and <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON> to report
<MONEY>$1.84</MONEY>.
   But economic difficulties continued to roll right off the
backs of the nation's copper companies. Prices averaged about
<MONEY>$1.18</MONEY> a pound for the quarter, up from <MONEY>$1.14</MONEY> a year ago and
well above what analysts had expected for the end of the
year. <ORGANIZATION>John Gross of J.E. Gross &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION> had predicted
copper would end the year at <MONEY>$1</MONEY> a pound. "This bull market
has persisted far, far longer than anybody expected," he
said.
   In trying to explain the apparent strength in the copper
market, analysts have pointed to stronger economies overseas,
especially <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and, until recently, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. "This is not a
domestic industry," said <PERSON>Mr. Atwell</PERSON>, adding that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
makes up a smaller part of the world's economy than it used
to. Other analysts suggest that copper-consuming companies
have been keeping higher inventories of copper because they
fear supplies could be disrupted in politically unstable
countries, such as <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
   Many analysts predict that copper prices will fall in
<DATE>1991</DATE>; <PERSON>Peter Ingersoll</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> is estimating a <MONEY>95 cent</MONEY>
average price for the year, compared with <MONEY>$1.19</MONEY> in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
Besides the slowing economy, the <DATE>December</DATE> start of operations
at <ORGANIZATION>Escondida</ORGANIZATION>, a large copper mine in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>, is expected to
add 250,000 tons of copper to world supplies this year.
   But <PERSON>Kenneth Friedman</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Boettcher &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>,
thinks the prices are strong because of larger, more longterm
structural changes that turned a chronic oversupply of copper
into a chronic undersupply. "For better than 10 years, copper
pricing was so poor that no additions were made to world-wide
capacity," said <PERSON>Mr. Friedman</PERSON>. "Demand finally caught up with
and surpassed capacity. He is predicting prices will rise in
the <DATE>first quarter of 1991</DATE>.
   For the present, strong copper prices are expected to have
boosted <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> earnings of copper companies modestly.
<PERSON>Mr. Ingersoll</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> estimates <ORGANIZATION>Magma Copper Co.</ORGANIZATION> earnings
will be <MONEY>52 cents</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>14 cents</MONEY> a year ago and <ORGANIZATION>Phelps
Dodge Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will report <MONEY>$3</MONEY> a share compared with <MONEY>$2.76</MONEY> a
share a year earlier before a <MONEY>$375 million</MONEY> charge for the
writedown of assets. Because of a charge of <MONEY>$1.24</MONEY> a share for
environmental cleanups, <PERSON>Mr. Ingersoll</PERSON> expects <ORGANIZATION>Asarco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to
report earnings of <MONEY>five cents</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>$1.42</MONEY> a year ago.
   Goldman's <PERSON>Mr. Atwell</PERSON> puts <ORGANIZATION>Asarco</ORGANIZATION> at about <MONEY>$1.35</MONEY> before the
charge and <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> at <MONEY>$3.16</MONEY>. He estimates <ORGANIZATION>Cyprus
Minerals Co.</ORGANIZATION> will report operating earnings of <MONEY>83 cents</MONEY>
compared with <MONEY>84 cents</MONEY>. Cyprus announced it will take a
charge of about <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY>, after taxes, to write down its
<LOCATION>Tonapah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, molybdenum mine assets.
   For gold, the average price for the quarter dipped <PERCENT>2.6%</PERCENT> to
<MONEY>$381</MONEY> an ounce from <MONEY>$391</MONEY>, according to <PERSON>J.E. Gross</PERSON>, reversing
the price increase that came in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> as a result
of Mideast worries. Some companies made up for the difference
by increasing production, but operating problems plagued
others.
   <PERSON>John Phizackerley</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Shearson</ORGANIZATION> said he expects <ORGANIZATION>American
Barrick Resources Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to report earnings of <MONEY>11 cents</MONEY>
compared with <MONEY>10 cents</MONEY> a year ago, <ORGANIZATION>Battle Mountain Gold
Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>seven cents</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>eight cents</MONEY>, <ORGANIZATION>Homestake
Mining Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>two cents</MONEY> compared with operating earnings of
<MONEY>five cents</MONEY>, and <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Gold Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>38 cents</MONEY>, about the same
as last year. He expects Echo Bay to report operating income
of about <MONEY>eight cents</MONEY> a share compared with an operating
profit of <MONEY>nine cents</MONEY> a share a year ago. The company is
expected to take a charge of <MONEY>32 cents</MONEY> a share for the <DATE>fourth
quarter</DATE> to write down its assets of the <LOCATION>Alta Bay</LOCATION> joint
venture, a group of mines in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>. In the <DATE>1989 fourth
quarter</DATE>, the company took a writedown of <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>20
cents</MONEY> a share, for an investment in some Canadian companies,
which resulted in a net loss of <MONEY>11 cents</MONEY> a share for the
period.
   Coal companies have finally solved many of the operating
and labor problems that have plagued them over the past year,
analysts said. Companies reported no major disruptions in
contract shipments, but the buildup of utility company
stockpiles through the year caused the spot market price to
decline.
   In spite of dismal earnings by its precious metals
division, coal producer <ORGANIZATION>Nerco Inc.</ORGANIZATION> should report profit of <MONEY>58
cents</MONEY> a share for the quarter compared with <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY> for the
year-ago period, estimates <PERSON>Marc Cohen</PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. He also predicts <ORGANIZATION>Pittston Co.</ORGANIZATION> will report net
of <MONEY>40 cents</MONEY> a share compared with a year-ago loss of <MONEY>seven
cents</MONEY> a share. The company was experiencing the adverse
effects of the coal miners' strike in the year-ago period,
but "even without a strike, this is a good comparison," <PERSON>Mr.
Cohen</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>Pittston</ORGANIZATION> is beginning to enjoy better
productivity at its mines, he said. <ORGANIZATION>Westmoreland Coal Co.</ORGANIZATION>
will report net of <MONEY>18 cents</MONEY> to <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> for the quarter
compared with <MONEY>36 cents</MONEY> in the year-ago period, <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON>
predicts. A couple of short work stoppages affected earnings,
even though shipments continued on time.
   For <DATE>1991</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Cohen</PERSON> expects coal industry performance to
be flat, except for those companies that start reaping the
benefits of new equipment that will raise productivity. Some
companies with low-sulfur coal reserves may begin to garner
higher contract prices by the end of the year as a result of
the acid rain provisions of the clean air law passed in <DATE>1990</DATE>.

   While most of the nation is wondering when the current
recession will end, Colorado is still enjoying moderate
growth.
   "Colorado will outperform the national economy through
1992," says Manlio Huacuja, an economist at the Colorado
Office of Planning and Budgeting in Denver.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Doris Drury</PERSON>, an economist and president of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Business and Economic Forecasting</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Regis College</ORGANIZATION>,
says: "Our rate of growth slowed down in the <DATE>last half of
1990</DATE>, but now it's picking up again. Things are looking
pretty good."
   A big reason is that the state government has been able to
resist the temptation to lure businesses with such come-ons
as tax breaks, largely because of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s natural
attributes: great scenery, great weather, generous natural
resources and great skiing. Perhaps as a result of the
state's economic and political stability, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s total
per-capita taxes -- including sales, income and all other
levies -- rank 45th in the nation, yet another attraction for
companies considering moving.
   Escaping a national downturn would be nothing new for
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. In the past four national recessions -- 1981-82,
<DATE>1980</DATE>, 1973-75 and <DATE>1970</DATE> -- <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s business activity, as
measured by its gross state product, continued to expand.
What's more, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> was the only state in the lower 48 to
escape the four declines unscathed; <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> also avoided the
national recessions.
   All told, nine states avoided the 1981-82 downturn, 22
sailed through the <DATE>1980</DATE> decline in good shape, 13 skipped the
1973-75 recession, and 27 did all right in <DATE>1970</DATE>. But only
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> weathered all four recessions --
conventionally defined as two consecutive declines in gross
state product, which is a state's total output of goods and
services.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, of course, is a large and diverse country. Some
states always do better than others because they supply goods
and services that happen, at a particular time, to be in
strong demand. Some states have their own little business
cycles, perhaps because they are so far away from national
markets that they are unaffected by ups and downs in those
markets.
   <PERSON>Ken Ackbareli</PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate Bancorp.</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, figures that <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> owes only about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of
its growth to national factors. "For <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>," he says, "the
figure is about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>, so both states are partly exempt from
national declines."
   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> had a "little business cycle" in the <DATE>first half
of the 1980s</DATE>. Rising oil prices had spurred a drilling boom
in the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountain</LOCATION> area, and a number of oil companies and
supply firms had built headquarters in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. But toward the
middle of the decade, oil prices fell, and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s
office-building boom soured.
   Many Coloradans figure they had a recession, but gross
state product and personal income kept growing, though at
slower rates. "All I know is that things certainly changed
around here," says <PERSON>Chris Blackwood</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>Kichner
Moore &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. "Before it
happened I would look out my window and see nothing but
construction cranes. You don't see those now."
   Nonresidential construction still is weak in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>,
though office vacancies have been falling. Residential
construction is doing well, reflecting the continued influx
of new businesses and residents. The economists interviewed
by <ORGANIZATION>Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast</ORGANIZATION>, a newsletter based at
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State University</ORGANIZATION>, now expect housing permits to rise
close to <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> this year and another <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   So, unlike much of the country, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> isn't worried
about housing. "Our construction recession is behind us,"
says <PERSON>Ms. Drury</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Regis College</ORGANIZATION>. "Our troubles in the
mid-1980s led companies to cut costs and otherwise slim down.
Whatever happens to the national economy, we've been
preparing for it for five years. We're really lean and mean."
   Consumers are reasonably optimistic, too, which bodes well
for spending. The <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION>, a private research
organization, reports that in <DATE>April</DATE> the index of expectations
for the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountain</LOCATION> area, which includes <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, stood
at 119.9, the highest figure for any area in the nation. Not
surprisingly, <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, still mired in a construction
recession, had an expectations index of 83.7, the lowest for
any area.
   <PERSON>Carolyn Sherwood-Call</PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco
Federal Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION>, recently studied the stability of state
and regional economies between l963 and <DATE>1986</DATE>. She found the
most stable economies were those of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> -- and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>.
   As <PERSON>Ms. Sherwood-Call</PERSON> points out, a region's stability can
depend in part on its resource endowments -- and the demand
for them. Such advantages can change.
   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, for instance, benefited mightily from the
discovery of gold in the state in <DATE>1859</DATE>. A great influx of
people took place to the cry of "Pike's Peak or bust." Gold
first was panned from streams, but later miners sought the
mother lode in the mountains.
   By <DATE>1890</DATE> the gold was largely gone, but its effects
lingered. The gold miners' hunger had spurred the development
of agricultural irrigation on the state's plains, and
agriculture remains an important source of state income. This
led to cultivation of sugar beets and the development of a
major beet sugar industry. Many analysts have called
irrigation the most significant event in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s history.
The old mining towns and the old-fashioned trains that linked
them, moreover, have become major tourist attractions.
   Large deposits of iron, oil and coal helped to make
<ORGANIZATION>Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron</ORGANIZATION>, now known as <ORGANIZATION>CF&amp;I Steel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, based in
<LOCATION>Pueblo</LOCATION>, a pioneer steel producer in <DATE>1892</DATE> specializing in
railroad rails. But distances from markets and the declining
importance of railroads have contributed to the decline of
the company. The firm is now in bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> has vast oil shale deposits, but in <DATE>1982</DATE> it was
decided to abandon a synthetic-fuel project that would have
used the deposits. So the shale remains right where it was.
   During World War II, the need for metals, especially
molybdenum, spurred a new <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> industry. Molybdenum is a
soft, lustrous metallic element used in alloys, parts for
electrical resistance furnaces, and points for spark plugs,
among other things. Demand had declined, but last year the
reopening of a large molybdenum mine owned by <ORGANIZATION>Amax Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
signaled the end of that downturn.
   At present, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s four major industries are tourism,
agriculture, advanced-technology manufacturing, and energy.
High-tech manufacturing, which includes a good deal of
defense, is especially important to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, since its high
unit prices make it economic to ship products long distances
to market. And so far, the proposed defense cutbacks have had
little effect on <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>.
   Why is there so much high-tech manufacturing in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>?
"I think the big thing is life style," says <PERSON>Jerry L. Jordan</PERSON>,
chief economist of <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate</ORGANIZATION>. "You can do that kind of
thing anywhere, but the skiing is better in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. The
summers are nice, too."
   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s life style has helped to attract an educated
work force, and industries that have grown rapidly in recent
years have included printing, publishing, and food products.
Skiing has grown rapidly, almost too rapidly for the state to
handle it. New facilities continue to be built -- and
continue to overflow. State economists look for the increase
to continue as oil drilling activity picks up in nearby
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, two major sources of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s skiers.
   Denver is at work on a major new project that will aid
out-of-state skiers -- as well as <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> business: a new
airport. <PERSON>Stapleton</PERSON>, the existing airport, has over the years
become something of a national joke. Inclement weather, not
unknown in the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION>, can cut <PERSON>Stapleton</PERSON> down to one
or two runways, causing long delays. Since <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> is a major
hub serving several airlines, the weather problems can cause
systemwide delays.
   While <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> hasn't been hit as hard as other states by
economic declines, neither has it had the booms that other
areas have experienced. The only exceptions are the gold rush
of a century ago and the brief oil boom of the late <DATE>1970s</DATE> and
early <DATE>1980s</DATE>. As <PERSON>Ms. Sherwood-Call</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Fed</ORGANIZATION>
says, states can if they choose plan for rapid expansion and
risk the busts. <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, by and large, seems to have opted
for stability.

executive officer, succeeding Chester B. Stone.
   Mr. Stone retired unexpectedly last week after less than a
year at the helm of the struggling mining company. Meanwhile,
the company said it formed a search committee to look for a
"long-term solution" to the management change, Mr. Campbell
said.

<TEXT>
   The 57-year-old <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON>, a board member since <DATE>1985</DATE>
and chairman since <DATE>May</DATE>, said he will leave his post as
president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Goodman Equipment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,

will remain full-time at <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> "as long as it takes" the
board to find a permanent successor. He wouldn't say whether
he considers himself a candidate.
   "There's so much to be done at <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>, and the things that
have to be done have to be done now," <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON> said. He
said he agrees with the board that the company needs to focus
on building its coal and copper reserves and operations. He
said he expects that will require the company to increase its
debt in the coming months. Currently, long-term debt is only
about <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> of the company's capital. In addition, <PERSON>Mr. Campbell</PERSON>
said, the company needs to cut costs to become more
competitive.
   Cyprus has been struggling over the past two years with
rising costs and some troubled operations. Ore grade has been
declining at its copper mines and the company was having
problems with its smelter at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, which it planned
to idle this <DATE>spring</DATE> for rebuilding. The company also has been
plagued by poor performance of coal and molybdenum mines
acquired in the past few years.

Prospecting</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>UDC</ORGANIZATION> 622.27.001.5] 
  [Text] A department of exploitation of deposits of rare and 
radioactive metals was organized on the initiative of professor, 
<ORGANIZATION>Doctor of Technical Sciences G. N. Popov</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow Institute 
of Nonferrous Metals</ORGANIZATION> and Gold in <DATE>1949</DATE>. The tasks of the 
department included training mining engineers having facility 
with the specific features of underground exploitation of 
uranium and rare metal deposits and scientific personnel of a 
high qualification in this field, and providing methodological 
assistance to mining enterprises and to planning and research 
institutes. 
  In <DATE>1963</DATE> the department was transferred to the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow 
Institute for Geological Prospecting</ORGANIZATION>, where to this date it has 
been training mining engineers specializing in underground and 
combined exploitation of ore deposits. 
  Students are taught on the basis of individual training 
plans 
distinguished by a high volume of training in geological 
disciplines, in the use of geophysical methods in mining, and in 
the specific features of combatting occupational diseases and 
protecting and making integrated use of the subsoil. Training of 
mining engineers specifically for exploitation of stratified 
deposits was started in <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
  Each year the department accepts two groups of students. 
Training of foreign students was started in <DATE>1992</DATE> (<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Chad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> etc.), in connection with which a student group 
for the training of specialists of a broad profile--mineral 
deposit exploitation--was organized. 
  Forty-seven doctorate dissertations were defended, 145 
candidates of technical sciences were matriculated, and over 
3,160 mining engineers were trained at the department. 
  The multifaceted activity of the department's collective 
embraces a wide range of work. 
  One of the most important directions in the work of the 
department's collective is supporting the training process with 
textbooks and training aids of a modern scientific and technical 
level. 
  The department is constantly working among students to 
attract them to scientific research. Students are prepared for 
independent research, and they present reports at scientific 
conferences within the framework of a student mining circle. 
  The scientific interests of all instructors, associates and 
graduate students are oriented on developing and improving the 
procedures of underground and surface mining of nonferrous, rare 
metal and diamond deposits. 
  Fundamental research completed by the department's 
collective 
since <DATE>1963</DATE> is described below. 
  In the field of underground exploitation of mineral 
deposits. A complex of research aimed at improving the 
procedures of mining Altay polymetallic deposits was carried out 
under the leadership of Prof. <PERSON>G. N. Popov</PERSON>, merited worker of 
science and technology. 
  A broad complex of scientific research aimed at 
substantiating and creating new procedures and equipment for 
hydraulic transportation of mineral raw materials for a number 
of enterprises in rare metal industry and ferrous metallurgy was 
carried out. 
  The technical possibility and feasibility of drilling 
conveyor extraction of ore from thin sections of sandy clay 
uranium deposits were substantiated. Systems of descending 
layered excavation employing hardening filling for exploitation 
of uranium deposits presenting a fire danger were actively 
introduced. 
  A cycle of work to substantiate sensible use the reserves of 
ore deposits was carried out under the leadership of Prof. <PERSON>V. A. 
Simakov</PERSON>. In this case the concept ``sensible use of reserves'' 
was refined by the inclusion of the time and intensity of 
developing deposits into it, in addition to full extraction of 
useful components in the entire extraction-processing cycle. A 
procedure was proposed for optimizing development of mineral 
extraction, in which the intensity and time of deposit 
development ensuring minimum outlays on acquisition of the end 
product at a prescribed production volume over the years of the 
period of optimization, within the bounds of allocated materials 
and monetary resources, are determined. 
  A new indicator was introduced to describe the quality of 
development of deposits in terms of the degree of fouling of ore 
by enclosing rock--the coefficient of introduction of enclosing 
rock, which is the ratio of introduced rock to extinguished 
reserves. In distinction from the known dilution coefficient, 
its magnitude does not depend on loss of ore during mining. 
  A procedure of optimizing the level of losses and dilution 
during mining based on compensational outlays to obtain metal 
underproduced in one of the variants was created with regard for 
the proposed coefficient. Solving this problem on the basis of 
the profit from a tonne of diluted reserves, where metal prices 
are established at the level of long-term marginal costs, is a 
particular case of this procedure. The results of this research 
made up part of a project for which the group of authors, 
including Prof <PERSON>A. V. Simakov</PERSON>, was awarded the <ORGANIZATION>State Prize</ORGANIZATION> for 
<DATE>1983</DATE>. 
  Research on generalizing the minimum industrial and flank 
content of the useful component at operating and new deposits 
had important significance to lead and zinc industry. The 
impermissible scatter of their values was revealed. A proposed 
means of ordering the values of these indicators at deposits 
provided for a significant savings of resources. 
  Research on the possibilities of grade-specific mining 
showed 
that enterprises frequently do not mine ore by grades, which 
significantly reduces the economic potential. 
  Scientific research is acquiring special importance to 
mining 
enterprises in the time of transition to market relations, when 
allocation of production reserves on the basis of sensible use 
of the reserves of deposits in terms of the time and intensity 
of deposit development, loss and dilution of ore during mining, 
establishment of requirements on the ore, grade-specific and 
selective mining, and exploitation equipment and procedures are 
becoming especially important. 
  The procedures for developing complexly structured ore 
deposits by an underground method were developed under the 
leadership of Prof. <PERSON>I. A. Kovalev</PERSON>: 

  -  a phased method of conducting scientific research when 
planning and introducing new mineral extraction procedures and 
improving existing ones; 
  -  a complex of measures for improving systems of sublevel 
breaking making it possible to preserve the stability of worked 
rock in the course of developing chamber reserves; 
  -  a procedure for removing reserves without leaving chamber 
pillars behind, which raises the effectiveness of developing 
steep deposits of low and moderate thickness with insufficiently 
stable enclosing rock; 
  -  a scheme of preparing a story in which it is divided into 
blocks with geometric parameters determined by the stability of 
the worked rock mass; 
  -  a means of directed crack formation along the outer boundary 
of 
a chamber to reduce the seismic action of explosions. 

    In the field of open-cut exploitation of mineral 
deposits. 
  The following were developed under the leadership of Prof. 
Yu. I. Anistratov: 

  -  a special procedure of open-cut exploitation of diamond 
deposits in <LOCATION>Yakutia</LOCATION>, where the quarry flanks are steep (the Mir 
and Aykhal quarries, the Internatsionalnaya and Udachnaya 
tubes), for which Yu. I. Anistratov was awarded the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> State 
Prize; 
  -  a procedure for developing deposits to a considerable depth 
(over 500 m) in stories with intermediate quarry flanks close to 
the extinction angle (introduced at a number of quarries in 
nonferrous metallurgy); 
  -  an explosion-less procedure for mining crystalline raw 
material 
at kimberlite deposits of <LOCATION>Yakutia</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Arkhangel Oblast</ORGANIZATION> using 
drilling cutter-loaders; 
  -  a method of laying out quarries with a personal computer 
using 
standard elements; 
  -  an energy-based method for selecting and justifying full 
mechanization of mining operations at quarries; 
  -  a means of exposing working horizons of mountain quarries 
with 
underground workings (<ORGANIZATION>Khibiny</ORGANIZATION>, Tyrnyauz); 
  -  a method of evaluating the influence of open-cut mining on 
the 
environment, and of developing procedures providing for 
ecological balance. 

    The following were developed under the leadership of 
professors <PERSON>B. P. Yumatov</PERSON> and Zh. V. Bunin: 

  -  a sensible and safe procedure of open-cut mining for 
combined (surface-underground) exploitation of ore deposits 
(objects of research and introduction--the <ORGANIZATION>Norilsk Mining</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Metallurgical Works</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Tselinnyy Mining and Chemical Works</ORGANIZATION>, 
and the Tyrnyauz VMK [not further identified]); 
  -  procedural directives on establishing requirements on 
minerals 
in the course of exploitation of ore deposits by the open-cut 
method (objects of research and introduction--the <PERSON>Sorsk 
Molybdenum Works</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentration 
Works</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Agarak Mining</ORGANIZATION> and Concentration Works); 
  -  a procedure and a package of applications programs for 
planning 
the basic parameters of quarries with a personal computer (for 
use in a system for automated planning and control of quarries): 
the outer and intermediate boundaries of quarries, the sensible 
direction for developing the work zone, and the calendar plan of 
mining operations (objects of research--the Sorsk Molybdenum 
Works and the <ORGANIZATION>Navoi Mining</ORGANIZATION> and Metallurgical Works); 
  -  the theoretical principles of planning phased development and 
reconstruction of ore quarries (the Sorsk Molybdenum Works, and 
the Muruntau quarry of the <ORGANIZATION>Navoi Mining and Concentration 
Works</ORGANIZATION>).

   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. made a $1.25 billion bid for Peabody
Holding Co., the largest U.S. coal producer, but the offer
was immediately topped by Hanson PLC, which said it was
"determined" to complete its previously announced plans to
buy Peabody.
   Wall Street observers said that Hanson's quick response
suggested that Amax, a natural-resources company based here,
had misplayed the bid and succeeded only in drawing attention
to its own vulnerability as a possible takeover candidate.
The observers said they doubted that Amax would make a new
bid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hanson acquired <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION> last month for <MONEY>$504 million</MONEY>
from three other companies. In <DATE>March</DATE>, <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> had announced a
plan to buy the remaining <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$715 million</MONEY>
from <ORGANIZATION>Newmont Mining Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Hanson acquired a <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> stake in
<ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> by buying <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Hanson's agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> allows other bidders to
top its offer for all of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION> before the purchase is
completed in <DATE>June</DATE>, to make sure <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s public holders
receive a fair price. The <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> bid, which occurred around
noon <DATE>Friday</DATE>, valued <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION> stake at <MONEY>$718.5 million</MONEY>
-- only a slight increase on <ORGANIZATION>Hanson</ORGANIZATION>'s offer. Within two
hours, <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> boosted its bid to <MONEY>$725.6 million</MONEY>.
   An <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> spokesman wouldn't comment on whether <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> plans a
new bid. Wall Street observers said they doubted <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> would
engage in a bidding war with the much larger <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON>, a
British conglomerate with <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> in cash and interests in
tobacco, specialty chemicals, and building products,
particularly in view of <LOCATION>Hanson</LOCATION>'s stated determination.
"Hanson wants this company," said one individual close to
<LOCATION>Hanson</LOCATION>.
   But the sequence of events puzzled some observers. Said
one: "The question is why would <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> openly compete with
<PERSON>Hanson</PERSON>, and risk putting themselves in play {for a takeover},
with a bid that was such a small increase over <LOCATION>Hanson</LOCATION>'s
offer?"
   An <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> spokesman suggested <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> may have misunderstood
<ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>March 29</DATE> announcement of the <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION> sale to
<LOCATION>Hanson</LOCATION>, which stated that <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Newmont</ORGANIZATION> "would accept"
an offer above <MONEY>$1.24 billion</MONEY> for all of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION>. "Reading
that, it looks like they're inviting an offer and naming a
price," the spokesman said. "Well, we took them at their word
and now we see their response."
   <PERSON>Vahid Fahti</PERSON>, a base-metals analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Prescott Ball &amp;
Turben Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION>, said that some people might
interpret the <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> bid "as a defensive move." <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> has been
the subject of off-and-on takeover speculation in the past
six months, with unusually high trading volume in its stock.
   News of the <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION> bid hurt <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s stock price, which
declined <MONEY>12.5 cents</MONEY> a share to <MONEY>$25.25</MONEY> <DATE>Friday</DATE> in composite
trading on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> despite a strong
advance in the overall market. Some analysts value the
company's parts as high as <MONEY>$50</MONEY> a share.
   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> reported profit of <MONEY>$360.4 million</MONEY>, or <MONEY>$4.19</MONEY>
a share, on revenue of <MONEY>$3.89 billion</MONEY>. Aluminum accounted for
<PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> of its sales, coal <PERCENT>14%</PERCENT>, gold <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>, with the remainder in
molybdenum and natural gas. It has slightly less than <MONEY>$1
billion</MONEY> in debt. Its <ORGANIZATION>Amax Coal</ORGANIZATION> unit is the third-largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
producer, with <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of the market compared with <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> for <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Fahti</PERSON> said he expects <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s earnings to decline about
<PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> this year to <MONEY>$2.75</MONEY> a share, mainly due to lower aluminum
prices and softer demand in the housing and construction
markets, the end-users of much of <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s output. He said a
coal acquisition that more than doubled <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION>'s debt could
make the company "somewhat less attractive to a suitor."
   The <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> bid amounts to about 12 times <ORGANIZATION>Peabody</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1989</DATE>
profit of <MONEY>$101.9 million</MONEY> on revenue of <MONEY>$1.74 billion</MONEY>.
Although <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> doesn't have any other coal business, it has
operations in several mining industries, including cement,
gold, sand and gravel, and brick.
   Last <DATE>August</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> made a <MONEY>$2.3 billion</MONEY> bid for <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge
Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian nickel, copper and zinc producer, but was
later outbid by <ORGANIZATION>Noranda Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Trelleborg AB</ORGANIZATION>, two other
metals concerns. The <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> had been
invited to bid by <ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>, which was concerned about a
"creeping takeover" by <ORGANIZATION>Noranda</ORGANIZATION>, which had acquired <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of
<ORGANIZATION>Falconbridge</ORGANIZATION>.
   One company with a rumored interest in <ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>Peter
Kiewit Sons Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a closely held concern in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, with
interests in construction and natural resources. A spokesman
for <PERSON>Kiewit</PERSON> couldn't be reached for comment.

   An act passed by Congress in 1872 allows the giveaway each
year of billions of dollars in taxpayer-owned minerals and
land. The Mining Law of 1872 gives miners who discover
valuable mineral deposits on more than 300 million acres of
public land the right to develop the deposit, to extract
minerals without paying a royalty and to purchase the land
for at most $5 an acre.
   The Mining Act came from the same mold as the Homestead
Act, railroad grants and other policies aimed at settling the
West. Unlike those other giveaway policies, however, the
Mining Act is still widely applied, permitting companies to
buy valuable land at fire-sale prices: In September 1981,
Stocks Mill and Supply Co. purchased two sand and gravel
properties outside Las Vegas from the federal government for
$1,124. A government appraiser later assessed the market
value of the properties at more than $2 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A claimant must prove the existence of a valuable mineral
deposit in order to purchase land under the Mining Act, but
once the land is purchased there is no obligation to mine.
Mining claims have been used for a golf course near <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>
and ski areas and private residences in <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> states.
   Even more egregious than the giveaway of lands, however,
is the giveaway of minerals. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> collects no royalties
from the mining on most public lands of minerals covered by
the <DATE>1872</DATE> act, including gold, silver, copper, molybdenum and
uranium. The government doesn't even know how much it is
giving away, but our group has estimated that the gross value
of minerals removed under the <DATE>1872</DATE> act to be more than <MONEY>$4
billion</MONEY> a year.
   The Goldstrike mine in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> is the largest known gold
deposit in the country, with a gross value of roughly <MONEY>$6
billion</MONEY>. The taxpayers own both the land and the gold, but
the deposit belongs to <ORGANIZATION>American Barrick Resources</ORGANIZATION>, a
Canadian-controlled company. <ORGANIZATION>Barrick</ORGANIZATION> is free to mine the gold
without royalty or, if it chooses, to purchase the land for
<MONEY>$5</MONEY> an acre.
   The <LOCATION>Morenci</LOCATION> copper mine in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> is located on land that
was purchased by <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$5</MONEY> an acre under the <DATE>1872</DATE>
act 50 years ago. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Phelps Dodge</ORGANIZATION> mined more than <MONEY>$500
million</MONEY> in copper from <LOCATION>Morenci</LOCATION>. The mine still has an
estimated <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY> in reserves.
   The Sleeper mine in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> is one of the lowest-cost major
gold mines in the world. It is entirely owned by the people
of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> but completely controlled by <ORGANIZATION>Amax Gold</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1989</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Amax</ORGANIZATION> extracted more than <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> in gold, and made a
profit of <MONEY>$64 million</MONEY>, even after allowing for depreciation
and depletion.
   The <DATE>1872</DATE> act removes control of public land from the hands
of the public. The holder of a valid claim has an absolute
right to mine: The Mining Act grants no discretion to the
<ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> to refuse
permission to mine.
   Federal land managers have been forced to allow uranium
mining by several companies, the largest being Energy Fuels
Nuclear, on the border of <LOCATION>Grand Canyon National Park</LOCATION>; pumice
mining by Copar above the wild and scenic <LOCATION>Jemez River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION>; and mining by <ORGANIZATION>California Nickel Co.</ORGANIZATION> above the <LOCATION>Smith
River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. CooSand purchased an environmentally
sensitive area in the <ORGANIZATION>Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</ORGANIZATION>
last year in order to mine sand. Mining companies may sue the
<ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> when they
feel that rules and regulations instituted to protect other
resources -- such as timber, watersheds, wildlife or scenic
values -- interfere with the right to mine.
   The public lands are held by the federal government as a
trust; they are to be managed in the best interests of the
people of the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. The 1872 Mining Act stands as a major
obstacle to this philosophy. There have been efforts in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to reform the act for more than 100 years and these
efforts continue. It is important that reform be quick and
thorough.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines 'opportunity' for
miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINES offered some of the world's best exploration opportunities
because there had been so little mineral exploration in the past decade,
said <PERSON>Mr Tony Robbins</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining Corporation</ORGANIZATION> exploration manager,
yesterday.
Even though the country was very well-endowed with copper, gold and other
minerals, it had been left behind when the rest of the world was
experiencing a gold-driven exploration boom. This presented mining companies
with 'a window of opportunity which no longer exists in many parts of the
world'.
The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> had missed out mainly because of the political instability
associated with President <PERSON>Marcos</PERSON>'s removal from power.
<PERSON>Mr Robbins</PERSON> said there had been no systematic, grass roots exploration since
the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> since when significant advances had been made in technology.
He was speaking at a seminar in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on to mining opportunities in the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and organised by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations' Department of Technical
Co-operation for Development</ORGANIZATION>, and Mining Journal.
<PERSON>Mr Robbins</PERSON> said that, despite the lack of recent exploration activity, the
country remained among the world's big metals producers, ranking eighth in
gold, tenth in copper and sixth in chromite. The country also had deposits
of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, platinum, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt,
aluminium and mercury.
However, although <ORGANIZATION>Western Mining</ORGANIZATION> was exploring in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> in
preference to <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, there were disadvantages. Most
important was that it was enshrined in the constitution that Filipino
companies had to be 60 per cent domestically-owned. 'The result is that in
the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> the foreign investor has to carry all the risk and all the
costs and only receive 40 per cent of the prize if the exploration is
successful,' he said.
However, a strong body of responsible opinion in the country recognised the
detrimental impact of the ownership rule and he hoped the new government
would change it after the <DATE>May</DATE> elections.

FT  24 DEC 92 / Skiing: Leadville, living on a legend - Arnold Wilson visits
an old mining town which is finding new ways to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Christmas Eve, <DATE>1881</DATE>. <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>.
'WITH HUGE spruce logs crackling in the fire-place, the scene presented on
this eve of the gladsome <DATE>Christmas</DATE> is far from dispiriting. <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>, warn
out from the day's work, is asleep in his bunk, doubtless dreaming of the
yule log and mistletoe, and fat stockings and plum pudding. Summers and
<ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> are enjoying a game of cards called 'hunky-punky' over there by the
fire, and I am not so sure but that their thoughts also are far away,
mingling unconsciously with those of loved ones in distant <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>
homes.'
<PERSON>Albert Morrison</PERSON>, a young prospector started this letter to his impoverished
mother and fiancee, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>New York State</LOCATION>.
'As tomorrow will be Christmas Day,' he wrote, 'I will have plenty of time
to complete this letter . . .'
But the letter never was finished. At one minute after <TIME>midnight</TIME>, the shack
shared by four prospectors was enveloped by a snow-slide leaving the men
frozen as in a tableau of life, with <PERSON>Albert</PERSON>'s hand still holding his pen.
The scene later described by a rescue party provided an enduring myth for
the highest skiing town in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
Some 101 years later, it is a freezing night in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> - sometimes known
as the 'city in the clouds'. Ski lift operators from the local resort of <ORGANIZATION>Ski
Cooper</ORGANIZATION> and further afield at <ORGANIZATION>Copper Mountain</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Breckenridge</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION> have
returned to their homes for the night. The ornate, relic-filled and slightly
kitsch <ORGANIZATION>Silver Dollar Saloon</ORGANIZATION> has emptied on to a street corner. And Attorney
<PERSON>Neil V. Reynolds</PERSON>, the local judge, puts his Holmesian pipe down and picks up
a microphone.
'Ladies and gentleman,' he announces. 'We have just heard that <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION>
has arrived in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>]'
There are cheers from a smallish crowd of children and parents who have
assembled on the sidewalk outside the white courthouse - all exhaling
dragon's breath as the temperature dives in the town which is perched at
10,150 ft beneath <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s highest peaks: <LOCATION>Mount Elbert</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mount Massive</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s Christmas tree - a mere 12ft high - is about to be illuminated.
There is a NASA-style countdown to the big moment.
'Five-four-three-two-one-ZERO]' It is a small flicker for mankind as a score
of tiny - almost pathetic - fairy lights are switched on. The little tree
does not exactly light up the sky. But it is symbolic of a special town. A
town that has twice been left for dead. And twice refused to die.
<LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> - past residents included <PERSON>Jesse James</PERSON>, <PERSON>Doc Holliday</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wyatt Earp</PERSON>
 -is one of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s oldest mining centres. In <DATE>1893</DATE>, when along with other
old mining towns which were later to become famous ski resorts, such as
<LOCATION>Aspen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Telluride</LOCATION>, Crested Butte, <LOCATION>Breckenridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Park City</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Alta</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>
had its heart torn out by a government decision to end the silver standard.
The boom years of silver were over.
Christmasses in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> became bleak: if they were lucky, children
received an orange, a stocking full of candy, a brief chat with <PERSON>Santa Claus</PERSON>
and a visit to the Dreamland or Empire Theatre to see the latest film.
While <PERSON>Breckenridge</PERSON> became an official ghost town, with a population of just
seven, and the other mining towns struggled for survival, the mining
community at <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> picked themselves up and started again with a
different quarry: molybdenum, used as a strengthening agent in steels.
Molybdenum was certainly a strengthening agent for <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>. The town
thrived again, until almost exactly a century after the silver crash,
competition from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, where molybdenum could be produced
more cheaply, brought the town's second mining era to a close.
Today there are still working mines dotted around <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, but unlike the
good old bad old days, they are now run by small groups of amateurs, or so
highly mechanised that they no longer provide much employment for
<LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>'s close-knit, hardy populace.
What makes <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> tick and survive today is skiing in <DATE>winter</DATE> - and
tourism in <DATE>summer</DATE>. Ski <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> is a fairly small, hillbilly ski area seven
miles from <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>. At <LOCATION>Chicago Ridge</LOCATION>, there is some excellent snowcat
skiing on runs such as Leaning Tree Drop-off, <ORGANIZATION>Heavenly Traverse</ORGANIZATION>, Tree Shots,
<LOCATION>Middle Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buckeye Trees</ORGANIZATION>.
Richard 'Rocket' <PERSON>Mathews</PERSON> drives the cat and <PERSON>Stu Schaefer</PERSON> guides (they
exchange roles from time to time.) The resort, where troops of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s
celebrated 10th <ORGANIZATION>Mountain Division</ORGANIZATION> trained during the war, is ideal for
families with its moderately gentle terrain. Apart from weekends, the trails
are empty. So with the once-celebrated mines in <LOCATION>California Gulch</LOCATION> long since
fallen silent, there are few options for those seeking employment. One is
working in the resorts of Copper, <LOCATION>Breckenridge</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Keystone</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Arapahoe Basin</LOCATION>.
There is a housing shortage in those resorts which brings pressure to live
out of town. <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>, where housing is much cheaper since the mining boom
went bust, is an obvious choice. So daily, mountain staff have to make the
cold and sometimes dangerous journey to and from work. Sometimes the road is
blocked by snow. But however hazardous such commuting may be, nothing
compares with the regular tragedies experienced down the mines. In one
seven-month period during <DATE>May, 1880</DATE>, 26 miners were killed and almost 50
seriously injured in accidents.
Of these 62 per cent were 'shaft-related', 26 per cent were caused by
mishandled or faulty explosives, four per cent by cave-ins and rock-falls,
four per cent by fumes, fire and suffocation and a final four per cent by
drowning or crushing. But the death of <PERSON>Albert Morrison</PERSON> and his friends was
perhaps the saddest.
<LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> arrives in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> this month in a glistening, new fire engine
on which is inscribed: '<LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lake County Fire &amp; Rescue</ORGANIZATION>'. Under the
red costume and white beard is <PERSON>Jim O'Neil</PERSON>, who is 75 and has been playing
the role for decades. Like almost every other elderly man in <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>, he
used to work at a local mine.
'Now give a big welcome to <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION>,' says <PERSON>Judge Reynolds</PERSON>.
<LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> is still searching for its role in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>. With such
resilient folk, <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> will probably get by for the time being with
skiing and tourism. But if you ask <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON> what the citizens of <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION>
will do in the long term, now that the mining era is over, he says: 'We
haven't decided yet.'

<FÊP=106> [Article by V. Smyk: "Even Metal Cannot Withstand It"] </F>
  [Text] The team of monetarists pushed us into a 
financial and economic crisis and then left. We shall seek to 
resolve it, "that was the way <PERSON>Vladimir Zimovetsk</PERSON>, director of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Volga Tube-Rolling Plant</ORGANIZATION>, explained the goal of the field 
session of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [<ORGANIZATION>Russian 
Federation Committee on Metallurgy</ORGANIZATION>] which gathered executives of 
the branch, directors of the largest metallurgy enterprises in 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Staryy Oskol</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Today it is more difficult for tube-rolling production 
workers than for others. In five months the sub-branch cut its 
production in half. In ferrous metallurgy the decline continues 
for almost all types of production, while in the case of the 
producers of tungsten concentrate it is particularly significant 
amounting to <PERCENT>74.3 percent</PERCENT>. 
  The loss of the domestic market is taking place primarily 
due 
to the lack of an effective demand. But not only because of 
that. The speech by <PERSON>Serafim Afonin</PERSON>, chairman of 
<LOCATION>Roskommetallurgiya</LOCATION>, for instance, contained the following fact: 
ZIL [<ORGANIZATION>Moscow Automobile I. A. Likhachev Plant</ORGANIZATION>] and <ORGANIZATION>AZLK</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Moscow 
Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant</ORGANIZATION>] are in a disastrous 
situation, but the metal-cutting tool containing tungsten and 
molybdenum, however is acquired by them not from the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow Hard 
Alloy Combine</ORGANIZATION>, but from abroad, and they pay for it with foreign 
currency. Production capacities of tube-rolling plants, built on 
a latch-key basis by foreign firms, stand idle while <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 
acquires many <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> in credit and 
purchases pipes abroad for trunk pipelines. The Tyrnyauz 
Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine has been idled together with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Lysvenskiy Metallurgical Plant</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Here is a typical example. Import duties were reduced or 
completely eliminated last year on the initiative of 
Roskommetallurgiya. These and other preferential terms gave the 
branch enterprises <MONEY>500 billion rubles</MONEY> [R]. It was proposed to 
use that for investments. The enterprises, however, invested not 
130 billion as planned but a total of only R15 billion. As a 
result the building of the <PERSON>Yakovlev</PERSON> Mine for the mining of ore 
with a <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> iron content and other projects of interest to 
all ferrous metallurgy enterprises was disrupted. 
  Metallurgists understand that if they confine themselves 
within the framework of their branch, they will be unable to 
resolve their problems. They are in the same group with power 
engineers and transportation workers, and it is necessary to 
balance the interests of each link. That can be accomplished if 
one includes another link: the government. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA recently wrote that German railways suffer 
annual losses of <MONEY>seven billion marks</MONEY>. This with distances that 
are insignificant compared to those in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and the higher 
level of equipment. The government covers this loss, 
understanding that without such a measure the country would 
simply be losing export income. <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in particular cannot 
neglect such a measure if we do not want our railroads and ports 
to die out. Already at the present time metallurgical 
enterprises are changing the routes for their freight since for 
many of them Baltic and Ukrainian ports are more advantageous 
than Russian ones. 
  The collegium stressed that the government must at least 
finance investments in power engineering and transportation. 
That measure, first of all, would permit a significant lowering 
of tariffs without freezing, and secondly, funds necessary to 
modernize and lower the cost of these branches would not create 
a burden on the entire economy. 
  A hospital, built for the city by the <ORGANIZATION>Staryy Oskol 
Electrometallurgical Plant</ORGANIZATION>, was opened on the eve of the 
collegium session at <ORGANIZATION>Staryy Oskol</ORGANIZATION>. It is a magnificent building 
with modern medical equipment. The city cannot take it over at 
the present time which means the combine will have to operate 
it. With what funds? The metallurgists believe one of the 
solutions to be a lowering of taxes by an amount equivalent to 
expenditures on the maintenance of such facilities. At any rate 
they do not intend shouldering that burden indefinitely. After 
all the metallurgists must include the maintenance of the social 
sphere in the cost of all production and these expenditures 
equal those on wages. 
  Executives in metallurgy worked out a number of concrete 
measures designed to resolve the economic crisis. They are being 
summarized and will be proposed to the government. The decree 
adopted at <ORGANIZATION>Staryy Oskol</ORGANIZATION> begins with the words: "Having studied 
the economic state of branch enterprises, the Collegium of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy</ORGANIZATION> views it as highly 
critical one."

PLACER <ORGANIZATION>Dome</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>'s leading gold producers, suffered halved
<DATE>first-quarter</DATE> income, with lower prices, higher costs and slack base metal
sales more than offsetting a <MONEY>5 per cent</MONEY> rise in bullion output.
The Vancouver-based company reported net earnings of CDollars 17.6m
(USDollars 15m), or <MONEY>7 cents</MONEY> a share, down from CDollars 35.1m, or <MONEY>15 cents</MONEY> a
share, a year earlier. Revenues fell to CDollars 256.8m from CDollars
299.9m.
Gold earnings tumbled to CDollars 10.6m from CDollars 25.9m. The company's
share of production rose to 357,000 oz from 337,000 oz, thanks to the
contribution of the new Porgera mine in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION>, which produced a
total of 224,800 oz in the quarter.
But the realised gold price of USDollars 410 per oz was 6 per cent lower
than a year earlier, and total production costs advanced to an average of
USDollars 336 from USDollars 321 per oz. Cash costs were up 27 per cent.
The higher costs were ascribed to lower output at the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Mine</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>northern Ontario</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Misima</LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION>Papua New Guinea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Kidston</LOCATION>
property in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
Earnings from other metals, notably copper, silver and molybdenum were
CDollars 1.5m, down from CDollars 7.2m. <LOCATION>Placer</LOCATION> said hedging will ensure it
receives at least USDollars 435 an oz for 61 per cent of its <DATE>1991</DATE> gold
output.
A study on the <ORGANIZATION>Mount Milligan</ORGANIZATION> property in <LOCATION>British Columbia</LOCATION> should be
completed this <DATE>summer</DATE>. Preliminary studies point to a mine with a capital
cost of CDollars 440m, which could produce 280,000 oz of gold and 80m lbs of
copper a year.

<HL> WHAT'S NEW:
New 'Sniffer'
Finds Explosives

   Explosives hidden in luggage can be detected by a new "sniffer." 

   Explosives like <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION>, nitroglycerine and plastique constantly emit vaporous traces of nitrogen-oxygen compounds that leak through any container into the surrounding air. 
Molecules of these compounds can be detected by a mass spectrometer, a laboratory instrument that identifies molecules on the basis of their weight or mass. 

   Analytical chemists at the federal <ORGANIZATION>Oak Ridge National Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> are developing a computerized, compact mass spectrometer that can be used at such places as security checkpoints at airports, military installations and power plants. 
A fan blows surrounding air through the instrument. 
The computer, which will pick up traces of the vapors at concentrations of only a few parts per billion parts of air, determines if the air contains molecules of the vapors from explosives. 
Unlike trained dogs, which are equally good at sniffing out explosives, the instrument can operate around the clock. 

   A laboratory bench version of the sniffer was about a cubic yard in size and cost about <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY>, says <PERSON>Gary L. Glish</PERSON>, one of the developers. 
A more compact version is now being built for field testing. 
Costs should come down if the instrument is produced commercially, <PERSON>Mr. Glish</PERSON> says. 

   Tests show the sniffer is highly specific for explosives -- that is, it won't sound false alarms. 
Variations could be made to detect flammable liquids or illegal drugs, <PERSON>Mr. Glish</PERSON> says. 

   Inhalable Insulin
   Inhalable insulin for diabetics passes a crucial test. 

   Taking insulin by nasal spray would be far more convenient than injections. 
But the insulin currently used for injections can't be absorbed through the nose's mucous membranes. 
So researchers have long sought a detergent that will break the insulin down to absorbable size. 

   One such inhalable insulin was tested at <ORGANIZATION>Boston University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> on six patients with Type I diabetes, the kind that requires insulin injections from childhood. 
The patients took their usual morning injection of slow-acting insulin to maintain a minimum level throughout the day. 
But at mealtimes, when they normally would have taken an extra injection to deal with the meal, they inhaled an insulin dose. 
It was as effective as the injection in holding down blood sugar but acted faster and disappeared more quickly from the blood stream, more closely mimicking the body's natural production of insulin following meals, according to <PERSON>Renate Kimmerle</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Melby</PERSON> of the endocrinology department. 

   In the first tests, the insulin aerosol irritated the nasal membranes. 
So, the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> researchers are now testing a new version. 
In addition, intranasal insulin wouldn't replace a morning injection of long-acting insulin, and several times as much insulin has to be used intranasally as injected for the same effect. 
But the convenience of using the spray at mealtimes may be worth the extra cost for many diabetics. 

   Other inhalable insulins are under test at <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Beth Israel Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
Once researchers settle on the most effective versions, large-scale clinical trials, taking two to three years, must be done before inhalable insulins are available, <PERSON>Dr. Kimmerle</PERSON> cautions. 

   Killing Termites
   A new termite killer grows out of a serendipitous discovery. 

   Six years ago, researchers at the <LOCATION>Madison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, labs of <ORGANIZATION>Agricetus Inc.</ORGANIZATION> were studying how certain bacteria take nitrogen from the air and "fix" it into compounds that can be used by plants for food. 
The company, jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION>Cetus Corp</ORGANIZATION>, a biotechnology firm, and <ORGANIZATION>W.R. Grace &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a farm chemicals maker, specializes in genetic engineering for agriculture. 
Among the nitrogen-fixing microbes they looked at: a strain that has a unique symbiotic relationship with termites, living in the termites' intestines and providing them with nitrogen nutrients. 

   The termite-dwelling bacteria happen to use molybdenum and tungsten as part of their nitrogen-fixing chemistry. 
So the researchers fed the termites various molybdenum and tungsten compounds to determine the role of these metals. 
The bacteria continued to fix nitrogen but -- for a still-unknown reason -- the termites died. 
The compounds were patented in <DATE>1983</DATE> but insecticide makers had little interest. 

   Now commercial interest rises as new government restrictions are placed on insecticides used against termites. 
Argricetus recently licensed a Japanese company to formulate and test the molybdenum termiticides and is ready to license companies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and other countries.
