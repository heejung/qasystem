<P>
They call themselves the <PERSON>Ju Wasi</PERSON>, meaning "correct people," and survive in 
eastern <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, descendants of the Bushmen who first inhabited the desert 
there 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first, we have become the last. We must do something quickly," 
said <ORGANIZATION>Tsanko Toma</ORGANIZATION>. He heads a farming cooperative and acts as spokesman for 
about 600 Bushmen in the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>1981</DATE>, they have gathered in 14 villages like this one south of Tsumkwe, 
one of the n'lore, their term for "the place we belong to," the land around the 
ancestral watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
The South African administration gave them everything they had never had and 
never desired: a school, a clinic, a church and a prison. But they also 
discovered what they were not expecting: malnutrition, alcoholism, despair, 
early death. 
</P>
<P>
Now they call Tsumkwe "the place of death," said <PERSON>Megam Biesele</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Bushman 
Development Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, a private body aiding the 600 Bushmen. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, several thousand were still hunting and gathering in 
the <LOCATION>Kalahari</LOCATION>. But in <DATE>1960</DATE> the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> allocated territory on ethnic 
lines, and the Bushmen lost <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of their land. 
</P>
<P>
Living traditionally in groups of 40 to 50, with no practice of central 
organization and leadership to state their case, they were unsuited to 
competitive society, Megam Biesele explained. 
</P>
<P>
Tsumkwe lies at the end of a sandy 125 miles of arrow-straight road, and the 
sight of humans along the isolated road is like an apparition. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few houses for whites, while the Bushmen live in huts, many around 
the military base of the South African army's 203rd Battalion. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have been using more than 500 Bushmen as trackers, but by next 
<DATE>November</DATE> the troops will have left under the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> independence plan for 
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. There will be no more wages for the trackers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all going to starve," warned American anthropologist <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON>, 
the creator of the <ORGANIZATION>Bushman Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Tsanko Toma</PERSON>, who said he was born "somewhere around <DATE>1940</DATE>," is emerging as a 
leader in a society that has no hierarchy of its own. 
</P>
<P>
He started the week in <LOCATION>Windhoek</LOCATION>, the territorial capital, meeting South African 
Administrator-General <PERSON>Louis Pienaar</PERSON> to "set out all the problems of the land." 
</P>
<P>
A particular concern was to voice fears that neighboring Herero tribesmen have 
designs on Bushman lands. 
</P>
<P>
Then he did the rounds of the villages, where the once nomadic Bushmen are 
trying to settle down as farmers and stock raisers, to tell them all he had 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
He made a similar tour after talks with <PERSON>Daniel Tjongarero</PERSON>, head of the internal 
branch of the main black nationalist grouping the <ORGANIZATION>South West Africa People's 
Organization</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO, whose guerrilla armed wing took up arms against <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s presence in 
the territory nearly a quarter of a century ago, is widely expected to win the 
general election scheduled for <DATE>November</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Tsanko did not know which party he will vote for. It will be "a new day" after 
independence, but the <PERSON>Ju Wasi</PERSON> does not yet know how to take part in government, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow tribesman Gaishay, from the cooperative in <LOCATION>Naru Na</LOCATION> village, said he felt 
that none of the political parties was ready to give any thought to the future 
of the Bushmen. 
</P>
<P>
Children and old people watched in the village square as he spoke with the 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
As evening drew near, some men and women -- the sexes have always been on an 
equal footing among the Bushmen -- went off to do some hunting. 
</P>
<P>
As they have for thousands of years, they used bows and poisoned arrows. 
</P>
<P>
They are not allowed to have rifles. That is a privilege reserved for white 
tourists who come to shoot elephants and lions in <LOCATION>Bushmanland</LOCATION>.

   A pregnant woman, her husband and their
2-year-old son were rescued after being stranded in the <LOCATION>Kalahari
Desert</LOCATION> for nine days, a relative said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Jonathan Hayman</PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON>Laura</PERSON>, and their son, <LOCATION>Romano</LOCATION>, were
driving across the <ORGANIZATION>Central Kalahari Game Reserve</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Feb. 23</DATE> when
their truck broke down, said <PERSON>Lawrence Wright</PERSON>, a cousin of <PERSON>Hayman</PERSON>.
   After three days, the <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> family ran out of food and water
and began walking back toward their hometown of <LOCATION>Serowe</LOCATION>, more than
120 miles away, <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> said.
   The mother and child were too weak to continue after three days,
but <PERSON>Hayman</PERSON>, 24, continued and was found by farm workers <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Botswana Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> helicopter located <PERSON>Mrs. Hayman</PERSON> and her
son, <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> said.
   ``I had given up hope,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Hayman</PERSON>, 23. ``I thought we
were both dead.''
   She said she and her son survived by sucking the moisture off
plants during the night. Daytime temperatures in the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>
often reach above 100 degrees time of year.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the golden glow of the <LOCATION>Kalahari
Desert</LOCATION>, the Bushmen live in nomadic simplicity virtually unchanged
for thousands of years.
   At the seaside resort of <LOCATION>Swakopmund</LOCATION>, descendants of German
settlers converse in their mother tongue over wiener schnitzel and
beer at sidewalk cafes.
   In the dusty town of <LOCATION>Rehoboth</LOCATION>, virtually all 20,000 residents
are of mixed-race and insist on being called ``Bastards.''
   <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s vast, rugged landscape has only 1.3 million people,
but they make up an anthropological laboratory of 11 ethnic groups
who often put tribe before country and are linked not by culture
nor tradition.
   With independence from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> expected early next year,
Namibians still are searching for a sense of nationhood to bond
people who share little but common boundaries.
   Witchcraft cases are tried under a Western legal system.
Mercedes-Benzes and donkey-drawn carts kick up dust along the same
rural roads. Black women with a week's worth of groceries perched
on their heads shop alongside white women in fur coats in this
modern capital.
   At political rallies arranged by the <ORGANIZATION>South-West Africa People's
Organization</ORGANIZATION>, the faction favored to win <DATE>November</DATE>'s
pre-independence elections, speeches are delivered in English, then
translated into four African languages.
   ``<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> is not a nation at this point,'' said <PERSON>Hans Diergaardt</PERSON>,
leader of the <LOCATION>Rehoboth Basters</LOCATION>. ``There are too many different
groups that have been kept apart for too long.''
   Diergaardt and his fellow Basters, the Afrikaans-language word
for ``bastards,'' epitomize the stubborn independence that
permeates <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s multi-tribal society.
   The product of liaisons between whites and blacks in <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cape Province</LOCATION>, the Basters left that region in search of
farmland and independence in <DATE>1868</DATE> and settled the deserted
missionary village of <LOCATION>Rehoboth</LOCATION>, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION>Windhoek</LOCATION>.
   They identify with neither whites nor blacks and have
steadfastly refused to recognize the authority of the German
colonialists or their South African successors.
   They now oppose <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s planned one-person, one-vote elections.
   ``A unitary state in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> is not going to work,'' said
<PERSON>Diergaardt</PERSON>, a husky farmer whose weathered face speaks of years
spent in the African sun.
   Diergaardt has threatened to unilaterally declare Rehoboth an
independent state if the Basters are dissatisfied with <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s
elected government.
   For the past several years the Basters have prepared for such a
move by purchasing land that separates their territory from
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> port of <LOCATION>Walvis Bay</LOCATION>, about 180 miles away. They've bought
250,000 acres and need about <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> to secure enough land for a
corridor to the sea, <PERSON>Diergaardt</PERSON> said.
   Like the Basters, the diminutive Bushmen have found little in
common with other Namibians.
   Entirely self-sufficient, the Bushmen thrive in the seemingly
inhospitable Kalahari with extraordinary hunting and gathering
skills.
   They are among the most primitive people on earth, rarely
building fixed settlements or making regular contact with other
groups.
   Most of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s 30,000 Bushmen have begun to join the modern
world, including hundreds employed by the South African-led
security forces as trackers in the 23-year-old bush war against
<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas.
   Equally untouched by Western culture are the Himbas of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s
barren northwest corner, who wear minimal clothing and smear their
bodies with a rancid mixture of butter and ochre that gives them a
distinctive orange tint.
   The Himbas have repeatedly rejected Western missionaries, while
their cousins, the Hereros, accepted them to such an extent that
the women still dress in brightly colored <DATE>19th-century</DATE> Victorian
dresses that seem incongruous in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s scorching climate.
   Most of the original missionaries and settlers were Germans,
whose influence remains strong.
   The <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Swakopmund</LOCATION> features turn-of-the-century
German architecture set against the alien terrain of the <ORGANIZATION>Namib
Desert</ORGANIZATION>. Visitors are more likely to be greeted in German than the
official languages of English and <LOCATION>Afrikaans</LOCATION>.
   German descendents, who account for about 20,000 of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s
75,000 whites, are prominent in business throughout the territory,
but generally stay out of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s tangled politics, which until
recently included 47 parties.
   Far from <LOCATION>Swakopmund</LOCATION>'s European charm, the Kavango people of
northeastern <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> remain wedded to tribal customs.
   In one case, a suspected Kavango arsonist received the
traditional punishment from his tribal elders _ he was ordered to
dig his own grave then lie in it, where he was buried alive,
according to court records.
   Three tribal elders were convicted of the killing, but received
only suspended sentences.
   Suspected witches have been thrown into rivers with stones tied
around their necks. If they drown, it is considered proof they were
witches; if they survive, then they were falsely accused, according
to tradition.
   <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> abandoned most of its segregation laws in the <DATE>late
1970</DATE>'s and early <DATE>1980</DATE>'s, and the racial climate is more relaxed
than in neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   But under <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> rule, <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s tribal differences were
formalized with the creation of 11 separate ethnic governments that
had considerable autonomy.
   <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s first independent government will face the difficult
task of establishing itself as a national authority that remains
sensitive to local customs.

THE VOICE OF THUNDER by <PERSON>Laurens</PERSON> van der <ORGANIZATION>Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99</ORGANIZATION>,
229 pages
SIR LAURENS van der <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> has led a life of adventure - soldier in the
jungles of the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, explorer of the deserts of <LOCATION>Southern Africa</LOCATION>, great
white hunter. Like a character in a <PERSON>John Buchan</PERSON> novel, he is equally at home
in tent and palace, welcomed, trusted and consulted as sincerely in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>
as in <LOCATION>Belgravia</LOCATION>.
Unlike the predecessors who trampled uncomprehendingly over local cultures,
he was sensitive and sympathetic. He understood that simple technology does
not imply simple minds; that peoples without books may share rich resources
of legendary traditions; and that those whose lives are precariously
balanced retain an understanding of the changing seasons, the vital force of
rain and sun, our kinship with animals, and other aspects of humanity which
are lost or obscured in the comfortable <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
Van der Post wrote marvellous books. He was quick to exploit television when
it was new and to help change old attitudes. To the post-imperial generation
brought up in this country after the war, as well as to recent
environmentalists and conservationists, <PERSON>Laurens</PERSON> van der Post is a modern
hero.
His new book The <ORGANIZATION>Voice of Thunder</ORGANIZATION> brings together two pieces written some
years ago,'The Little Memory' and 'The Great Memory', and a recent essay,
'The Other Journey'. The earlier pieces are classic van der Post, part
autobiography, part good yarn about the desert, interspersed with
observations and speculations about how the bushmen of the Kalahari see the
world and how we can share their wisdom.
The new essay has no narrative, it is an old man's meditation on the story
of the Odyssey, the perpetual cycle of departure, return and departure which
he sees as intrinsic to all lives.
As he has grown older, van der Post's mystical streak has become more
pronounced. He is sure he has a message to pass on, but it is hard to pin
down what exactly it is. The ancient Greeks would have recognised his awe at
the power of nature as a sense of the divine, Pan in the woods, Nereids in
the <LOCATION>Ocean</LOCATION>, without implying a personal deity or an intended discoverable
design. The romantic poets shared his vision of the mountains, the torrents
and the deserts as metaphors of the tempests and aridities of life. Jung,
whom van der Post knew personally, suggested the concept of the collective
unconscious, the cumulative effect of heredity and experience, which is
unique to each individual but of which a good deal is also shared with other
human beings.
Van der <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> sees a revealed secret in the urge of the unconscious to become
conscious. Perhaps, he suggests elsewhere, everything in the universe is
synchronised. The metaphor of a journey can give shape to recurring patterns
in human lives. Mixing personal experience with fragments of science, myth
and literature, drawing on a quotation here and a famous name there, van der
Post constantly risks appearing banal and confused. He is a remarkable man,
but wonderment and benevolence are not, by themselves, enough to make a poet
or a philosopher.

<HEAD>Pope Calls On Catholics To Help Discrimination Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standing on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s doorstep,
Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> called on the people of this desert nation
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to assist victims of racial discrimination who are
``deprived of their legitimate rights.''
   The pope, on a one-day visit to diamond-rich and bone-dry
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, praised the nation as ``an island of peace in a troubled
sea.''
   <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, a landlocked country of 1.1 million people, has never
fought a battle in its 22 years of independence despite bordering
such turbulent places as <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``You are a peace-loving and friendly people who believe in the
basic equality and human dignity of every man and woman,'' the
pontiff told about 2,000 people who greeted him at the airport,
including a choir of bare-breasted, teen-age schoolgirls.
   Later, in a speech at the Cathedral of Christ the King, the
pontiff clearly referred to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and its apartheid policies
of racial segregation, without mentioning the country by name.
   ``You have witnessed the plight of those who are subjected by
law to discrimination,'' the pontiff told the audience in <LOCATION>Gaborone</LOCATION>,
10 miles from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s northern border. ``I gladly support
your desire to be close to those who are unjustly deprived of their
legitimate rights and lack decent living conditions.''
   The pope arrived <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, the first stop on his
five-nation tour of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   He travels <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to <LOCATION>Lesotho</LOCATION>, a mountain kingdom surrounded
by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, where he is likely to make additional comments on
apartheid. The pontiff is not visiting <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> on this trip
but the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> has said he may do so in the future.
   At an afternoon mass in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s national stadium, <PERSON>John Paul</PERSON>
renewed his call for regional peace to a crowd of 50,000 _ more
than <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s entire Catholic population of 45,000. Several
thousand of those attending were from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, according to
church officials.
   ``What are the causes of humanity's fears?'' the pontiff said.
``It is the absence of justice and peace in our lives, and in the
world, that so often troubles us and arouses our fears.''
   ``Nation still lifts sword against nation. There is much
training for war,'' he said.
   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has raided <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> several times in past years
killing alleged guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The pope was serenaded by several hundred members of a women's
choir and received gifts from Catholic parishes around the country.
Two parishes from western <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> brought crosses they had carried
by foot and car across the Kalahari desert, which makes up <PERCENT>80
percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> has a Western-style, multiparty democracy, a rarity in
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. Diamond mines make it relatively wealthy on the continent
but it remains heavily dependent economically on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   On papal matters, the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the pope would return
to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> next year, with stops in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> and the island nation
of <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION>.
   There has been speculation that the trip, expected next <DATE>May</DATE>,
also may include <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Joaquim
Navarrro</PERSON>, traveling with the pope, said neither country was ``on
the program,'' although he confirmed that Angolan bishops had
recently sent an invitation to the pope.

   Voters stood in long lines under
pouring rain <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to vote for a new Parliament for <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>,
one of the few African nations with regular, multiparty elections.
   The conservative <ORGANIZATION>Botswana Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> was expected to
retain its comfortable majority. It has governed this diamond-rich
country since independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 23 years ago and supervised
a capitalist economy that has made <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s most
prosperous states.
   Eight political parties contested the elections. The polls
closed at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> but final results were not expected until <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   There were no reports of turnout. About 360,000 people over the
age of 21 were eligible to vote.
   It was the sixth general election in this landlocked country in
southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> country since independence in <DATE>1966</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, now led by President <PERSON>Quett Masire</PERSON>, has won
all the elections. It held 28 of the 34 seats in the former
<ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
   The socialist <ORGANIZATION>Botswana National Front</ORGANIZATION> held five seats and
controls the city council in <LOCATION>Gaborone</LOCATION>, the capital of this nation
of 1.2 million people.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Botswana People's Party</ORGANIZATION> had one parliamentary seat, which it
was expected to lose. The other five parties were not expected to
win any seats.
   Masire's party was expected to maintain its advantage because of
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s booming economy, which has grown at least <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT>
annually through the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Diamonds from the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>, along with cattle ranching,
provide most of the wealth.
   When <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> gained independence it was among the world's 20
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of less than <MONEY>$100</MONEY>.
Today the average yearly income is more than <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>, one of the
highest in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   On a continent crippled by foreign debt, <ORGANIZATION>Botwana</ORGANIZATION>'s government
has spent cautiously. The country has foreign reserves in excess of
<MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>.
   Masire, who has been president since <DATE>1980</DATE>, has avoided large,
expensive public works projects and his administration concentrated
on small-scale development.
   In foreign affairs, his government has been critical of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s policies of racial discrimination, but it has kept close
business ties with its powerful southern neighbor.
   <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s army has never fought a battle, even though the
country is surrounded by such tumultuous lands as <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Botswana National Front</ORGANIZATION> has said it can win seats in larger
towns where jobs and houses are in short supply. The front also
claims <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s wealth has not reached ordinary workers and
declaried it would establish more social welfare programs.

Can she trust him? 
The plot, taken from the novel by <PERSON>Dan Jenkins</PERSON>, sounds like typical TV-movie fare. 
But the writing, script, country music and local color (never mind local off-color) are outstanding.

Just south of <PERSON>Victoria Falls</PERSON>, in the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Okavango River</LOCATION> forms an extraordinary inland delta. 
This three-part "Nature" miniseries presents the history of the area and its amazingly rich flora and fauna, including bat-eared foxes, dancing ostriches, shrimp-eating flamingos and leaping bush babies. 

   Tuesdays, <DATE>Feb. 23</DATE> and <DATE>March 1</DATE>, <TIME>8-9 p.m. EST</TIME>, on PBS: "Battles in the War on Cancer." 
Remember Interleukin-2, the miracle cancer drug that made headlines back in <DATE>1985</DATE>? 
The first part of this special edition of "NOVA" examines the mounting costs of testing this (or any) new drug, while the second part brings more heartening news about better detection and treatment of breast cancers.

Until recently, he did so as an official spokesman for Gosteleradio, so it's puzzling to see a <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> press release call him "the unofficial voice of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>." 
Perhaps by scrutinizing this documentary, we can figure out whose "Pozner file" the film makers used. 

   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 24, 9-10</DATE><TIME>:30 p.m. EST</TIME>, on PBS: "<PERSON>Billy Galvin</PERSON>." 
Like the <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> film mentioned above, this tale of Irish blue-collar <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> has a predictable TV-movie plot: generational conflict between an independent son (<PERSON>Lenny Van Dohlen</PERSON>) and his strong-willed father (Karl Malden). 
But also like the <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> film, this "American Playhouse" presentation offers a rich sense of place. 
The language is wonderful, and the actors even rise to the challenge of approximating the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> accent! 

   <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 26</DATE>, 9-10<TIME>:30 p.m. EST</TIME>, on PBS: "Wolf Trap Salutes Dizzy Gillespie." 
<PERSON>Oscar Peterson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carmen McRae</PERSON>, <PERSON>Benny Carter</PERSON> and other jazz greats gathered last <DATE>June</DATE> to pay tribute, on his <DATE>70th birthday</DATE>, to the man with the rubber cheeks and the tip-tilted horn. 
The show also includes excellent film clips of past performances with the likes of <PERSON>John Coltrane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlie Parker</PERSON>. 

   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 27</DATE>, 10 p.m.-midnight EST, on PBS: "Firing Line Special Edition: The Next First Lady." 
No, the hosts of this interview program -- <PERSON>William F. Buckley Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Strauss</PERSON> -- do not know who the next First Lady will be. 
But they will be talking with all the possibilities, except <PERSON>Jacqueline Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON>. 

   <DATE>Sunday-Monday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 28-29</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. EST</TIME>, on CBS: "Bluegrass." 
That graceful filly <PERSON>Cheryl Ladd</PERSON> plays a would-be member of the high-stepping <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> horsebreeding set, only to be thwarted by a colicky, bad-tempered stud played by <PERSON>Wayne Rogers</PERSON>. 
But she's got the right bloodlines and the best training, and soon leaves her dainty hoof prints in all the right places. 

   <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 29</DATE>, <TIME>8-9 p.m. EST</TIME>, on CBS: "Superman's 50th Anniversary: A Celebration of the Man of Steel." 
Muhammad Ali, <PERSON>Hal Holbrook</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jimmy Breslin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lee Salk</PERSON> and many others will sing the praises of this icon of American popular culture, in an extravaganza produced by "<DATE>Saturday</DATE> Night Live" creator <PERSON>Lorne Michaels</PERSON>. 

   <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <DATE>Feb. 29</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. EST</TIME>, on <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>: "Perfect People." 
In order to star in this confection about "two middle-aged couch potatoes" who strive for physical beauty by embarking on an incredible ordeal of diet, exercise, plastic surgery, hair transplants and liposuction, actors <PERSON>Lauren Hutton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Perry King</PERSON> had to embark on an incredible ordeal of skullcaps, hairpieces, false jowls, makeup and body-altering prosthetics. 

   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <DATE>March 1</DATE>, <TIME>9-11 p.m. EST</TIME>, on CBS: "The 37th Annual Miss USA Pageant." 
Speaking of perfection and incredible ordeals, don't miss these 51 fine young things strutting their stuff in old <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>. 

   <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <DATE>March 2</DATE>, <TIME>8-11 p.m. EST</TIME>, on CBS: "The 30th Annual Grammy Awards." 
If you get argumentative about the success of <PERSON>Steve Winwood</PERSON>'s comeback, or about whether <LOCATION>Los Lobos</LOCATION> is more authentic than <PERSON>Suzanne Vega</PERSON>, watch this prestigious music awards show. 
If you never heard of these people, tune in and find out who they are, and what's been happening this year in pop (and a little bit about jazz and classical) music.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Botswana Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, which
has governed this diamond-rich nation since independence in <DATE>1966</DATE>,
retained a comfortable majority in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>, according to partial
returns <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The party captured all 19 districts where final results were
available for the elections, and it appeared set to add to its
majority in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>. Prior to <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s balloting, the party
held 28 of the 34 seats.
   The left-leaning <ORGANIZATION>Botswana National Front</ORGANIZATION> was expected to retain
at least four of its five seats. The <ORGANIZATION>Botswana People's Party</ORGANIZATION> lost
its lone seat.
   This peaceful, southern African nation is one of only a few on
the continent to hold regular, multiparty elections. <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s
polls were the sixth since <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> gained independence from
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 23 years ago.
   President <PERSON>Quett Masire</PERSON> and his Democratic Party retained their
comfortable majority on the strength of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s surging
capitalist economy, which has grown at least <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> annually
throughout the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   Diamonds from the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>, along with cattle ranching,
account for most of the wealth in this thinly populated desert
nation of 1.2 million.
   When <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> gained independence it was among the world's 20
poorest nations, with a per capita annual income of less than <MONEY>$100</MONEY>.
Today the average yearly income is more than <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>, one of the
highest in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   At a time when many African nations are crippled by huge foreign
debts, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s government has spent cautiously and has foreign
reserves in excess of <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>, enough to pay for more than two
years of imports.
   Masire, president since <DATE>1980</DATE>, has avoided expensive public works
projects and concentrated on small-scale development.
   The opposition <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION> argued that <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s wealth has
not reached the ordinary workers and called for an increase in
public spending and the creation of more social programs.

FINDING YOUR OWN COMFORT ZONE IN ONE GEM OF A COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> is a peaceful country of 1.2 million people, most of whom live along 
the eastern border with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If all you saw was the <DATE>1980</DATE> South African movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy," you 
might think of this country as primitive and backward. Most of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> is 
blanketed by the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>, where bushmen still hunt with arrows as they 
have for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
But <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> also has one of the fastest-growing economies in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, mainly 
because it provides <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of the world's gem diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
My Okavango excursion was the highlight of a 12-day loop through southern 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. It began in <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. We traveled south to <LOCATION>Francistown</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, northeast to <PERSON>Nata</PERSON> and west to <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>. After the canoe voyage we headed 
northeast to <ORGANIZATION>Chobe National Park</ORGANIZATION> and on to <LOCATION>Victoria Falls</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This trip was the rough way to see the <ORGANIZATION>Okavango Delta</ORGANIZATION>, and it's not for 
everyone. There are many more comfortable ways to go. Whether you fly to <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> 
and stay in a luxury camp or drive in a Land-Rover and camp out, you won't 
likely be disappointed once you get to the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Getting There: If you're driving, you need a four-wheel-drive vehicle; the 
190-mile stretch from <ORGANIZATION>Nata</ORGANIZATION>, which is halfway between <LOCATION>Francistown</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>, is 
made of a chalky gravel. Coming from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, as I was, <LOCATION>Francistown</LOCATION> is the 
first major town, about 58 miles southwest of the <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> border. 
</P>
<P>
A good stop-off point is <ORGANIZATION>Nata Lodge</ORGANIZATION> (Private Bag 10, <LOCATION>Francistown</LOCATION>) six miles 
south of <PERSON>Nata</PERSON>. The lodge has good accommodations and a nice restaurant. I 
stayed in the campground behind the lodge for five pula (about <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY>). Thatched 
huts and tented rooms also are available. Tented rooms cost slightly more than 
the campground; the huts are 60 pula (<MONEY>$30</MONEY>) a night. 
</P>
<P>
If you're flying to <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> you will likely have to go through <LOCATION>Gabarone</LOCATION>, the 
capital of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>. Carriers serving the area include <LOCATION>Air Botswana</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>British 
Airways</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia Airways</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air Zimbabwe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>South African Airways</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Safari Options: Once you reach <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> there are basically two ways to see the 
delta: the mobile or the fly-in safaris. I took a mobile safari. We took our 
own camping gear and provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Island Safari Lodge (P.O. Box 116, <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> 300) charges 40 pula a day 
for a three-person canoe and 95 pula for a return motorboat trip into the 
<ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>. We stayed in the <LOCATION>Island Safari</LOCATION> campground for five pula, but Island 
Safaris also offers lodging (47.50 pula per person double, 80 pula per person 
single), a restaurant (dinner is 18 pula), a bar, a swimming pool and a little 
movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
Other operators in <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> are Crocodile Camp (Box 46) and the <LOCATION>Okavango River 
Lodge</LOCATION> (Box 32, <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>). It's also possible to hire your own poler and mokoro out 
of <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The fly-in safaris offer a more comfortable way to see the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>. These 
companies fly you from <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> to an exclusive, semi-permanent camp, treat you 
like royalty and take you out on daylong canoe trips. Amenities include 
thatched or tented lodging with comfortable beds, mosquito netting, lighting, 
bathrooms and showers (with hot water), plus a restaurant, bar and movie 
theater. Meals and laundry service are often included. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Gametrackers International</ORGANIZATION> (1000 <PERSON>E. Broadway</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> 91205, toll-free (800) 
252-0493) offers an eight-day package through northern <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, including a 
stop at <LOCATION>Victoria Falls</LOCATION>, for <MONEY>$2,725</MONEY> (low season, <DATE>March 1</DATE> through <DATE>June 30</DATE>) or 
<MONEY>$2,925</MONEY> (high season, <DATE>July 1</DATE> through <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>). 
</P>
<P>
Desert and <ORGANIZATION>Delta Safaris Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> (16179 E. <LOCATION>Whittier Blvd.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Whittier</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> 90603, 
(213) 947-5100) offers an eight-night itinerary for <MONEY>$2,274.65</MONEY> per person, with 
a minimum of four people. A six-night itinerary costs <MONEY>$1,537.05</MONEY> per person 
(minimum of four). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ker Downey Selby</PERSON> (13201 <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, Suite 800, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION> 77040, 
(800) 231-6352) offers a nine-day trip for <MONEY>$1,952</MONEY>. The company also does fancy 
mobile safaris for <MONEY>$660</MONEY> a day for two people, or <MONEY>$460</MONEY> a day per person. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Okavango Tours &amp; Safaris</ORGANIZATION> (P.O. Box 39, <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>) operates <ORGANIZATION>Delta Camp</ORGANIZATION>, an 
exclusive camp with everything provided, and <ORGANIZATION>Oddball</ORGANIZATION>'s, something in between a 
fly-in and a mobile safari. Oddball's flies you into a semi-permanent camp on 
the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> (110 pula for return), but you must take your own food and camping 
gear (7.50 pula a night for camping). For 30 pulas a day you can also hire a 
mokoro through <ORGANIZATION>Oddball's</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When to Go: I took my trip in <DATE>May</DATE>, a good time to see the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> but perhaps not 
the best time to see animals. The <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> was in full flood, and it was 
beautiful. The end of the dry season, <DATE>September</DATE> and <DATE>October</DATE>, is peak 
animal-viewing season, but also peak tourist season. It's a good idea to make 
reservations well ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Health: Malaria is the main concern. Consult a physician and begin taking 
anti-malaria medication one week before entering the area. Take mosquito 
repellent and netting. Make sure to keep all of your tent flaps closed until 
you go to sleep for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Tsetse flies are in the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>, but they usually aren't a problem, mainly 
because of spraying to reduce their population. There are insect repellents 
that are effective against the flies. 
</P>
<P>
If you drink water straight from the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>, you should boil or filter it. 
</P>
<P>
What to Take: If you're camping, you need to take all of your gear. Most fly-in 
operators will supply everything. You should also take sun block, sunglasses, a 
hat and neutral-colored clothing (to avoid frightening the animals), plus 
binoculars, a good camera with a telephoto lens, and film. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: <DATE>Last July 1</DATE> Botswana raised fees for non-residents at its 
national parks from 5 pula to 30 pula a day, and as much as 50 pula a day for 
organized tours. 
</P>
<P>
If you're visiting the <ORGANIZATION>Okavango Delta</ORGANIZATION> it would be a shame not to also visit 
<ORGANIZATION>Chobe National Park</ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <PERSON>Victoria Falls</PERSON> is across the border in 
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, and should not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
A good source of invaluable information for traveling on the cheap around 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> is "Africa on a Shoestring" by <PERSON>Geoff Crowther</PERSON> (Lonely Planet, <MONEY>$24.95</MONEY>). 
</P>

FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: North Luangwa now open - Practical
Traveller / Safaris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE TRACKS were very fresh in the off-white talc of the dusty path
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
there was an African hunting dog not far ahead. We set off on foot, treading
silently and hardly daring to breathe. We had barely reached the bend in the
track which led through thick mopane scrub when the wild dog doubled back
and met us face to face. We had walked into the middle of a hunt.
This was one of those chance encounters which turn an African safari from a
holiday into an adventure. One way of maximising the chances of such
encounters is to choose your destination carefully. With more areas opening
up for visitors, opportunities are increasing.
<LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>South Luangwa</LOCATION> national park has long been noted for its walking
safaris and its exciting night drives, while <LOCATION>North Luangwa</LOCATION> has only recently
been opened to visitors, although on a limited scale. <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> was one of the
pioneers of walking safaris. They are generally well planned and full of
interest.
<ORGANIZATION>Abercrombie &amp; Kent</ORGANIZATION>, Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions, <ORGANIZATION>Twickers World</ORGANIZATION>, and
Art of Travel all go to <LOCATION>Luangwa Valley</LOCATION>, but of these only Art of Travel
specifically includes <LOCATION>North Luangwa</LOCATION>. Expect to pay Pounds 1,855 and up for
14 days.
While the walks in <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> take you from one fixed camp to another, <PERSON>Richard
Bonham</PERSON>'s walking expeditions into <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>'s enormous Selous game reserve
are more in the traditional safari mould. Strings of porters are used, and
you sleep under the stars. Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions offers these
safaris from Pounds 3,950.
The traditional theme is repeated elsewhere in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> where Gibbs Farm
Safaris takes clients into the vast grass seas of the <LOCATION>Serengeti</LOCATION>. Camping in
luxury tents, you will not see another vehicle in spite of the open country.
<PERSON>Nigel Perks</PERSON>, who runs GFS, has an uncanny knack of finding the most elusive
of animals. These safaris can be booked through Art of Travel, while
<ORGANIZATION>Twickers World</ORGANIZATION> has fly-in safaris to the Serengeti from Pounds 2,615 for 17
days.
A destination that has become much more accessible now that <ORGANIZATION>Air Namibia</ORGANIZATION>
operates direct flights from <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. With its good road
network, this southern African country makes an excellent destination for a
fly-drive tour. Etosha national park has plenty of elephant, black rhino and
lions, and a stay at <LOCATION>Okaukuejo</LOCATION>, with its floodlit water hole, is not to be
missed.
One country to rejoin the safari scene recently is <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION>, which has
gorillas. The borders of <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> meet in the volcanic
massif which forms the last stronghold of the mountain gorilla. It is
particularly good to see that gorilla-watching in <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> is possible again
now, as the continued conservation of these primates depends so much on
western visitors. Twickers World has a 23-day tour including visiting
chimpanzees in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> from Pounds 1,675, while <ORGANIZATION>Abercrombie &amp; Kent</ORGANIZATION> has a
four-day add-on to a standard safari for around Pounds 1,021.
Mana Pools national park on the banks of the <LOCATION>River Zambezi</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> is
not only excellent for walking but is one of the highlights of a canoe
safari down the <LOCATION>Zambezi</LOCATION>, a leisurely way to see game, especially hippos and
crocodiles, at quite close quarters.
In turn, overland transport comes in many forms. <ORGANIZATION>Abercrombie &amp; Kent</ORGANIZATION> offers a
traditional ox-wagon safari on the shores of <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Lake Naivasha</LOCATION> (two
days, Pounds 480 ex-Nairobi), or a camel safari in northern <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> (three
days, Pounds 307 ex-Nairobi), while there is the opportunity to explore
parts of the Kalahari desert in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> on all-terrain vehicles.
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Okavango delta</ORGANIZATION>, a rich mixture of glittering channels, clear
lagoons, water-lilied pools and sandy, palm-treed islands, has never been
easy to travel around. One way is to take an unhurried safari in traditional
mokoros, dug-out canoes, which are poled through the placid waters of this
enormous labyrinth of waterways by local guides, with an occasional walk on
one of the thousands of islands.

<HEAD>Charles Turns 40 with Tongue Tucked Firmly in Cheek</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> donned a ``Life Begins
at 40'' button and poked fun at his eccentric image <DATE>Monday</DATE> as he
celebrated his birthday with 1,500 youths he has helped overcome
poverty and unemployment.
   ``You've given me one of the best birthday parties I could ever
have hoped for,'' the heir to the throne declared after a day that
included champagne toasts, birthday cakes, renditions of ``Happy
Birthday,'' and a princely bit of disco dancing with three of his
guests.
   A ball at <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> for friends and family was scheduled
for the evening.
   Charles used his 40th birthday to launch an appeal for <MONEY>$70
million</MONEY> for the Prince's <ORGANIZATION>Youth Business Trust</ORGANIZATION>, a charity that gives
seed money and professional advice to unemployed people aged 18 to
25 who want to start their own business.
   He chose <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s second-largest city, and spent the
day visiting projects partly financed by his various charities.
   He went to <LOCATION>Handsworth</LOCATION>, an inner city district torn by race riots
in <DATE>1985</DATE>, to inspect <ORGANIZATION>Grove Lane Baths</ORGANIZATION>, which is being converted into
a community center.
   Then he continued to the <ORGANIZATION>Old Tram Depot</ORGANIZATION>, which has been made into
a transport museum. It was festooned with flags, balloons and
antique gaslamps. An old double-decker bus bore the number 40 and
the words ``Happy Birthday Prince Charles.''
   In the cavernous tram depot, the prince was serenaded by calypso
and rock bands, and by hundreds of young people singing a specially
composed paean to Charles: ``Thank you for showing where the road
can lead; If we put our mind to it, in time we will succeed.''
   His mother, <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>, is in good health at 62, and he
expects a long wait before being crowned <PERSON>King Charles III</PERSON>.
Meanwhile, his search for a meaningful role has transformed him into
a compelling spokesman for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s needy youth, and a critic of
environmental neglect.
   He also has a penchant for alternative medicine, vegetarianism,
talking to his plants and sojourning among the Bushmen of the
<LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>. He regards this simply as a measure of his
open-mindedness, and is known to be angry at the way some newspapers
here have exploited his foibles to question his sanity.
   His speech in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> was a carefully crafted riposte,
frequently interrupted by laughter and cheers.
   ``Only the other day I was inquiring of an entire bed of
old-fashioned roses who were forced to listen to my dementing
ramblings on the meaning of the universe as I sat cross-legged in
the lotus position on the gravel path in front of me,'' he said.
   ``And I was inquiring of them what they thought would happen on
my birthday in a <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> tram shed. `A tram shed?' they all
replied, totally aghast at the thought. Yes, I said, a tram shed.
   ``At this point a row of prize Welsh leeks, cocky little things,
which were lurking in a nearby vegetable patch, chipped in to say
that they expected the shed would be filled with groups of
semi-naked Kalahari Bushmen ... and also a troupe or two of Tibetan
Buddhist monks ... armed with advance copies of the tabloid
newspapers which would be strewn in my path in a form of ancient
Buddhist greeting ...
   ``But looking around here, ladies and gentlemen, I see those
idiotic plants have got it wrong again. I knew they would. Instead,
you've given me one of the best birthday parties I could ever have
hoped for.''
   Gesturing to his lapel button, which he said was given to him by
his two small sons, he said, ``I'm not sure I ought to be reminded
of it, but my children reminded me of it just this day.''
   Of the charities he runs, he said: ``I never imagined for one
minute that they would become big enough to start giving expensive
birthday parties like this one. But it's all, I can assure you,
extremely rewarding and encouraging if you can see just one person's
life transformed by this means.''

Later I got used to not caring a damn, just to walking and staying put when I 
had walked far enough, at some village of which I didn't know the name, to 
letting myself drift with <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. -- <PERSON>Graham Greene</PERSON>, "Journey Without Maps" 
</P>
<P>
Drifting with the currents on <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Okavango Delta</ORGANIZATION>, gliding through 
channels choked by papyrus and lily pads is like a journey without maps. 
</P>
<P>
I found myself in unfamiliar territory, not caring about anything but sitting 
back and enjoying the sky, the clouds and the birds as our canoe passed red and 
yellow reeds, swamp grasses, sausage trees and fields of maize. 
</P>
<P>
I watched wallowing hippos, heard the screech of baboons and, in the <TIME>evening</TIME>, 
fell asleep to a symphony of swamp sounds. I was not oblivious to the dangers 
of this watery wilderness, but it was hard to feel threatened in such pristine, 
even hypnotic, surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Before <DATE>1923</DATE> there were no comprehensive maps of the <ORGANIZATION>Okavango Delta</ORGANIZATION>, a lush 
waterway on the edge of the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>. It's nearly impossible to 
accurately map an area that changes so dramatically with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Okavango River</LOCATION>, which begins in the <LOCATION>Angola Highlands</LOCATION>, swells during the 
rainy season (<DATE>November</DATE> to <DATE>April</DATE>) and floods over a depression in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, 
forming the world's largest inland delta: 6,500 square miles of inlets, flood 
plains, lagoons and islands. 
</P>
<P>
I went on a four-day water safari last <DATE>May</DATE>. It was a good time to visit. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> was in full flood, lush with vegetation, and the weather was dry and warm 
but never too hot. 
</P>
<P>
I saw lots of wildlife, though I probably would have seen more at the end of 
the dry season in <DATE>September</DATE> and <DATE>October</DATE> when herds of animals come to the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> 
in search of water. 
</P>
<P>
Canoes, which are like water taxis, are the only way to get around much of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>. They transport people from village to village, to fishing or hunting 
areas. Polers are the taxi drivers, having grown up navigating the channels. 
They stand in the stern, moving the canoe forward with a long forked pole (a 
ngashi). 
</P>
<P>
 My journey began when two friends -- <PERSON>Katie Janssen</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>John Blank</ORGANIZATION> -- showed up 
at my door in <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. They had just finished a year teaching in 
Kenyan villages. I was on a six-month trip to <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION>, visiting a friend who 
works there. 
</P>
<P>
Katie and <PERSON>John</PERSON> were driving through eastern and southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and suggested a 
trip to the <LOCATION>Okavango</LOCATION> -- the "Serengeti of Swamps" they called it. I was game. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to stick to a timetable when you're traveling in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> in a '67 Land 
Rover. Every time we hit a rut I braced myself to avoid hitting my head on the 
roof. We stalled each time mud splashed on the spark plugs, which was often. 
</P>
<P>
It took three days to make the 700-mile trip to the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>. We passed through 
customs behind a huge bus of Zimbabweans going to <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> to shop. 
</P>
<P>
Later, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> soldiers stopped us at a roadblock. They were apparently making 
a routine check for South African secret agents who conduct undercover 
operations in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, trying to find <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. 
They let us pass. 
</P>
<P>
After a long drive along the northern edge of the surprisingly lush <LOCATION>Kalahari 
Desert</LOCATION> it was a relief to see water. We had reached <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION>, the gateway to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> is a patchwork of old and new, with posh hotels going up next to 
traditional villages. 
</P>
<P>
Herero women, refugees from <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, wander the streets dressed in colorful 
long dresses adopted from 19th-Century German colonists, but decorated with 
African patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Our home base was 7 1/2 miles north of <LOCATION>Maun</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Island Safari Lodge</ORGANIZATION>. We shared a 
campsite with several <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> speaking <LOCATION>Afrikaans</LOCATION>. They tried to convince 
us that apartheid doesn't exist, and that they weren't such "bad guys." They 
regaled us with tales of traversing the African bush. 
</P>
<P>
But we were more interested in water and canoes than Afrikaner tales. So we 
decided to hire a canoe and poler for four days through Island Safaris, at the 
lodge. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kay Potter</PERSON>, who operates the lodge with her husband <PERSON>Phil</PERSON>, recommends using 
Fiberglas canoes rather than the traditional mokoros, which are carved from 
sausage trees. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to chop down a sausage tree to make a mokoro," she said. "Before long 
the trees will be gone. Besides, you get a wet bum in a mokoro. I guarantee 
it." We were to get "wet bums" anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The next day a speedboat took us into the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>. As we went deeper, the winding 
pathway through the lily pads grew narrower. The boatman moved expertly through 
the tortuous channels at breakneck speed. Every so often he would stop and 
reverse the motor, when the prop became clogged with reeds. 
</P>
<P>
After two hours we reached an island inhabited by polers who were sitting 
around a fire making coffee in tin cans and cooking mielie meal. Mielie meal, 
the staple food in <LOCATION>sub-Saharan Africa</LOCATION>, is like thick grits. It fills you up but 
won't put meat on your bones. A telltale sign: There wasn't an overweight man 
among the polers. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't pay much heed to us when we arrived. But eventually <PERSON>Kenneth Monare</PERSON>, 
a tall, barefoot man wearing shorts and a blue T-shirt, approached us. He would 
be our pilot and guide for the next four days. 
</P>
<P>
We were lucky. Kenneth spoke English and enjoyed practicing it with us. He also 
taught us a few <LOCATION>Setswana</LOCATION> phrases. Although English is the official language of 
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Setswana</LOCATION>, a Bantu language of the <LOCATION>Tswana</LOCATION> tribe, is spoken by <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of 
its population. 
</P>
<P>
Monare's friend Kid, a shorter man wearing a <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> jacket, piloted the other 
canoe in our party, which also included a Canadian couple who were traveling 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
When the polers were ready, we glided out into a channel bound for Chief's 
<LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>, the main island in <ORGANIZATION>Moremi Wildlife Reserve</ORGANIZATION> (set up by the <LOCATION>Tswana</LOCATION> tribe 
in <DATE>1962</DATE> to protect the animals) and one of the best game reserves in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth stood in the stern and began rhythmically poling us forward. The prow 
of the canoe parted the reeds that sprouted like stubble from the water. 
Sometimes a spider, while stretching a web between the reeds, would fall into 
our canoe. 
</P>
<P>
The spiders were fat, dark and fuzzy, though non-poisonous. We would either 
toss them out of the canoe or carry them along with us to another part of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>. The webs were often so beautiful that I felt sad, as if we had destroyed 
a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> is a palette of colors: yellow water lilies, white and pink flowers 
against the reeds, tiny green frogs on lily pads. 
</P>
<P>
When we passed another canoe <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> would greet his fellow poler with a hearty 
"dumela!" ("hello" in <LOCATION>Setswana</LOCATION>). I marveled at how he could navigate the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> 
maze in which channels become dead ends clogged by vegetation. Some of the 
channels are kept open only because hippos break through the reeds. 
</P>
<P>
We reached our first campsite on Chief's <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION> after three hours and a bit too 
much sun. Later, we took the canoe out to get water for cooking and to 
photograph the sunsets. The nights, what with the campfires and the stars, 
reminded me of my childhood camping trips. 
</P>
<P>
When we were quiet we were treated to a cacophony of exotic sounds: the screech 
of baboons . . . hippo grunts . . . the plaintive songs of crickets, frogs, 
birds . . . an insect that sounded like the tinkling of a toy piano, and the 
eerie cackling of hyenas. 
</P>
<P>
As we brushed our teeth we saw two yellow eyes of a bush baby, a nocturnal 
primate, staring at us through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of mosquitoes were considerably less exciting. I was glad that I was 
wearing mosquito repellent and taking anti-malaria medication. Malaria is the 
main hazard in the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>. It's unlikely that one would be bitten by tsetse 
flies, crocodiles, lions, leopards or poisonous snakes, but anyone who goes 
into the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> and doesn't take precautions against malaria is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> took us to another spot on the northern part of Chief's 
<LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>, a place that abounds with game. We passed a deep pool where hippos were 
wallowing. Kenneth and Kid kept their distance. I was aware that an angry hippo 
could smash a canoe to bits. But <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON>, with typical African tour guide 
aplomb, said there was little danger. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very frightened," he said, as a snort came up from a hippo. Nine times 
out of 10 he's right. Of course I'd hate to be too close on that occasion when 
a hippo does decide to charge. 
</P>
<P>
As we approached our destination <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> and Kid found that the channel had 
shifted and was only a few inches deep. The thick swamp grasses made it 
impossible to move forward. After a futile effort, <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> gave us the command: 
"Get out!" 
</P>
<P>
We rolled up our pants legs and began to push the canoes through the reeds. We 
splashed through the mushy swamp. Now, I'm not one who particularly enjoys 
sticking his feet into swamp water. I had visions of leeches covering my 
calves. I feared it might be time for the crocodiles to have a picnic. I guess 
I identify more with <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> than <ORGANIZATION>Indiana Jones</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
We reached our campsite tired but exhilarated. I looked back at the area we had 
just crossed -- a field of tans and yellows fading into the blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the island was deserted except for the animals. We followed 
<PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> on walking safaris. He led us for hours as he followed smells, tracks 
and droppings through the brown grass and gnarled trees. He had to quiet us 
several times to avoid frightening the animals. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, after hours of walking, he put up his hand to halt us. Several 
zebra, wildebeest, tsesebe antelope and warthogs came out in front of us, no 
more than 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
We were on the trail of an elephant. We could smell its musk-like odor but we 
never found it. I had seen elephants before, but always from the safety of a 
vehicle. I feared the possibility of coming face to face with one of the huge 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
But we probably were safe in <LOCATION>Kenneth</LOCATION>'s hands. He had a keen sense of the smells 
and sounds of the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> -- where to go and, perhaps more important, where not 
to go. His calm and self-confidence was reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
On our <TIME>last night</TIME> I realized why <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> wanted Kid to come along. They joked 
and laughed together, making the trip relaxed and fun for all of us. But Kid 
was also a master fisherman. He took a drop line, crouched by the water's edge 
and snared 20 fish. 
</P>
<P>
Kid and <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> used four of the fish to make a stew for themselves, and saved 
the rest for their fellow polers. I feared that perhaps the fish would be the 
appetizer and we would be the main course for some predator -- a leopard, 
baboon or hyena, whose jaws are said to be the strongest of all animals. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, hyenas are known to attack humans while they sleep, which is why it's 
important to keep your tent flap zipped up. But in the morning the fish were 
still dangling on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth showed us his calloused hands, which told the story of his years as a 
poler. The lodge pays him 5 pula (about <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY>) a day plus food. (Passengers are 
expected to tip their poler at the end of the trip.) 
</P>
<P>
He told us that someday he would like to own his own mokoro. But you need to 
pay a teacher 200 to 300 pula to show you how to build one. Besides that, 
<PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> had to think about saving enough pulas to someday pay for a bride. 
Payment to the parents of the bride used to be in cattle; now you can pay in 
pulas (or VCRs in some parts of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
I was happy I didn't have to worry about a bride's price. Then again, I would 
soon return to a complex world of jumbo jets and grid-locked cities, and 
somehow the life of the poler seemed more civilized and appealing. 
</P>
<P>
As we rode back to the <ORGANIZATION>Island Safari Lodge</ORGANIZATION> in a powerboat at what now seemed 
like a frenetic pace, I hoped that there would always be room in this world for 
the polers, expertly plying the uncharted delta waters.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Meditations of the sage for today - JDF Jones reviews
an anthology of the work of Sir Laurens van der Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEATHER FALL: AN ANTHOLOGY by <PERSON>Laurens</PERSON> van der <ORGANIZATION>Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
16.99</ORGANIZATION>, 269 pages
Sir <PERSON>Laurens</PERSON> van der Post is not so far short of 90 but, happily, in full
possession of his powers as he celebrates this 60th anniversary of his
association with the <ORGANIZATION>Hogarth Press</ORGANIZATION> (today subsumed in <LOCATION>Chatto</LOCATION>, and in turn in
<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION>). This attendant anthology, <PERSON>Feather Fall</PERSON>, is a slightly curious
concept because one has to question its function. Is it to commemorate the
occasion? To remind us fans of his qualities? To give to new readers a taste
which will encourage them to buy the real books? Perhaps the model is the
anthology of CG Jung - van der Post's mentor - which has led many casual
readers to tackle Jung's fuller achievement.
After all, it is hard to imagine an anthology from, say, <LOCATION>Conrad</LOCATION>, or <LOCATION>Bellow</LOCATION>,
or <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> (successful publishing projects like The Essential <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>
are not comparable because they are omnibuses, not anthologies). The
explanation is that van der Post is seen today not so much as a novelist -
although he is a good one - but as a thinker, visionary, philosopher,
mystic. You cannot sensibly anthologise a novelist but you can much more
easily gather together a collection of extracts, often brief, even a single
paragraph, from the life-work of a sage.
The danger is that, as a result of abbreviation, you can finish up with too
many out-of-context mini-extracts which do less than justice to the author:
for instance, 'Never try to go ahead of your spoor. Many a man has died
because he has not observed the discipline of the spoor to the end'. That
sort of example, and there are quite a few of them here, would keep Private
Eye happy for months. As with all van der Post's regular appearances in that
journal, it is very unfair but undeniably funny.
Another problem with a book of this sort is that it cannot - because these
are snippets] - communicate the achievement of a creative writer. It needs
to be insisted that the early van der Post novels - In A Province, The Face
Beside The Fire, <PERSON>Flamingo Feather</PERSON> - are still splendid. The African travel
books - Venture to the Interior, The Lost World of the Kalahari, The Heart
of the <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON> - continue to defy the sneers of the anthropologists. A Story
Like The Wind and A Far-Off Place are a captivating duo about childhood and
much else. Even the food book, <ORGANIZATION>First Catch Your Eland</ORGANIZATION>, is hard to put down.
And that is to leave out The Dark Eye in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, The Seed and the Sower, the
travels to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the recent semi-memoirs, and so much more.
The editors of <ORGANIZATION>Feather Fall</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jean-Marc Pottiez</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jane Bedford</PERSON>, focus on
van der Post not as novelist or traveller, soldier or crypto-diplomat, but
as - to use <PERSON>Rosamond Lehmann</PERSON>'s words about him - 'a great spiritual thinker
and writer'. They correctly see 'a pattern in his writing, a flow and a
continuity' over 60 years, or at least over the 40 years since he resumed
his writing career after returning from the war in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>. That
pattern is underlined by the fact that he has never hesitated to repeat
himself: again and again his books, whether ostensibly fiction or
non-fiction, return to themes and episodes from his early Afrikaner
childhood, his <PERSON>Bushman</PERSON> nanny, his Huguenot ancestry, his early youthful
visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, his experiences as a POW, his subsequent travels in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,
his acquaintance with <PERSON>Jung</PERSON>, and so on.
Inevitably and properly, these topics are re-visited in this volume,
together with his lifelong meditation on the mighty themes that go with them
 -the dark shadow within ourselves, the function of journey for each of us,
the significance of the <PERSON>Bushman</PERSON> as the 'first man', the religious role of
<ORGANIZATION>Wilderness</ORGANIZATION>, the necessity to forgive, the Jungian sense of 'wholeness', the
mystery of Dream.
Too many of these extracts, in my opinion, are taken from that odd volume A
Walk with a <PERSON>White Bushman</PERSON>, which is not a real van der Post book but a
rambling and disorganised conversation with <PERSON>Jean-Marc Pottiez</PERSON>. I am also
struck by a change in style over the years: I am convinced that at some
point the taut, elegant pace of, say, Venture to the Interior, turned into
the very different rhythm, a tendency to spin words and lose precision, of
the later books. (I assume he started to dictate, which is never a good
thing.)
Van der Post has been active in Southern African affairs for many years
though he has chosen to operate sub rosa. His disdain for apartheid was
never a secret, nor - more controversially - his opposition to the
international sanctions which surely contributed to recent events. I
particularly enjoyed his unwitting reference here to the Afrikaners' history
'which still has a half-Nelson hold on them'. Fresh from a visit to
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, and full of images of inauguration of majority rule, I was
also struck by his understanding - dating back to his years as prisoner of
the Japanese - of the surprising possibility of forgiveness.
'Persons who have really suffered at the hands of others do not find it
difficult to forgive, nor even to understand the people who caused their
suffering,' he once wrote. 'They do not find it difficult to forgive because
out of suffering and sorrow truly endured comes an instinctive sense of
privilege . . .' He went on, in a later novel, 'For if one does not forgive,
one does not understand, and if one does not understand, one is afraid, and
if one is afraid, one hates, and if one hates, one cannot love. And no new
beginning on earth is possible without love . . .'
I should like to think that those two elderly <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Laurens</PERSON> van
der Post and <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>, might have something to say to each other when
they are next in the same town.

glistening Okovanggo swamps. Willie Phillips taps a leathery finger on the

said. "Come back here next spring, and you'll see dead animals all along it."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BOTSWANA'S GIANT FENCE IS KILLING WILDLIFE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The fence runs along the northwest rim of the Okovanggo, an
8,500-square-mile wilderness teeming with game in <LOCATION>northwest Botswana</LOCATION>, where
the <LOCATION>Okovanggo River</LOCATION> makes a fan-shaped inland delta before dying in the sands
of the <ORGANIZATION>Kalahari Desert.</ORGANIZATION>;    Besides cutting migration routes for some of the
<ORGANIZATION>Okovanggo</ORGANIZATION>'s rarest herds, the "buffalo fence" under construction also places
outside the fence one of the wildest and most remote sections of the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>,
the <LOCATION>Magwegqana</LOCATION> peninsula.;     'It's a paradise';    "It's a paradise, I'm
telling you, a paradise," <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said. "And it'll all be cattle country
now.";    The fence is the latest part of a long-range plan by the government
to cordon this sprawling, desert nation into cattle and wildlife zones.;   
The fences already have opened massive tracts of formerly wild country to
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s cattle industry. They also have killed tens of thousands of wild
animals -- giraffe, springbok, zebra, eland -- that become tangled in the
sharp wires as they follow their centuries-old migrating routes. In the <DATE>last
decade</DATE>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s population of 300,000 wildebeest was reduced to a little
more than 1,000; they either died in the fences or of thirst in their
water-poor enclaves.;     Government defends fences;    Government officials
defend the program as necessary to <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s lucrative beef trade.
Environmentalists, they say, exaggerate the threat and underestimate the
ability of wildlife to adapt to the fences.;    <PERSON>Ove Nielsen</PERSON>, chairman of the
<ORGANIZATION>Botswana Meat Commission</ORGANIZATION>, complains that foreigners are trying to turn his
country into "a gigantic zoo.";    <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, long considered one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s
most conservation-minded countries, recently has come under increasing attack
from international environmental groups -- partly because of the new fences
and partly for the proposed dredging of 15 miles of river leading out of the
swamps.;     Dredging draws attention;    The dredging, intended to tap the
<ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>'s precious water, has drawn more international attention in recent
weeks. <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> threatened to boycott <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s diamond industry if the
dredging isn't stopped. But many people think the buffalo fence poses the
greater threat.;    "As far as I'm concerned, this is worse than the
dredging," said one environmentalist in <LOCATION>Gaborone</LOCATION>, the capital.;    <ORGANIZATION>Coert Van
Hasselt</ORGANIZATION>, a lawyer based in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, represents a coalition of
environmental groups threatening to launch a global boycott of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s beef
industry because of the fences.;    One concern is the timing of the
construction. Many of the Okovanggo's animals have left the swamp area to
migrate north toward the <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> highlands, where the rains begin in early
<DATE>January</DATE>. If the fence is finished in the next few months, environmentalists
argue, these animals will be caught outside.;     Delay promised;    In
response, the <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> government promised only to plant the tall, wooden
posts for the fence, but to hold off stringing the steel wire until the rains
subside and the animals return to the central Okovanggo.;    But a <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION>
investigator said this month that an inspection showed that the wire was being
put in place and that the new fence's first casualty -- a young giraffe -- had
been found tangled and dead along one completed stretch.;    To
environmentalists, it is as though one of the world's greatest natural
treasures is being sacrificed for the benefit of a handful of major cattle
owners.;    To many Botswanans -- and to many landowners throughout <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> --
it is as though they are being asked to remain primitive and poor so
well-heeled foreigners will have a place to come on vacation.  </TEXT>

FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers digs deeper into its
resources - The new lease of life for the Jwaneng and Finsch diamond mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, is
known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the
richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the
stones it yields. Jwaneng's position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m
expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of
schedule and under budget.
Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern <LOCATION>Cape Province</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>, another diamond mine, the <LOCATION>Finsch</LOCATION>, where operations started in <DATE>1964</DATE>,
has been given a new lease of life.
Having dug an open pit 423 metres deep, miners have now gone underground. <PERSON>Mr
Simon Webb</PERSON>, the general manager, says that the underground development has
given it another 35 to 40 years of life.
All this goes to show that De Beers, the South African group that dominates
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its
ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term
difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. It also
remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its
100-year-old mines at <ORGANIZATION>Kimberley</ORGANIZATION> are now running down.
The South African group believes that its control of at least <MONEY>50 per cent</MONEY> of
world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate
with the other producers who have marketing contracts with De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation,
In <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> De Beers controls half of <ORGANIZATION>Debswana</ORGANIZATION>, the company that owns the
Jwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest. The value of Jwaneng to
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> cannot be overstated.
It, and the country's two other (smaller) diamond mines, between them
account for 50 per cent of the government's revenue and 40 per cent of the
country's gross domestic product. No wonder Jwaneng's company slogan is Re
phtas imisa <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, which translates as 'We make <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> sparkle'.
Production started at Jwaneng in <DATE>1982</DATE>. Now a so-called fourth stream is
being completed which is adding one-third to processing capacity. In turn,
this means a 21 per cent rise in the number of carats produced. Last year
the mine treated 5.8m tonnes of ore which yielded 8.546m carats of diamonds,
well below the <DATE>1992</DATE> output when the 5.77m tonnes treated gave up more than
9m carats.
Jwaneng's open pit has reached a depth of 190 metres. Already it is 2kms
long and 1km wide. <PERSON>Mr Loz Shaw</PERSON>, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600
metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit
will go down at least that far.
<PERSON>Mr Derrick Moore</PERSON>, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the
open pit will last another 35 years - 'and then we might go underground'.
If experience at De Beers' wholly-owned Finsch mine in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is
anything to go by, planning the underground development at Jwaneng might
already have started.
Planning for the underground mine at Finsch started in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and the
first work began in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Yet the bottom of the Finsch open pit - 423 metres
 -was not reached until <DATE>1990</DATE>.
Unfortunately, things did not go completely as expected when underground
mining started, to some extent because the development was designed by a
management whose expertise was mainly in open pit mining.
However, <PERSON>Mr Mark Button</PERSON>, mining superintendent, says: 'Finsch has come of
age as an underground mine after two years. Our costs compare with the best
in the group.'
Among the innovations that have helped Finsch achieve its objectives are
some remote-controlled LHD (load-haul-dump) trucks which are similar to
radio-controlled toy vehicles or boats. Using VHF radio signals, a driver
can stand back and send a truck on its own to dig out material from areas
between the old pit wall and the underground development that would not
otherwise be mined because of the dangers involved. When, as occasionally
happens, rock crashes on to the LHD trucks, it is relatively simply to haul
the vehicles out virtually undamaged.
<PERSON>Mr Webb</PERSON> says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, at
which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make
recovery viable.
Finsch - named after the discoverers, <PERSON>Messrs Fincham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schwabel</PERSON>, who
stumbled across the kimberlite pipe containing the diamonds when actually
they were looking for asbestos - is one of the victims of the present
turmoil in the diamond market caused mainly by uncertainties about Russian
exports.
About 500 of its 1,900 employees were laid off in <DATE>August 1992</DATE>. It is mining
only five days a week at present and processing on four days. Last year
Finsch mined 2.68m tonnes and recovered 2m carats of diamonds compared with
4.7m tonnes mined and 3.446m carats in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Webb</PERSON> suggests <DATE>1994</DATE> output will be similar to last year's. But when market
conditions improve, production can be brought back up to previous levels in
about six months.

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operation Desert Shield, along with
holding off Iraqi soldiers, is also shielding the desert from
another force that each year devastates Saudi rangeland: millions
of Iraqi sheep.
   An inadvertent side effect of impending war, conservationists
say, is that Iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration
across the border to find pasture for sheep, goats and camels.
   That, they say, is no small windfall to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, where a
loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into
wasteland across much of the country.
   ``Tanks and jeeps running around up there are nothing compared
to what happens from overgrazing,'' said <PERSON>Graham Child</PERSON>, senior
consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and
Development</ORGANIZATION>.
   Crisis or not, the commission is pressing ahead with a 10-year
plan to protect endangered habitats and restock them with
disease-free gazelle, ostrich and native birds.
   The measures have already brought the Arabian oryx back from
extinction in the wild. Two species of gazelle are being bred by
the hundreds.
   There are also some new houbara bustards, large birds beloved by
Saudis who hunt them with falcons.
   Arabian rangelands, slowly degrading for a thousand years, now
suffer badly from <LOCATION>Saudi Bedouin</LOCATION> now able to use water trucks to
graze their animals on fragile land they could not reach before.
   Under historic accords, Iraqi and Jordanian nomads have crossed
regularly into northern <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> to find fresh range. They have
benefited from the same generous subsidies allowed the Saudis.
   At the same time, swift rural development in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>
brought new roads, irrigated farming and other incursions on
natural habitats.
   Saudi leaders realized they faced a crisis in the mid-1980s when
hunters consistently camehome empty-handed. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, the
commission was set up to do something about it.
   Within four years, 57,692 square miles were designated protected
areas. Specialists came in to shape a wildlife research center from
a neglected private zoo on the late <LOCATION>King Khalid</LOCATION>'s farm north of
here.
   At a second center, scientists experimented with ways to breed
enough houbara bustard chicks to save the threatened wild
population.
   ``They've achieved an enormous amount in three years,'' said
<PERSON>Doug Williamson</PERSON>, an English-based biologist who runs the <ORGANIZATION>King
Khalid Wildlife Research Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Things are far from perfect, but there is goodwill and money
is being committed,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Abdul Aziz abu Zinada</PERSON>, the commision's secretary-general, said
his priorities were protecting habitats, seeking environmental
legislation, restocking wildlife and building public awareness.
   Conflict with <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> has stalled plans for regional cooperation,
he said, but international organizations have continued to help
with data and advice.
   ``Now in the north you can see idmi (sand gazelle) where they
had almost disappeared,'' Abu <PERSON>Zinada</PERSON> said. ``It is thrilling.''
   At the <ORGANIZATION>King Khalid Center</ORGANIZATION>, scientists have all but eliminated
the tuberculosis which, traced back to a gift deer from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, had
crippled herds left for years in a single enclosure.
   Soon the 600 to 700 gazelles now thriving as a result of the
program will be breeding hundreds of kids a year to be released
into the wild, <PERSON>Williamson</PERSON> said.
   The center has two pairs of afri, or Saudi dorcas gazelles,
among the <DATE>last 27</DATE> believed left in the world.
   Altogether, there are 20 species from five continents.
   The animals thrive in separate pens and paddocks and include a
mix of indigenous species and gifts from visitors. There are idmi,
rheem (mountain gazelle), other rare gazelles, Arabian oryx,
zebras, ostriches and assorted extras, including a mad half-goat,
half-ibex that thinks it's a deer.
   Williamson, an antelope specialist who worked in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>, is also conducting research on how gazelle cope
with roasting desert temperatures.
   ``We haven't been affected much by the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> crisis,'' he said,
echoing remarks by scientists conducting other commission projects.
   ``There is a lot to do still, but we're doing it.''

FT  25 JUN 94 / Books: African journeys - JDF Jones discovers a
classic-in-waiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ELECTRONIC ELEPHANT by <PERSON>Dan Jacobson Hamish Hamilton</PERSON> Pounds 17.99, 373
pages
HAPPY SAD LAND by <PERSON>Mark McCrum Sinclair-Stevenson</PERSON> Pounds 16.99, 455 pages
INNOCENTS IN <LOCATION>AFRICA</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Drury Pifer Granta Books Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 15.99, 338 pages
<PERSON>Dan Jacobson</PERSON> has taken time off from his crafted and distinguished novels to
go home - home to <LOCATION>Kimberley</LOCATION>, the diamond town, and thence to travel up the
'Missionary Road', that ancient African route which slips between the
Kalahari and the <PERSON>Boers</PERSON> and finishes at the <LOCATION>Zambesi</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Victoria Falls</LOCATION>.
It is not one of the region's finer scenic routes, featuring as it does
countless miles of thorn, sand and scrub, so <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> has to explain that he
was attracted to the journey in part by its historical interest, in part by
its personal reference - 'that half-known, half-feared region which had lain
forbiddingly on the very doorstep of the <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> I had grown up in'. We are
to be taken back, then, to the scene of his early - brilliant - novels,
before he graduated to a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> professorial chair and ambitious novels on
Old Testament themes. The best thing in The Electronic Elephant is his
description of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern Cape</ORGANIZATION> veld, which sends us back after all these
years to A Dance in the Sun and its images of a furious Afrikaner isolation.
The route to the north was indeed important to the 19th-century
missionaries, who were in the vanguard of colonial conquest. 'The
<ORGANIZATION>Livingstone Liquor Stall</ORGANIZATION>' in <LOCATION>Campbell</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Griquatown</LOCATION>, is a reminder of the
presiding genius of the tale. It is a road, argues <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON>, littered with
the wreckage of successive ideologies: European imperialism, Boer
nationalism, Victorian racialism, apartheid, African liberation, <PERSON>Marxism</PERSON> -
and Christianity, which alone has survived, and prospered, in its peculiar
African styles. In a lovely scene in the <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION> mission church the
secular-Jewish <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> and his atheist wife are the only congregation at
the Easter service: 'Making sense of my presence there was impossible;
impossible also not to feel the strangest mixture of wonder, embarrassment,
mirth, fraudulence, compassion for our hosts, even a kind of protectiveness
towards them'.
This is, as you would expect, a journey informed by the novelist's eye. He
encounters <PERSON>Bushman</PERSON> soldiers brought back for their safety from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> by the
<ORGANIZATION>South African Defence Forces</ORGANIZATION> whose forebears had massacred them to
near-extinction (it is, as he says, 'surreal'); he meets a group of
far-Right Afrikaners who are preparing for their own ethnic, on-screen
state; he returns, always, to the history of these obscure territories; he
notes that it was platinum as well as tourism which transformed the economy
of President <PERSON>Mangope</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Bophuthatswana</LOCATION>; he has the expatriate white South
African's gentle scepticism of the future ('A 'non-racial' <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>? One
might as well talk of breeding a kosher pig . . .')
When he moves out of the Republic he is less confident: he does not respond
to <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> and is ill at ease in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. The single map is inadequate,
the absence of an index is regrettable, and he can't spell <LOCATION>Mmabatho</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mark McCrum</PERSON> has published the story of another journey around <LOCATION>Southern
Africa</LOCATION>. The scheme is simple: <PERSON>McCrum</PERSON> spent time in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> as a teenager in
<DATE>1977</DATE> and liked it; 15 years later he went back. Cue to a pleasantly readable
account of his travels and his undramatic adventures. McCrum has a good ear
for dialogue and does not take himself too seriously. Happy Sad Land makes
an interesting, relaxed, unessential read for anyone interested in that part
of the world. He can't spell Van Zyl Slabbert.
The best of the bunch, the surprise, the curiosity from out of the blue, the
classic-in-waiting, is <PERSON>Drury Pifer</PERSON>'s Innocents in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. Pifer is an
American, a playwright who was brought up in <LOCATION>Southern Africa</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> as
son of a mining engineer who was employed on the <ORGANIZATION>Rand</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Kimberley</LOCATION>, in
<LOCATION>South-west Africa</LOCATION>, and then in <LOCATION>Kimberley</LOCATION> again.
<PERSON>Pifer</PERSON> has produced an entrancing memoir of childhood in pre-apartheid days.
This book, written with superb precision and elegance, its recall of detail
based on access to his beloved mother's letters home, is utterly fascinating
about the <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> of those pre-war years, yet it is more than this, it
evokes and recreates the intimacy of the life of a happy family of
half-a-century ago. The fact that they were Americans gives a unique view of
the English-Afrikaner tensions of those formative years, but the deeper
subject is its poetic recapture of the experiences of childhood which most
of us never recall in more than fragments.
The Pifers went back to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> at the end of the war: 'It didn't occur to
us that this journey out of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> was the last time we would find ourselves
together and happy, day after day, perfectly matched in our non-stop prattle
and familiar love . . .' The boy never went back.
Innocents in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> deserves a much longer review: let this be a shorthand
recommendation of a wonderful book. He can't spell Japie.

FT  22 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: Penny-pinching chic for the recession -
Lucia van der Post goes bargain-hunting and finds that even in these
straitened times it can be fun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS something about <DATE>February</DATE> that seems to induce in me a fit of
parsimony. This is not normally something that comes naturally, as my
husband is the first to rue, but I am taking a perverse kind of pleasure in
seeking out ways of spending less without having any less fun.
There are, of course, cycles in patterns of expenditure and few of us remain
unaffected by the moods that sweep our worlds.
What is interesting about the current cycle is while some are forced to cut
back for the saddest of reasons (unemployment, redundancy, rising costs)
others, whose incomes have not been affected one jot by the current economic
woes, also feel unaccountably constrained when it comes to consuming.
It is not quite done to go on spending in the old audacious ways. Cutting
back is seriously a la mode. Conspicuous Thrift is back in vogue.
Designer clothes are being tracked down at less than full retail price,
houses are being repainted and given a new lease of life with bargains from
markets and salerooms, upholstery and stencilling classes are there for the
taking, secondhand books are being sought, casseroles and pastas are turning
up on tables instead of foie gras and magret de canard. All it needs is
ingenuity, thought and style.
Here for those who feel hard-up and inclined to join the challenge are a few
suggestions for ways and means of cutting down without feeling deprived:
The ardent bookworm will have noticed that hardback books, once bought
lightheartedly, without thought for purse or pocket, have now become a
serious luxury.
Every town has its secondhand bookshop but in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> the best, for serious
readers, is generally agreed to be Skoob, 15 Sicilian Avenue, <ORGANIZATION>Southampton
Row</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> WC1. Mostly rather academically-inclined books but lots of
general interest, too.
Joining The <LOCATION>London Library</LOCATION>, 14 <ORGANIZATION>St. James's Square</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW1 could also be
a good move - it would not take many books to recoup the Pounds 100 a year
fee. You can join almost instantly - just fill in the form and pay up.
Secondhand clothes are, of course, the cheapest, if not always the most
fashionable, way of dressing.
For chaps <PERSON>Bertie Wooster</PERSON> of 284 <ORGANIZATION>Fulham Road</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW10, is a newcomer.
Here the would-be gentleman can kit himself out in authentic gear at a
fraction of the full retail price.
Everything is secondhand, all in what its owner calls 'really good nick.'
Dinner jackets can be bought for Pounds 75, morning coats and trousers from
Pounds 75 to Pounds 130 and bespoke, tailor-made suits for between Pounds 45
and Pounds 85. A pair of cords would be Pounds 25, tweed suits from Pounds
65 to Pounds 100.
There is many a chic woman who waits for the periodic peripatetic Designers'
Sale to bring her wardrobe up to date.
The next are not until <DATE>June 5</DATE> - <DATE>7</DATE>. Tel: 071-223-8004 for tickets when you
could put your summer wardrobe in order.
Do not forget the charity shops which seem to have become rather demode
recently.
I bought a ravishing silky ruffled blouse (ex-Saks 5th Avenue) at my local
branch for Pounds 3.60 which, though I say it myself, acquitted itself well
last week at a chic Parisian party.
For those who can dressmake or upholster or make their own curtains The
Cloth Shop, 290 Portobello road, <ORGANIZATION>Ladbroke Grove</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W10 (tel:
081-968-6001) is well worth knowing about.
Most fabrics are sold at half-price. There are wool suitings at Pounds 10 a
metre, old velvets from Pounds 1 to Pounds 12 a metre, as well as wonderful
collection of old English tie fabrics from the late <DATE>1950s</DATE>.
Then there are designer fabrics from people such as <PERSON>John Galliano</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Arabella Pollen</PERSON> and at the moment a collection of <PERSON>Ralph Lauren</PERSON> blankets for
Pounds 80 (normally Pounds 300.)
When it comes to furnishing the home do not forget the markets - getting up
early on a <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> to go to <LOCATION>Bermondsey</LOCATION>, south <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, trawling the
auction rooms and rooting around in the secondhand shops still provides the
best bargains and gives homes an interesting and eclectic air.
<PERSON>Eric Geen</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Town &amp; Country Auctions</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, The Bargain <PERSON>Hunter</PERSON>'s
handbook (published by the <ORGANIZATION>AA</ORGANIZATION>, Pounds 5.99) is still in print and is still
the best guide to salerooms all over the country.
The <ORGANIZATION>Java Cotton Company</ORGANIZATION>, 52 <ORGANIZATION>Lonsdale Road</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W11 5BY (some of its wares
are photographed top right) sells ravishing hand-drawn and hand-block batik,
all made by traditional Javanese methods.
Anyone who has already come across batik will know what truly lovely effects
it produces, anyone who does not should hurry along to take a look. Besides
selling the handblocked cottons by the metre (Pounds 14.75), it also has a
range of accessories made from the fabric - table napkins (Pounds 2.25),
cushions (Pounds 18.75) and tablecloths (from Pounds 38).
<PERSON>Ian Mankin</PERSON>, of 109 <ORGANIZATION>Regent's Park Road</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, MW1 8UT, has long been a
source of sturdy inexpensive fabrics - all those lovely old-fashioned things
such as mattress ticking (Pounds 4.75 a metre), striped muslin (Pounds 4.50
a metre), calico (Pounds 2.00) cricket stripes (Pounds 5.80) and cotton net
(Pounds 1.25).
Now he has opened another branch south of the Park at 271, <LOCATION>Wandsworth Bridge
Road</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW6 2TX. Look out also for double width linen by the metre,
wide enough for a 5 ft 6 ins bed, at Pounds 29.80 which means you could make
a pair for Pounds 165 instead of paying the Pounds 235 that currently the
lowest priced ready-made version costs.
<PERSON>Anthony Thompson</PERSON> currently has some marvellous rugs, carpets, shawls,
needlepoint and textiles on sale at very special prices. The market has been
seriously depressed all year and if you go along to his shop at 5, <ORGANIZATION>Hillgate
Street</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W8 7 SP you will find early 20th century needlework chair
covers from Pounds 20, rugs from Pounds 50 and lots of other bargains
besides.
Then there is our old friend the Next Directory - I cannot recommend highly
enough the new spring version. It is beautifully photographed and filled
with highly desirable clothes and household goods, from simple shorts and
trousers, sweaters, the best T-shirts I have yet seen  - generous sleeves
with dropped shoulders, good necklines in marled blue, grey or cream for
Pounds 12.99 - to an excellent range of household basics.
Look for 100 per cent cotton percale bedding at Pounds 19.99 for a single
sheet, chambray bed linen at Pounds 29.99 for a single duvet cover and plain
ridged glass bowls (photographed below) at Pounds 16.99 for four. Well worth
sending for. For the catalogue (Pounds 1) tel: 0345-100-500.
And now, having saved all that money, what about a treat?
Hartley Safaris have, at the request of four <DATE>Weekend</DATE> FT readers who came
with us to the Kalahari and the <ORGANIZATION>Okavango delta</ORGANIZATION> two years ago, put together a
very special trip to the remote <ORGANIZATION>Kalahari Gemsbok Park</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Etosha</LOCATION> pan, the
Skeleton coast and the Namib desert.
It will be a privileged group of just ten readers and some smashing guides -
eight places are booked, only two places, which will go to the first takers,
are left.
It runs from <DATE>April 24</DATE> - <DATE>May 8</DATE> and costs Pounds 4,579 each. Full itineraries
available from <PERSON>Hartley</PERSON>'s Safaris, 12 <ORGANIZATION>Queensberry Mews West</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SW7 2DXU.

   This woman is impossible. In the middle of the night, she
wakes her lover to complain. He has resumed the bedtime
ritual she loves best, reading poetry to her. It's unfairly
seductive, she tells him. He agrees, makes no protest, goes
back to sleep. So, she wakes him again to apologize for
waking him the first time. Miraculously, he doesn't shoot
her.
   If things are going well for the never-named, first-person
narrator of Norman Rush's "Mating" (Knopf, 477 pages, $23),
she worries. If they're going badly, she worries in
overdrive. She lives to talk, amusing her lover at one point
by saying she's bored when she's silent. Should she have a
child, she imagines she would be impatient for it to begin
talking, and pets aren't for her because they don't talk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Her seatmate on a short flight, say <LOCATION>Boston-New York</LOCATION>, might
find her entertaining. If the flight were any longer, he
would have a headset on and the country music channel pumping
at top volume.
   She is in her early 30s, an anthropologist whose Ph.D.
thesis is going nowhere. In her journal, she writes things
like: "I think what I want is the feeling I got when I first
read <PERSON>David Hume</PERSON>, when I felt something like a cold light
bathing me." (Flight attendant] Here's the headset back,
bring me a parachute.)
   To call attention to what a special case she is, her
narration is sprinkled with simple German, Latin and French
words plus enough obscure English vocabulary to give a
diligent reader's dictionary a workout.
   For all her infuriating habits, she also has a sense of
humor, a keen eye for cant in others and great daring. In the
first sections of "Mating," there is much to like. The
narrator is biding her time in <LOCATION>Gabarone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s capital,
being wry and funny about everything from expatriate life in
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to anthropology to her own appearance. "Not that I'm
so beautiful, unless hair volume determines beauty."
   She is looking for a little repose and a bit of sexual
adventure after a disastrous time in the remote Tswapong
Hills where she went to pursue a thesis on nutritional
anthropology among primitive gatherers only to find that she
had been misinformed. "Gathering was a dead issue in my part
of the bush. Normal-type food seems to have percolated
everywhere," she explains.
   Enter <PERSON>Nelson Denoon</PERSON>. He is one of the world's most famous
and controversial experts on development. She calls him the
<LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION> of the field, since he reached an early zenith
with a book that outraged development professionals and won
adoration from undergraduates. Denoon fires verbal bullets at
the right and the left, declaring that "Capitalism is
strangling black <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>: Socialism will bury her]"
   He is in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> running a top-secret experiment in the
<LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION> and our woman, after meeting him briefly in
<LOCATION>Gabarone</LOCATION>, sets out to bag him.
   To do so, she has to walk several days across the desert,
a brave trek that she barely survives. Once safely at
<PERSON>Denoon</PERSON>'s model community, Tsau, she finds it has been built
around women, many from the lowest social strata. The
female-run project seems an ingenious and thriving success
although water supply is always precarious.
   <PERSON>Mr. Rush</PERSON> is a high-stakes gambler. For a man to make an
intellectual, insecure, independent, overly introspective
woman the narrator of a novel is a risk. He succeeds quite
brilliantly in the creation of a character, but he abruptly
runs out of story. Once <PERSON>Denoon</PERSON> has been brought to bed, the
wheels come off "Mating." In fact, the novel fails because
Tsau and <PERSON>Denoon</PERSON>, not our impossibly demanding narrator, don't
command attention.
   Early on, our woman noted that <PERSON>Denoon</PERSON> badly needs an
editor -- a polite way of saying he is a bore. Alas, he
becomes less and less interesting the more deeply our
narrator explores his mind and body. The novel loses its
early charm and <PERSON>Mr. Rush</PERSON>, who five years ago published
"Whites," a lively and powerful collection of stories about
expatriates in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, seems to take less and less care with
his writing.
   "I was scribbling away when mes amis said koko," reads one
sentence, koko being a word meaning "knock-knock." Bushmen
are described as people "who had nothing except lice but were
happier than we were." So it goes in <LOCATION>Tsau</LOCATION>.
   The love affair goes as flat as the prose. Having bagged
her man, our narrator wants to leave Tsau and make little
Denoons. That doesn't appeal to the Great Man. Doubts fill
the desert air.
   She has already warned us that mating is a tricky
business: "Assortative mating shows there has to be some
drive in nature to bring equals together in the toils of
love, so why even in the most enlightened and beautifully
launched unions are we afraid we hear the master-slave
relationship moving its slow thighs somewhere in the
vicinity?" she says, bemoaning how hard it is to find love
between equals.
   And if anyone ever had sharp ears for bad-news thighs
coming over the horizon, it's our narrator. Meanwhile, the
traumas in Tsau build. They leave <PERSON>Denoon</PERSON> passive and ready
for marriage and babies. But, a passive <PERSON>Denoon</PERSON> isn't what our
woman wants. She splits. Only to have second thoughts. Of
course, for her, second thoughts are but a beginning. There
will be thirds, fourths, thoughts without number. For those
we will have to await "Mating: The Sequel."

FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Green shoots in Africa - Lucia van der Post
invites readers to join her on a special trip to Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I THOUGHT I had hung up my (professional) safari hat. With small groups of
FT readers I have canoed down the <LOCATION>Zambezi</LOCATION>, camped in the innermost reaches
of the Kalahari, walked through swamps in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, looked for <PERSON>Bushman</PERSON>
paintings in the Tsodilo hills, skirted hippos in the <LOCATION>Okavango Delta</LOCATION>,
watched the eagles fly and the lion hunt . . . happy, happy days in the
company of lots of smashing readers.
That <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> could still have further delights to offer seemed unimaginable.
But that was before I met <PERSON>Iain</PERSON> and <PERSON>Oria Douglas-Hamilton</PERSON>.
Anybody who knows anything about <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> knows that there is scarcely another
soul who knows as much about elephants, who has spent as many hours right in
among them, as <LOCATION>Iain</LOCATION> and Oria. Ever since <PERSON>Iain</PERSON> went out to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> as a young
Oxford zoology graduate to complete his Ph. D thesis on elephant behaviour,
and met Oria at a party in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>, elephants have been their lives. They
have studied them on the shores of <LOCATION>Lake Manyara</LOCATION>, charted their falling
numbers up and down the width and length of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, fought for them, lobbied
for them and written about them. 'Nobody,' said <PERSON>Desmond Morris</PERSON> recently,
'has done more for elephants than the Douglas-Hamiltons.'
So a chance to go in among the elephants with <PERSON>Iain</PERSON> and <PERSON>Oria</PERSON> as our guides
seemed special enough to make me look to my safari hat. This will be the
first time the Douglas-Hamiltons have taken a group on this kind of safari.
There are places for just 16 people in all. The Douglas-Hamiltons will
accompany the group from beginning to end. They will take you among the
groups of elephants they have got to know so well in <LOCATION>Lake Manyara</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Tsavo
East National Park</LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION>Tarangire River</LOCATION> where in <DATE>September</DATE> (the
time of our safari) huge herds gather to drink among the baobab trees.
You will stay in private camps, most of them set up specially for the group
in areas where the game viewing is best or where the herds are known to be
gathering. There will be picnic lunches in the bush, evening meals on the
banks of rivers, nights spent with nothing but slivers of canvas between you
and the African darkness.
Iain and <ORGANIZATION>Oria</ORGANIZATION>, however, will not be the only experts. After seven days the
group flies (with the Douglas-Hamiltons as well) to the ottoman-style camp
of <PERSON>Roland Purcell</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Mahale Mountains</LOCATION> on the eastern shores of <LOCATION>Lake
Tanganyika</LOCATION>. Here among the palm-nut vultures, the fish eagles, the goliath
herons you will stay for three nights, with <LOCATION>Roland</LOCATION> on hand to illuminate the
experience. Roland is to chimps what the Douglas-Hamiltons are to elephants.
He has studied them, knows their families, has given them names and is a
world-renowned expert on primate behaviour. There, in the tropical
rainforest, is the largest known group of chimpanzees in the world, some 100
strong, which <ORGANIZATION>Roland</ORGANIZATION> will take you to.
From the <LOCATION>Mahale Mountains</LOCATION> another private charter flight takes you to your
own camp in a private part of the <ORGANIZATION>Masai Mara Reserve</ORGANIZATION> to search for the
wildebeest migration, one of the great sights of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
The trip ends with three days in the Douglas-Hamiltons' own home on the
shores of <LOCATION>Lake Naivasha</LOCATION> with more local treats such as lunch among the
flamingoes of <LOCATION>Lake Nakuru</LOCATION> and a flight round <LOCATION>Mount Kenya</LOCATION> (designed to make
sure you come back to climb it).
The safari starts at <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday, September 3</DATE> and finishes back at
<LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday, September 20</DATE>. It has been orchestrated by African
Explorations of <ORGANIZATION>Holwell Manor Barn</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Holwell</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Burford</LOCATION>, Oxon OX18 4JS.
At Pounds 5,499 per person it is not cheap - (time perhaps to say sod the
recession?) - but I believe that what you will be getting is unbeatable:
world authorities on elephants and chimpanzees, private camps in secluded
parts of the bush and private charter flights from one area to another.
Anybody wanting more information and a detailed itinerary should write to me
at <ORGANIZATION>The Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>, No 1 <ORGANIZATION>Southwark Bridge</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> SE1 9HL, marking the
envelope 'Safari'. To book a guaranteed place a deposit of Pounds 1,000 will
be required (non-returnable except in cases covered by holiday insurance).
It should be made payable to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> Explorations but sent to me.
As I have learnt from past experience that readers in far-flung parts feel
rather disadvantaged by distance and postal services, I will allow a full
fortnight for letters to arrive and itineraries to be sent out. After that
it will be first come, first served.
'Even today, to visit <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> is a feast for the senses,' says <ORGANIZATION>Bartle Bull</ORGANIZATION> in
his splendid tome on the history of the safari. I believe he is right. We
cannot know what <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> must have looked like to those first explorers a
century and a half ago but I do know that conservation policies are
beginning to show some results. <PERSON>Iain Douglas-Hamilton</PERSON> tells me the elephant
herds in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> are healthier and more numerous than they were ten years ago.
Everywhere a sense of the treasures that we so nearly lost - and might yet
lose - has brought a heightened sense of care and awareness. At present we
are lucky. The <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> we yearn for is still there to be discovered.

<HEAD>African Elephant Population Declined By One-Third From 1981-7</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread poaching has reduced the
African elephant population by more than one-third during the
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, from 1.2 million to less than 800,000, a conservation group
said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kalahari Conservation Society</ORGANIZATION> said in its monthly newletter
that <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> was the only African country to report a substantial
increase in its elephant population during from <DATE>1981</DATE> to <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The number of elephants in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> rose from 20,000 to 51,000
during the seven years, the newsletter said.
   Overall, the African elephant population fell from 1.2 million
in <DATE>1981</DATE> to 764,000 by <DATE>1987</DATE>, the group said. The decline was
attributed almost completely to the poaching of elephants for their
valuable ivory tusks, the newsletter said.
   The Botswana-based conservation society said the figures came
from the <ORGANIZATION>African Elephant Conservation Coordinating Group</ORGANIZATION>, which
was assisted by the Swiss-based Convention on <ORGANIZATION>International Trade</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Endangered Species</LOCATION>.

<FP=106> [Interview with President <PERSON>Sam Nujoma</PERSON> by <PERSON>Veronique Kiesel</PERSON> in </F>
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>; date not given: "On <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> and the President's Visit 
to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>"] 
  [Text] [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] Four years ago, <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> gained independence 
and, after winning the elections, you became its first 
president. What has changed in your country since then? 
  [<LOCATION>Nujoma</LOCATION>] The Namibians are free, masters of their fate. They 
make their own decisions, through the process of parliamentary 
democracy. Human rights are respected, as is press freedom and 
freedom of speech, which are protected by law. Before that, 
people were separated according to their color, their ethnic 
origin. Today, Namibian children go to school together, all are 
citizens of the same country. We have striven to establish 
peace and stability, which are vital to economic development. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] Your government program includes an agrarian 
reform, 
the redistribution of land to peasants who were deprived of it. 
Is this reform not likely to disrupt the good relations which 
you have succeeded in maintaining with the white minority in 
your country? 
  [<LOCATION>Nujoma</LOCATION>] <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> was colonized first by the Germans, and <PERCENT>80 
percent</PERCENT> of arable land is in the hands of the Whites. Now that 
apartheid no longer exists, and that all Namibians are equal 
citizens, we need land for some people, but we believe in the 
virtues of dialogue. The land problem was discussed at the <DATE>1991</DATE> 
<ORGANIZATION>National Conference</ORGANIZATION>, with all the interlocutors, including the 
Whites. A technical committee then sent a report to the 
government and to <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. Of course, there are some Whites 
who do not want to share, who support the status quo, but the 
Constitution guarantees everybody's rights, and we want to 
ensure that every Namibian can own land. This is a big country, 
and there is a political will to achieve justice and a decent 
life for all. I therefore think we will manage to overcome this 
problem. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] Your big South African neighbor has just changed 
its 
face with <ORGANIZATION>Nelson Mandela</ORGANIZATION>'s victory. What wishes do you have for 
the new <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and what are your hopes for <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> and the 
rest of the region? 
  [<PERSON>Nujoma</PERSON>] As citizens, we welcome the new democratic and 
nonracial <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. We hope that there will be no more 
explosions of violence as there were before the elections, but 
that instead all <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> will set to work for the common 
good. 
  As for our relations with our big neighbor, we hope that by 
joining the various regional organizations, and with its high 
economic standard, it will contribute to the welfare of the 
whole of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and even the whole continent. At 
present, our economy is highly dependent on <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 
economy, because of our historical ties. I think that this can 
be used in a positive way, now that apartheid is a thing of the 
past. Together we can be stronger faced with competition from 
the rest of the world. Let us follow the example of the 
<ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>), we should succeed in creating an African 
economic community. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] Just a few years ago, you were regarded as a 
Marxist 
guerrilla and now you are developing a free trade economic 
policy. How do you explain this change? 
  [<LOCATION>Nujoma</LOCATION>] I have been called all kinds of names: I was a 
terrorist, a Communist. In fact, I was primarily a Namibian, a 
member of the international community, who was fighting for his 
country's independence against the occupying forces. Today, our 
enemies have changed: They are called poverty, ignorance, and 
disease, and we must fight them. Our country has many 
resources: Uranium, copper, gold, and other metals, but we need 
education to be able to really exploit this wealth. That is why 
we opened a university <DATE>last year</DATE>, and why we are building many 
schools and hospitals. This improvement in our society is vital. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] Since the beginning of <DATE>last year</DATE>, the port of 
<LOCATION>Walvis Bay</LOCATION>, which was always occupied by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, has been 
returned to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. What are your plans on this subject? 
  [<PERSON>Nujoma</PERSON>] As you know, <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> occupies a strategic position 
in this part of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. It provides access to the ocean for 
enclaved countries like <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, 
especially in view of the fact that we are working on big 
highways, like the trans-Kalahari Highway. <LOCATION>Walvis Bay</LOCATION> is 
already one of the most efficient ports in the whole of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, 
and, by railroad, it is even linked with <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>. The more 
transport routes there are, the more we will be able to develop 
trade and business, inside the continent itself. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] With regard to the development of the port, you are 
in contact with <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nujoma</ORGANIZATION>] Indeed, we went to visit the port of <LOCATION>Antwerp</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> [18 <DATE>May</DATE>] and we have been very impressed by 
the organization of labor. Moreover, we are very interested in 
an agreement which would enable us to improve the training of 
Namibians in this sphere. The <ORGANIZATION>Belgian Government</ORGANIZATION> has promised 
us the necessary funds for a training program of this kind. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] Aside from this cooperation agreement, what are the 
aims of your visit to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>? 
  [<PERSON>Nujoma</PERSON>] <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> is a product of the international 
community. 
My colleagues and I have all experienced exile, especially in 
<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, which is rather like our second home: Two <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> 
[South- west African People's Organization] conferences were 
held there in <DATE>1972</DATE> and <DATE>1986</DATE>. From our early days, we were 
supported here in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> by antiapartheid organizations and by 
trade unions, then by the government. We have very good 
friends, and this visit is an opportunity to revive the 
excellent relations between our two countries. Just after our 
independence, to express our gratitude, I invited <PERSON>King Baudouin</PERSON> 
to <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. He accepted, but unfortunately did not have time to 
come to see us. Moreover, we came here with proposals for 
commercial agreements, and plans for joint-ventures between 
private enterprises. 
  [<PERSON>Kiesel</PERSON>] What about the European aspect of your visit to 
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>? 
  [<LOCATION>Nujoma</LOCATION>] From before we gained our independence, the 
<ORGANIZATION>European 
Community</ORGANIZATION> gave us its support, and it continued afterwards, 
especially through aid for training. The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> therefore plays a 
vital role with regard to us, and we want to continue these 
relations in the most beneficial way.

<LEADPARA>  EVERY evening, just before dusk, the elephants come down to drink in the Ngamo
Flats. Groups of a dozen or more lumber across the sand toward the "pans" that
turn to mud in the southern African dry season. They siphon water with their
great trunks, trumpeting angrily whenever the occasional train roars past on
Hwange's border.;    Chris Van Wyk, a strapping Afrikaner, likes to think of
the ritual as his own private elephant show. "I've been running safaris here
for three years," he said, rolling his R's in classic Boer style. "And I don't
think I've missed a single performance."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tonight, as we emerged from the acacia forest in <LOCATION>Van Wyk</LOCATION>'s Toyota Land

in fright, kicking up clouds of white Kalahari desert sand. But one old bull
lingered in a water hole 50 yards from us, oblivious to our intrusion. Van Wyk
descended from the vehicle, scattered sand, then, satisfied that we were
downwind of the keen-smelling, nearsighted beast, silently motioned me forward
until we were just a few long strides away.;    Suddenly, he froze -- we'd
moved a little too close. The bull had emerged from the pan and was plodding
straight at us, raising his mud-covered tusks. Van Wyk began running backward,
slapping a cartridge into his Winchester and locking the bolt. Distracted or
confused, the elephant turned away.;    <ORGANIZATION>Hwange National Park</ORGANIZATION> sits on the high
semidesert plains in the northwest corner of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, formerly called
<LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION> after British imperialist <PERSON>Cecil Rhodes</PERSON>. This arid "safari belt" was
once the country's war zone. My visit during the African <DATE>winter last August</DATE>
came 10 years after black Patriotic Front guerrillas, led by <PERSON>Joshua Nkomo</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON>, triumphed in their struggle to topple the white-minority regime
and created the new nation of Zimbabwe.;    The Rhodesian war, which lasted
from <DATE>1972</DATE> to <DATE>1980</DATE>, killed more than 15,000 people in sporadic bush clashes and
raids on army bases and white homesteads. Within a few months of independence,
150,000 of <LOCATION>Rhodesia</LOCATION>'s white population of 250,000 had fled, many resettling in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. There they could continue the life of privilege that had
disappeared from the rest of the continent.;    Today a traveler in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
has the sense of a nation finally at peace. Some of the 100,000 white
"Rhodies" who remain are prospering like Van Wyk, by running safaris in the
very bush where they spent the civil war. Blacks, who comprise <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of
the 9.5 million people and who were held back under the white-minority regime,
now dominate the civil service in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s cities and, in the bush, are
making slow inroads in the tourist business.;    The apartheid that blights
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has become an odious memory here -- although many Rhodies' sense
of racial superiority has hardly dimmed with black independence.;    <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
does resemble <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in one respect -- its efforts to protect its
resources. The 14,000-square-mile <ORGANIZATION>Hwange</ORGANIZATION> has 18,000 elephants, among the
greatest herds in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Zambezi Valley</LOCATION> is the last sanctuary of the
endangered black rhino. Because of the Civil War, tourism has been slow to
develop in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, and concessions that dole out huge chunks of wilderness
to a single safari operator, like <PERSON>Van Wyk</PERSON>, aren't unusual. That has kept
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> from becoming marred by the crowds and the commercialization of
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, which most Americans think of when they consider an African safari.;   
Indeed, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, along with neighboring <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, has a reputation among
wildlife connoisseurs for the most unspoiled game viewing on the continent.
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> also has one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s better developed infrastructures, from the
capital <LOCATION>Harare</LOCATION> to the tiny settlement of <LOCATION>Kariba</LOCATION>, gateway to the <LOCATION>Zambezi
Valley</LOCATION>. One of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s more prosperous countries (although plagued by
drought, unemployment and AIDS), for many Americans it remains a hazy place, a
Third World "hot spot" that still evokes images of land mines and AK-47-toting
guerrillas. During my two-week journey, I saw groups of British and South
African tourists -- but not a single American.;    My travels through <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
took me to several other places that echo <ORGANIZATION>Hwange</ORGANIZATION>'s magnificent isolation and
bountiful wildlife. Along the <LOCATION>Zambezi River</LOCATION>, I paddled through gorges and
Everglades-like shallows, slept on sand banks and, except for my canoeing
group, didn't encounter another human for days. At <ORGANIZATION>Matusadona National Park</ORGANIZATION> on
the shores of <LOCATION>Lake Kariba</LOCATION>, I stayed in a houseboat moored in a shallow bay
amid thousands of drowned trees -- and tracked lions in a hardscrabble land of
mopani trees, red-clay termite mounds and towering ilala-nut palms.;    Alone
at the falls;    Even <PERSON>Victoria Falls</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s prime tourist attraction,
feels virtually undiscovered. In the early morning, I reached the
300-foot-high falls via a dirt path through the rain forest. I paid one
Zimbabwean dollar (<MONEY>40 cents</MONEY>) to a sleepy clerk, and then walked along a muddy
precipice in solitude before the misting, mile-wide cascade.;    But nowhere
is <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s wildness, openness and isolation better experienced than at a
camp such as <PERSON>Van Wyk</PERSON>'s, a handful of tents down a gravel track in the
southeast corner of Hwange Park.;    A half-dozen luxury tents -- each
equipped with a cot, kerosene stove, night table and folding chair -- were
pitched beneath leadwood and ebony trees, lush green canopies that offered
protection from <ORGANIZATION>Hwange</ORGANIZATION>'s easterly winds. Van Wyk and his Ndebele workers were
moving the camp from one clearing to another 500 yards away, digging latrines,
laying pipe from a well and erecting thatched canopies to shelter the tents. I
was his only guest during the transition period.;    Van Wyk spent three days
driving me in his Land Rover through the acacia forests, sand flats, palm
groves and open savannah of Hwange. Frequently we descended from the vehicle
and tracked the reserve's bountiful game -- giraffe, wildebeest, mongoose,
sable, zebra, ostrich, elephant, white rhino, bush buck -- on foot. We saw no
other tourists, no other vehicles.;    Each evening we returned to camp,
where, under a huge tarp, servants and cooks from the local Ndebele tribe
prepared four-course dinners by kerosene lamp in wood-burning stoves. Herds of
wildebeest -- prehistoric-looking bison with dust-mop bodies, spindly legs and
small brains -- gathered just a few yards from the tent camp. As we ate, the
night echoed with the unearthly shouts of hyenas, jackals and baboons. "Where
the tall grass ends and the short grass begins," said <PERSON>Van Wyk</PERSON>, pointing to the
spectral figures, "that's the end of human territory.";    Talk often shifted
from the animals to human concerns. Chain-smoking <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> cigarettes and
sipping a rum and <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> as we sat around a campfire, Van Wyk liked to discuss
his life as a "Rhodie" bushman in the <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> of President <PERSON>Mugabe</PERSON>. Actually,
he said, he'd considered emigrating to his native <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> when the new
government came to power. "I didn't have faith in the blacks running the
country," he admitted.;    For now <PERSON>Van Wyk</PERSON> can pretend that his little corner
of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> hasn't changed. He still sees himself as the benevolent baas,
looking after his black employees.;    But sometimes his attitude betrayed its
South African roots. He talked about his staff's "limitations," and once, as
we watched an elephant raise a leg and scratch beneath it with its trunk, he
commented: "That's just the way the blacks do it." Van Wyk laughed heartily,
while I, not wanting to antagonize my host, managed only a grimace at his
bigotry.;    If Van Wyk represents the old Rhodesian way of life and thought,
<PERSON>Jeremiah Gaza</PERSON> symbolizes the new <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. I met the 28-year-old Shona
tribesman on the <LOCATION>Zambezi River</LOCATION>, the border between <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, and
the fourth-longest river on the continent.;    <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> loved the river. He had
grown up in <LOCATION>Kariba</LOCATION> and landed a job as a driver for a safari company nine
years ago, towing canoes from <LOCATION>Kariba</LOCATION> over the <LOCATION>Zambezi Escarpment</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Mana</PERSON> Pools
75 miles away. In <DATE>1989</DATE> he became one of the first blacks to be admitted into
an apprentice program for river guides -- a sign of changing attitudes among
the white-owned companies that dominate <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s tourist trade.;    Illegal
rhino hunting;    <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> became impassioned about the illegal rhino hunting that
flourishes here. Zambian poachers carrying AK-47s sneak across by night in
pursuit of the endangered black rhino, several thousand of which live in <LOCATION>Mana
Pools</LOCATION> park. The horn sells for <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> a kilogram on the black market. To
combat the poaching, well-trained squadrons of Zimbabwean rangers patrol the
bush and the river. Since <DATE>1984</DATE>, 125 poachers have been shot to death and 55
captured, while three rangers and 675 rhino have been killed. "I can say the
Zambians are very poor," <PERSON>Gaza</PERSON> said. "They have ruined their country -- and now
they want to ruin <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>.";    A handsome man wearing an olive-green safari
hat, T-shirt, shorts and sandals, <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> led us through the bayou-like shallows,
so different from the chasms of white water that characterize the <LOCATION>Zambezi</LOCATION>
further upstream, near <LOCATION>Victoria Falls</LOCATION>. The fierce African sun rose over the
empty green hills of <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> as animals came down to the river to drink.;   
Elephants waded deliberately across the river -- gentlemanly beasts who paid
no attention as we watched them while sticking our paddles in the muck to stop
our drift downstream. The banks teemed with baboons, crocodiles, waterbuck,
<LOCATION>Cape buffalo</LOCATION>, black samango monkeys, buffalo and exotic birds ranging from
fish eagles to Goliath herons to lilac-breasted rollers.;    But the dominant
animal on the <LOCATION>Zambezi</LOCATION> is the hippo. "I can say . . . there may be 1,500 hippo
between <PERSON>Mana Pools</PERSON> and Kanyemba," said <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION>. He was constantly offering
tidbits about the river, prefacing every fact with the expression, "I can
say.";    By the third day on the <LOCATION>Zambezi</LOCATION>, the current quickened as it passed
through the <PERSON>Mupata Gorge</PERSON>, a dramatic landscape of velvety hills rising right
above the river. Thick clumps of weeds twisted around our paddles as the
current carried us swiftly downstream. Gaza gestured to the Zambian riverbank.
"Look, look!" he cried. It was a cheetah, moving silently through the low
grass. "He must be hunting for baboon," he said.;    One afternoon, he noticed
what appeared to be a bulky gray boulder lying on the bank and led us toward
it. As the boats scraped the river bottom and stopped against the beach, the
"boulder" suddenly quivered and rose haltingly to its feet. A 2,000-pound
hippo bull snorted menacingly. Then, instead of charging, it stood shivering.
The beast turned away from the canoe and plodded into the river, disappearing
beneath the brown-green surface.;    "He is sick," <PERSON>Gaza</PERSON> said. "He shakes and
his eyes are red, just like the last time I had malaria. I can say that he
will die very soon. Much death along the river.";    Some last words;  I
thought about his words days later, as I returned to <LOCATION>Kariba</LOCATION> from three days of
isolation on a houseboat moored on the lake shore. A Rhodie from <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION>'s
company, <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Safaris</ORGANIZATION>, met me with shocking news: <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> had died in a Land
Rover accident a mile from the airstrip at <LOCATION>Kanyemba</LOCATION> where I'd last seen him.
He had been driving too fast on a rough dirt road, swerved to avoid a <ORGANIZATION>National
Parks</ORGANIZATION> truck and flipped the vehicle, killing himself instantly and injuring a
co-worker.;    It was hard to accept. He was a man who'd seemed to have found
his place in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, thriving in a land that, only 10 years ago, had been a
killing zone.;    Yet <PERSON>Jeremiah Gaza</PERSON>'s sudden death seemed symbolic of both
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>: racing toward the future, charged with
ambition, borne back by its own poverty, recklessness and fragility. In
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, the land's splendors are never far removed from their dangers.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE hardest part about planning a trip to Zimbabwe is the inflexibility of
most tour companies -- and trying to find a knowledgeable operator whose base
is not South Africa.;    Because Zimbabwe is still an obscure destination for
Americans, most U.S. "adventure travel" specialists offer only a few trips a
year, and these are often part of a larger itinerary. One New York-based
outfit, however, specializes in Zimbabwe trips: African Wildlife and Travel,
run by a Zimbabwean named Andrew Graham. Graham is highly informative, knows
many out-of-the-way spots, and puts together personalized itineraries at a
price of $150-$200 a day, plus air fare (around $1,400).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Derek von Wissell</PERSON>, as cosmopolitan a man as you will find in the bucolic kingdom of <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, long suspected that his country had an identity crisis. 
But he didn't know how bad things were until he climbed into a <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> cab a couple of years ago. 

   "I'm in this taxi," he recalls, "and the driver asks me where I'm from. 
I said, '<LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>.' 
He says, 'Oh, I've got a cousin in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.' 
I said, 'That's nice, but I'm from <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>.' 
And he says, 'Yeah, like I said, I've got a cousin there.'" 

   Much the wiser after his ride, <PERSON>Mr. von Wissell</PERSON>, who is <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>'s minister for commerce, industry and tourism, sensed that his mission to attract foreign investment to his country was doomed. 
Still, when he got back home, he sent letters to 250 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies operating in neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and hoped for the best. 

   "The response was limited," he remembers. 
"In fact, that's an overstatement." 
Only three -- count 'em, three -- perfunctory replies were received. 
The rest probably ended up in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. 
"The name <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Mr. von Wissell</PERSON> sadly concluded, "didn't mean anything to anyone." 

   But that was all before sanctions. 
Just a year ago tomorrow, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> passed an array of economic sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and something magical happened to this kingdom. 
People -- not all of them, mind you, but some -- started getting interested in <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>. 
If <PERSON>Mr. von Wissell</PERSON> sent out 250 letters today, chances are he would get at least six replies. 

   The reason for the new interest: As sanctions against <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> picked up steam around the world and corporate disinvestment followed, several companies operating in that country looked for a new home -- or, in the case of South African companies, a second home -- in the region. 
That is when they spied <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, which, much to the country's consternation, has often been mistaken for one of the apartheid homelands created by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 

   Suddenly, things began popping here. 
<ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> shut down its South African concentrate plant and moved in. 
Several South African manufacturers, coveting the Made in <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> label, opened up factories. 
Space at the industrial park near the city of <LOCATION>Manzini</LOCATION> became a hot item. 

   Sanctions, at long last, had put <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> on the map. 
Not on the maps of the world's cabbies, perhaps, but certainly on the maps of some corporate board rooms. 

   "Coca-Cola, here in <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, we couldn't believe it at first," marvels <PERSON>Jabu Matsebula</PERSON>, an editor of the Times of <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>. 
"We knew that <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> is very secretive and selective. 
For them to pick <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> meant we're on our way." 

   The subjects of <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> have since realized that not everything goes better with <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>. 
Just a few weeks ago, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> refused a shipment of Swazi pine furniture because it figured the country couldn't produce anything so sophisticated. 
And an international railway convention wouldn't accept <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>'s credentials until it proved it was a legitimate country. 
<LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, which gained its independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1968</DATE>, had to produce its <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> membership card. 

   Obscurity is hard to shake. 
Nonetheless, recognition by <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> and other companies is a start. 
At the moment, in fact, the partly government-owned <ORGANIZATION>Swaziland Industrial Development Co.</ORGANIZATION> has about all the exposure it can stand. 
Its small staff is overworked, with 15 foreign-investment projects amounting to <MONEY>150 million emalangeni</MONEY> (<MONEY>$75 million</MONEY>) on the drawing board and several others in the discussion stage. 

   Most of these are a variety of South African manufacturing ventures. 
Others include a couple of Taiwanese and Israeli textile companies and British and West German machine-tool makers. 
In addition, Swazi officials say that American companies <ORGANIZATION>Eastman Kodak Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>, having disinvested from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, are considering establishing bases in <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>. 

   This activity may not seem like much to a developed country like, say, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, but it constitutes a bona fide boom in a place like <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, which has only 750,000 citizens and an agriculture-based economy. 

   It is an ironic boom, though, for Swazi officials had persistently argued against sanctions, believing that no good could come of them. 
They feared that <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, a black-ruled nation that is surrounded on three sides by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and is inextricably linked to its economy, would inevitably get smacked by any blow aimed at its big neighbor. 
They also worried that sanctions would lead to greater repression and violence in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which could in turn upset the tranquillity here -- particularly if <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> stepped up cross-border raids in pursuit of its opponents. 

   Even worse would be a border blockade by the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> against those neighbors that advocated sanctions. 
Such a blockade against <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> would strangle the Swazis' external trade. 

   "We were hesitant to bring down the wrath of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Mr. von Wissell</PERSON>, the only white member of the Swazi cabinet. 

   So far, none of these fears have come to pass, but sanctions have brought <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> some unimagined problems along with the benefits. 

   No sooner had <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> established a name for itself, thanks to sanctions, than it was soiled by unscrupulous "sanctions-busters" in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> using fake Swazi labels. 
A shipment of Swazi wine ended up in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, yet <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> has no vineyards. 
One <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> country received a load of Swazi citrus that amounted to four times <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>'s annual citrus production. 
Electric heaters, which are almost nonexistent in this temperate kingdom, have appeared bearing Made in <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> labels. 
Swazi officials have lodged complaints with South African authorities, who have promised to investigate the matter. 

   Then there is the pineapple problem. 
Shut out of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, South African pineapple growers have been unloading their fruit in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, squeezing <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> out of its traditional market. 
As a result, the warehouses at <ORGANIZATION>Swaziland Fruit Canners Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> are overflowing with canned pineapples. 
In some storage areas there is no longer enough room for the forklifts, bearing yet more crates, to make a turn. 

   "Two months after the sanctions, we started feeling the effect," says <PERSON>H. van Thiel Berghuys</PERSON>, the company's managing director. 
He points to some crates sitting outside in the rain, and notes that about <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> is being spent to build another warehouse. 
"I'm telling you, it isn't funny," he says dolefully. 

   On balance, though, the sanctions have the Swazis smiling. 
The new foreign investment has created several thousand jobs and helped the economy achieve a growth rate projected this year at <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT>. 

   "We see ourselves as the next <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Scott Reid</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Industrial Development Co.</ORGANIZATION>, referring to the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Ocean</ORGANIZATION> island that has become an offshore industrial haven. 
"We've got a lot to offer." 

   <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> does have quite a bit going for it, at least in the troubled context of southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
For starters, it is peaceful, unlike <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, where civil wars are raging. 
It is fertile, unlike <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, which is blanketed by the Kalahari desert. 
It likes capitalism, unlike <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>. 
What's more, it is relatively modern: Videocassette recorders are starting to catch on. 

   <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> has also been able to avert the bane of other black African countries: dictatorial one-party politics. 
It simply doesn't have any parties. 
The late <PERSON>King Sobhuza II</PERSON>, who reigned 61 years, effectively abolished them a decade ago when it seemed that all they ever argued about was the necessity of having a king. 

   And, most soothing to potential investors, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> is the epitome of laissez-faire. 
The present king, 19-year-old <PERSON>Mswati III</PERSON>, is more likely to pop into a fast-food joint than into an industrial-policy debate, although he does cut the ribbon at a new factory now and then. 

   Coca-Cola came here for a combination of these reasons, not to mention the various tax incentives. 
"They've also got some spectacular golf courses here," says <PERSON>Edward Ettinger</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION>'s general manager in <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>. 

   He reflects on the country's past identity problems and comes up with a thought that might clear things up once and for all. 
"You know," he says, "if <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> can maintain its neutrality in the region, it has the potential to become the <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>."

<TEXT>
   In his search for an escape from the frustration of
playing monarch-in-waiting, <PERSON>Prince Charles</PERSON> is carving out a niche as
an improbable but often effective ``Voice of the People.''
   His sorties into issues like ocean pollution, unemployment and
inner city decay bring him about as close to political controversy
as the strictly neutral British monarchy can go. By stretching the
bars of his gilded cage, this child of privilege faces the irony of
becoming a darling of the left, monarchy's traditional foe.
   <PERSON>Charles Philip Arthur George</PERSON> turns 40 on <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE>, and the <PERSON>Bonnie
Prince Charlie</PERSON> of younger days has grown more somber, the sense of
guilt at all his privileges more apparent.
   There's still a lot of the fun-loving jetsetter left in him, but
the solemn face looks more lined and lived-in. The pate that will
one day wear the crown is balding. His taste in clothes runs to
conservative double-breasted suits. If he owns a pair of jeans, no
one in the outside world has seen him in them.
   Moving among his fellow citizens _ particularly the young, urban
unemployed who are his biggest concern _ he takes on what a
biographer, <PERSON>Alan Hamilton</PERSON>, calls ``the faintly puzzled air of a
bishop in a betting shop.''
   At times, the heir to the throne could pass for just another
<DATE>1960s</DATE> survivor coasting into middle age: married with two small
kids, he's into organic farming, alternative medicine, health food,
Jungian philosophy and the fate of ozone layer.
   What lifts him above the ordinary is that as Prince of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Earl of Chester</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Cornwall</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Rothesay</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Earl of
Carrick</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Baron of Renfrew</PERSON>, Lord of the <LOCATION>Isles</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Great Steward</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, his destiny is to become <PERSON>King Charles III</PERSON>.
   That destiny looks far off. His mother, <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON>, is
healthy and vigorous at 62, and shows no inclination to abdicate in
favor of her son.
   Meanwhile, perhaps mindful of an earlier Prince of <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> who
frittered away 59 years waiting to be crowned <PERSON>King Edward VII</PERSON>, the
prince has made it clear that ``I am determined not to be confined
to cutting ribbons.''
   Charles' story, writes another biographer, <PERSON>Anthony Holden</PERSON>, ``is
one of constant struggle against the limitations placed upon him by
the genetic accident of his birth ... a confused and tortured soul
trying to come to terms with a claustrophobic, if comfortable life
of inherited imprisonment ... a caring and thoughtful man in search
of good to do.''
   That search has taken him on clandestine visits to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> slums,
into the cowsheds of his tenant farmers, to the peatlands of the
<LOCATION>Western Isles</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> and as far afield as the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>
in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>.
   His attempts to articulate what he has learned have suffered from
clumsiness, but as his themes become more polished, they tell as
much about his own state of mind as they do about the state of
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   Simply put, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> stands for consensus in a society divided by
the uncompromising anti-consensus politics of <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>.
   Where the Conservative prime minister is embarked on a capitalist
revolution designed to create what she calls ``a go-getter
society,'' <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> gives voice to the fears of the losers in this
race for a leaner, tougher <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   The problem for <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> is that when the issues are so
all-embracing, and consensus is a dirty word in <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s
book, just being neutral can seem like taking sides.
   ``We're in for a period of eight, 10, perhaps 20 years of
Conservative government, and therefore any criticism of the world as
it is sounds like a criticism of the government,'' says <PERSON>Norman
Tebbit</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Conservative Party</ORGANIZATION> chairman.
   Thus when <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> attacks <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> pollution, it is widely seen
as an attack on <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s government as insensitive to the
environment.
   When he decries unemployment, Thatcherites bristle at a perceived
criticism of the prime minister for having caused the unemployment.
If <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> laments poverty, the implication, intended or not, is
that <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> doesn't care about the poor.
   Says biographer <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON>: ``<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> believes in the
meritocracy, and an individual in <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is all
right provided he can make it on his own. ... <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> does not
sympathize with the underprivileged. Charles does.''

<TEXT>     Nice story. Indiana Jones and the <LOCATION>Lost City</LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Monkey Gods</ORGANIZATION>. Too bad
it's not true.;   Bulldozers rumble along mud-rutted paths on the desolate
hillside here, kicking up dust and gravel, while an army of workers hauls
bricks and girders into the massive work site.;   When it is completed late
next year, the <LOCATION>Lost City</LOCATION> development -- located in the nominally independent
South African homeland of <LOCATION>Bophuthatswana</LOCATION> -- will be the largest and most
lavish attempt in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to separate international tourists from
their travel dollars. It features an artificial jungle, massive luxury hotel
and its own concocted history.;   ALL OVER southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, tour agents,
hoteliers and safari operators are gearing up for what they hope will be a
boom in South African tourism -- once the country gets its political problems
sorted out, of course.;   Just this month, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> began negotiations to
expand its 8,000-square-mile <ORGANIZATION>Kruger National Game Park</ORGANIZATION> by annexing 2,000
square miles of an adjacent game refuge in neighboring, war-torn Mozambique.; 
 Three hotels are on the drawing boards in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>'s northern suburbs
alone, with others planned for <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Durban</LOCATION> and various mountain, desert
and wildlife vacation areas.;   "Sanctions and violence have made it difficult
to attract foreign visitors all these years," said <PERSON>Barry Hurter</PERSON>, director of
marketing for <LOCATION>Lost City</LOCATION>'s parent company. "People would come here, say how
wonderful everything was, then go home and not tell their neighbors where they
went.";   The hope is that now, with President <PERSON>F.W. de Klerk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>African National
Congress</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON> and other political leaders beginning talks
to transform <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> into a non-racial democracy, passions will cool and
foreign tourists will arrive in larger numbers.;   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, a record 792,387
foreigners visited <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. Tourism plummeted by more than a third in
subsequent years as economic boycotts took their toll and the state airline
was prohibited from flying into many countries, including the <LOCATION>United States.</LOCATION>; 
 But in <DATE>1990</DATE>, the year <LOCATION>Mandela</LOCATION> was released from prison and de Klerk began
dismantling apartheid, 1.03 million foreigners -- a new record -- visited
<LOCATION>South Africa.</LOCATION>;   Most of last year's rise came in visitors from elsewhere in
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, as numerous states relaxed sanctions.;   But the tourists <PERSON>Geyer</PERSON>
expects in the coming decade will be from elsewhere, with the biggest
potential growth areas being <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States.</LOCATION>;   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, 70,502
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens visited <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. Last year, 47,425 came, a drop of almost a
third -- and <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of those came only to visit friends and relatives.;  
<PERSON>Geyer</PERSON> blames the drop on the political boycott, which made it morally
unacceptable to spend tourist dollars in the apartheid state, and the end of
direct flights between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and Johannesburg.;   FLIGHTS to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> are
set to resume this year. But there are still hurdles. The political situation,
for instance, is far from settled. Violence still erupts in the townships, and
the negotiations for a new constitution have not even begun. And the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> still
disapproves of foreign tourists coming to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, arguing that they
should wait until the country reforms itself before pumping money into it.;  
A skeleton of girders and brick rises above the bare hillside on the <LOCATION>Lost City</LOCATION>
site. More than 5,000 workers clamber along scaffolding or laboriously cart
palms and bamboo to transplant sites.;   The <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Lost City</LOCATION> is a kind
of pre-colonial fairy tale of exotic old <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, a Third World whimsy, for
travelers who want the jungle and the mist and eerie pagan religions without
giving up air conditioning, marble bathrooms and Italian food -- and without
the guilt of staying in decaying colonial hotels surrounded by shantytowns.;  
There will be 64 acres of manufactured jungle, including 7,000 trees festooned
with 30,000 hanging orchids, a 350-room luxury hotel made to look like an
ancient palace, a gigantic wave pool capable of stirring 6-foot swells,
crocodiles and hippos, thousands of birds, four water-slides and dozens of
assorted "ruins" framed by the picturesque primordial foliage.;   At various
points, hidden mist machines will give the look and feel of a tropical rain
forest to what is actually an artificial garden in the dry air of the desert's
edge ("built on the vestiges of an ancient, imaginary lake," a promotional
film proclaims).  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Says Neanderthal Man Could Talk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forget notions of Neanderthal man as a
giant hairy brute who stumbled about, managing utterances no more
sophisticated than an occasional ``ugh'' or ``duh.''
   Neanderthal man could talk, researchers say. He couldn't
pronounce the letters ``e'' or ``i,'' and he probably sounded a bit
nasal and hard to understand, but he could communicate.
   Neanderthals even may have spun yarns, whispered gossip, and told
a few one-liners, says <PERSON>Terrence Deacon</PERSON>, assistant professor of
anthropology at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>.
   What's more, they may have talked with early humans, and if they
did, remnants of Neanderthal language could be found in modern
speech, says Deacon.
   About 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals living in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>
were invaded by a race of smaller folk _ modern humans _ who had
migrated from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. For thousands of years the two cultures
mingled, and quite possibly communicated, before Neanderthals died
out 35,000 years ago, <ORGANIZATION>Deacon</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Neanderthals ``had every bit of the intellectual and linguistic
capability'' that our direct ancestors did, <ORGANIZATION>Deacon</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
``They could have conversed with modern humans.''
   Deacon bases this contention on his studies of monkey and human
brains. His research showed that an area called the ventral
prefontal cortex, which grew dramatically in modern human brains,
serves as a link between speech centers controlling so-called
automatic vocalizations _ laughter and crying _ and those areas
controlling more sophisticated speech.
   The development of this large cortex distinguished humans from
primates, which use automatic vocalizations like shrieks and hoots
to communicate. Since Neanderthal brains also had a large ventral
prefrontal cortex, it is reasonable to assume they could talk,
<PERSON>Deacon</PERSON> said.
   Neanderthal man was a big guy, to be sure. He had larger bones
and muscles, a sloping forehead and more menacing jaws and teeth
than today's average human, but his brain was much like ours. There
is no reason he wouldn't have the gift of gab, <ORGANIZATION>Deacon</ORGANIZATION> said.
   He couldn't utter some of the vowels we do, though, because his
larynx was higher in his throat than ours. So he couldn't ``ooh'' if
he spied a beautiful full moon, for example.
   <PERSON>Philip Lieberman</PERSON>, professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences
at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION>, agreed with some of <ORGANIZATION>Deacon</ORGANIZATION>'s argument.
   But <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> said that while he'd ``be astonished if they didn't
talk ... whether they spoke anything like humans is an unsettled
issue.
   ``The difference in the vocal tract means the <ORGANIZATION>Neanderthal</ORGANIZATION>
couldn't close his nose off,'' <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> said, noting this would
make Neanderthal speech very nasal, which added errors to any
language.
   Lieberman added that Neanderthal speech also would be hampered by
not being able to say ``e'' or ``i,'' the most common sounds found
in modern languages.
   Deacon said much of what an anthropologist believes about
Neanderthal man's capacities depend upon what is considered crucial
to speech.
   ``It all comes down to what you think is more important for
speech _ the brain or the larynx,'' <PERSON>Deacon</PERSON> said. ``I believe it is
the brain.''
   Deacon's argument may have gained strength recently with the
discovery of a human-like hyoid bone, from which the larynx is
suspended, in the 60,000-year-old skeleton of a <ORGANIZATION>Neanderthal on Mount
Carmel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>.
   If Neanderthals and modern humans talked, there also may be some
aspects of Neanderthal speech left in modern languages, <ORGANIZATION>Deacon</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``It's an open question, but it's not impossible that our
language was affected,'' <PERSON>Deacon</PERSON> said.
   So what did Neanderthals talk about? They were hunters and
gatherers, much like the Bushmen of the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,
so they probably talked about the animals they hunted and the
berries they gathered for food.
   But not all Neanderthal communication was shop talk.
   ``They didn't just talk about their jobs,'' <PERSON>Deacon</PERSON> said. ``I
think they could have told jokes. And there were issues of family,
shelter, disease and aging that they might have discussed. And of
course, there was the play of children.
   ``It's a disservice to the complexity of their society to think
of Neanderthals as dumb brutes,'' <PERSON>Deacon</PERSON> said.
   Perhaps they joked about the puny Homo sapiens who invaded their
turf.
   Say, did you hear the one about the human who thought
Neanderthals were dumb?

FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Van Niekerk's Cape crusade to
rescue farmers - The South African agriculture minister is trying everything
to minimise bankruptcies / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the
northern part of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cape Province</LOCATION>. A few score farmers and their
families from a radius of a about 100 km (62 miles) had gathered to wander
around about a dozen trade and craft stands, have a braai (barbecue) lunch
and to see which of them would be awarded the prize for the best Fat-Tailed
Persian sheep. The temperature was in the mid-40s centigrade (about 120 deg
F).
This is virtually desert country where a farmer needs several thousand
hectares and a drought- and heat-resistant breed of sheep to make a
reasonable living. It lies between the <LOCATION>Great Karoo</LOCATION> in the south and the
Kalahari in the north and the town owes its existence and past wealth to the
mining of blue asbestos and copper from the nearby hills.
Now the copper mine is worked out and the lung disease asbestosis has killed
the demand for the asbestos the area once produced. Today Prieska relies
almost entirely on agriculture and in both prosperity and population it is
only half the town it once was.
But the mood at the show was jovial and relaxed. The quality of the sheep
entered for the competition was excellent, the food was good and the local
MP was among the small crowd. They know him well; for not only is he a
neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that
qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s minister of agriculture.
<PERSON>Mr Kraai van Niekerk</PERSON> would probably have attended the show as a farmer in
any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on
continued political reform in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Prieska</LOCATION> is the centre of his
constituency. He had delivered a speech at another town that morning; now he
was pressing the flesh of his fellow farmers before addressing a house
meeting in the <TIME>late afternoon</TIME> and another in the local town hall in the
<TIME>evening</TIME>. In the sweltering heat it was a punishing schedule.
If the voters reject continued reform <PERSON>Mr van Niekerk</PERSON>, along with the rest of
the cabinet, will begin preparations to resign. But if the majority of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s white electorate votes against calls by the <ORGANIZATION>Conservative Party</ORGANIZATION> and
the <ORGANIZATION>AWB</ORGANIZATION> for a return to old ways, the minister will be able to return to
other pressing problems in his department.
Chief among these is the extended drought which has affected a significant
proportion of the Republic. Indeed, I had expected that the arid area in
which the minister's own farm is situated would be suffering most. But I was
wrong.
When I went with him to his 13,000-hectare holding, which has an annual
rainfall of just 6 inches and where temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s
centigrade are normal throughout the long <DATE>summer</DATE>, he explained that the
secret of success on such dry bush veldt was to restrict stocking rates (he
runs only one Merino wool sheep per 10 hectares) and to conserve what little
moisture was available.
This meant moving each 300-head flock on a regular basis from one
100-hectare camp (pasture) to another so as not to destroy the indigenous
grasses and bushes sprouting from the sandy, rocky terrain and which,
incredibly to my unaccustomed eye, sustained the animals in good condition.
He talked with enthusiasm and detailed knowledge about the balance of
nature. And he claimed that it was not farmers like him, who were used to
managing in dry weather, who were in financial trouble.
It is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as I
had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and <PERSON>Mr van Niekerk</PERSON> has
already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers'
representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt.
Aid schemes are being worked out, wherever possible, to write off some debt
and to re-schedule the rest, often at subsidised interest rates. But in many
cases the financial position is such that the farmer is beyond help.
Critics of the rescue attempts allege that most of the farmers who are in
trouble are financially illiterate and that they are reaping the results of
unbridled expenditure and expansion in the boom years of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and
<DATE>1980s</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr van Niekerk</PERSON> concedes that such suggestions contain an element of
truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are
socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as
possible should be saved.
To allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is
little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put
tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. Since the repeal of
the Group Areas Act two years ago there has already been enormous growth in
the squatter camps around big towns. Hordes of unemployed farm workers would
add to an already serious problem.
There is also the immediate problem of ensuring the availability of
sufficient food. <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> consumes between 6m and 7m tonnes of maize
each year. Production from this year's drought stricken crops is forecast at
less than 3m tonnes. In addition, the republic has long term commitments to
supply maize to other southern African countries.
It appears likely, therefore, that it will be necessary for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to
import up to 5m tonnes of maize during the coming months. Some commentators
have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such
volumes within the time available but <PERSON>Mr van Niekerk</PERSON> assured me that his
department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that
imports have already begun to arrive. He also denied that there was any
possibility of rationing over coming months.
Some of his optimism was based, however, on the possibility that South
African-grown wheat could be substituted for maize when it was harvested in
<DATE>November</DATE>. But back in the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Free State</ORGANIZATION>, last week, farmers were
worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to
germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time.
Theirs is a summer rainfall area and that season is almost over. If they get
no rain, there will be no point sowing the seed and they will have no crops
to harvest next <DATE>November</DATE>.
As the minister said, that is a long way ahead and there will be time to
make arrangements to deal with that problem should it occur. But in the
meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers
and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South
African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow. Whichever way you
look at it this is a crucial time for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Swaying across the shimmering plains - African
elephants are reputed to be impossible to train. But three of them carried
Michael J Woods through the Okavango Delta - on their terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX WHITE, black and tan wild dogs, the rarest and most endangered of
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s carnivores, reluctantly rose to their feet and disdainfully stepped
aside as we pushed into the thick thorn scrub where they were resting in the
heat of the day.
For the first time in my life I felt quite invisible, my universally feared
human form subsumed into that of the African elephant on which I was riding,
for the dogs had no inkling of our presence. All they noticed were the great
grey ghosts padding almost silently past. This magic was to be repeated
again and again during our safari. For almost a week, I became an elephant.
Even giraffes with small calves and notoriously grumpy lone bull buffaloes
allowed us to come much closer than I had believed possible.
Sadly, the only animals it was necessary to avoid were wild elephants and we
had more than our fair share of encounters during our five-day elephant-back
safari from Abu's camp, run by <PERSON>Ker and Downey</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Okavango Delta</ORGANIZATION>.
Generally speaking, distant animals would be easily deterred by the sight of
<PERSON>Randall Moore</PERSON>, the owner of the three riding elephants, <PERSON>Abu</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bennie</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Kathy</PERSON>. He accompanied us on foot and was armed in case of problems. Twice,
though, we were followed. On the first occasion a troubled <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> repeatedly
sent deep, rumbling growls far into the forest from her vibrating body; on
the second, it needed two shots, fired over the head of a persistent bull,
before he would retreat.
Each of the three adult elephants carried two passengers on its back,
sitting in a mixture of saddle and play-pen with the handler or mahout
riding astride the elephant's neck. From here the animals were controlled
with verbal commands, prods from the bull hook and rewards of cattle nuts.
African elephants are reputed to be impossible to train, being larger and
supposedly of more uncertain temperament than their Indian counterparts.
While <PERSON>Randall Moore</PERSON> has proved this to be a fallacy, I always felt our trip
was conducted on the elephants' terms.
Once, when they worked themselves into a frenzy of fear over a non-existent
danger and finally bolted with us on board, there was little Abu's handler
could do about it, in spite of beating him over the head with the bull hook
until its fibreglass handle shattered, sending the business end spinning
into the undergrowth. The elephants simply came to a halt when they felt it
was safe to do so.
Riding an elephant in these conditions was a little like sitting upstairs in
a silent, invisible, all-terrain, open-top, double-decker bus driven by an
ever hungry, somewhat obstinate and slightly unpredictable eight-year-old
guided by calls and prods from the top deck. They are an ideal form of
transport in the intricate web of sandy islands and shallow, clear waters of
the <LOCATION>Okavango</LOCATION>, for they are undeterred by all but the thickest thorn scrub
and the view from high on their backs is unsurpassed.
Our expeditions were enlivened by the presence of seven baby elephants, aged
between three and five, orphans of culling operations in <PERSON>Kruger</PERSON> national
park, which turned each outing from a gentle walk into a foray with a gang
of vandals, tearing branches from trees, uprooting grasses and shrubs and
generally leaving a trail of destruction behind.
When we walked along the channels which snake through the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>, the babies
would indulge in serious feeding, snatching succulent rushes as they passed
or pulling down with their small trunks the carefully selected fluffy
seed-heads of reeds.
Although the water is rarely more than 6ft deep, occasional pools exceeded
that, and then the youngsters would completely disappear. First a trunk tip
would come questing above the surface - followed by a little elephant, black
and gleaming, which would bob up before slipping under again.
Now and then a spirit of abandon would overtake the babies and they would
thrash and beat the water with their trunks, throwing spray high into the
air with great exuberance. Once, we came to a small mud wallow and this they
could not resist, falling on to their sides and working their way into the
dark morass, or picking up gouts of mud and tossing them over their backs
and under their bellies.
The activities at Abu's Camp are not restricted to elephant riding, and keen
fishermen may take a mokoro (a canoe punted by a local guide) out on to the
water where the catches can be prolific. Game drives are also on offer, and
one afternoon I escaped with a driver and a safari truck to look for the
wild dogs again.
After a two-hour search, we came across them lying in long grass and stayed
with them as they began to grow increasingly restless, greeting one another
and preparing for an evening's hunt. With the sun sinking in the sky, they
rose as a group and trotted off to look for supper.
Ever the showman, on the last morning <PERSON>Randall Moore</PERSON> found it impossible to
conceal his circus roots and treated us to a whole series of elephant film
stunts, from mock charges to babies crawling through the sand. This,
together with the occasional need to fire over the heads of wild elephants
and the slow acting sedative administered to <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> after her nervous bolt on
the first day, left me slightly uneasy.
On the other hand, I treasure the memory of riding with a slow, steady
elephant rhythm across a shimmering plain of waving golden grass, studded
here and there with copper-leaved mopane trees and bordered by a frieze of
rustling lala palms, their blue-green foliage making feathery rosettes
against the clear blue sky of the Kalahari winter.
<PERSON>Michael Woods</PERSON>' elephant-back safari was arranged by <ORGANIZATION>Twickers World</ORGANIZATION>, of 22
Church Street, <LOCATION>Twickenham</LOCATION>, TW1 3NW, 081-892-7606, and was run from Abu's
Camp in the <LOCATION>Okavango Delta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>. The camp has en-suite facilities and
includes such luxuries as a daily laundry service and hot water bottles.
Elephants make unstable platforms for photography, so keen photographers
could combine an elephant-back safari with a stay at one of Ker and <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION>'s
photographic safari camps in the <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION>. The winter weather is dry,
pleasantly warm during the day but rather cold at night. Potential elephant
riders should note that they will be required to sign a comprehensive
release form, and agree not to sue, before being allowed to ride. From
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, elephant-back safaris cost from Pounds 3,037 per person for a total
of nine days.

This is not a review; it is a sneak preview. A month hence <PERSON>Derek Jarman</PERSON>'s
new film Blue should reach public screens and before that you may catch it
at the <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> Film Festival (one performance only, <DATE>August 22</DATE>). But unlike
Jurassic Park or <ORGANIZATION>Last Action Hero</ORGANIZATION>, it will not explode on every doorstep in
the glory of <LOCATION>Hollywood Hyperama</LOCATION>. Nor will there be a movie tie-in industry
of Blue hamburgers, T-shirts and model dinosaurs.
Indeed there is scarcely, in the normal sense of the word, a movie. Blue is
76 minutes of the title colour, projected without change or inflection
beyond the blips and scratches on the celluloid itself. While the soundtrack
blends voices, music and sound effects, the screen just sits there being
blue. While actors recite <PERSON>Jarman</PERSON>'s scripted thoughts, and everything from
sea noises to babbling crowds and heart-thumps mix with the verbal musings
on life and death, art and Aids, beauty and pain, the sole balm for the eyes
is that single-colour rectangle. It flickers like a midnight-blue heart
monitor that has lost its pulse line.
You may already be reaching for your desk diary to pencil in 'Avoid Blue on
every available date.' Deny yourself that self-denial. Would you believe
that I sat there in a large <LOCATION>North London</LOCATION> cinema last week with an invited
audience of 30 in pin-drop awe and silence? Or that Blue is not the
Emperor's new clothes but the Artist's coat of many colours transformed -
concentrated? distilled? - to a blue thought (the film) in a blue shade (the
cinema)?
Blue is about failing sight and intensifying vision. Jarman himself, long an
HIV victim, has deteriorating eyesight along with the other hundred horrors
freely available to Aids sufferers. He details these - wryly, stoically -
through the voice-overs in Blue. But instead of being a condemned man's
litany of last thoughts, the film uses despair as a slipway to hope and
strength and even to a defiant delight. The more insufferably singular is
that 'patch of blue' (<ORGANIZATION>Wilde</ORGANIZATION>'s prison-cell view made movie image), the more
overpoweringly plural are the flickers of thought, sensation and insight
that it provokes.
The film, it could be said, uses an age-old hypnotist's trick. Show your
patients the right kind of rhythmic nothingness - a swinging watch, a
swaying light, a single flickering colour - and they will slip into a
high-productivity coma. By lunchtime they will have remembered their whole
past and possibly been programmed for a saner future.
Blue, though, is more than trickery, though it is never less than hypnotic.
It gives you the freedom to flee if you wish. (<PERSON>Jarman</PERSON>'s catalogue of
hospital experiences alone may have you reaching for the mental opt-out
switch.) But finally you do not want to escape. The soundtrack is too rich,
too astonishing: with <PERSON>Jarman</PERSON>'s words etching life out of death while <PERSON>Simon
Fisher Turner</PERSON>'s music works its eerie, elemental magic. And the imagery -
that pool of colour that beckons and absorbs your attention and then returns
it re-baptised, re-sensitised - is too pliant, too precious to be resisted
by any filmgoer brought up on the rude, unchanging colours of commercial
cinema.
*****
Oh dear and here they are. Sentimental pink for Apres L'Amour. Throw-up
yellow for Made In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Re-issue rust colour for In Cold Blood. And
plasticky rainbow hues for two production-slate fillers from <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>.
Apres L'Amour and Made In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> are interchangeable tales of modern
womanhood. <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON> in the first has a child but no
mate/husband/breadwinner: above all, no papa for her paternally challenged,
sperm-bank-conceived daughter <PERSON>Nia Long</PERSON>. <PERSON>Isabelle Huppert</PERSON> in the French film
has enough men to fill to flood-alert level the average sperm bank but -
yes, you guess correctly - no children.
Movie folk should get together to solve each other's problems on an exchange
basis. In <ORGANIZATION>America Mlle Huppert</ORGANIZATION> would find a fulfilling, not to say
asphyxiating degree of motherly fulfilment in <LOCATION>Miss Goldberg</LOCATION>'s homey-folksy
milieu: a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> of brittle marriages but teeming wombs, where
pinbright teenagers dash about the land searching for missing parents. In
Made In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> the supposed father of <PERSON>Goldberg</PERSON>'s daughter is revealed to be
<PERSON>Ted Danson</PERSON>: white (bad), male (worse) and a car salesman (unspeakable).
Soon, though, young Nia is adoring him and so is the initially hostile
<PERSON>Whoopi</PERSON>. By curtain-time - but in the long afternoons of the silly season how
long that is in coming - everyone is looking dewy-eyed at everyone else.
Seeking men, a lonely <PERSON>Whoopi</PERSON> could have gone to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to rent the flat of
Isabelle (Apres L'Amour) <PERSON>Huppert</PERSON>. Here the door is almost off its hinges
with the to-ing and fro-ing of lovers: chiefly, tired but handsome architect
<PERSON>Bernard Giradeau</PERSON> and puppyish-pretty singer-composer <PERSON>Hippolyte Girardot</PERSON>.
La <PERSON>Huppert</PERSON> tries to keep both these relationships going, but you know how it
is. Each man is married; each has a mortgage and children; and when the
crunch comes, it is always 'Ma cherie, ce n'est pas pour toujours.' Plus
which, the heroine herself silently longs for offspring.
<PERSON>Huppert</PERSON> was last seen by us in <ORGANIZATION>Madame Bovary</ORGANIZATION>. She is still wearing <PERSON>Emma</PERSON>'s
look of pale anomie, as of one struck by Life while crossing its busy road
without looking. But where <PERSON>Flaubert</PERSON> supplied his heroine with a good script,
writer-director <PERSON>Diane Kurys</PERSON> (Coup De Foudre, A Man In Love) can only ring
dwindling changes on a soap-operatic plot of musical beds and frustrated
motherhood.
A Far Off Place and Champions are two lost-looking Disney films. The first
answers a question we might have spent our whole lives not pondering. What
would we do if we had to cross the Kalahari on foot, with no provisions of
food or water and <DATE>1000</DATE> miles to cover to the nearest town?
Young <PERSON>Reese Witherspoon</PERSON>, freshly-orphaned daughter of two white <LOCATION>South
Africans</LOCATION> killed by ivory poachers, must do this. For company she has only
two young friends - a white boy (<PERSON>Ethan Randall</PERSON>) and a <PERSON>Bushman</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sarel Bok</PERSON>) -
and soon the usual things that happen in deserts are happening. Mirages,
sandstorms, miraculous stumblings upon water and a Central Casting villain
(<PERSON>Jack Thompson</PERSON>) shooting at them from a helicopter.
Laurens van der Post wrote the two original stories on which the film is
based and noted ex-cameraman <PERSON>Mikael Salomon</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Backdraft</LOCATION>, Far And Away)
directed. But it all resembles 'Walkabout 2: The Plot Runs Out Of Ideas.' We
sense neither the miles nor the days. We feel neither thirst nor hunger. We
marvel only at the leisure-time the characters have in which to play games,
to fall in love, to tell stories and even - surely a first? - to make
blouses from springbok hide.
Champions was called The <ORGANIZATION>Mighty Ducks</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and made a small fortune.
Crossing the ocean, it has lost its original title and failed to find a visa
for its original charm. Who in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> will jump about at the story of a
little-league ice hockey team managed by a burnt-out veteran (<PERSON>Emilio
Estevez</PERSON>, all of 30) who wants to redeem his long-ago failures as a player?
Director <PERSON>Stephen Herek</PERSON> directs early scenes with the visual snap and
off-wall wit he brought to Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure. But once the
games start, the fun stops. Don't we just know - can we even doubt  - that
these <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> youngsters will go all the way to a tear-filled finale
when the rank outsiders (they) will beat the glowering, macho favourites:
twice their size, dressed in black and all but accompanied by <ORGANIZATION>Spaghetti
Western</ORGANIZATION> villain music.
Like a cooling ice-block to the head, you can always apply <PERSON>Richard Brooks</PERSON>'s
In Cold Blood to your brain. The <DATE>1967</DATE> true-life murder story returns to the
<ORGANIZATION>ICA</ORGANIZATION>, still chilling in its black-and-white docudrama immediacy if still a
touch browbeating in its late-on liberal message-mongering.

<HEAD>Discovered Link Between Man And Ape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Raymond Dart</PERSON>, a pioneering
anthropologist whose once-controversial discovery of a link between
man and ape is now widely accepted, died after a three-week illness.
He was 95.
   Dart died of a brain hemorrhage <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at a clinic near
<LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, said a colleague from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of the
<LOCATION>Witwatersrand</LOCATION>, Professor <PERSON>Phillip Tobias</PERSON>.
   Dart became widely known in <DATE>1925</DATE>, when he publicized his claim
that a skull found in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cape Province</LOCATION> came from an
ape-like, pre-human form of man that he called Australopithecus.
   For decades, his theory was viewed skeptically by most of his
professional peers. Some critics said the skull was that of a
chimpanzee, and <PERSON>Dart</PERSON> was denounced by religious groups who objected
to the theory of evolution.
   But later work by <PERSON>Dart</PERSON> and discoveries by other
paleoanthropologists in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> eventually confirmed his theories.
   ``<PERSON>Dart</PERSON> is the grand old man of fossil-man research,'' <PERSON>Donald
Ortner</PERSON>, curator of physical anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>
Institution in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, said a few years ago. ``His early
observations on the evolutionary significance of
Australopithecus-Africanus were highly controversial at the time he
made them, but since then have been generally accepted.''
   Dart was born <DATE>Feb. 4, 1893</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and graduated
from the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney University Medical School</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1917</DATE>. In <DATE>1923</DATE>, he was
hired as professor of anatomy at the <ORGANIZATION>University of the Witwatersrand</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION>, where he taught until <DATE>1958</DATE>. For 18 years, he was
dean of the university's medical school.
   The skull that brought him notoriety was recovered from a
limestone cave at <LOCATION>Taung</LOCATION>, on the edge of the Kalahari desert. After
weeks of examination, <PERSON>Dart</PERSON> concluded that it belonged to a child of
an ape-related species that had moved further in a human direction
than previously known species.
   Tobias, an internationally recognized anatomist, wrote in <DATE>1983</DATE>:
``<PERSON>Dart</PERSON>'s appreciation and interpretation of the hominoid-like traits
of Astralopithecus represent the single most important breakthrough
in paleoanthropology of the <DATE>20th century</DATE>, next to which all the
other African discoveries represented a mere filling-in.''

CSO 

  [Text] <ORGANIZATION>Armscor</ORGANIZATION> this week revealed exactly how it is beating 
its swords into ploughshares. 
  At a military research seminar in <LOCATION>Braamfontein</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Armscor</ORGANIZATION> 
senior manager <PERSON>Dr. Andre Buys</PERSON> described how the only country in 
the world to ever dismantle a nuclear weapons capability had 
gone about it. 
  <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has 400kg of highly enriched uranium in storage 
15km from <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>, supposedly safe against terrorists -- unless 
they have scientists on their side, said <PERSON>Mr. David Albright</PERSON>, 
president of the <ORGANIZATION>US-based Institute for Science and 
International Security</ORGANIZATION>. 
  <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> also had a controversial batch of tritium, 
which 
daramatically increases the power of nuclear weapons, imported 
from <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> in exchange for uranium. 
  As part of the scheme, the tritium was sold for use in 
fluorescent signs such as those on cinema exits. 
  <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> -- the founder member of "the ex-nuclear club" 
-- realized it had to commercialize its technology if it was to 
succeed in dismantling its nuclear weapons capability, said Dr. 
Buys. 
  Scores of <ORGANIZATION>Armscor</ORGANIZATION> ideas were whittled down to 17 business 
units with processes stemming from the uranium enrichment 
programme. 
  Centrifuges designed to enrich uranium were adapted to 
reduce 
emissions from industrial stacks, to filter air for helicopter 
turbines and to improve ventilation. 
  Staff members at <ORGANIZATION>Armscor</ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries involved in the 
construction of nuclear devices also came up with 200 commercial 
ideas that were hacked down to six projects. 
  These were: 
  --Explosive cladding. Metals aluminium that cannot be 
welded conventionally are joined by explosives; 
  --Creating rare-earth magnets; 
  --Linking tungsten to copper or silver for use in 
electrical switchgear; 
  --Hot isostatic pressing which allowed components to be 
made from matallic powders; 
  --Pyrotechnic products which include special focused 
explosives to break up big boulders; and, 
  --A medical ventilator. 
  However, <PERSON>Dr. Buys</PERSON> said it was not known if the technology 
conversion would be successful in the long term. 
  "Since no one else has dismantled a nuclear weapons program, 
there is nowhere to look for advice." 
  The 400kg of highly enriched uranium outside <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> cannot 
immediately be reconstituted into weapon form. 
  And, with a glut of nuclear material on world markets, it is 
only worth R15-million. 
  But if, as the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> wishes, it is used to make medical 
isotopes, the value will increase to R500-million. 
  However, Western nations oppose this option because they 
fear 
the "black bomb" -- industry terminology for a black nation with 
nuclear-weapons capability. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Albright</PERSON> said: "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> doesn't want highly enriched 
uranium to remain in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>." 
  At the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s military research group meeting in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> 
this week, he said the West wanted the possibility of 
bomb-making removed from South African soil. 
  But <PERSON>Mr. Albright</PERSON> said: "The US government won't give up on 
highly enriched uranium. They don't want to hurt <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> 
economically -- they just don't want it to have this power." 
  One the other side, the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> was "upset by the lack of trust, 
the idea that it wants to create a black bomb." 
  "If highly enriched uranium wasn't present in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, 
it would take years before it could get a nuclear weapon here," 
said <PERSON>Mr. Albright</PERSON>. 
  "But as it is, the project could be reconstituted in secret 
and it would take only a few months." 
  <PERSON>Mr. Dion Smith</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Armscor</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that a maximum of 1,000 
<LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> had known about the nuclear military program -- 
so reconstitution in secret was not impossible. 
  The closest <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> came to using one was in <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
  Test-bomb shafts were dug in the Kalahari desert and later 
closed in the 70's. 
  But they were reopened in <DATE>1987</DATE>, said the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Roger 
Jardine</PERSON>, 
because "the Cubans were overrunning the <ORGANIZATION>SADF</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>." 
  Dr. Buys said: "The shafts were reopened in relation to 
events in <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>. The war was reaching a semi-conventional state 
and it was backed by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>." 
  The thinking was that if <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> detonated a nuclear 
bomb in a shaft, the Americans would pick it up on satellite or 
seismic equipment and would be forced to help -- or risk SA 
using remaining "credible devices." 
  And so the watchers and the watched, former adversaries, 
continue to debate the chronology and detail of what really 
happened, with <ORGANIZATION>Armscor</ORGANIZATION> asking for a copy of a Soviet report it 
says "cannot exist."

What does literature do? What is it for? These splendid essays, selected from 
25 years' worth of sharp, firm responses to the particularly grotesque and 
challenging conditions for writers in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, do nothing less than answer 
these huge questions. But they are not bombastic utterances. <PERSON>Nadine Gordimer</PERSON> is 
an unboastful, honest writer who dislikes cant. One of her mentors, cited with 
respectful pleasure, is <ORGANIZATION>Turgenev</ORGANIZATION>, whose "unpretentious essays," she says, in a 
phrase that can be reapplied to her own work, "make up a remarkable testament 
to a writer's creed." 
</P>
<P>
Her own creed is simple. Politically, it rests on two absolutes: "Racism is 
evil"; "Art is on the side of the oppressed." (If you question the latter, ask 
yourself, she says, "what writer of any literary worth defends fascism, 
totalitarianism, racism?") The writer's job is twofold. He (or she, but 
<PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON>, who has other things on her mind than feminism, always says he) has 
to reconcile his interior, secret, imaginative world with his responsibility to 
what's outside, to history. Through this reconciliation (an especially 
difficult one to make in her country), writing tries to go beyond what has so 
far been "allowed." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON> played truant from school as a child, she needed, like all 
children, to be told that the world she felt so confined by was not the only 
possible world, that there might be an existence she did not yet know was 
"permissible." That, she insists, is what writing is for: to "explore 
possibilities present but undreamt of in the living of a single life," to 
record "unconfessed history"; in <PERSON>Yeats</PERSON>' words, "to express a life that has 
never found expression." 
</P>
<P>
If writing's job is to permit or express the impermissible and unexpressed, it 
follows that although "censorship may have to do with literature, literature 
has nothing whatever to do with censorship." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON>'s life is spent where a conflict over the right of books to be read 
(and written) is built into the writer's life -- as it is still in <LOCATION>Eastern 
Europe</LOCATION> and in many other parts of the world. In the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, this conflict has 
just been brought home to us in momentous and horrifying form by the 
ayatollah's anathematizing of <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON>. In the earlier stages of the 
Muslim vendetta against "The Satanic Verses," <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON> had to cancel a visit to 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, one of the countries where the book is now banned. Gordimer was 
among those who spoke out strongly against this curtailing of a writer's 
freedom. The case would be close to her heart, since it is the most extreme 
version imaginable of the perpetual opposition between art and orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
That opposition displays similar features in widely variant contexts, whether 
these be Iranian fundamentalism, apartheid, Stalinism, anti-Semitism or the 
militaristic variant of Zionism. In the context in which <PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON> writes, the 
government's efforts, at once ludicrous and malevolent, to ban, raid, censor, 
imprison, exile and silence writers who express alternative versions of history 
to its own, can provide any of them with a South African version of <PERSON>Rushdie</PERSON>'s 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
The essays in "The Essential Gesture" are not only about censorship. They range 
widely over politics, literature, travel to other African countries and notable 
individuals. But their essential subject is always the writer's responsibility. 
This makes the book at once a life story and a history of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Stephen 
Clingman</PERSON>'s clear (if a little too hagiographical) commentary places the essays 
in a changing context and points up their interesting connections with 
<PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON>'s fiction. So we move from the liberal, optimistic response to events 
like the <DATE>1957</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Treason Trial of Chief Luthulu</ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> members, to the 
outrage at the dark acts of the '60s, the <LOCATION>Sharpeville</LOCATION> killings, the banning of 
the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> and the trial and life imprisonment of the white Communist <PERSON>Bram 
Fischer</PERSON>, the inspiration for "Burger's Daughter." In the '70s, with the "Soweto 
Revolt," the essays record the "failure of the liberal ideal" and the changing 
relations between white progressives and the Black Consciousness movement. More 
recently, as in her novels, "<DATE>July</DATE>'s People" and "A Sport of Nature," the 
writing looks, not always hopefully, at the example of other post-colonial 
African countries and anticipates the implications of revolution in <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There is a danger for the writer in being always on the side of the angels. 
Sometimes these essays, speaking of "relevance" and "commitment," edge toward 
the worthily pious. Gordimer is acutely aware of the problems in "conforming to 
an orthodoxy of opposition." The risk is greatest, she sees, for the black 
writer, who is expected to adopt the "kit" of "reliable emotive phrases," 
partly because "agitprop" has been "the first contemporary art form that many 
black <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> feel they can call their own." But this is a dilemma for 
white writers too. Gordimer knows that nothing she says in her public speeches 
"will be as true as my fiction" and that fiction cannot do the job of speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The perils of belonging too much to an ideology of resistance are set against 
the problems of having nowhere to belong. In many of these essays, <PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON> 
considers, realistically and penetratingly, changing relations between black 
and white writers in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, and the inevitable "double alienation" of a 
writer such as herself, "non-European" and "non-Black." How the white writers 
who stay on in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> are to accept their future role as the voices of an 
unwanted and isolated minority is a subject that requires all her honesty and 
firmness of mind. She can only hope that by continuing to say "we" of white and 
black writers, she can endorse the possibility of "a single, common, indigenous 
nature for art in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>," not a falsely imposed or fatally divided 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
It is also apparent to her that alienation is (up to a point) not a burden but 
a necessity for the writer. This perception makes her an excellent observer of 
countries where she is made to feel non-existent: "To be white in the streets 
of <LOCATION>Accra</LOCATION> is to feel oneself curiously anonymous and almost invisible; one is 
aware of one's unimportance, in terms of what a white face has meant and now 
means to people." She records, with wonderful exactness and curiosity, scenes 
from a world where the white view is irrelevant: the night-time halt of a river 
boat in the <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION>, gorgeous "ladies of joy" in a <LOCATION>Brazzaville</LOCATION> open-air cafe, 
lavish erotic designs -- symbols of fertility -- on Malagasy tombs, a picnic 
party of women in full Victorian dress (unchanged descendants of pre-1914 
refugees from <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>) eating porridge in the Kalahari desert. Throughout her 
travels, <PERSON>Gordimer</PERSON> compares the African states (such as <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION>) that are 
"dedicated to radical change in the life of the masses" and those (such as the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ivory Coast</ORGANIZATION>) that have fostered a black elite and are dependent on foreign 
investments. In these diagnoses of possible African developments, she takes as 
her motto the messages she spots written up on buses and taxis in <LOCATION>Ghana</LOCATION>: "It 
changes," and "Merci Dieu." These essays, too, records of a dramatically 
changing history by a tolerant, flexible, adaptive mind, are sermons on that 
text: "<PERSON>Merci Dieu</PERSON>, it changes."

<P>
VISUAL ANTHROPOLOGY HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE FILMING OF 'NANOOK OF THE 
NORTH'

<P>
<PERSON>Timothy Asch</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Center for Visual Anthropology</ORGANIZATION>, sees a 
not-too-distant day when new anthropological research will be published 
complete with accompanying films, stored on a 3-inch videodisc in a pocket 
inside the book jacket. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Asch</PERSON>, who co-produced with anthropologist <PERSON>Napoleon Chagnon</PERSON> a series of 
ground-breaking films on the fierce Yanomamo Indians of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, sees a 
number of ways in which his science will benefit from the explosion of video 
technology, which puts ever-more-sophisticated cameras into ever-smaller and 
easier-to-use packages. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of knowledge and expertise that anthropologists have could, in 
collaboration with ethnographic film makers, turn into a tremendous resource," 
<PERSON>Asch</PERSON> told an audience at the 12th annual Symposium of Man held recently at <LOCATION>Cal 
State Fullerton</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The use of film to record non-Western cultures is nothing new, stretching back 
at least to "Nanook of the North," <PERSON>Robert Flaherty</PERSON>'s famed <DATE>1921</DATE> docudrama about 
an Eskimo family. Since the '20s, cultural anthropologists have often turned to 
film as a way to record the people and cultures they study. 
</P>
<P>
But sound synchronization in the field was not practical until about <DATE>1960</DATE>, and 
film equipment has until recently been cumbersome and difficult to use under 
the often-trying conditions that greet anthropologists. Advances in film and 
especially video technology, developed primarily for the entertainment 
industry, have revolutionized ethnographic film making, <PERSON>Asch</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> master's degree program in visual anthropology, <PERSON>Asch</PERSON> is 
training film makers who will collaborate with field anthropologists to record 
data that was once the exclusive domain of notebook and sketch pad. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to recording a culture on film or video is that several 
scientists can view the same piece of data, rather than having to rely on one 
person's observations, according to noted ethnographic film maker <PERSON>Patsy Asch</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Timothy</PERSON>'s wife. In some instances, the ability to repeatedly view a film is 
another advantage, as in the case of dance kinesics or studying intricate 
rituals. 
</P>
<P>
But most importantly, the films often serve as a final record of many tribal 
cultures that are being decimated by the destruction of tropical forests and by 
other encroachments of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribal world is disappearing at a staggeringly high rate, one that is 
accelerating on a day-by-day basis," said <PERSON>Chagnon</PERSON>, another of the panelists. A 
professor at <ORGANIZATION>UC Santa Barbara</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Chagnon</PERSON>'s 25 years of studying the 
Yanomamo has formed the basis of one of the best-known case studies in cultural 
anthropology, one that is found in most introductory textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Chagnon, who concentrates on Yanomamo tribes in southern <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, said he has 
seen changes in the culture each time he returns (13 visits, totaling 50 
months). The Yanomamo of northern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, meanwhile, have been virtually wiped 
out in recent years, since the discovery of gold on their land in <DATE>1987</DATE> 
attracted more than 40,000 prospectors virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanomamo of southern <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, meanwhile, may have a better chance of 
survival precisely because the films of <PERSON>Tim Asch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chagnon</PERSON> have given them a 
place in the public consciousness, <PERSON>Chagnon</PERSON> believes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are groups like the Yanomamo and the bushmen (of southwest <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s 
Kalahari Desert) who have become very, very significant in the minds of lots 
and lots of people," <PERSON>Chagnon</PERSON> said. "Because they have been documented in a very 
positivistic, straightforward, scientific way, (that) can now be used to help 
them to survive the destruction that is going on. . . . They have become 
symbols. They represent the tragedy of all other tribal people in all places on 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from <PERSON>Chagnon</PERSON>'s assertions on the potential political uses of ethnographic 
film, other panelists raised doubts about its scientific importance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that technology is going to save us," said <PERSON>Jay Ruby</PERSON>, an 
anthropology professor at <ORGANIZATION>Temple University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and editor of the 
journal, Visual Anthropology. "CD ROMs and 8-mm video and high-resolution 
television are not going to help us think." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than training more people to make movies, Ruby suggested teaching 
students how to analyze and interpret filmed data. "I think we're drowning in a 
sea of images, and I'd like to argue that we take fewer pictures and start 
thinking more, because I'm very bored with continually seeing basically the 
same lame ideas on the screen," <PERSON>Ruby</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I work with some students who are just technological wizards but don't have a 
single thing to say," <PERSON>Ruby</PERSON> said. "They're all dressed up with nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
One panelist, <PERSON>John Homiak</PERSON>, is an archivist with the Human Studies Film Archives 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION>. More than 5 million feet of film and video are 
stored in the archives, <PERSON>Homiak</PERSON> said, but he thinks the resource is woefully 
under-utilized. 
</P>
<P>
That is largely because most anthropologists want to make their name with their 
own field research, <PERSON>Tim Asch</PERSON> said, rather than by studying the research of 
other anthropologists. But, he added, the collected films and videos will take 
on more importance as time goes on and the tribal cultures recorded for 
posterity continue to be diluted and sometimes obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, he said, if there existed a film record of an Aztec sacrifice, or of a 
vintage performance of <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION>'s "King Lear" at the <ORGANIZATION>Globe Theatre</ORGANIZATION>. It may 
be 100 or 200 years before the archives are truly utilized. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go for the long term," <PERSON>Asch</PERSON> argued. "It's important to take visual 
anthropology seriously."

NAMIBIANS SAY THEY ARE SLOWING ILLICIT IVORY TRADE

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conservation officials in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> believe they are beginning to stem a surge in 
the illicit ivory trade that followed the withdrawal of South African troops 
under a U.N.-sponsored independence plan. 
</P>
<P>
They scored their latest success <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE> when police smashed a major 
international smuggling syndicate after months of investigation, arresting 25 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Officials seized 980 elephant tusks, weighing about seven tons and valued at 
nearly <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>, in what they believe was <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s biggest haul of illegal 
ivory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest haul made in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>," said Col. <PERSON>Johan Meintjies</PERSON>, head of 
the police diamond and narcotics squad, which also investigates poaching, after 
the raid in the farming town of <LOCATION>Okahandja</LOCATION>, 43 miles north of <LOCATION>Windhoek</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The tusks were found hidden behind a load of vegetables in a refrigerated 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
"These tusks came from more than 500 elephants, but we believe most of them 
were from animals killed in countries either to the north or the northeast of 
us," <PERSON>Brian Jones</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Nature Conservation</ORGANIZATION>, told 
<ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> Police Help 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Gerhard Roux</PERSON>, spokesman for the South African administrator-general of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Louis Pienaar</PERSON>, said: "It was with the assistance of the South African police 
that the police in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> were able to achieve this result." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say ivory is smuggled from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> 
by way of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>. It is then shipped to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> for 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men detained in the raid could face 10 years in jail under 
penalties that have been tightened since the latest poaching spate began. 
</P>
<P>
Poaching has increased this year since the number of South African forces in 
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> was reduced under the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> independence plan for the huge desert 
territory, which had been ruled by <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION> since World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>July</DATE> only 1,500 <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> troops have remained in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, confined to 
two bases in the north under the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> plan. 
</P>
<P>
Police say poachers had previously been deterred by the <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>, who 
were trying to prevent infiltration from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> by pro-independence guerrillas 
of the <ORGANIZATION>South West Africa People's Organization</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smugglers Watched 
</P>
<P>
Before the latest arrests, police had followed the smugglers through <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> 
from <LOCATION>Rundu</LOCATION>, a small town on the Angolan border in the northeast, watching them 
since <DATE>July 16</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited until we thought we had the biggest and most fish before we 
pounced," said <PERSON>Meintjies</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Rundu</LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION>Kavango River</LOCATION>, has been a conduit for ivory from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> and arms 
supplies to the rebel movement there, the <ORGANIZATION>National Union</ORGANIZATION> for the Total 
Independence of <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The area on either side of the river teems with elephants and other game, now 
threatened by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the seized elephant tusks were huge, weighing as much as 80 pounds, 
while others were tiny, taken from baby elephants. Police also seized 14 
rhinoceros horns and a few hippopotamus teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists fear that one of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s most precious resources, its 
abundant wildlife and especially its threatened black rhinoceros, faces a major 
menace from poaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Since <DATE>July this year</DATE> we have captured at least 80 poachers," police Chief 
Inspector Kierie du <ORGANIZATION>Rand</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas the police are using former bush fighters from <ORGANIZATION>Koevoet</ORGANIZATION> -- the now 
disbanded counter-insurgency unit -- to hunt the ivory dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Namibian police say the anti-poaching units have had a marked effect. But the 
<ORGANIZATION>South West Africa People's Organization</ORGANIZATION> opposes the use of the units, saying 
all former <ORGANIZATION>Koevoet</ORGANIZATION> members should be banned from police duty because they 
intimidate <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> supporters.

<HL> The Dispossessed: Far From the Unrest, South African Blacks In Rural Areas Suffer --- A Dry 'Homeland' Town Has Little Work or Hope; Even the Gardens Are Barren --- Couples Live Apart to Survive </HL>

<DATELINE> LAXEY, South Africa  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Being the health worker in this tiny village, <PERSON>Lizzie Nouse</PERSON> knows its ills well. 
"Oh, the stories I can tell you," she says, settling down to do just that on the porch of the clinic. 

   She tells of malnutrition and its deceptive effects: The children look younger than they are and the adults older. 
She matter-of-factly lists the Laxey children who have died lately; "Almost every woman here has lost at least one," she says. 

   In fact, by <PERSON>Mrs. Nouse</PERSON>'s diagnosis, the community itself is barely alive. 
"There is no work for our men," she says. 
"They have either left us or they lie around drunk. 
We have no money to pay for our children's school, so they run on the streets. 
There isn't enough water, or food, or firewood. 
We feel we have been forgotten." 

   During the unrest in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> the international focus has been on its black urban areas, the crowded townships that are the breeding grounds of political discontent. 
But difficult as township conditions may be, those of black rural communities are far worse. 

   <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is dotted with hundreds of destitute villages like Laxey, a kind of geographic pox spread by a two-decade-long program of herding blacks into self-governing "tribal homelands." 
Their residents are apartheid's dispossessed -- people who have been uprooted, dumped in a place far away from home and more or less abandoned. 
For all its gold, its diamonds and its heart transplants, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has pockets of deprivation worse than the general conditions in some of its much poorer black-ruled neighbors. 

   Under domestic and international pressure, the government now claims to have stopped forced removals. 
But their legacy remains. 
The yawning economic gap, between communities that are of the <ORGANIZATION>First World</ORGANIZATION> and others that are of the Third, underlies much of the social strife that has wrenched <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 

   Rural areas, mainly tribal homelands, are where nearly two-thirds of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s blacks live. 
Subsistence farming supports some of them, but fewer than <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT>; most other households look to husbands or sons who travel long distances to work in factories or mines, rarely returning home. 
An increasing number of rural black families rely solely on handouts. 

   Much of the charity comes from Operation Hunger, a private group that collects contributions, mainly from white <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>, and distributes corn meal and powdered soup to 1.2 million poor people. 
Operation Hunger recently studied 28 rural black communities and found evidence of malnutrition in more than half of the children examined. 
In several villages, more than <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of people had no work. 
In some places <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of households were headed by women. 

   To <PERSON>Ina Perlman</PERSON>, Operation Hunger's executive director, the numbers are "a disgrace to a country with our gross national product." 
In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s GNP was <MONEY>$2,040</MONEY> per capita. 
Yet whites had per-capita disposable income of more than twice that. 

   The South African government long neglected the rural poor; those in the relocated villages, after all, had officially become the responsibility of the homeland governments. 
And the homeland governments have been less interested in helping them than in acquiring the trappings of quasi-statehood -- parliament buildings, stadiums, hotels and casinos. 
Pretoria also points out that much of the misery is due to years of persistent drought that is only now easing. 

   More recently, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has begun to promote rural development. 
"We are very sincere in trying to bring a balance in socio-economic conditions," says <PERSON>Koos Engelbrecht</PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of National Health and Population Development</ORGANIZATION>. 
But he cautions that "it is going to take a big effort, a lot of money, and, let's face it, a lot of time." 

   In <LOCATION>Laxey</LOCATION>, time is one thing people have in abundance. 
"I haven't worked for years," says <PERSON>Jim Matloug</PERSON>, an elderly man with a scrubby white beard who stops by the clinic just to talk. 
He squeezes the last drop out of a milk carton and drops it on the ground. 
"I'm useless now." 

   "The only thing he waits for," says <PERSON>Mrs. Nouse</PERSON>, "is a coffin." 

   <PERSON>Mr. Matloug</PERSON> isn't waiting alone, for Laxey is a place of old men and women, along with mothers and their children. 
Most men of working age have left in search of jobs. 
Some of them never come back. 

   In their old home, in a place called Ga-Thlose about 40 miles south of the town of <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION>, jobs could be found. 
The women could work as domestic servants for white families, and many of the men worked in asbestos and manganese mines or for farmers. 
Thus, families could stay together. 
In addition, the land was more fertile and big towns were accessible over adequate roads. 

   But in <DATE>1977</DATE>, government trucks arrived and carried the 40,000 blacks of Ga-Thlose to the southern edge of the <LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>, about 50 miles to the other side of <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION>. 
Here, in the remote reaches of what had been declared the tribal homeland of <LOCATION>Bophuthatswana</LOCATION>, jobs are as scarce as rain, and the only commerce consists of a couple of small, overpriced general stores. 

   Raising crops on the parched banks of the <LOCATION>Mashewing River</LOCATION> here has proved nearly impossible. 
Kuruman now is reachable only by rutted gravel roads. 
To travel there and back by bus may cost as much as 16 rand, or about <MONEY>$8</MONEY>, which isn't easy for a Bophuthatswanan to pay. 

   Just ask <PERSON>Piet Molopi</PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION>Padstow</LOCATION>, who retired to a South African pension equal to about <MONEY>$50</MONEY> a month after 38 years as a mineworker. 
Now 73, he has to go to <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION> to pick up the pension each month. 
After paying for the bus ride, he is already down to about <MONEY>$42</MONEY>. 
The rest goes to pay off a credit note from his food purchases the previous month. 
Then he must run up another tab to buy this month's supply of corn meal, sugar and coffee. 

   The pension money doesn't last even a day, and the food barely lasts two weeks. 
"Then I suffer," <PERSON>Mr. Molopi</PERSON> says. 

   As it happens, the whites of <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION> have also suffered, though to a far lesser degree. 
The town's population has declined by several hundred to about 4,000 since the relocation of blacks. 
Its merchants have lost not only black customers but also some whites; many whites now cross into the nearest part of <LOCATION>Bophuthatswana</LOCATION> for grocery shopping because the sales tax is lower. 

   <PERSON>Donald Riekert</PERSON>, a photographer and poet who has lived in the area all his life, says several <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION> retailers have closed, and in trying to attract investment, <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bophuthatswana</LOCATION> villages find themselves arguing against each other. 
"The problem is that what should be one economic unit has been divided into two political units," he says. 
"The result is that we're both struggling to survive." 

   This is about the only similarity, though. 
While the whites of <LOCATION>Kuruman</LOCATION> come home from work and turn on their lawn sprinklers, the people along the dry <LOCATION>Mashewing River</LOCATION> desperately try to grow something, anything, in the ubiquitous red sand. 
"The wind always blows, and the sand covers everything," says <PERSON>Cecelia Mongaka</PERSON>, as she looks at the dune covering the pitiful garden in front of <LOCATION>Padstow</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Windmills and several diesel pumps bring water to taps on the dusty streets, but it is never enough. 
When the diesel fuel runs out, as it seems to do at the end of every month, the pumps stand idle for several days until a new shipment arrives. 
But the plants and livestock can't wait. 

   "I'm down to one cow and one calf, two donkeys and six goats," says <PERSON>Mr. Matloug</PERSON> of Laxey. 
"I came here with a lot more, but they have died from the dryness. 
I've also had to sell some, to feed my family." 

   Anyone with even one goat is considered rich along the Mashewing. 
The Operation Hunger study found that in <LOCATION>Padstow</LOCATION> only <PERCENT>9%</PERCENT> of the adults have work. 
Households are large, averaging eight people, but their monthly income averages only about <MONEY>$40</MONEY>. 
For nearly three-quarters of <LOCATION>Padstow</LOCATION> families, the only means of survival is the fortnightly rations of corn meal and soup the relief organization distributes. 
"We've dug many graves of hunger here," sighs <PERSON>Mrs. Mongaka</PERSON>. 

   All this leaves the people vulnerable to exploitation. 
Some women say they have done government road-repair work for as little as <MONEY>$15</MONEY> a month. 
White farmers frequently come through the area looking for cheap labor. 

   <PERSON>Kierie Strydom</PERSON> pulls his oversize truck to a stop across from the clinic in <LOCATION>Laxey</LOCATION>. 
He hires about 250 residents for nine or 10 months of the year and has come today to get some more for a busy period. 
He pays <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> to <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> a day for picking peanuts and culling kernels of seed corn. 
During the corn harvest, much of which is done by hand, he says he pays maybe six or seven bags of corn for every 100 filled. 

   "I give them their meals, and I also give them coffee and sugar. 
I treat them right," he says, before driving off with a couple of dozen boys. 

   Up the road are three young women who worked on a farm most of last year. 
Among them they have 10 children but no husbands living at home. 
They were hoping to bring back plenty of corn meal for their children, but after 10 months of work, they say, they returned with a total of just five bags. 

   "They say they don't ever want to do that again," says <PERSON>Mrs. Nouse</PERSON>, the health worker. 
But, she notes, in <LOCATION>Laxey</LOCATION> one doesn't have many choices.

<TEXT>
   Party flags, T-shirts and posters,
paraphernalia of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s independence-election campaign, abound
in this remote outpost of the diminutive Bushmen, the territory's
earliest inhabitants.
   But the crucial issue among them is not independence from <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>; it's survival.
   Bushman farmers, limited to a fraction of their traditional
territory, hope to retain enough land to raise themselves just to
subsistence levels when <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> becomes independent after the
voting <DATE>Nov. 7-11</DATE>.
   Those Bushmen who fought for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> during a 23-year war
against pro-independence guerrillas in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, also known as
<LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>, are living off their last military paychecks and
waiting to hear the army's plans for their future. Others languish
in the slums of <LOCATION>Bushmanland</LOCATION>'s only town, Tshumkwe.
   The third smallest of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s 11 ethnic groups, the 33,000
Bushmen have never been united politically. They are scattered
across an arid territory and speak a half-dozen languages,
including <LOCATION>Afrikaans</LOCATION>, the language of the majority of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s
whites.
   Thirty years ago, some Namibian Bushmen survived solely by
hunting and gathering, as did their ancestors. Today, even the
Ju@wa in <LOCATION>eastern Bushmanland</LOCATION>, the only group still in possession of
its traditional hunting grounds, must raise cattle and vegetables
to survive.
   Toma, a young <PERSON>Bushman</PERSON> who speaks <LOCATION>Afrikaans</LOCATION> as well as Ju@wa's
clicking language, said the elections mark the first time his
people have been wooed by political parties. He hopes independence
will bring a high school and more shops in <LOCATION>Tshumkwe</LOCATION>, a job for him,
and a better house for his family in the tiny, grass-hut village of
Gautcha.
   The United Nations-supervised elections will determine the
make-up of a constitution-writing assembly. Independence, after 74
years of South African rule, will come once the constitution and
new government are in place.
   Although elections are new to the Bushmen, they know the rural
development policies of the new government could affect them
dramatically.
   They have been invited to community meetings by officials of the
<ORGANIZATION>South-West Africa People's Organization</ORGANIZATION> (SWAPO), the guerrilla
movement that is the front-runner in the campaign. They have
received free food and T-shirts from supporters of <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>'s main
rival, the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Turnhalle Alliance</ORGANIZATION>.
   SWAPO says it plans to redistribute unused or foreign-owned land
to those without property, but <PERSON>Theo-Ben Gurirab</PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>
official, said the party wants to get away from ethnic stereotypes.
   He added that he believes Bushmen have become the focus of what
he calls disproportionate and misguided concern, particularly
abroad, over what might happen to the Bushmen, their traditions and
cultures.
   ``We do not want to lock them in a zoo for foreigners to come
and experiment on how they used to live,'' <PERSON>Gurirab</PERSON> said. ``We're
going to look at them as citizens of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> whose needs should be
attended to.''
   Gurirab condemned as ``sinister'' suggestions by South African
officials to move to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> Bushmen soldiers worried about
their future in independent <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Erno Gauerke</PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Turnhalle Alliance</ORGANIZATION>,
said Bushmen were struggling through a difficult transition from
traditional to modern society. He said his party, a multiracial,
pro-capitalist coalition, would try to promote rural agricultural
development and a shift from communal to private land use.
   <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Ju@wa Bushman Development Foundation</ORGANIZATION> said
the Bushmen now are <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s equivalent of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
``untouchables.'' But he said increasing numbers of other Namibians
could face similar hardship unless economic trends are reversed.
   <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>, an American filmmaker and anthropolgist whose
organization seeks to promote small-scale farming projects in
<LOCATION>Bushmanland</LOCATION>, said the Bushmen are trapped between outsiders'
sentimental views that they should be protected from the modern
world and the reality of their poverty.
   They face ``death by myth,'' he said, when what they want is a
chance to achieve self-sufficiency.
   The <PERSON>Namibian Bushman</PERSON> population has declined at a rate of about
<PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> every 10 years, <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> said.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Ferdie Weich</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Dutch Reformed Church</ORGANIZATION>, who has done
missionary work in several Bushmen communities, said illiteracy is
widespread.
   ``At school, there's a certain amount of unidentifiable
discrimination against the Bushmen,'' he said.
   Because of the scarcity of teachers who speak their languages,
<PERSON>Bushman</PERSON> children are taught in <LOCATION>Afrikaans</LOCATION>.
   The Bushmen will be dependent for several generations on outside
financial help and on the perserverance of those who try to assist
them, <PERSON>Weich</PERSON> said.
   The Ju@wa foundation has helped establish 20 new villages in
<LOCATION>Bushmanland</LOCATION> where residents tend gardens and raise cattle as well
as hunt and gather.
   Project director <PERSON>Megan Biesele</PERSON> said the farming cooperative they
have formed is an attempt to translate their ancient system of land
use into modern terms to gain leasehold over the area.
   The foundation hopes to establish 15 more villages of 30 to 35
people each and to improve education and health services.

<TEXT>
   In a continent littered with economic
disasters, <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> heads toward independence as a potential success
if it can meet the demands of poor blacks without alienating
wealthy whites and foreign investors.
   The desert territory has profitable mining, fishing and farming
industries and one of the best infrastructures in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, much of
it built with money from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   White-controlled <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has administered <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, also
known as <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>, for 74 years under a mandate from the
defunct <ORGANIZATION>League of Nations</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s per capita income of about <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> annually is among
the highest in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. But economists say its independence could
bring a sharp economic decline and they list these reasons:
   _ <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which has provided up to <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s
<MONEY>$750 million</MONEY> annual budget, is expected to cut virtually all aid
after independence, expected early next year.
   _ Thousands of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s whites, concerned about the future
under a black-led government, are expected to leave the country or
move their assets to neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   _ Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>South-West Africa People's Organization</ORGANIZATION>, the
guerrilla group expected to win pre-independence elections in
<DATE>November</DATE>, have virtually no hands-on economic experience. They
proclaim socialist policies associated with crumbling economies
elsewhere in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of
socialism over capitalism,'' the organization said in an election
manifesto.
   ``The state will have ownership of a significant part of the
country's economic resources,'' it said. ``Egalitarianism forms the
basis of (<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>'s) vision of a just social order.''
   Such promises are popular among the black majority in a
territory where the unemployment rate is estimated at <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>
and few blacks own homes or businesses.
   Will it work?
   All the southern African nations that have relied heavily on
state control of the economy _ <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> _ have suffered economic declines or fallen short of
their potential.
   <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, the one black-ruled country in the region to pursue a
market-oriented economy, has prospered.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> has raised expectations that will be difficult to meet
regardless of their policies,'' said <PERSON>Rainer Ritter</PERSON>, a private
economist in <LOCATION>Windhoek</LOCATION>.
   The organization has promised major improvements in education,
health care, housing and jobs.
   But <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> has not said how it will finance the programs. The
territory now has a budget deficit of about <MONEY>$180 million</MONEY> and a
foreign debt of more than <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>.
   SWAPO will have to try to prevent a recession in the northern
towns and villages of the Ovambo tribe, where the organization
draws its strongest support.
   An estimated 50,000 South African soldiers have left <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>
since the year-long independence plan took effect <DATE>April 1</DATE>. Most
were stationed in the north, where Namibians fought them but relied
on their money.
   Hundreds of small general stores, known as cuca shops, are
central to economic life in the north and are likely to suffer.
Thousands of Namibians employed by the military in jobs ranging
from soldiers to maids are now out of work.
   SWAPO has softened its hard-line socialist language in recent
months in an effort to encourage whites to stay and to attract
foreign investors.
   ``We will invite foreign investors to develop our economy,''
<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Sam Nujoma</PERSON> said recently in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. ``We do
not think the present moment is the time for nationalizations.''
   <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION> also has made it clear it will accept a mixed economy and
needs the skills and capital of <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s 75,000 whites, who make
up <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of the territory's 1.3 million people.
   Whites own an estimated <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT> of private property in
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> and earn at least 10 times more than blacks on average,
according to <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>.
   SWAPO's main opponent, the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Turnhalle Alliance</ORGANIZATION>, says
<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>'s moderate tone will vanish if the organization comes to
power.
   SWAPO remains committed to ``an outdated and demonstrably
unsuccessful ideology _ that of doctrinaire socialism _ an ideology
that has already destroyed the economies of most African states,''
said the alliance, a multiracial coalition that favors a
market-oriented economy.
   The Namibian government, under South African control, already
accounts for more than half the territory's <MONEY>$1.3 billion</MONEY> gross
domestic product.
   Large diamond and uranium mining companies, owned by firms in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, make up the largest chunk of the private
sector.
   <ORGANIZATION>Consolidated Diamond Mining of Namibia</ORGANIZATION>, owned by De Beers of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, recently said <ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>'s economic views contain ``some
inaccuracies and a certain lack of realism.''
   But the company also said it was ``encouraged by (<ORGANIZATION>SWAPO</ORGANIZATION>'s)
apparent willingness to negotiate'' and that willingness ``offers
scope for reconciliation between government and the private
sector.''

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zambian President <PERSON>Kenneth Kaunda</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
urged the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to stop supporting Angolan rebels and paid
rare tribute to the Western nation, for mediating talks to bring
peace to southwestern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   A summit meeting of the six Front-line States in direct
confrontation with <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> called for <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General
<PERSON>Javier Perez de Cuellar</PERSON> to hasten independence in <LOCATION>South-West Africa</LOCATION>,
also known as <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, and ensure the machinery for independence
remains under the control of the world body.
   The leaders of <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> also appealed to the international community for military
and other support during <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s U.N.-supervised transition to
independence.
   It was the first Front-line summit since <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>South
Africa</ORGANIZATION> signed a U.S.-negotiated peace accord.
   Under the agreement, signed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
will grant independence to mineral-rich <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> while <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> withdraws
50,000 troops from <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> within 27 months.
   Opening the summit, <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> called on President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>
to help the peace process by halting support to <PERSON>Jonas Savimbi</PERSON>'s
<ORGANIZATION>National Union</ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>.
   Savimbi's rebels have been fighting <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>'s Marxist government
since the country gained independence from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE>. The
guerrillas orginally were backed by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, which for 73 years
has governed <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>. But in recent
years they also have won support from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Neither <PERSON>Savimbi</PERSON>'s movement nor guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION>South-West
Africa People's Organization</ORGANIZATION> fighting for Namibian independence were
involved directly in the peace accord.
   However, Namibian guerrilla leader <PERSON>Sam Nujoma</PERSON> said on the eve of
the summit that he hoped this Christmas would be the last under
South African occupation for <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s 1 million people.
   At the summit, <PERSON>Kaunda</PERSON> praised the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration for
mediating months of fractured talks that finally resulted in the
accord. But he echoed black leaders' fears that <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> will
renege.
   Angolan President <PERSON>Jose Eduardo dos Santos</PERSON>, whose nation stands to
gain most from the pact, was more optimistic. He declared <DATE>Sunday</DATE> he
was happy with the terms and predicted southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> would be
``transformed in the near future into a zone of peace and
international cooperation.''
   <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> have
been at the forefront of African efforts to end <LOCATION>Pretoria</LOCATION>'s policy of
legal race separation and speed Namibian independence.
   Also at the summit are the three main guerrilla-backed political
movements fighting in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> _ <PERSON>Nujoma</PERSON>'s organization, and
the <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Pan-Africanist Congress</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.

MAGAZINES / BOB SIPCHEN: HOW MANY BODIES IN MIDEAST WAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many American soldiers are likely to die if a ground war breaks out in the 
<LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
1,200? 
</P>
<P>
20,000? 
</P>
<P>
32,000? 
</P>
<P>
48,000? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, each of those figures has been presented as a reasonable estimate of 
American casualties in a one-month ground war in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But if you haven't heard those figures, you're not alone. According to an 
article in the <DATE>December</DATE> Washington Monthly, the American media have been remiss 
-- at least until recently -- in asking basic questions about Operation Desert 
Shield, such as, "How many Americans are likely to be killed?" and, "How many 
American deaths are justified in stopping Saddam Hussein?" 
</P>
<P>
This apparent phobia about figures dates back to the moment <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> invaded 
<LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Monthly editor <PERSON>James Bennet</PERSON> writes in "How They Missed That 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the first days of the crisis, the notion of sending any troops, let 
alone the more than 400,000 now predicted to be deployed in the <LOCATION>Mideast</LOCATION> by 
year's end, seemed virtually unthinkable. In fact, the four news outlets the 
monthly has tracked since the invasion -- <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "Nightline," with <PERSON>Ted Koppel</PERSON>, 
the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times -- all quoted 
sources who dismissed out-of-hand the idea of deploying American troops to 
fight a ground war. 
</P>
<P>
As rumors of possible troop deployment began to leak, rising from an initial 
ceiling of 50,000 to 100,000 to 250,000, the press continued to print official 
denials, <PERSON>Bennet</PERSON> reports. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> quoted "one of the handful of a senior policy 
planners in the administration," who called the last figure "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
An <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE> editorial in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times -- the monthly gives this paper 
better marks than the other media surveyed, but is nevertheless critical of The 
Times' coverage of potential casualties -- called the suggestion of 250,000 
troops being sent to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> "mind-boggling." The Times editorial 
predicted: "Hundreds of Thousands of American fighting men are not going to be 
put into the ferociously hostile environment of <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the deployment did occur. But, according to <PERSON>Bennet</PERSON>, the same media 
that had at first reported why economic sanctions alone, or a naval blockade, 
or at most a massive air strike were the best options for resolving the crisis, 
failed to seriously question the wisdom of the rapidly escalating troop 
buildup. Nor did they adequately discuss potential casualties. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a Brookings Institution analyst presented on <DATE>Sept. 5</DATE> a model 
suggesting that American and Saudi forces would suffer 32,000 to 48,000 
casualties in a war lasting just one month, but only the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> 
reported it -- and then on page 6. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Mueller</PERSON>, the author of "War, Presidents, and Public Opinion," is quoted in 
the monthly piece as saying that support for Presidents eroded as casualties 
mounted in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. If 20,000 soldiers were killed in the <LOCATION>Middle 
East</LOCATION>, it would be "catastrophic," he says. "That would be vastly more than were 
suffered in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> in the first year. . . . I can even imagine impeachment." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, <PERSON>Bennet</PERSON> points out, even now no pollster has asked the blunt question: "Is 
it worth 20,000 to 30,000 casualties to get Hussein?" 
</P>
<P>
As testimony on Capitol Hill increases, more publications are focusing on 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s policies in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In its <DATE>Dec. 10</DATE> cover story, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> attempts to paint a picture of "What War Would 
Be Like." But even at this late date, the weekly seems reluctant to discuss the 
potential body count. 
</P>
<P>
In the main essay, oddly titled "If War Begins," the magazine states that in 
the first days of war, "100 or more lost <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aircraft would be a fair 
estimate." It also quotes analysts who "figure the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> must anticipate the 
destruction of 100 to 200 tanks, each with a four-man crew and an equal number 
of Bradley Fighting vehicles, each carrying a dozen solders." 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't until the penultimate paragraph that an actual estimate of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
casualties is quoted: 1,200 to 3,000 dead and 7,000 to 16,000 wounded in the 
first 10 days of fighting. And that figure, from a retired colonel, seems 
optimistic, given that in the previous paragraph British officers say they 
would expect to lose 2,000 soldiers from their relatively tiny force of 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Media reluctance to focus on this gruesome topic may be spurred by fears of 
being labeled unpatriotic. In another <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> article in the package, for example, 
special correspondent <PERSON>Michael Kramer</PERSON> writes: " . . . <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> undoubtedly took 
further comfort from the parade of skeptics counseling delay before (<ORGANIZATION>Georgia 
Sen.</ORGANIZATION>) <PERSON>Sam Nunn</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Senate Armed Services Committee</ORGANIZATION> last week." 
</P>
<P>
But patriotism and quiescence do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. The problem, 
as <PERSON>Bennet</PERSON> sees it, is not so much in President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s policy per se, but rather 
in the suspect manner in which the decisions about the crisis have been made 
and presented to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to oppose the American troop deployment in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> to 
worry about the singular absence of public debate -- in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, 
in the major papers, on TV -- during those first few weeks," <PERSON>Bennet</PERSON> writes. 
"You just have to believe that good debate makes good policy." 
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
The human inhabitants of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s Kalahari desert call that vast expanse "the 
great thirstland." For an animals' eye perspective of this magnificent turf, 
turn to photographer <PERSON>Frans Lanting</PERSON>'s work in the <ORGANIZATION>December National Geographic</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some of his images -- the bullfrog staring out from a huge rainwater pond, the 
drinking impalas -- are charming. Some -- the skinned Zebra, the snacking 
crocodiles and lions -- are gruesome. But they are all captivating.

<FP=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Prospects of violence are so great in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> 
that it is making hundreds of white people in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> flee 
across the border into the neighboring states of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>. However, as <PERSON>Derek James</PERSON> now 
reports from <LOCATION>Gaborone</LOCATION>, the locals of <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> have also been 
making their own panic moves. 
  [Begin James recording] <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> is attractive to <LOCATION>South 
Africans</LOCATION> because of its closeness, stability, and peace. 
Already stories abound and are confirmed by top <ORGANIZATION>Bank of 
Botswana</ORGANIZATION> officials of large amounts of South African rands being 
handed over to banks here. <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s (?free) fall of the South 
African currency is not only a message of a collapse in overseas 
confidence, but also a strong signal to those who have money to 
get it out of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. One such person handed over 300,000 
in <LOCATION>South African rands</LOCATION>, that is 50,000 pounds, into a <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> 
bank account last week. Most <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> are still not rich 
enough to afford top <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> hotels and are staying with 
friends, but in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> the caravan parks are 
already filling up. Some <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> will simply be making 
temporary use of neighboring countries. 
  <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic 
drop in supplies of food. Over <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of our food comes 
from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and traders have been warned that strikes, 
hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited 
supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior <ORGANIZATION>Bank of 
Botswana</ORGANIZATION> official assured (?journalists) last week that 
<LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s currency will be protected, but a dramatic <PERCENT>6.8 
percent</PERCENT> drop in the South African rand since <DATE>January</DATE> is bound to 
affect the <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> pula, which is partly linked to the rand. 
People in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> are filling their cupboards with tinned 
food, as they hear of <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>' advice to stock up with 
food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great 
days of election and freedom approach. 
  The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries 
first, although the influx of money will be a temporary 
blessing, as <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> is merely being used a conduit for the 
outflow of cash. [end recording]
