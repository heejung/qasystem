  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> that the hopes that 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>, will 
be given somewhat different treatment as regards sanctions are 
unrealistic. The international community is not even 
considering a partial relaxation of sanctions against <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
alone, and such a solution "would not be good for either 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>," he said. 
  Speaking about a possible lifting of the sanctions against 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, which has been talked about increasingly often among 
the public, <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said at a news conference that the only 
relaxation that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> could expect is the reestablishing of 
traffic links with <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and somewhat more generous humanitarian 
aid, due to the large numbers of refugees. 
  The Montenegrin prime minister stressed that the awareness 
of 
how senseless the sanctions are is gaining strength in the 
international community, for it is being realized that they have 
not achieved their objective. Asked how much the sanctions have 
cost <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said that the "amount of the losses" 
cannot be precisely quantified. However, he added, the lost 
exports and revenue from tourism, the non-functioning of the 
merchant fleet, and the inability to meet contractual 
obligations to foreign partners have so far cost <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> some 
<MONEY>$3.34 billion</MONEY>. 
  Speaking about new economic measures, <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> mentioned a 
possible increase in salaries in the republic, but warned they 
have to be kept in line with other parameters, particularly with 
production.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- Significant headway 
has been achieved in the talks conducted by the Montenegrin 
delegation in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, because there is a growing 
awareness that the policy of sanctions against the <ORGANIZATION>Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is pointless, Montenegrin 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON> said in his assessment of the 
Montenegrin delegation's visit to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>. The delegation 
returned to <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> <DATE>yesterday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. 
  The stands of the international community -- primarily the 
<LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> -- on the futility of the policy of sanctions, 
which have, in a way, been conveyed to the Montenegrin 
delegation will, according to <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON>, encourage a flurry of 
activity leading to the establishment of peace in 
<LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, after which the sanctions against the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> will be alleviated. 
  Assessing the talks in <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> as extremely useful and 
interesting, the Montenegrin prime minister stressed that it had 
been mutually noted that peace in <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> is of 
paramount importance, and that this will be followed by all 
other moves on the part of the international community. 
  Respect was also voiced toward the principled policies 
pursued by <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, both in the sense of searching for a 
solution in the region of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> and of normalizing 
the situation in the entire area, <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said. He attaches 
great importance to the fact that, by making this visit, 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s foreign policy, which does carry a certain amount 
of weight in the eyes of the international community, has 
announced the beginning of a new diplomatic offensive.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Government of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has no official reports on or evidence of the 
mobilization of refugees, TANJUG was told today by <PERSON>Rade Perovic</PERSON>, 
deputy prime minister in the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Government</ORGANIZATION>. The 
parliamentary Social-Democratic Party of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> was the 
first to voice its opinion in reaction to reports on the alleged 
mobilization of refugees claiming that "with the blessing from 
the republic's bodies and the support of military authorities, 
refugees from the territory of <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> are issued 
call-ups to be mobilized into the army of the republic of 
Srpska." 
  The issue was also raised at a session of the Montenegrin 
parliament, held <DATE>last week</DATE>, when deputy <PERSON>Savo Jablan</PERSON> asked: "Who 
is behind the forced mobilization of refugees in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, and 
what is its aim?". Stressing that the government of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
has no official reports on the alleged mobilization, <PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>, in 
charge of that ministry, claims that the UN convention on the 
status of refugees is honored in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
  "A decree on the care for refugees, passed in <DATE>July 1992</DATE>, 
regulates their position and status, and they are exempt from 
mobilization," <PERSON>Perovic</PERSON> stressed.

  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Budva</LOCATION>, 22 <DATE>May</DATE> -- After almost two years everyone 
knows that the sanctions against the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> [FRY] are absurd and unjust. However, even if they 
were just, they need to be more flexible, at least enough to 
acknowledge the basic humanitarian needs. Montenegrin Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON> said this at a news conference <DATE>today</DATE> 
with a group of international journalists who have been in 
<LOCATION>Budva</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, for three days. They go to <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> on 23 <DATE>May</DATE>. 
  <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said that the negative consequences of the 
sanctions on the Montenegrin economy have caused more than <MONEY>$5 
billion</MONEY> in damage, with the greatest repercussions on the 
humanitarian situation because <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is supporting about 
50,000 refugees, <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of whom are Muslim. He said 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has been coping with a serious humanitarian crisis 
for months. UN bodies have not yet aproved a single request for 
the import of certain goods which would ease humanitarian and 
other problems. 
  The Montenegrin prime minister was frequently asked about 
the 
effects of the sanctions and how long <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> will be able to 
endure them. <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said that the international blockade 
has been a complete fiasco, but if someone is interested in 
testing our ability to suffer, the nation is resilient and can 
endure the imposed hardships. 
  Illustrating the deadly effects of the sanctions, the 
Montenegrin prime minister said the government had already sold 
several vessels from the republic's relatively opulent fleet. 
However, a number of vessels are in danger because they are 
trapped in foreign ports, and the costs of their anchorage are 
growing alarmingly day by day. [passage omitted] 
  <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> was also asked repeatedly about <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s 
position in the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said 
that most citizens of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> would be in favor of a joint 
state with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>; others are iin favor of that, but only with 
absolute equality between the federal members. Montenegro will 
not back up on that position by a millimeter, the prime minister 
said. He added that there are secessionist and unitaristic 
political forces in both <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. In this context 
he mentioned certain political trends from within the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian 
Academy of Science</ORGANIZATION> and Arts and certain political views voiced 
at the recent congress of Serbian intellectuals. However, he 
stressed that official policy does not support those views, 
either in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> or in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
  Any denial of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> as a separate entity and the denial 
of its equality has a very destructive and destabilizing effect 
on the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> warned, and said that the overall 
constitutional commitments do not threaten <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s position 
in any way. [passage omitted]

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- The <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin 
Foreign Affairs Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has announced that <PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON> met 
Italian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Antonio Martino</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> today. 
  Lekic "voiced the opinion that the peace process in 
connection with the <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> conflict is entering its 
most delicate stage to date, and that its end will either mean 
qualitative improvement or a plunge into an even deeper crisis 
and uncertainty." According to the Montenegrin foreign minister, 
by accepting or rejecting the furure peace plan, the warring 
sides in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> will definitely declare themselves either for 
peace or for the continuation of the war. 
  The Italian foreign minister was reported as having said in 
talks with <PERSON>Lekic</PERSON> that his country holds <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s 
constructive contribution to the current peace process in high 
esteem and he expressed <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s readiness to go on aiding 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in alleviating its difficulties. Contacts between 
Italian and Montenegrin representatives so far have been 
assessed as positive, and it was concluded with pleasure that 
they have lately been registering an upward trend. 
  Hope was expressed that cooperation between <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> will be promoted after the sanctions are lifted.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
Government submitted a written notice today to the republic's 
assembly to the effect that, following the adoption of a federal 
law on defense, there is no longer any need for Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON> to perform the duty of minister for defense. 
  When the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Government</ORGANIZATION> was being formed in <DATE>March 
last year</DATE>, it decided that the prime minister, <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON>, 
would perform the duty of minister for defense until a federal 
law on defense was passed which, the government explained, would 
specify constitutional arrangements in this sphere and create 
conditions for a uniform discharge of this duty at federal level. 
  Given that the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegro Ministry for Defense</ORGANIZATION> has been 
dissolved following the adoption of the federal law in this 
sphere, the government suggests that the republic's assembly 
should relieve Deputy Defense Minister <PERSON>Veljko Vukovic</PERSON> of his 
duty.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic 
of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> [FRY], created two years ago, is no new state; its 
creation merely confirmed the will of the Serbian and 
Montenegrin people to set up their own state in a new way, FRY 
President <PERSON>Zoran Lilic</PERSON> stated today in an interview to <LOCATION>Radio 
Montenegro</LOCATION>. He said the current <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> "emerged under 
domestic and international conditions of general chaos." The 
creation of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION> was a rational response by the Montenegrin 
and Serbian people to this chaos, <PERSON>Lilic</PERSON> stressed on the occasion 
of two-year anniversary of formation of the common state of 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. According to him, the founding, 
preservation, and strengthening of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION> are values of such 
importance that their full meaning will only be able to be 
assessed in retrospect. Lilic also said that it is very 
important to preserve continuity in relation to the former 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> "both because of specific international rights, which 
will have to be recognized, and for the sake of the interests of 
parts of the nation outside the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>." 
  Most political parties, according to <PERSON>Lilic</PERSON>, have understood 
that they cannot disregard the will of the people when it comes 
to the reasons for the founding and preservation of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>, and 
its prospects. The <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION> president stated that "sporadic 
disagreements" between the two federal units are only a 
consequence of the difficult economic blockade and other 
unfavorable circumstances. According to him, "the Montenegrin 
people have stoically suffered many trials and tribulations" 
over the past two years. <PERSON>Lilic</PERSON> said the harsh blockade had 
interrupted many positive processes in the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>. However, even 
in these conditions many changes for the better have been 
achieved. "During two years of condensed history the hardened 
forces have maintained themselves and will be ready for the time 
when the sanctions are lifted," <PERSON>Lilic</PERSON> stressed, expressing the 
hope that this would happen soon. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION> president on this occasion also repeated his view 
that a peaceful resolution of all the conflicts on the territory 
of the former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> remains the only constructive option 
and firm orientation.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>N. Perkovic</PERSON>: "Under the Sea Into the World"] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 16 <DATE>May 1994</DATE> -- Owing to a project made 
possible by the <ORGANIZATION>OTE</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Greek Telecommunications Organization</ORGANIZATION>, 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> will not remain a desert island in the 
"sea" of international telecommunications. A part of the <MONEY>$3.5 
million</MONEY> equipment for digital radio-relay connections, which had 
been bought by <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> from the Italian company 
"Alcatel-Teletra" before the sanctions were introduced, will be 
delivered to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>. Beginning from <DATE>September 
1996</DATE>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> should have an underwater connection from Bar, 
through <LOCATION>Durres</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Corfu</LOCATION>, to the whole world. 
  This is the result of the agreement achieved in <LOCATION>Salonika</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> between the Yugoslav and Montenegrin <ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> and the 
representatives of the Greek telecommunication service. In 
<LOCATION>Salonika</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Vucic Cagorovic</PERSON>, the Yugoslav <ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> general manager, 
<PERSON>Milorad Jaksic</PERSON>, the Serbian <ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> general manager, and <PERSON>Jusuf 
Fetahovic</PERSON>, the Montenegrin <ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> general manager, concluded the 
work of expert groups from both countries. 
  There followed a meeting of expert groups in <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION>, led by 
<PERSON>Jusuf Fetahovic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Petros Labron</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>OTE</ORGANIZATION> general manager, in 
which the agreement was reached that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> should be 
included in every project for optic cables planned for the 
<LOCATION>Adriatic</LOCATION>. 
  Experts consider that the <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> investment in the 
radio-relay and optic cables project will be the most profitable 
investment in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Therefore it is considered that this 
historic endeavor will be fervently supported by the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin 
Government</ORGANIZATION>, especially if we know that both <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> would profit from it because this 
would enable them to become linked to the international 
communication network. Otherwise they would not only be cut off 
from the world and deprived of the possibility of following 
scientific achievements in this field, but they would also lose 
an important income in hard currency. 
  Taking into consideration all parameters, this will be the 
most profitable ecological and tourist undertaking in the 
ecological state of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> [as published].

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin President 
<PERSON>Momir Bulatovic</PERSON> announced today that a Greek consulate would 
open in this <LOCATION>Republic</LOCATION>. 
  "In the course of a visit by <ORGANIZATION>Greek Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Karolos Papoulias</ORGANIZATION> some time ago we accepted with 
pleasure an offer by our guests to open a Greek consulate in 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> said, adding that according to what he 
had learned, the Greek parliament has approved such a decision. 
  Replying to a question on the possibility of the opening of 
the consulates of other countries in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> said 
at a news conference that there was also interest in the opening 
of an Albanian consulate. Unfortunately, he added, "because of 
the current political situation, this idea has not yet reached 
the phase of realization." 
  The Montenegrin president stressed that the foreign policy 
orientation of the government and the leadership of this 
republic is "to accept offers and set up a consular network", 
which would also make the entire diplomatic communication of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> more efficient.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 31</DATE> (TANJUG) -- It has been officially 
estimated that the Yugoslav republic of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has sustained 
a loss of over <MONEY>five billion dollars</MONEY> over the past two years of 
the international blockade. Montenegrin Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo 
Djukanovic</PERSON> has said that this is the rough estimate of both 
direct and indirect losses caused by the sanctions. He added, 
however, that there were also losses which cannot be measured by 
statistical figures. 
  According to the federal government, the international 
blockade has over the past two years inflicted on the Yugoslav 
economy a direct loss of <MONEY>35 billion dollars</MONEY>, which, together 
with those caused indirectly, amount to <MONEY>100 billion dollars</MONEY>. On 
<DATE>May 30, 1992</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> introduced draconic 
economic sanctions against the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> 
(Serbia/Montenegro) because of its alleged involvement in the 
civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in neighbouring 
<LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>. Most Montenegrin firms are operating at 
intervals and below their rated capacities. It is estimated 
that one-third of the total 130,000-strong workforce has been 
laid off with token pay due to the slashed production rate. 
  <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s most vital and profitable industries, such as 
tourism, maritime economy, iron and steel industry and 
non-ferrous metal industry, have been severely crippled by the 
international blockade. <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s fleet, which formerly 
accounted for about 20 per cent of the annual foreign currency 
revenues and for about five per cent of the total revenues, has 
found itself on the verge of collapse. The fleet's 37 ships, 
with 977,000-tonne cargo capacity, is blocked in harbours 
throughout the world, for which <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> has to pay a lay-over 
tax amounting to over <MONEY>50 million dollars</MONEY> a year. 
  The sanctions have especially aggravated the humanitarian 
situation in the republic, as the impoverished economy bears the 
brunt of providing not only for its 615,000 citizens but also 
for more than 50,000 refugees in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Over the past two 
years, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has on several occasions urged the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. 
Sanctions Committee</ORGANIZATION> to approve exports of alumina, which would 
enable the purchase of necessary foodstuffs and medicines, but 
none of the requests have so far been approved.

  [Text] "Take me east of <ORGANIZATION>Suez</ORGANIZATION> where there is no difference 
between the best and the worst," <ORGANIZATION>Rudyard Kipling</ORGANIZATION> wished once. 
This week it was not necessary to travel that far in order to 
reach a world in which fantasy and reality meet. The second <ORGANIZATION>DPS</ORGANIZATION> 
[Democratic Party of Socialists] congress was the place in which 
the desired and the twisted world in which we live, led by the 
<ORGANIZATION>DPS</ORGANIZATION> and its leaders, were equalized. 
  <ORGANIZATION>DPS</ORGANIZATION> members said in the congress that they were devoted to 
democracy, but at the same time they use wiretaps and physical 
threats and misuse the media, which are more brutal than the 
communist television during the last 50 years. They claim to be 
establishing a constitutional state and torture people in 
prisons. They make statements in which they point out that they 
pursue the politics of peace and friendly relations with their 
neighbors, but they have obviously forgotten that they led a war 
outside <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and sowed 250 graves over the country for 
Montenegrin youngsters who died in that war. They pretend to be 
developing a civilized state, while supporting ethnic cleansing 
not only in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, but also in <LOCATION>Boka Kotorska</LOCATION> and in northern 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. They support political pluralism and parliamentary 
democracy but they arm their political followers. They boast 
about the safety <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> citizens allegedly have, but they 
"forget" to mention the act of kidnapping in <LOCATION>Strpci</LOCATION>, in which 
they were involved. They are trying to convince us that their 
foreign policy is constructive and assessed positively by the 
whole world, but their plane can only fly to <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> in order to 
buy furniture for their new apartments there. They are open to 
all democratic ideas, but "their attitudes are completely 
identical" with those of the fascist <PERSON>Zhirinovsky</PERSON>. They 
conducted a "secret" poll about public matters and invited the 
manager of an "independent" institute of an "autonomous" 
university to the party congress in order to read what they 
wrote for him. Their bells [the state media] were ringing two 
days long telling us that according to that objective poll more 
than <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the 1,000 respondents support <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, but 
they did not say that less than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> supported an alliance 
of Serbian states, called <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, into which they want to 
push <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, too. 
  <PERSON>Momir Bulatovic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON> revived the idea that 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> should merge. They did not state the 
reasons, so we cannot think of their opposite in order to know 
what their real motives are, but let us mention two possible 
reasons in order to make things clearer. One of the reasons is 
to offer the greedy and disoriented Montenegrins the chance to 
spread to <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>. In this way they would be silenced -- 
they would not dare oppose the process of making <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> a 
Serbian province. They would perhaps not become a national 
minority, but a weak majority in their own state. The second 
reason reveals that the constructors of a greater-Serbia in 
<LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> have difficulties. If the Muslim-Croatian federation is 
accomplished, there are good chances that the territories along 
the <LOCATION>Drina River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Eastern Bosnia</LOCATION> will be annexed to it, 
regardless of the fact that they are ethnically clean now. If 
Serbs oppose the tripartite federation and if <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> enters two 
confederations, with <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, there is the 
possibility that Serbian territories in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> be divided into 
two separate parts. In this case, <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> would be 
connected with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> through <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> as a member state of 
the alliance of Serbian states. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>DPS</ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON>, keeps on denying 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> as a state. In the alliance of Serbian states, 
although its name might be <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, there is no place for 
Montenegrin individuality, there are no conditions to cherish 
the national, cultural, religious, and other authentic 
Montenegrin traditions. The <ORGANIZATION>Serbian Institute for the 
Protection of Monuments</ORGANIZATION> was given the task of renovating the 
Romanesque church of <ORGANIZATION>Sveti Luka</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION>. After the renovation 
the original dome without a square pedestal was turned into the 
<ORGANIZATION>Raska School</ORGANIZATION> type dome with a high square pedestal. This example 
illustrates how dull the (post)communist <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is. It also 
shows the Serbian attitude toward Montenegrin cultural heritage 
and its future in any union of Serbian states. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>DPS</ORGANIZATION> members who gave standing ovations to the university 
assistant from <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, should know that they are participants 
in the crime being committed against <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> on their behalf 
and with their own hands. 
  The fact that this is interpreted as the people's wish does 
not change the essence.

  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Mile Djukanovic</PERSON>, 
opening a two-day conference on the prospects of the 
shipbuilding, repair, and servicing industry in the <ORGANIZATION>Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> [FRY] organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Veljko Vlahovic 
Shipyard</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bijela</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, within the framework of this 
year's <ORGANIZATION>Mimosa Festival</ORGANIZATION>, spoke on the resources available to the 
Montenegrin maritime trade sector and on government measures to 
safeguard that industry under the conditions of sanctions. 
  <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said: "The following data speak about the 
significance and the prospects of the maritime trade industry of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>: a port cargo handling capacity of about five million 
tons, a repair capacity of 80 to 100 ships annually, a fleet 
consisting of 37 ships with about one million tons displacement, 
5,200 workers -- <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the total number of employed in 
the republic. Participation in maritime trade accounts for <PERCENT>17 
percent</PERCENT> of the GNP of the republic and <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of total 
foreign exchange income. 
  Projects planned for the development of maritime trade were 
halted with the introduction of sanctions by the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security 
Council</ORGANIZATION>. Sanctions did not affect any other sector of the 
economy to such a degree as they did maritime trade. They 
brought into question its very survival. Direct damage from the 
sanctions to the maritime trade enterprises of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has 
been assessed at <MONEY>$220 million</MONEY>. The republic government, together 
with the federal government, is undertaking measures to 
safeguard existing capacities during the sanctions, i.e., to 
activate them as successfully as possible after the sanctions 
are lifted. [passage omitted] 
  This is why, with the help of the federal government and the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$45 million</MONEY> have been earmarked for 
that purpose. These funds have saved the ships from 
foreclosure." [passage omitted]

<FÊP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Branko Jokic</PERSON>: "Business Is Business"] </F>
  [Text] (From our correspondent) <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 28 <DATE>January</DATE> -- 
According to an article published in the Novi Pazar magazine 
<LOCATION>SANDZAK</LOCATION>, Montenegrin and Albanian authorities concluded a secret 
agreement on the export of gasoline from <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, 
from where it is delivered to Pale [capital of the <LOCATION>Srpska</LOCATION> 
republic] to be used by the Bosnian Serb military. 
  According to the article, Montenegrin Albanians living along 
the Montenegrin-Albanian border are involved in the deals. Some 
of them have been licensed by the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Government</ORGANIZATION> to 
"import" gasoline. Gasoline, which costs one German mark per 
liter in the Albanian town of <LOCATION>Scutari</LOCATION>, is transported in large 
quantities across <LOCATION>Lake Skutari</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Army</ORGANIZATION> 
provides specially equipped boats. 
  The citizens of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> involved in this business earn 
one-half mark per liter. Almost all local residents participate 
in this trade (actually it is a state-sanctioned smuggling 
operation) because of the high earnings. <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and the 
<LOCATION>Srpska</LOCATION> republic are well supplied with gasoline. The <ORGANIZATION>Pizon 
Petrol Enterprise</ORGANIZATION>, owned by the former <ORGANIZATION>Crvena Zvezda</ORGANIZATION> soccer 
player <PERSON>Vladimir Petrovic Pizon</PERSON>, transports gasoline from <LOCATION>Lake 
Scutari</LOCATION> to Pale. 
  As reported, the Albanian authorities have recently 
tightened 
control over gasoline sales in <LOCATION>Scutari</LOCATION>, but it is a well-known 
secret that gasoline stations in <ORGANIZATION>Scutari</ORGANIZATION> work at full speed and 
sell almost half of all the gasoline sold in <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>. We are 
talking about very large quantities, knowing that last year 
Albanians registered several thousand vehicles that they had 
purchased at European junkyards. According to the article, Pale 
receives five to seven tanker-truck loads of Albanian gasoline 
each day. 
  In addition to <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION> is also accused of 
sanctions violations. At the border crossings near <LOCATION>Ohrid</LOCATION> and 
<PERSON>Rozaj</PERSON> (on the Macedonian-Albanian and Montenegrin-Albanian 
borders), aluminum is exported from <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and raw materials 
are imported for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> without hindrance. Heavy 
trucks and trailers wait for hours on both sides of the border 
crossings, which in the past were almost without traffic. 
  If all this is true, we could conclude that this type of 
border trade, uncontrolled by representatives of the 
international community, was agreed to by <PERSON>Momir Bulatovic</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Sali Berisha</PERSON> when the Montenegrin president visited <LOCATION>Tirana</LOCATION>. At 
the same time, Montenegrin Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON> paid a 
visit to <LOCATION>Skopje</LOCATION>. It is a fact that we can only guess now how 
<LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> benefits. Maybe it is alleviation of discontent in the 
western part of the country, where at least some hundred local 
residents are earning good incomes trafficking in gasoline.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>D. Becirovic</PERSON>: "Private Operators Are Ruining the </F>
Dinar"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 5 Apr -- Montenegrin Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo 
Djukanovic</PERSON> today invited bankers to <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> for a discussion 
of what is happening to the money supply, saying that disturbing 
problems have been arising in recent days after the favorable 
results in the first stage of stabilizing the monetary system. 
According to <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON>, these problems require urgent measures. 
He mentioned scalping, of which he said that the "participant 
banks" are not the only ones. Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Krunoslav Vukcevic</PERSON> asked the bankers to present their view of 
how the currency exchange business operates. He presented 
figures to the effect that by 4 <DATE>April</DATE> Montenegrin banks had 
purchased <MONEY>13.2 million German marks</MONEY> [DM]. When the sale of 
foreign exchange is taken into account, there was a positive 
result of about DM12 million. In view of the fact that the 
result for the entire country is DM300 million, the share of 
Montenegrin banking is not really at an enviable level in that 
amount. He also pointed to the phenomenon of scalping. <PERSON>Petar 
Vujovic</PERSON>, director of the Montenegrin branch of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Bank</ORGANIZATION>, mentioned other figures, saying that the purchases of 
foreign exchange in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> amounted to about DM26 million, 
but that banks in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> headquartered in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> are not 
turning over their entire purchases to the Montenegrin branch of 
the <ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "When we asked the <ORGANIZATION>Beobanka</ORGANIZATION> office about the purchases of 
foreign exchange, they told us that headquarters gave out the 
figures. Later they told us that they were not prohibited from 
giving out figures, but they could not provide them," <PERSON>Vujovic</PERSON> 
said. 
  <PERSON>Radmila Kalezic</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Jugobanka</LOCATION> manager in <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, stated 
categorically that her bank was not engaging in scalping. She 
said that the purchasing of foreign exchange had been good up 
until <DATE>10 days ago</DATE>, but since that time things had changed, and 
her bank had a deficit of DM397,000 in sales and purchases of 
foreign exchange. 
  "The tellers noticed that the same people are coming to buy 
foreign exchange again and again in the course of the day. Those 
who earlier purchased it on the street have now moved to the 
banks. It seems that private operators are not promptly turning 
in their cash receipts for the day," <PERSON>Kalezic</PERSON> said, calling for 
the government to monitor strictly the cash flow of private 
firms. 
  <PERSON>Milorad Lakovic</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Pljevaljska Bank</ORGANIZATION>, was also 
categorical about the private operators. He said that the 
dealers are working for the private operators and that the black 
market is already beginning to operate, and <PERSON>Cetkovic</PERSON>, the 
director of <LOCATION>Jugobanka</LOCATION> in Herceg-Novi, presented the figure that 
until a few days ago the ratio in the purchase and sale of 
foreign exchange was 4:1 to the advantage of the bank, but now 
that ratio is even. He said that the private sector is probably 
engaged in purchasing from farmers, so that the movement of the 
money is not being monitored, and certain new people are coming 
to bank windows and doing so several times a day. The bankers in 
<LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION> say that a check should be run on how people with a 
monthly salary of no more than 100 dinars can come several times 
a day and present 100 dinars to buy marks. When bank personnel 
notice this and offer another currency instead of marks, these 
people call for the assistance of the financial police, and the 
officials must then pay them. 
  It is obvious that scalping and the dealers are slowly 
becoming reality once again.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 6</DATE> (TANJUG) -- 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s ruling Democratic Party of Socialists ended its 
second congress in the capital <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> late on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
  The congress re-elected Montenegrin President <PERSON>Momir 
Bulatovic</PERSON> 
as president of the party. Closing the two-day gathering of 218 
delegates, <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> emphasised the importance of cherishing and 
promoting the state of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> which, together with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, 
forms <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, and said that nobody had the right to break 
these states. It is not in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s interest to form a 
state only with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, "our vital interests lie also in the 
direction of <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, and we have close historical and 
economic ties also with the Bosnian Serb republic and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Republic of Serb Krajina</ORGANIZATION> (R.S.K.)" said <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON>. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in <DATE>1991</DATE> by the local Serbs in 
those 
parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> 
where they are the majority population, in response to <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>'s 
violent secession from former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> and trampling on their 
rights. 
  In <DATE>1992</DATE>, local Serbs in the breakaway Yugoslav Republic of 
<LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, too, formed their Bosnian Serb republic in 
their ancestral ethnic lands. 
  Bulatovic said that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> was supporting and would 
continue to do so the struggle of the Serb people outside 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> for freedom, dignity and equality, but added that it 
would continue to oppose "the extreme nationalism which has 
grown root under the influence of civil war, radically 
confronted ideologies and narrow national interests." 
  He stressed that Moslems in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> must by no means be 
equated with the militant fundamentalists in the Bosnian Moslem 
leadership, and that the Albanians who advocate secessionism and 
violent methods of its achievement were few in the republic. 
  Bulatovic said that there must be no animosity towards 
Croats 
in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, because "we have never waged war on the Croatian 
people, but on the proponents of the extremist greater-national 
ideology" in <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>. 
  He said that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> had been the first to "suggest to a 
wondering <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> the idea of a normalisation of relations among 
the former Yugoslav republics," and that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> "has no 
reason for a confrontation with, for instance, <LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION> or 
<LOCATION>Slovenia</LOCATION>."

  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--We hope that the 
Yugoslav crisis is reaching its final stage, the stage of an 
antiwar and political outcome, Montenegrin Foreign Affairs 
Minister <PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON> told POBJEDA today. 
  He added that it would be logical to expect--following the 
agreement on the federal and confederal links between the 
Muslims and Croats that enables the Croats in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> to have 
state and institutional links with their mother 
country--something similar to be offered to the Serbs also so 
that they can link up with their natural homeland, <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. By 
taking such an approach, the international community, while in a 
way restoring <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>--that is, linking parts of that 
formerly complex country--wants to prevent the creation of an 
Islamic fundamentalist <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> and to secure natural links 
between identical peoples. 
  Asked whether <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ministry for Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION> will 
be disbanded, <PERSON>Lekic</PERSON> categorically said that the ministry was 
working as usual and that the termination of its work and 
existence was totally out of the question. [passage omitted]

  [Text] <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- British Foreign Secretary 
<PERSON>Douglas Hurd</PERSON> today received a Montenegrin delegation headed by 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON>. 
  The Montenegrin delegation was received this afternoon by 
<PERSON>Douglas Hogg</PERSON>, state minister at the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION>, and visited 
the <ORGANIZATION>British Council</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The Montenegrin delegation also includes Deputy Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Kruno Vukcevic</PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON>. 
  It has been learned from the delegation that the talks 
centred on the crisis in former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, especially the 
search for a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Hezcegovina. The hosts 
asked the Montenegrin delegation to convey their appeal to the 
Yugoslav side to help in the establishment of peace in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> by 
influencing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed 51:49 
territorial ratio. 
  According to <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> will do all it can 
to find a peaceful solution as soon as possible. 
  The hosts were also informed about the consequences of the 
international sanctions on the Montenegrin economy, and the 
government delegation requested <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s aid in opening a ferry 
line to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for humanitarian reasons, and to enable the 
blocked Montenegrin ships to return to their home ports. 
  The Montenegrin delegation will be meeting members of the 
British-Yugoslav group in the <LOCATION>British Parliament</LOCATION> tomorrow.

<FÊP=106> [Report by <ORGANIZATION>Lj</ORGANIZATION>. Mudresa: "Not in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s Interest"] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> -- It is certain that the international 
sanctions will remain in effect for some time. Therefore, the 
healthy part of the economy that can produce and sell its 
products must be stimulated. The new economic program for the 
revival of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> has been drafted 
by a team of experts and it would be good if the federal 
government shared the responsibility for the program's 
implementation. This was stated by <PERSON>Vojin Djukanovic</PERSON>, president 
of <ORGANIZATION>Economic Chamber of Montenegro</ORGANIZATION> at a meeting with businessmen 
and trade union leaders in <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> yesterday. 
  However, the majority of businessmen drew attention to a 
number of unknowns contained in the program. Slobodan Lekovic 
took the view that the elaborate program did not take into 
account the interests of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, above all, those in the 
maritime economy, tourism, and transportation infrastructure. 
"Relations between the two federal units -- <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> -- in their joint state of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> have not been 
presented fully and clearly," <PERSON>Lekovic</PERSON> said. 
  Dr. <PERSON>Janko Radulovic</PERSON> expressed the view that reaching a 
political consensus is a very important factor for the 
realization of the program. He stressed that the program must 
be accompanied by a number of operational and legal regulations, 
adding: "The program is more turned toward the Republic of 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and if it has any pretensions toward the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic</ORGANIZATION> 
of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, it must respect the specific characteristics of 
the Montenegrin economy more." 
  <PERSON>Danilo Popovic</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Confederation of 
Trade Unions</ORGANIZATION>, said that it was not questionable that we needed a 
program to solve the crisis, but expressed the doubt: "Who will 
pay for it if it fails. A large number of workers, pensioners, 
and disabled people, according to statistics, are paupers, 
because they are surviving on about <MONEY>10 German marks</MONEY> a month when 
it is known that the minimum amount of money needed to survive, 
according to international standards, is about 30 German marks a 
month. Trade unions will demand wages to be paid in a stable, 
convertible currency, or the new dinar, or in kind." <PERSON>Popovic</PERSON> 
said that the <ORGANIZATION>Confederation of Trade Unions</ORGANIZATION> would today 
officially inform the public about its objections to the 
program. This will also be done by the <ORGANIZATION>Economic Chamber of 
Montenegro</ORGANIZATION> in its assessment that will be sent to the federal 
government today.

<FÊP=106> [Report by R. Barjaktarevic: "<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> Is Not a Serbian </F>
State"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Pristina</LOCATION> -- "It is obvious that I cannot have a 
favorable opinion about any proposal that turns <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> into 
a region. This means that the proposal, which comes from 
<LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, that would lead to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> losing its statehood is 
unacceptable to us. The authors of such ideas and projects are 
mistaken, since Montenegrin statehood has been forged by the 
nation through burdensome history, and that is why the current 
Montenegrin generation has the moral duty to take a dignified 
patriotic stand toward such tendencies that are aimed at 
obstructing the revival of Montenegrin statehood. I regard as 
frivolous all the theories about a new constitution based on 
regionalization." 
  This is what Montenegrin Foreign Minister <PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON> said 
in an extensive interview for the <LOCATION>Pristina</LOCATION> ZERI. 
  Asked about the possibility of creating a union of Serbian 
states, which would also include <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lekic</PERSON> said: 
  "We are discussing ideas, thoughts. However, they not only 
have not been discussed and verified at the official state 
levels, but they have not even been defined. In any case, in 
connection with our position, that is, the <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s 
position, there are many open questions. As for an association, 
that is links between the Serb <LOCATION>Krajina</LOCATION> and the republic of 
<LOCATION>Srpska</LOCATION>, I can see some difficulties in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> participating 
in such a creation. To start with, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is not a Serbian 
state, but a state of the people who live in it, that is, a 
civil state." 
  The Montenegrin foreign minister said that there were "no 
secret connections between <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>," and he also 
said that relations with <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> were better since "whenever I 
travel abroad, I fly from the <LOCATION>Tirana</LOCATION> airport." As for <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>, 
he said: "The basic thing is to start a serious dialogue, but 
it is hard to say what kinds of solutions will be found. In any 
case, it would be best if the solutions were to reflect the will 
of all the citizens. I support certain rights for <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>, 
autonomy, certain subjectivity."

<FÊP=106> [Article by Luko Brailo: "<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> Without `Black Gold'"] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the power industry, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has 
demanded that the joint state function on the federal principle 
-- that is, that Yugoslav oil and petroleum products be divided 
between both republics according to their needs and not just 
given to one republic. Yugoslav oil practically belongs to just 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, as it is produced only in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> -- <LOCATION>Vojvodina</LOCATION> -- so all 
products have previously ended up exclusively in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. As the 
production in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> (in addition to stealing Croatian oil from 
<LOCATION>Djeletovci</LOCATION>) is considered Yugoslav in the federal balance of 
energy supply and consumption, the Montenegrins hold that this 
Yugoslav production must be divided as such. 
  "<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> did not get a single drop of oil or any other 
energy product from the federal balance of energy supply and 
consumption, so the Government of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has reiterated the 
demand for solving the problem, which was presented to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Executive Council</ORGANIZATION> a long time ago," said Montenegrin 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON>. <PERSON>Miodrag Gomilanovic</PERSON>, 
Montenegrin minister of power industry, says that the situation 
regarding oil and petroleum products threatens to block the 
economy and lives since all reserves on all levels have been 
exhausted. He added: "We demand joint criteria for the 
distribution of oil -- that is, a priority list. The so-called 
first priority group should have the same criteria for consumers 
in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>." 
<H5>  Petrol Stations Instead of Pillboxes </H5>
  It is obvious that the federal Yugoslav balance of energy 
supply and consumption exists only on paper and is applied 
solely to priority consumers in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> following the old saying: 
"Near is my shirt but nearer is my skin." In other words, all 
petroleum products in "the FRY [Federal Republic of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>]" 
are produced by the "Serbian Oil Industry of <LOCATION>Nis</LOCATION>" and it is all 
distributed to priority consumers, except for some symbolic 
amounts for free sale, by the republic (Serbian) emergency 
committee. The so-called federal committee is only informed 
about the amount that is to be divided by the Serbian republic 
committee. <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, therefore, requested (demanded) the 
right to buy a certain percentage of total production on the 
basis of former consumption ratio. 
  And while "the shirt and the skin" are not being treated as 
equal, <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION> "Jugopetrol" published the information according to 
which three metric tons of gasoline and eight tons of diesel are 
being delivered to the Montenegrin market daily, so that the 
present monthly balance of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> amounts to approximately 
100 tons of gasoline and 250 tons of diesel. However, priority 
consumers need about 300 tons of gasoline and 1,800 tons of 
diesel. 
  The amount needed is acquired on the black market under the 
auspices of the state. For example, it is an open secret that, 
at the Bozaj border crossing toward <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, Montenegrin customs 
officers charge one dinar per liter of gasoline to truck drivers 
whose trucks have additional, so-called expanded fuel tanks. 
Indeed, it is only done a couple of days each month, while 
"expanded fuel tanks" are usually tolerated the rest of the 
month. Otherwise, oil and gasoline are most often transported 
illegally by water, especially across <PERSON>Lake Skadar</PERSON>, which forms 
most of the borderline between <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>. Oil 
fever has spread to villages on both sides of the lake. In "the 
land of eagles," gas stations are being built along the borders, 
replacing the string of pillboxes. Researching those oil roads, 
correspondents of the Montenegrin independent weekly MONITOR 
found out that about 200 boats cross the imaginary borderline 
between <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> every day. The boats are used 
for smuggling everything from cigarettes to satellite dishes, 
but mostly for oil and gasoline. The profitability of the 
entire operation is substantiated by the following data: The 
Albanians are paid 0.7 German marks [DM] per liter of oil, which 
is later sold for DM1.2 -- the equivalent amount in <LOCATION>Avramovic</LOCATION>'s 
dinars. Consequently, the profit is about half a German mark 
per liter, but since the state takes <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of that, 
black-marketeers are left with about DM30 (dinars) per barrel. 
(It has become customary in these transactions to use standard 
"Skadar barrels," which contain 210 liters each.) In this case, 
a recently founded firm "Transport" of <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> presents a kind 
of authority, according to MONITOR, as it issues permits for 
black-marketing on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Just 
as every other official document, that permit has serial number, 
name, surname, and photograph of the person to which it is 
issued. Black-marketeers point out that, on the arrival to the 
Montenegrin side of the lake, they can only deliver oil to 
certain authorized persons, otherwise the permit "is gone." The 
permit means so much, among other reasons, because its holders 
enjoy the protection of both the police and the army. 
  The busiest spot on the Montenegrin side of <PERSON>Lake Skadar</PERSON> is 
at the "Plavnica" motel. The former favorite weekend resort of 
<LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> inhabitants, which, in the past couple of years, has 
been more frequently closed than open, has taken on a new life 
thanks to oil. The motel was leased for DM1,200 per month. The 
lessee rigged up a wharf and every cistern's approach to the 
so-called loading pad is charged DM200. Motel "Plavnica" also 
has an entertainment program featuring Russian strippers. As 
many as 10 cisterns with Serb and Bosnian license plates are 
filled up here every day. Some of them belong to a <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> 
firm "Pizon," whose owner is famous former soccer player for 
"Zvezda" [<LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> soccer team] <PERSON>Vladimir Petrovic Pizon</PERSON>. Oil is 
being smuggled on the <LOCATION>Bojana River</LOCATION>, which connects Lake Skadar 
with the sea, as well as in <LOCATION>Ulcinj</LOCATION>, by means of a specially 
designed raft cistern that is towed by boat along the sea border 
between <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>. 
<H5>  Plastic Tube at the Bottom of the <PERSON>Bojana </H5>
  However</PERSON>, the oil warehouse at <LOCATION>Plavnica</LOCATION> has recently burned 
down. Some five acres of land was burned then, two cisterns, 
several hundred tons of oil, a dozen cars, and two tractors were 
destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Soon after 
that, the Albanian police, in collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION>World 
Organization of Customs Officers</ORGANIZATION>, discovered a plastic tube at 
the bottom of the <LOCATION>Bojana River</LOCATION> that was used to carry oil from 
<LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Ulcinj</LOCATION> connection was also 
"unearthed." All those events, just as the recent confiscation 
of a tanker transporting oil for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, which was 
redirected to <LOCATION>Brindisi</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Western European Union</ORGANIZATION> 
forces, indicate that the "Skadar connection" is slowly running 
dry. Among others, the Albanian police have also been 
instructed by the international community and organizations that 
supervise the embargo imposed on "the FRY" to cover the entire 
area of Skadar and prevent further black-marketing of oil. It 
is an open secret that Montenegrin and Albanian black-marketeers 
have easily found a common ground in the business, and we must 
point out that every black-marketeer caught on the Albanian side 
had to pay a fine of DM10. 
  Those relations were soon strained as a result of the 
mentioned haggling over the federal balance of energy supply and 
consumption between <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, and there is no doubt 
that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> will be getting the worst of it for a while. 
And so, the <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> economic circles will again start working 
on "dividing Yugoslav petroleum products from <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>," but 
according to the already known principle. In other words, 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> should offer a certain amount of money to be used for 
research and production "of the very Yugoslav oil in <LOCATION>Vojvodina</LOCATION>." 
The thesis says that at least one part of the Montenegrin 
tourist pie will have to end up in the oil fields of <LOCATION>Vojvodina</LOCATION>, 
for it is senseless to demand federal rights without accepting 
federal obligations. Alleged equal status of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in the 
joint federal state is, therefore, still an ideal and the cry of 
<PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON>, one of the architects of "Zabljak Yugoslavia," 
[the meeting in <LOCATION>Zabljak</LOCATION> was held to confirm the preservation of 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>] does indeed seem grotesque. Oil problems are just 
the tip of the iceberg of the "joint" economy. The Serbian idea 
of a joint market is described by the case of importing 50,000 
tons of salt for the needs of <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. Meanwhile, there are more 
than 35,000 of tons of salt at the <LOCATION>Ulcinj</LOCATION> salt-works, so the 
amount of unsold salt threatens to have serious repercussions on 
the harvest this year.... In a nutshell, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is 
suffocating more and more every day.

acquiesced in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s request to intercede with the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.

  Although humanitarian goods are supposed to be exempt from

1992</DATE> for its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring 
<LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> sanctions committee has often been 
deliberately slow in issuing the necessary permits for the 
import of even the most essential articles, which are in 
extremely short supply because of the embargo, making life 
difficult both for the Yugoslavs and the 700,000 refugees 
accommodated in the country.

    [Editorial Report] South Slav media have been carrying 
reports that the Yugoslav military leadership has become 
increasingly worried about troop morale. Fewer and fewer 
soldiers are going to war voluntarily, and the authorities in 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> have had to resort to forceful 
mobilization of Serb refugees. Commenting on this issue in a 3 
<DATE>February</DATE> interview on <LOCATION>Sarajevo</LOCATION> radio, Bosnian President <PERSON>Alija 
Izetbegovic</PERSON> said that the Yugoslav military may be suffering a 
"shortage of manpower" and having problems with "the morale of 
that manpower." 
  In the 17 <DATE>March</DATE> issue of the <LOCATION>Ljubljana</LOCATION> daily DNEVNIK, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Slovene Press Agency</ORGANIZATION> [STA] reports that few conscripts are 
responding to call-ups in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Many of them obtain 
medical certificates attesting that they are physically 
incapable of serving in the armed forces. Quoting the <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> 
weekly LIBERAL, STA states that such false medical certificates 
are sold by draft officers at a high price, adding that many 
reservists prefer going to jail to enlisting for the "defense of 
the fatherland." According to the report, the military police 
are quite active, picking up draftees on the streets and 
delivering them to military barracks. 
  STA reports that the "action" is supposedly coordinated by 
Major <PERSON>Veselin Sljivancanin</PERSON>, a "man on the wanted list" and the 
"hero of <LOCATION>Vukovar</LOCATION>." As commander of the 5th Motorized Brigade of 
the <LOCATION>Podgorica Corps</LOCATION>, he is also in charge of all Montenegrin 
draft boards. According to "well-informed sources," he was sent 
from <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to "put military affairs in order 
and raise the morale of the military." "Other sources" claim 
that his assignment is to prevent the possible secession of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, if necessary 
by utilizing the "methods he employed in <LOCATION>Vukovar</LOCATION>." Examining his 
role in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, the 5 <DATE>November</DATE> issue of the <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> 
opposition weekly MONITOR concludes that <PERSON>Sljivancanin</PERSON>, "a lover 
of the Socialist Party of <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>" and a proven fighter for the 
"Serbian cause," had been sent to exert "federal" pressure on 
the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Government</ORGANIZATION>. Although he was allegedly received 
"cooly" by his immediate superior, General <PERSON>Milorad Obradovic</PERSON>, 
MONITOR reports, many people feel that <PERSON>Sljivancanin</PERSON> might remain 
in <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> permanently, while others believe that his 
assignment must be viewed as a "temporary solution" within the 
context of personnel changes in the <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Army</ORGANIZATION>.

<FÊP=106> [Interview with Montenegrin Foreign Minister <PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON> </F>
by <PERSON>Milovan Nedeljkov</PERSON>; place and date not given: "We Are Not a 
Part of Small or Greater <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>"] 
  [Text] One of the "most difficult" politicians for extreme 
Serb nationalists in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, and very often also for the Serb 
authorities, is the "naughty boy" of Montenegrin politics, 
<PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Although 
official <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> has never publicly complained about the work 
of the Montenegrin foreign minister, they have long been trying 
to force <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> to relinquish that ministry and <PERSON>Lekic</PERSON>'s 
ministerial function. Most serious accusations come from 
<PERSON>Seselj</PERSON>'s radical, who say the young minister (born in <DATE>1947</DATE>) 
intends to separate <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and lead it into the 
protection of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION>. He is being reproached for 
having indirectly caused the flogging of Serb tourists in 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> with his statement that "<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is not a Serb 
state." 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> announces the "revitalization" of Yugo- 
diplomacy. Has that anything to do with the abolition of your 
ministry, i.e. your appointment as <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>'s ambassador to 
<LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>? 
  [<PERSON>Lekic</PERSON>] The revitalization, as you called it, of Yugo- 
diplomacy is not connected to the abolition of the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION>. Things are quite clear -- that 
ministry is based in history and in the Constitution, which is 
more important than occasional attempts to abolish it. This 
important element of Montenegrin sovereignty, realized in 
history in <DATE>1878</DATE>, cannot depend on one man alone. I am going 
nowhere, but even if I were, it could only happen after my 
successor is chosen at the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION>. If I 
were to go to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, I would not be the ambassador of <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, 
but of both <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] As the foreign minister of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, during 
diplomatic missions, have you ever met diplomats from former 
Yugoslav republics? What were those meetings like, if there 
were any? 
  [Lekic] Unfortunately, I met none. I am not avoiding such 
meetings. I believe there will be more such meetings with 
gradual normalization of relations between the republics of 
former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] You once said that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has "objective 
needs to communicate with the world," and that that is the 
reason for not abolishing the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs</ORGANIZATION>. Does that mean that "your" ministry, contrary to the 
general belief in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> and other former Yugo-republics, is 
not just following orders coming from <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>? 
  [Lekic] It is obvious that the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION> is not obeying orders from <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>. As a 
departmental organ, the ministry is working on the basis of 
program politics of the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] How do you feel about the national problem. 
Some people from <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> accuse you of betraying the Serb 
national interest. 
  [Lekic] I am a Montenegrin. I am working to help <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
overcome this difficult and tragic crisis of the collapse of 
former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> as painlessly as possible. Since I returned 
from <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>, where I was ambassador of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, 
two years ago, I have been working to preserve the interest and 
reputation of our republic, at the expense of no one. 
  [Nedeljkov] You have recently stated that "<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is not 
a Serb state" and that provoked powerful reaction in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Lekic</ORGANIZATION>] <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> belongs to its citizens, for its 
Constitution defines it as a civic state, not as a national 
state. If we apply national criteria, then it is a Montenegrin 
state, for the Montenegrins are the most numerous nation in 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. However, it is primarily characterized, politically 
speaking, as a civic and democratic state community. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] Can <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> become a member of the union of 
Serb states, which many political forces in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> have been 
announcing? 
  [<PERSON>Lekic</PERSON>] The Montenegrins are a sovereign and politically 
mature nation, so it will be the only factor deciding about 
historic road of the oldest Slavic state in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] <LOCATION>Should Montenegro</LOCATION> be a part of a greater 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>? 
  [Lekic] <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> cannot be a part of small or greater 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>; it is a state that can join a broader community on an 
equal level. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] Is the FRY [Federal Republic of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>] a 
democratic, peace-loving federation of two equal states? 
  [Lekic] Being surrounded by war, suffering under economic 
sanctions, it is difficult to achieve the ideals of democracy, 
federalism, and other societal values to the full. There are 
tendencies, certain results, and for true political, economic, 
and cultural emancipation, we must have more favorable general 
conditions, primarily lifting the economic sanctions imposed by 
the international community. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] The statement by the advisor to the <ORGANIZATION>Office of 
Croatia</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Bilandzic</PERSON>, that <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> could open a 
consulate in <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, was interpreted as a direct attack on 
the sovereignty of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>. What do you say about that? 
  [Lekic] I do not consider that statement an attack on the 
sovereignty of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>. That is not a new idea and it is worthy 
of being considered and discussed. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] Does <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> have a dual foreign politics 
with regard to the so called "western Serbian countries" and 
Prevlaka? 
  [Lekic] I do not see a connection between the problem of 
Prevlaka and, as you said, western Serbian countries. The 
uninhabited peninsula of <LOCATION>Prevlaka</LOCATION>, with several hundreds of 
meters of rocky ground, makes a logical whole of the <LOCATION>Bay of Boka 
Kotorska</LOCATION>. Always in history, ever since the time of the 
Venetians, these areas were governed by the rule that those who 
had <LOCATION>Boka Kotorska</LOCATION> also controlled Prevlaka. In case of the 
opposite, the narrow bay becomes a joint property, waters in 
that part of the bay are territorial and international, and that 
may lead to incidents which, I believe, are neither in the 
interest of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> or our side. I, therefore, expect that a 
just solution will be found in the final peace agreement. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] <LOCATION>Prevlaka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, the Republic of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>. 
What is the role of <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> in that? 
  [Lekic] Our institutional connections with the other federal 
unit show that the entire federation is interested in solving 
the problem of Prevlaka. We must point out that Prevlaka is a 
favorite subject of the extremists, who, though they do not 
quite know where it is exactly, think it should be turned into 
casus belli. Potential instrumentalization of Prevlaka for 
military purposes is another reason to join forces to solve this 
problem in a rational manner. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nedeljkov</ORGANIZATION>] Do you believe in future close links between 
former Yugo-republics? 
  [<PERSON>Lekic</PERSON>] All republics of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> are logically 
connected to a point. <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> with a strong, sometimes even 
illusionist Yugoslav feeling, has real and potential connections 
with former Yugoslav republics. No republic of former 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> has gone to the moon; rather, we are still neighbors. 
We all have two choices: to take the road of constant conflict 
or that of cooperation. There is no third way. We think that, 
in spite of great differences that were created, we must try to 
establish, first bearable relations and then, as much as 
possible, restore road, economic, and other connections which 
were decades in the making, while we were living together. Of 
course, the beginning of the process requires respect for new 
state entities created on the territory of former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>.

<FÊP=106> [Unattributed article: "No Chance of Survival"] </F>
  [Text] A reporter for the Austrian economics journal 
INTERNATIONALE WIRTSCHAFT wrote in an article titled "Heroes Are 
Tired": <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> is committing slow suicide and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is 
dying with it. She describes the hopeless state of the 
Montenegrin economy. The author claims that, objectively 
speaking, the industry of the most loyal Serbian ally has no 
chance of survival following the dissolution of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>. It 
not only lacks raw materials, it has been left without a market. 
The Montenegrin economy used to rest on three pillars -- its 
main sources of foreign currency: production of aluminum, 
maritime transport, and tourism. Before the war in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s merchant marine earned <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY>, as much as 
tourism. Sales of aluminum accounted for <MONEY>$155 million</MONEY>. All three 
economic sectors are virtually in ruins today. 
  The Montenegrin economy did not fare badly at the end of the 
<DATE>1980</DATE>'s. The former Yugoslav republic produced <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>'s quality steel and <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of its aluminum. Of 
course, the aluminum combine in <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> as well as the iron 
works in Niksic have been operating at a loss in recent years. 
According to an assessment by an independent economist, <PERSON>Branko 
Vujosevic</PERSON>, they may be operating at only 20-percent capacity 
but, fearing labor unrest, the political leadership is afraid to 
close them. 
  The second pillar of the Montenegrin economy was the 
maritime 
industry. <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> had the largest concentration of ships per 
capita in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Following the imposition of sanctions, most of 
them are now anchored. Tourism, which had the best chance of 
developing in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, has also been damaged by sanctions. 
Since <DATE>1991</DATE> there have been no foreign tourists, while before the 
war they accounted for 35 to <MONEY>45 percents</MONEY> of all overnight 
guests. Montenegrins must now be content with Serbian and 
domestic guests. Macedonian tourists are counted as foreign 
guests although they do not bring foreign currency. 
  Since the introduction of <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> sanctions against rump 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, the Montenegrin food supply has depended entirely on 
Serbian good will. This was apparent last fall when trucks 
loaded with needed foodstuffs were not allowed to cross the 
Serbian-Montenegrin border at <LOCATION>Prijepolje</LOCATION>. The Serbian 
authorities suddenly demanded special permits. This internal 
trade embargo against the small Serbian partner was meant to be 
a disciplinary measure to preclude any thought of independence. 
  <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> -- like <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> -- has horribly high inflation, 
and 
humble protests [against sanctions] by the leadership that 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is an innocent victim are to no avail. The only thing 
that is still adequate in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is the supply of 
electricity, but this is also supposed to change thanks to the 
rapprochement between Croats and Serbs. It is supposed to be 
exported to <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> for foreign currency.

<FÊP=106> ["B.I.M."-attributed report: "Seselj Threatens Muslims and </F>
Montenegrins"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> -- "Where are those who threatened me not 
to come to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>?" <PERSON>Dr. Vojislav Seselj</PERSON> asked the members of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian Radical Party</ORGANIZATION> [SRS] and its sympathizers, who 
gathered to hail their leader on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. To support 
his claim that there are no obstacles for him in "Serbian 
Montenegro," the leader of the Serbian Radicals quoted his visit 
to Plav, which is mainly inhabited by Muslims. "I strolled 
through Plav yesterday, and nobody dared utter a word," boasted 
<PERSON>Seselj</PERSON> who was received in the Budo Tomovic youth hall in 
<LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> with chants <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>! <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>! and well-known Chetnik 
songs (Who is the second, I am the first to drink Turkish blood). 
  Seselj spoke mostly about the progress that has been made in 
the creation of a greater <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, calling on the Muslims and the 
Croats in the Republic of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> to "accept the peace on the 
front lines as this is the most fair. If they do not want this, 
the Serbs will conquer even those territories that they lost 
because of the betrayal by the former Yugoslav Peoples' <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>." 
For this reason, the Serbs have lost <LOCATION>Dubrovnik</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Zadar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sibenik</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Karlovac</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virovitica</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Osijek</LOCATION> ("all Serbian towns"), however, 
"one must be realistic" now and form a unified Serbian state 
with one parliament and one president on the territories that 
the Serbs "have managed to liberate." 
  "The <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> is a sword hanging over the heads of enemies of the 
Serbs," <PERSON>Seselj</PERSON> stated and added that "the Muslims in <LOCATION>Sandzak</LOCATION> are 
preparing for an uprising," however "let them, as several tens 
of thousands of <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> members and the Serbian Chetnik movement 
members are ready to go to these territories at any moment to 
prevent the fragmentation of the Serbian lands." The revenge 
will be bloody and there will be no mercy, <PERSON>Seselj</PERSON> added. 
  <PERSON>Dr. Seselj</PERSON> also reviewed the efforts of individual 
Montenegrin parties (the Liberal Alliance of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>) to separate <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> from the Serbian 
lands, which he described as "the betrayal of Serbianhood by 
foreign mercenaries," who would not have entered the Assembly 
had the Albanians, the Muslims and the Catholics in <LOCATION>Boka 
Kotorska</LOCATION> not voted for them.

    [Editorial Report] Three articles in two recent issues of 
the <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> weekly VREME discuss the public admission by <PERSON>Nikola 
Pejakovic</PERSON>, Montenegrin minister of internal affairs, that Serb 
and Muslim refugees from <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> had been deported 
from <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to Serbian-held territory in <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>. 
  VREME's 4 <DATE>April</DATE> issue published a letter dated 18 <DATE>September 
1992</DATE> written by <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON> in response to an inquiry by <PERSON>Daniela 
Stupar-Titoric</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>- <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> refugee in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, 
about the fate of her husband. In the letter <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON> admitted 
to Stupar-Titoric that her husband, <PERSON>Alemko Titoric</PERSON>, from <LOCATION>Novo 
Sarajevo</LOCATION>, had been arrested in <LOCATION>Herceg Novi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, on 26 
<DATE>May 1992</DATE> together with 34 other persons, and, at the request of 
the republic of Srpska [RS], the self-proclaimed Serb state in 
<LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, handed over to <ORGANIZATION>Srebrenica Secretariat of 
Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> [SUP] officials, who in turn handed the 
refugees over to Bosnian Muslim military police at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Territorial Defense</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Bratunac</LOCATION> in exchange for RS 
prisoners. Pejakovic stated in the letter that he had no other 
information on the fate of the deported individuals. 
  The 11 <DATE>April</DATE> issue of VREME contended that <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON>'s 
letter 
finally confirmed the suspicions of the Montenegrin opposition 
that what is at issue are "acts that have the character of war 
crimes against a civilian population." The weekly noted that 
opposition delegates in the Montenegrin Assembly had been 
demanding an investigation of the deportation of refugees since 
the "<DATE>first half of 1992</DATE>." These demands contributed to the 
"satanization" of the opposition in the Montenegrin press, VREME 
said, adding that the press viewed the arrested individuals as 
"Alija's fighters and perpetrators of diversionary tactics" who 
"came to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> disguised as refugees" intending to "provoke 
a war in this area." In talks with opposition party delegations, 
however, Montenegrin President <PERSON>Momir Bulatovic</PERSON> gave his 
assurance that the deportation of refugees would cease and that 
each case would be investigated, VREME reported, adding that a 
parliamentary commission had been formed to conduct an 
investigation. VREME listed the names of 85 ethnic Muslim and 
Serb deportees who it said were identified by <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON> in his 
<DATE>April 1993</DATE> official response to the parliamentary commission. 
According to the information provided by <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON>, groups of 
refugees were turned over to the republic of <LOCATION>Srpska</LOCATION> on 19, 24, 
25, and 27 <DATE>May 1992</DATE>. 
  The same issue of VREME criticized the deportation of 
refugees and cited a statement by <PERSON>Nebojsa Vucinic</PERSON>, professor at 
the law faculty of the university in <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, that "what is at 
issue is the violation of the Convention on the Status of 
Refugees, which <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> signed and ratified.... The basic 
right of refugees is that they not be returned to the state from 
which they escaped and in which their lives are in danger.... 
The basic duty of a state is to offer protection to the 
refugees, and if someone among them has committed a war crime or 
a crime against humanity, he is to answer before a regular court 
and through regular court proceedings." 
  VREME also quoted <PERSON>Stevan Lilic</PERSON>, professor of constitutional 
law at <ORGANIZATION>Belgrade University</ORGANIZATION>, who viewed <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON>'s letter to 
<PERSON>Daniela Stupar-Titoric</PERSON> as "proof of the clinical death of a 
legal state." Lilic stated that the police violated both the 
Constitution of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and the Constitution and Criminal 
Code of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> [FRY]. He cited 
Article 23 of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY Constitution</ORGANIZATION>, which maintains that no one 
should be deprived of freedom except persons who have committed 
criminal acts; Article 154 of the Criminal Code of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, 
which calls for a five-year prison sentence for persons who 
violate human rights on the basis of ethnic, racial, or other 
differences; and Article 142 of the Code, according to which the 
taking of hostages is considered a war crime. Lilic asked: "Is 
the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Ministry of Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> in the service of 
the republic of <LOCATION>Srpska</LOCATION>, and is <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> conducting on its 
territory a manhunt for people of another state and on behalf of 
that state? Thus, a state is violating its own constitution in 
order to do a service for another state.... This act is not only 
unconstitutional, it is totally immoral." 
  VREME maintains that <PERSON>Pejakovic</PERSON>'s "cool public admission" of 
the deportation amounts to an attempt to institutionalize 
lawlessness and to proclaim the manhunt for refugees a normal 
police procedure. Thus, the weekly concludes, this kind of 
lawlessness could be repeated again and again.

  [Editorial Report] The 20 <DATE>February</DATE> edition of the <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> 
daily POLITIKA, on page 9, attacks an article that appeared in 
the <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, daily POBJEDA "the day before

<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>. POLITIKA states that the POBJEDA 
article's author, <PERSON>Dragan Hajdukovic</PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, 
is remembered for his pamphlets, published in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, 
calling for "the bombing of <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>" and requesting the 
"imposition of sanctions against his own country." Now he "makes 
an appearance in the domestic press," and, "at a time of paper 
shortages," publishes on "two entire pages" of POBJEDA a 
political program for the "renewal of the Montenegrin state," 
instructing the Montenegrin people "to secede from <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>." 
Hajdukovic disregards the fact that the large majority of the 
inhabitants of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> declared themselves in favor of a 
joint state, POLITIKA remarks, adding that the editorial staff 
of POBJEDA has already disassociated itself from the article, 
calling it a "glaring error."

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Dragan Djuric</PERSON>: "False Hopes"] </F>
  [Text] They have already begun to beat the band about the 
success of the second phase of the <PERSON>Avramovic</PERSON> 
program--invigoration of production. The key argument used is 
the figure of no less than a 21.3-percent increase in Yugoslav 
output between <DATE>February</DATE> and <DATE>March</DATE>. 
  In <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, however, the "first successful results" are 
proving to be a pure illusion. That is, whereas in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> the 
<DATE>March</DATE> level of output really was <PERCENT>22.6 percent</PERCENT> higher than in 
<DATE>February</DATE>, the Montenegrin economy is continuing to record a drop 
of about <PERCENT>6.5 percent</PERCENT>. 
  The program for the country's monetary reform and economic 
recovery, recalls <PERSON>Miodrag Causevic</PERSON>, vice president of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, was commissioned as a project 
by the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian Government</ORGANIZATION> and the president of the Republic of 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, and only later, on grounds that it was the best of all 
the stabilization programs that have been requested, was it 
submitted to the federal government and almost thrust upon it. 
Even Prime Minister <PERSON>Kontic</PERSON> did not immediately accept it with 
open arms, while the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Government</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Causevic</PERSON> recalls, 
made a number of objections, suggestions, and warnings. On the 
so-called team of some 40 experts headed by <PERSON>Dr. Avramovic</PERSON>, there 
was only one man from <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>--<PERSON>Dr. Janko Radulovic</PERSON>, secretary 
of the republic <ORGANIZATION>Secretariat for Development</ORGANIZATION>. The objections of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> pertained above all to the need to 
respect specific structural needs and interests of the 
Montenegrin economy, which had no place in the Avramovic 
program. In that connection, they particularly accentuated the 
problems of the maritime industry and tourism. 
  "The main reasons why the Montenegrin economy has not felt 
more essentially the favorable aspects of the functioning of the 
Avramovic program up to this point," <PERSON>Causevic</PERSON> says, "lie in its 
more pronounced dependence on exports and the dominant role of 
the heavy industrial sectors." 
  The best example of the impotence of any measures of an 
internal nature is offered by the situation in maritime 
shipping. In the best of times, this industry brought <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
about one-fifth of its total inflow of foreign exchange. Its 
importance to this republic can also be seen from the fact that 
if <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> were viewed as an independent state, it would be 
the strongest maritime power in the world if the size of its 
maritime fleet were compared to the size of the country! Today, 
its fleet of 38 vessels, with a total capacity of almost 1 
million metric tons, is tied up and captive, with immense daily 
costs, which are becoming more and more difficult to cover. 
  <PERSON>Radomir Mugosa</PERSON>, secretary of the general association of the 
maritime industry in the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, points 
out that two companies--Jugooceania of <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION> and Prekookeanska 
plovidba of Bar--although before adoption of Resolution No. 820 
they were registered under a foreign flag, were literally caught 
in the mousetrap of the sanctions. Not a single vessel is 
sailing, some have been anchored by the banks as a guarantee for 
collection of debts, others are tied up at the dock under the 
pressure of the sanctions, while almost half of the fleet "hid" 
in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, which it dares not leave. 
  Last year, these companies had to sell four vessels in order 
to cover current costs. At the same time, the empty docks in the 
port of Bar, with a capacity for handling almost five million 
tons of cargo a year, and the shipyards in <LOCATION>Bijela</LOCATION>, which can 
repair about 100 vessels a year, are gloomy. One part of the 
port has been taken over by the fleet of the <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Navy</ORGANIZATION>, and 
the launches with which the Italians are carrying on a smuggling 
operation (mainly tobacco) with <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> are repaired from 
time to time in the shipyard. And that is all. 
  There is no chance at all, <PERSON>Mugosa</PERSON> explains, for this branch 
of the economy, which has immense importance to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, to 
get on its feet unless the sanctions are removed. 
  The electric power industry, which has a share of <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> 
in total Montenegrin output, coal production, which accounts for 
<PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of output, and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, 
that is, the <ORGANIZATION>Niksic Steel Mill</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> Aluminum 
Combine, whose share is greater than <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>, are also 
suffering great troubles. In the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Chamber of 
Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, they point out that the Avramovic program helps these 
industries only indirectly and that some growth of production 
might be expected only if small alternative production programs 
are started, using unsuccessful capacity that already exists. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Podgorica Aluminum Combine</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has managed to 
maintain production at about <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of capacity, while at 
the heart of the combine, the electrolysis operation is 
operating at only one-fifth of capacity. The value of the 
aluminum produced and held in inventory is estimated at about 
<MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>. The need for alkalies, resins, and petroleum coke 
(all imported) is so great that it is almost impossible to 
obtain them through the usual smuggling channels. What is more, 
there is also some doubt about obtaining alumina from <LOCATION>Zvornik</LOCATION> 
the because of exceptional increase in shipping costs since 
adoption of the new dinar. If we include in this survey Obod of 
<LOCATION>Cetinje</LOCATION>, which is operating at about <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of capacity and 
importing all of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of components for production, then 
we get a clearer idea of what it means to say "dependence of the 
economy on imports," and therefore the significance of isolation. 
  Increasingly frequent charges are also coming from the 
largest Montenegrin firm to the effect that instead of 
cooperation in carrying out programs for economic recovery, they 
are encountering disloyal competition on the part of firms in 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. For instance, at the <ORGANIZATION>Niksic Steel Mill</ORGANIZATION> they say that 
firms from <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> are importing more and more steel on the basis 
of various compensation deals, although the Niksic collective 
has on inventory more than 13,000 tons of various types of 
quality steels. At the same time, scrap iron is being exported 
from <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> more and more, although <ORGANIZATION>Niksic</ORGANIZATION> is shutting down more 
and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time. 
  <PERSON>Anton Kastrati</PERSON>, director of the salt plant at <LOCATION>Ulcinj</LOCATION>, 
explicitly accuses <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> of importing 50,000 tons of salt in 
violation of a contract and thus jeopardizing this year's salt 
production. And the warehouses are full. 
  At <ORGANIZATION>Jugopetrol</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION> they also have objections. It is 
extremely difficult to obtain fuel abroad, and it is not 
uncommon for it to cost sixfold more than it would have 
otherwise. Customs duties are added to that, so that intolerably 
high fuel costs are being imposed on the economy. It is as 
though Yugoslav sources of petroleum do not exist for 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Recently, none other than Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo 
Djukanovic</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> was not getting even a drop from 
domestic production. 
  All in all, the Montenegrin economy is on its knees. For 
years now, its production has been dropping faster and faster 
and farther and farther. If the <DATE>1992</DATE> level of output is taken as 
the basis of comparison, then what was achieved in the 
relatively peaceful year of prewar <DATE>1989</DATE> would stand at 76, and 
<DATE>last year</DATE>'s results at minus 60. The level of output at the 
moment, compared to <DATE>March of last year</DATE>, which was disastrous, is 
down about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>. To be sure, the statistics show that some 
industries with a total share of less than some <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> in 
output have nevertheless come to life. 
  In spite of <ORGANIZATION>Avramovic</ORGANIZATION>'s optimism, the Montenegrins are 
worried about how to keep production from dying altogether.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 7</DATE> (AFP) -- The only 
road link between <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has been closed to 
traffic for five days, a local daily reported <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. The 
Albanian authorities have forbidden any vehicles from crossing 
into or out of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> -- which together with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> forms 
rump-Yugoslavia -- at <LOCATION>Bozaj</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Lazar Jankovic</PERSON>, spokesman for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Commission for Border Incidents</ORGANIZATION>, quoted <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by 
the local daily POBJEDA. The road is open to pedestrians. 
  The Albanian authorties apparently took the action after 
Albanian truck drivers had blocked the border because, <PERSON>Jankovic</PERSON> 
said, they were "unhappy at the changing criteria imposed by 
Yugoslav customs officials." Since a total embargo was imposed 
on <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> two years ago, the Bozaj border-control post has 
become the focus of traffic in oil and other supplies for the 
Yugoslav market. Several Montenegrins were arrested recently by 
Albanians for trafficking oil, according to rumours which 
Montengrin authorities refuse to confirm. 
  PJOBEDA said it had learnt from unoffical sources that six 
policemen and a Montenegrin customs officer were being 
questioned for their role in the trafficking.

<FÊP=106> [Interview with <PERSON>Slavko Perovic</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Liberal </F>
Alliance of Montenegro</ORGANIZATION>, by <PERSON>Marko Vukovic</PERSON>; place and date not 
given: "Anschluss of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>"] 
  [Text] <PERSON>Momir Bulatovic</PERSON>, president of the republic, 
furnished the topic for the interview of the president of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Liberal Alliance</ORGANIZATION> [LSCG] when he hinted at a union of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
with <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>. The increasingly frequent demands to ban the 
LSCG and <ORGANIZATION>SDP</ORGANIZATION> [Social Democratic Party] [as published] made by 
certain members of assemblies of northern Montenegrin opstinas 
were of equal interest. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Vukovic</ORGANIZATION>] What would union with <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> mean for 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in the sense of its status as a state and to 
Montenegrins from the nationality standpoint? 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] It is not a question of any union with 
<LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>. 
It is a question of annexation or, if you like, Anschluss, of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, so that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> would forever, 
according to the conception of the Serbian expansionists, be 
part and parcel of the future maxi, midi, or mini <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. So, 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> must at any price be included in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. Because of 
its coast from the geostrategic standpoint, because of its 
history, which, using the formula of the Montenegrins as the 
purest Serbs, as a people of Serbian origin, and so on, rounds 
out, according to the Serbs, the overwhelming truth not only of 
the five centuries of enslavement, but also, as far as the 
church is concerned, of collaboration with the Turks. When 
things are taken to their ultimate consequences, we learn that 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is the backbone, but also the Achilles heel, of the 
Serbian expansionist project. <PERSON>Nikolaj Velimirovic</PERSON> put it this 
way: "Serbism without <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is like a body without bones." 
So, following a de facto annexation, the Montenegrins would very 
quickly be presented a demand to become Serbs, since, as 
President <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> threatened with the authority of his 
authoritarian state, the Montenegrins are of Serb origin, so 
that it is truly illogical, when they are of Serb origin, for 
them not to be Serbs today, but Montenegrins, a Comintern 
nationality invented somewhere else. In any case, when it 
becomes part of <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, a major change occurs in the ethnic 
structure to the advantage of Serbs, who will then vote for 
regionalization of the future unitary Serbian state, in which 
nothing would be left of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> but the folklore. So, this 
is a betrayal of the national interests of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>.... 
  [Vukovic] One gets the impression that the development of 
events in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>, I am referring above all to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
initiative to create a Muslim-Croat federation, which would then 
enter into a confederation with the Republic of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION>, could 
favor the suggested integration. 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] It is my impression that the Americans and 
Russians 
have taken over Bosnian territory. The Russian side, make no 
mistake about it, is cooperating with the Americans. It is 
merely helping <PERSON>Milosevic</PERSON> and Karadzic to celebrate every defeat 
they experience, in keeping with Serbian tradition. The entire 
world saw <ORGANIZATION>Karadzic</ORGANIZATION>'s celebration after withdrawal under the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> 
threat. And it is clear on this occasion that if <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> had not 
made the request, <PERSON>Karadzic</PERSON> and Mladic would have given <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> a 
kick in the rear. It is my belief that <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> will be buttoned 
up, that the confederation will turn out to have been only a 
lure to join the negotiations. I am convinced that Bulatovic 
"fired off" <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> only in order to throw out a new bone 
for this unhappy people to gnaw on, a trick to make it forget 
the fact that it is imprisoned and that this was done to it by 
the Montenegrin-Herzegovinian-Serbian separatists, who have made 
of it their own reservation on which, so they hope, they will be 
the chiefs for a long time yet.... 
  [Vukovic] Many refer to <PERSON>Mr. Bulatovic</PERSON>'s statement as an open 
claim to territory of neighboring <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, which 
has been internationally recognized. How do you assess the 
effect of that act on the attitude of the international 
community towards <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>? 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] The idea of union with <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION> has the 
additional goal of destroying any thought of any Montenegrin 
position in foreign policy. Bulatovic's move subjects <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
to a defeat and mockery in the international arena and will 
contribute to its being globally satanized once again. This is 
all being done intentionally in order to destroy <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. The 
result is the same as achieved at one time by <LOCATION>Prevlaka</LOCATION>, then 
<LOCATION>Dubrovnik</LOCATION>, then Zhirinovsky.... This question should be put to 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, since the ministry still has not 
spoken out, which might be interpreted as support for the views 
of Bulatovic and <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON>; otherwise, the moral thing to do is 
resign. 
  [Vukovic] Do you believe the idea of creating the Republic 
of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, as they say it would be called, was 
conceived in the head of President Bulatovic? 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vucurovic</PERSON> are excellent friends, and 
they are both entirely devoted to Slobodan. It is clear than an 
idea like this could not have been conceived in the heads of 
those two, since they are not here to create, but to execute. 
The idea is <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>'s, the execution is <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>'s, just as 
<DATE>January 1989</DATE> established. If things take that course, the idea 
is strategic in the sense that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is killed off for good 
within the framework of some alliance of Serbian states, 
countries, cantons, or whatever they might be. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Vukovic</ORGANIZATION>] How would the LSCG react if a referendum were 
called for unification of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>? 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] That referendum, if it should come about, will be 
carried out under the same conditions as the recent referendum 
on annexation of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>. We boycotted that 
referendum, we would boycott this one as well. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Vukovic</ORGANIZATION>] What impact would that event have on interethnic 
relations in the republic? 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] It would heat them to the glowing point. There 
would be no place in this state for Montenegrins, Muslims, 
Albanians, and the few Croats who have remained in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
At the same time, I think that the Montenegrins would be in the 
worst position, since the other groupings would be protected by 
the international community, but it will not protect us, since, 
as <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> says, we are of Serb origin, that is, Serbs. In 
that scenario even the Serbs in the People's Party will be 
undesirable, since the entire project was conceived as an act of 
destroying <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s statehood, so that the question of the 
sea would be solved for the Serbian side once and for all. The 
existence of a state bothers them, since that is the means by 
which the sea is kept out of their complete control, regardless 
of whether it is a Serbian or Montenegrin state. And that is the 
only reason why <PERSON>Seselj</PERSON> and his office were set up in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
and that is why even <PERSON>Kilibarda</PERSON> is a traitor from their 
standpoint. 
  [Vukovic] Now that we have touched upon the topic of 
interethnic relations, which it seems have been additionally 
strained by the arrests of the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>SDA</ORGANIZATION> [Democratic 
Action Party], we should note that there have been more frequent 
demands to ban the LSCG and the <ORGANIZATION>SDA</ORGANIZATION>! 
  [<LOCATION>Perovic</LOCATION>] We are precise in our views, and they expose the 
Serbian expansionist project, which ultimately, or even above 
all, is disastrous for the Serbian people itself. We get in the 
way, since we are a party of the authentic liberal democratic 
option, that is, of the civil option; we further our objectives 
exclusively by democratic means, which even the world at large 
has recognized through my foreign political contacts, and has 
supported us in this. That is why we are an embarrassing 
opponent, that is why they need to ban us, not only because of 
our objective, an independent <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, but because of the 
truth that we convey and communicate unashamedly. All the 
groupings in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> have been armed by the government -- 
either directly or under its tranquil eye. Those who were naive 
took the weapons, not realizing that weapons could not solve 
anything, since this is not <DATE>1784</DATE>, but <DATE>1994</DATE>. Those weapons have 
turned into a trap for those who accepted them, and the 
government will take advantage of this regardless of the 
religious, ethnic or other allegiance of those who possess them, 
since political accounts are settled with arrests like the 
arrest of the <ORGANIZATION>SDA</ORGANIZATION>, using the form of protecting the public 
order. Someone decided the Muslims need to be intimidated once 
again, perhaps pushed once again in the direction of Bulatovic, 
who mentioned them in such mellifluous terms at the recent 
congress of the <ORGANIZATION>DPS</ORGANIZATION> [Democratic Party of Socialists]. Perhaps an 
election is being prepared. Who knows what they are up to. I 
have information that something is being prepared for us and for 
me in particular. One would say that it is our turn. But, 
whatever happens, we are ready for him! 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Vukovic</ORGANIZATION>] Along with the "spontaneous" demands to ban the 
LSCG, an attempt is being made to cast your party in the image 
of a terrorist organization. To that end the Montenegrin 
ministry of internal affairs has been showing a surprising 
propensity toward graphomania. 
  [<PERSON>Perovic</PERSON>] The Montenegrin public is aware of all the 
government's efforts to satanize the LSCG. This has had a 
definite impact with a certain number of people. But we have 
managed to achieve the opposite result with an immense number of 
people. We were not taken in by the provocations, by the plants, 
by the offers of posts in the government, by the threats, nor 
will we be. We are aware that we are being infiltrated by 
"spies," by agents provocateurs, that at some point an agent 
provocateur will be activated to portray us in the light they 
want. We know that, we see them, it is all right. That is their 
technology for holding onto power, but nothing will stop us, 
nothing....

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- The latest situation 
in <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> indicates that the most critical stage of 
the crisis has not ended and that the war threatens to spread. 
So says a statement sent to TANJUG by <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s Foreign 
Minister <PERSON>Miodrag Lekic</PERSON>. In his opinion, these are the latest 
tragic consequences of the proclamation and recognition of 
<LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> without securing a consensus of all three 
constituent peoples beforehand, a principle that was explicitly 
defined in the constitution of that republic at that time. 
  Lekic, however, notes that the fundamental causes of the war 
do not exonerate the warring adventurers belonging to the sides 
in <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> from responsibility for the activities 
which not only continue to cause further suffering among the 
innocent population, but also further diminish the possibility 
of finding a peaceful solution. To unquestioningly give in to 
everything that comes from the top brass cannot be in the 
national interest. This particularly refers to those things 
which irresponsibly undermine the efforts aimed at restoring 
peace. True patriotism, he adds, can be seen in those who, in 
addition to promoting national interests, advocate peace and 
respect for the rights of others and an end to the suffering of 
the population. [passage omitted]

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Milenko Pesic</PERSON>: "Concerning Support for </F>
Strengthening the <ORGANIZATION>Federal State</ORGANIZATION>: Is Centralization Possible in 
the FRY?"] 
  [Text] <PERSON>Slobodan Rakitic</PERSON>, DEPOS [Democratic Movement of 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>]: "The federal state has too few authorities"; 
academician <PERSON>Miodrag Jovicic</PERSON>: "A two-member federation has no 
chance of succeeding"; <PERSON>Dr. Pavle Nikolic</PERSON>: "For a unified state 
of Serbs and Montenegrins." 
  Time will tell what the future of <PERSON>Djindjic</PERSON>'s idea on the 
need 
to centralize <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> is. The opposition offered in 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to his support for strengthening the federal state 
was more than vehement. 
  Responding to charges by the Montenegrin political public, 
<PERSON>Zoran Djindjic</PERSON> said: "I do not challenge the fact that 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has its own statehood and its own symbols and 
sovereignty. However, some questions concerning money and the 
economy must be separated out. There is no equality if someone 
gives 10 dinars and someone else gives 20 dinars, and then they 
have an equal voice in deciding how that money is going to be 
used." 
<H5>  Djindjic in a Rush </H5>
  Many people feel that the disintegration of the SFRY 
[Socialist Federal Republic of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>] first began in the 
monetary sphere. As soon as the stories of who was exploiting 
whom and who was making decisions about money began circulating, 
post-World War II <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION> signed its own death sentence. 
  Two years in the life of the third <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> as a 
two-member 
federation have been enough to show that not everything in the 
new federal state is functioning smoothly. 
  Slobodan Rakitic, leader of the DEPOS caucus in the <ORGANIZATION>Federal 
Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, agrees that the federal state has too few authorities. 
  "This is evidenced by the fact that sessions of the two 
chambers of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Assembly</ORGANIZATION> are very rare, while 
announcements that the federal government has not prepared bills 
for the legislature are very common. Legislative activities have 
been sharply curtailed, to the benefit of the 
member-states--<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>," says Rakitic. 
  Rakitic feels that <PERSON>Djindjic</PERSON> was right when he raised the 
question of the competence of the federal state and its 
influence on the political and economic life of the citizens, 
"if one does not want this present-day state to resemble the one 
portrayed in the <DATE>1974</DATE> Constitution." 
  "Nevertheless, I think that <PERSON>Djindjic</PERSON> has rushed the whole 
story. It would be nice if we as a state could deal with these 
problems now," the head of the DEPOS caucus in the federal 
parliament warns. 
  The current federation has no chance of succeeding, 
academician <PERSON>Miodrag Jovicic</PERSON> believes. 
  "There are three reasons why the FRY [Federal Republic of 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>] cannot be effective as a federative state," this 
expert in constitutional law explains. 
  First, the theory and practice of federalism show that 
two-member federations have no chance of succeeding. As his 
second argument, <PERSON>Jovicic</PERSON> cites the differences between <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in terms of size and economic power; finally, 
there is the Zabljak Constitution, which contains a number of 
weaknesses and numerous confederal elements that were present in 
the former SFRY. 
<H5>  Way Out of Current Situation </H5>
  As a strong critic of the current constitutional solution 
for 
the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jovicic</PERSON> warns that the supreme legal document grants 
privileges to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in a number of regards. 
  "There are two ways out of the current situation. One is to 
abolish the current republican and provincial borders and form a 
state of regions. Such a solution would be somewhere between a 
unitary and federal structure for the state," <PERSON>Jovicic</PERSON> 
emphasizes, adding that he is opposed to a unitary state. 
  Jovicic sees another possibility for overcoming the current 
discord between the two members of the federation in granting 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> special autonomous status, so-called corpum 
separatum, like what the <LOCATION>Banovina</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> gained in <DATE>1939</DATE>. 
"That means that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> would no longer have its own 
constitution and president," says academician <PERSON>Jovicic</PERSON>. 
  Dr. <PERSON>Pavle Nikolic</PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>School of Law</ORGANIZATION> and 
federal deputy, also says that the current two-member federation 
is untenable as a solution, because it does not ensure the equal 
rights of the federal units and the equal rights of its citizens. 
  "The two-member federation is fertile ground for sovereignty 
disputes and rivalries, which always bring forth aspirations 
toward confederalism on the one hand and centralism on the other 
hand," <PERSON>Nikolic</PERSON> stresses. 
  Despite the unification of <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in <DATE>1918</DATE>, 
the 
post-World War II arrangement, and the constitutional solution 
of <DATE>1974</DATE>, these two states have grown apart over the course of 
time, emphasizing their statehood and sovereignty. 
  "I support a unified state of Serbs and Montenegrins with 
divided democratic-political territorial autonomy, as a 
community of the Serbian and Montenegrin states. Through this 
sort of renunciation of statehood by <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, the 
basis for creating a unified statehood of the entire nation 
would be created," <PERSON>Nikolic</PERSON> believes, adding that this would 
avoid centralism, which is inherently undemocratic.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, Jan 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Radoje Kontic</PERSON> and the premiers of the Yugoslav Republics of 
<LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Nikola Sainovic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Milo Djukanovic</PERSON>, on 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> [12 <DATE>January</DATE>] backed up an economic recovery 
programme drawn up by a team of Yugoslav experts and agreed to 
start implement the measures contained in it as of next week. 
Yugoslavia desperately needs such a programme to counter the 
effects of an airtight international blockade and monster 
inflation which in <DATE>December</DATE> alone reached one million percent. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> imposed tough sanctions on 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> in late <DATE>May of 1992</DATE> for its alleged involvement in 
civil war in neighbouring <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>. 
  Kontic, <PERSON>Sainovic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> were agreed that the 
anti-inflation and stabilization programme, due to be launched 
on <DATE>January 17</DATE>, would ensure an economic independence to the 
country and open prospects for recovery on the basis of 
market-economy principles, the <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Information Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 
said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Government</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 
generally upheld the programme but insisted on some corrections 
and amendments, the statement added. The programme focuses on 
curbing hyperinflation and ensuring monetary stability as a 
precondition for reviving production and improving the living 
standards of the population, the <ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Government</ORGANIZATION> said. It 
also said that in the conditions of international sanctions, 
financial backing for the programme should be primarily ensured 
from domestic sources rather than from foreign ones. This 
should not stop actions, however, for deblocking Yugoslav assets 
frozen in foreign banks, settlement of claims that <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> 
has towards other countries and conclusion of credit and other 
financial arrangements to support the programme, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal 
Government</ORGANIZATION> said. 
  The government of <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> backed the programme, 
while the government of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> said on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that it 
should be used as a basis for seeking how to surmount the 
present economic difficulties and suggested a series of 
alterations. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal</ORGANIZATION> prime minister whose 
content was published on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, Montenegrin Premier 
<PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON> said that the programme did not fully take into 
account the effects of the blockade, that it was better suited 
to an open economy and that it implied backing of foreign 
capital. 
  Another shortcoming of the programme, the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin 
Government</ORGANIZATION> said, is that it offers no complete answer as to how 
to revive production and the commodities' market and how to 
mitigate the acute social problems.

  [Text] [Announcer] Montenegrin Prime Minister <PERSON>Milo 
Djukanovic</PERSON> is paying an official visit to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>. We 
have established a direct link with <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> where Mr. Prime 
Minister [<ORGANIZATION>Djukanovic</ORGANIZATION>] is. Good day! 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Djukanovic</ORGANIZATION>] Good day! 
  [Announcer] To get right to the point for the listeners of 
Argument Vise [An Argument More] program -- what is the 
objective of your visit to <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, have you had any 
concrete meetings and talks? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Djukanovic</ORGANIZATION>] Together with the deputy prime minister and 
Montenegrin foreign minister I am visiting <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> at the 
invitation of one of the members of the foreign affairs' 
committee of the lower chamber of the <ORGANIZATION>British Parliament</ORGANIZATION>. This 
afternoon I am supposed to present my vision of the current 
situation in <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> in this lower chamber committee. 
  [Announcer] I presume that we will obtain some concrete 
information about your talks there later in the day. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Djukanovic</ORGANIZATION>] Hello? 
  [Announcer] Yes, we can hear you. Rather optimistic 
assessments have been coming from <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, to which you paid an 
official visit beforehand -- that is, mutual satisfaction with 
this visit. Could you say anything more about it for our 
listeners? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Djukanovic</ORGANIZATION>] I took the opportunity of the fact that I was 
travelling to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> via <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> to hold talks with the <ORGANIZATION>Albanian 
Government</ORGANIZATION>. We held talks with Prime Minister <PERSON>Meksi</PERSON>, naturally, 
in the presence of the foreign minister and other government 
officials. We discussed the need to intensify mutual relations. 
We took the opportunity to tell <PERSON>Mr. Meksi</PERSON> that the overall 
foreign affairs' goal of the FRY [Federal Republic of 
<LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>] is to establish good relations with its neighbors 
and that, within this context, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has an explicit need 
to establish good, that is to say, better relations with 
<LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, with whom it borders directly, than we have had in the 
past. On that occasion, we discussed some essential issues that 
represent the most important segments of the improvement of 
mutual relations -- the rights of minorities in both countries 
and some vital issues that we perceive as a possibility to 
promote economic and other cooperation. 
  I received assurances that, in accordance with the 
democratic 
changes that are underway in that country, the rights of the 
Serbs and the Montenegrins who live in <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> will receive 
appropriate treatment parallel to a demand that such a policy be 
pursued for the Albanians in the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Naturally, as always, special interest was shown in the 
problem of <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>. It seems that there have been some ambiguous 
statements by some diplomatic representatives of some 
superpowers -- I am primarily referring to the statements that 
have been coming from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> recently -- which have contributed 
a lot that <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> abandoned the aggressive attitude toward the 
<ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION> regarding <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>, acknowledged that <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> is an integral 
part of <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, and that this issue can only be 
discussed at the level of rights that must be guaranteed to the 
citizens of Albanian ethnicity in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>. 
  I would say that for me all together this was a sign that a 
new leaf has been turned in the attitudes toward this issue and 
in the general FRY-Albanian relations. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much. We wish you all success in 
you visit and activities in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.

  [Text] [Vukovic] There is almost general consensus that 
despite the optimism that seemed never to have been greater the 
talks in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> yielded "meager results." 
Does this assessment also apply to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s vital need for 
the lifting or at least the suspension of the sanctions? 
  [Lekic] Bearing in mind the diminishing number of 
controversial, although complex issues, it is true that 
optimistic expectations prevailed, and even possibilities for 
the signing of an agreement. In the introductory speech at the 
plenary session, <PERSON>Lord Owen</PERSON> said that very little stood in the 
way of the agreement. The three sides that actually represent 
the three nationalist structures of the authority are more or 
less continuing with their maximalist demands for the time 
being, lacking the readiness to strike a decisive compromise. 
For this reason the pressure of the international community is 
at the moment on all three sides. The Muslim side is now 
assuming greater responsibly for the rejection of the 
Serbian-Croatian agreement, which, formally speaking, reflects 
the opinion of the majority in <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> at the moment. 
True enough, this is a majority born out of a suspicious 
alliance like the earlier Croatian-Muslim alliance that sufficed 
for the international community to recognize <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, 
by which the fire in this republic was definitely lit. 
  However, an agreement of the three sides, a principle that 
should have been respected from the very beginning, can be 
reached in the coming rounds of the talks. As is known, the 
signing of the peace agreement on <LOCATION>Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION> parallel to 
the favorable development of other elements of the peace process 
will open a perspective for the progressive suspension, that is 
to say, lifting of the sanctions, which gives rise to certain, 
naturally, moderate optimism. 
  [<PERSON>Vukovic</PERSON>] My impression is that certain "sub-questions" are 
unexpectedly (in light of the assurances by the state 
leadership) getting complicated or perhaps this is merely 
becoming evident now. I am primarily thinking of Prevlaka. 
  [<PERSON>Lekic</PERSON>] A part of the so-called <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> position 
paper refers to the demands that the Muslim and also the Serbian 
side gain access to the sea. The actual circumstances of these 
efforts are hypothetical for the time being. 
  Throughout the entire course of diplomatic activities, 
including this latest one, the position and insistence of our 
republic was that Prevlaka belongs to <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. The present 
compromise solution for Prevlaka, as perhaps the only 
observation of the conclusions of the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> conference, has 
brought no serious incidents, which was noted with satisfaction 
at the last plenary conference. However, a fair and definitive 
decision will be reached when Prevlaka formally falls to 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
  [<PERSON>Vukovic</PERSON>] What about the demand that the blockade of Bar 
harbor be lifted to receive humanitarian aid? By the way, to 
what degree did the "assistance" of <PERSON>Radovan Karadzic</PERSON> [president 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian Republic</ORGANIZATION>] and [FRY Foreign Minister] <PERSON>Vladislav 
Jovanovic</PERSON> help this initiative? 
  [Lekic] The committee for sanctions at the demand of 
incumbent Montenegrin authorities and the <ORGANIZATION>FAO</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization</ORGANIZATION>] on 11 <DATE>June 1993</DATE> passed a general 
decision to open Bar harbor for the humanitarian aid to the 
former Yugoslav republics. The renewed operation of this harbor 
has been postponed. It is only left to us to analyze why this 
decision is not being put into effect and, naturally, to fight 
for its alteration. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Vukovic</ORGANIZATION>] Immediately upon their return from <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, 
[Montenegrin] President <PERSON>Bulatovic</PERSON> said that "in normal times 
there would be much less need for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> 
to have independent diplomacy," and that "it is much better that 
we strive toward observation of the federal Constitution and 
leave this activity to the federal organs." Many understood 
this statement as characteristic of the president's laying of 
the ground for the abolition of your ministry? 
  [Lekic] I have no knowledge of preparing the ground for the 
abolition of the ministry nor that this issue is topical. I 
know that so far the Montenegrin president of the republic and 
the prime minister have favored the normal functioning of the 
ministry, among other reasons, to adhere to the Constitution. 
  [Vukovic] Until recently your departure to the post of 
ambassador in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> has been "topical" in the corridors and 
lately there has also been some talk that you might take the 
post of federal foreign minister. I presume that you have heard 
about both options and my question is: Is there any substance 
in either of them? 
  [Lekic] Between <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> I would give priority to 
<LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, naturally for as long as I enjoy the trust of the 
public and the authorities in power. Within my decisionmaking 
domain I shall give priority to what I judge to be in the 
interest of our republic. 
  [Vukovic] To sum up -- even when <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s 
international status normalizes, is there a reason for 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to remain without its own diplomacy? 
  [Lekic] In any form of normalization you speak of there will 
be no serious arguments for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s remaining without its 
own diplomacy. On the contrary, valid historic and state 
interests exist for the continuation of this important attribute 
of Montenegrin statehood. 
  [Vukovic] The Peoples' Party and the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian Radical Party</ORGANIZATION> 
do not conceal their dissatisfaction with your work and believe 
that you are pursuing a "separatist" diplomacy for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
Please comment. 
  [Lekic] I strive for the reputation, the interests, and the 
international recognizability of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> by acknowledging 
reality, naturally, all this not at others' expense. Those who 
do not conceal their dissatisfaction with such efforts at the 
same time do not conceal their attitude or intentions toward 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. 
  Regarding the Peoples' Party, I would not judge it on the 
basis of the statements and moves by some of its 
representatives. In other words, I would like to believe that 
there are many among its members and sympathizers who respect 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and its state and henceforth support the state 
activities that are in its interest. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Vukovic</ORGANIZATION>] In the Montenegrin opposition block there is also 
certain mistrust in you. 
  [Lekic] Bearing in mind the outlined principles we are 
striving for, I have some difficulty in identifying my 
antagonism to all the forces that truly and rationally work for 
the interests of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. If you are referring to the 
mistrust of those who in the foreign affairs sphere constantly 
champion foreign military intervention against the Serbs in 
<LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> and the extension and tightening of sanctions, thus, for 
something that does not significantly differ from, for example, 
the official views of <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, then I would not comment, for, I 
hope, wholly rational reasons. In any case, all political 
forces perfectly legitimately strive to gain power and personal 
aspirations should be treated as normal. 
  [Vukovic] It seems to me that the so-called Serbian block of 
parties in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is irritated by the manner in which you 
conduct the Montenegrin foreign policy, as well as your clear 
identification as a Montenegrin in a national sense. Has 
somebody from the ruling party (among those who claim that 
"Montenegrinhood [crnogorstvo] without Serbianhood [srpstvo]" is 
not possible) reproached you for anything in this sense? 
  [Lekic] I am not aware of anyone reproaching me for anything 
like this. 
  [<PERSON>Vukovic</PERSON>] What is, therefore, your attitude toward 
Montenegrinhood with or without Serbianhood, especially in 
concrete contemporary political events? 
  [Lekic] I was always repulsed by the mythologizing of the 
intolerant idea of ethnocentrism. I must admit that we perceive 
terms like Serbianhood and Montenegrinhood, which otherwise 
frequently cause people intellectual and other excitement, as 
expressions of romantic rhetoric and old-fashioned pathos. I 
have never heard, for example, the terms Englishhood or 
Frenchhood although these are big and old nations. 
  Aspirations of individual political factions that are based 
on the past and the attempts to accomplish the mythical and 
mystical variant instead of the sober and contemporary option, 
give rise to big errors. Political demagogues are transforming 
the mythical variant into altogether lowly political goals. 
Instead of controversies and mystification of Serbianhood and 
<PERSON>Montenegrinhood</PERSON>, the question of the Montenegrin-Serbian state 
interests is the one that rationally poses itself. I favor the 
search for rational state relations, economic, and cultural 
cooperation, by which historic alliances as well as state and 
legal peculiarities (of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, two old counties) 
would be reinstated at the same time. 
  [Vukovic] The elections in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> are over. The electoral 
campaign has shown that literally all the parties there consider 
the present <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> to be a transitional solution on the way 
to the final goal -- the alliance of the Serbian lands. Do you 
keep to the position you stated in POBJEDA this <DATE>April</DATE> that such 
an initiative is unacceptable for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> because <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
has an established state and national awareness, and the recent 
one in THE INDEPENDENT that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has its own tradition of 
statehood and does not wish to embark upon an adventure by which 
it would risk the loss of its own identity? Can you imagine 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in such a state formation and yourself as the foreign 
minister in the republican government, if <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> were to 
have one at all then? 
  [Lekic] I can immediately answer that I do not see myself 
as foreign minister in such a formation. I would also like to 
state my opinion that all peoples have a legitimate right to 
self-determination, the Serbs included. I am not familiar with 
the concept of such an alliance but I presume that it is 
necessary to respect the will of all who are envisaged for such 
an alliance. 
  I did not change my opinion regarding <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> as a civic 
state and the alliance of the Serbian lands, which I have 
clearly explained in POBJEDA and recently in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s THE 
INDEPENDENT. In any case the Montenegrin state is not for sale. 
I believe that its centennial continuity will continue in the 
forms on which the majority of its citizens will decide and 
which the minority will democratically respect. Faced with the 
new historic challenges and experiences, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, an old 
state, that is to say, the Montenegrin people with recognizable 
state and national identity, will know how to chose their 
historic ways. In these bleak historic times we are all again 
sitting the test of historical maturity and ethics. If we are 
worthy of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> and its pure and exalted idea, we will not 
make a wrong choice. 
  [<PERSON>Vukovic</PERSON>] What kind of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> would you by no means wish 
to see in the future? 
  [Lekic] I would not like our political, cultural, and 
religious differences transformed into clashes that would later, 
depending on the winner, lead into <ORGANIZATION>Manichaean</ORGANIZATION> division into 
heroes and traitors. In this century alone our ancient 
divisions have left sorrow and scars on the Montenegrin people, 
who live with history, bearing it as a tragic burden. 
  For this reason it is our duty to reach a political and 
cultural consensus regardless of all the differences so that by 
collective responsibility we meet the present challenges.

have almost completely destroyed the merchant fleet of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> which accounted for about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the 
republic's annual foreign currency revenue and five percent of

part of Bar and `<ORGANIZATION>Jugooceanija</ORGANIZATION>' of <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION>. A total of 37 
Montenegrin ships, totalling 977,000 dwt, have been stranded in 
various ports throughout the world. 
  Cargo transport, port reloading and shipbuilding activities 
have ground to a complete halt, said <PERSON>Radomir Mugosa</PERSON>, the

<ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Chamber of Economy</ORGANIZATION>. He added that the <DATE>1993</DATE> 
maintenance costs of ships belonging to `<ORGANIZATION>Prekookeanska Plovidba</ORGANIZATION>'

ships with a dwt of over 80,000. 
  The port of Bar, which is capable of reloading five million 
tonnes of goods, has not had any earnings because no ships have 
entered it over the past two years, <PERSON>Mugosa</PERSON> said. He added that 
the shipbuilding yard `<PERSON>Veljko Vlahovic</PERSON>,' in <LOCATION>Bijela</LOCATION>, has also 
suspended its activities although it used to overhaul between

<FÊP=106> [Commentary by <PERSON>Frane Plancic</PERSON>: "<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> Under Military </F>
Management?"] 
  [Text] Serbian plans for <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> have long been known, 
and they have long been implemented without any great problems, 
in cooperation with [President of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>] Bulatovic and 
[Prime Minister] <PERSON>Djukanovic</PERSON>, the duo in power. What is not known 
are the Serbian plans for solving the expected secessionist 
crisis in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. However, there are certain indications of 
these plans, such as the deployment of the means for a 
preventative solution to this crisis by force, which have 
already been carried out. Naturally, the matter involves the 
<ORGANIZATION>Yugoslav Army</ORGANIZATION> (the Serbian armed forces), whose troops are on 
the alert because of the "constant danger from <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>." 
  Belgrade is prepared to solve this "secessionist crisis" 
either by introducing martial law or by war. In either case, 
what <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> must have is the following: territory clear of 
Albanians and Croats, a short period to apply armed force, 
achieved by deploying force on the crisis territories at the 
appropriate time, and, finally, to keep the situation on the 
borders with <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> politically unstable, so that 
"internal intervention" could be covered and justified by 
external reasons. 
  The plans for the additional militarization of the Lustica 
peninsula (the <LOCATION>Boka Kotorska</LOCATION> bay), Valdinos cove (near <LOCATION>Ulcinj</LOCATION>), 
and Krnjicko Oko (on Lake Skadarsko) thus assume a clear 
political and military meaning. <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>'s plan is accompanied 
by a request for building apartments for about 10,000 officers 
and their families. 
  Most of all this is being planned in eastern <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, 
densely populated by autochthonous Albanians. It clearly 
follows that "cleansing" is being planned. At the same time, 
Serbs are being settled in the area, so with additional 
militarization a favorable "balance of power" in relation to the 
Montenegrin "secessionists" is being achieved. The 
militarization of Lustica and the advanced cleansing of the 
autochthonous Croats in <LOCATION>Boka</LOCATION> is being guided by the same 
principle. 
  The decision to turn the <LOCATION>Lustica</LOCATION> peninsula into a military 
range and the construction of a naval port (base, stronghold) at 
Valdinos is primarily an open threat to Montenegrin sovereignty, 
and indirectly also to <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, since it is assumed 
that these countries will act aggressively toward Montenegrin 
territory. 
  The naval port of Valdinos does not only have a "land" 
purpose (threatening the Montenegrin secessionists), but its 
primary task is to hold the Serbian fleet that needs to secure 
for <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> a part in controlling the sea and the traffic in 
the wider <LOCATION>Otranto</LOCATION> area, especially when the lifting of the 
sanctions or a laxer regime of navigation and traffic is 
expected, as is constantly being announced in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>. A more 
acceptable explanation has been put forward in the Montenegrin 
public -- that all this is a question of defense measures. 
  Viewed more passively, this represents the redeployment of 
the fleet from <LOCATION>Boka</LOCATION>, where the ships are within the range of 
Croatian weapons. Moreover, it would be difficult for the many 
different ships and submarines to sail out on time, fast, and in 
an orderly manner. 
  Valdinos Cove offers much better opportunities for active 
defense measures, at least insofar as it is further from <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> 
and as it is easier to sail out of. However, all the other 
conditions are less favorable than those at <LOCATION>Boka</LOCATION>. This cove is 
only a mile long, the water 5 to 15 meters deep, and it is 
surrounded by hills that are, on average, two to three times 
lower than those at <ORGANIZATION>Boka</ORGANIZATION>, and open to strong winter winds. When 
one sails out of the cove, as is the case with <ORGANIZATION>Boka</ORGANIZATION>, the ships 
are in the open, at the mercy of a superior opponent from the 
air, the sea, or under the sea. Particular drawbacks are the 
fact that all the work has to be done from scratch (where will 
this kind of money come from?), that it will take a long time, 
and then there is also the hinterland with which <ORGANIZATION>Valdinos</ORGANIZATION> has 
very weak traffic and other connections. 
  After all, is the best indication not <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> silently 
overlooking the fact that Valdinos is not the best choice? 
There are several coves more appropriate for the purpose, but 
the "trouble" is that there is no Albanian or Croatian 
population there. 
  While talking to several senior <ORGANIZATION>Croatian Navy</ORGANIZATION> officials, we 
agreed that <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> (when it truly is <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>) will have 
the legitimate right to establish its own navy, in accordance 
with its defense needs, and also to take all passive and active 
security measures. However, they stated that the warships at 
<LOCATION>Boka</LOCATION> are neither Montenegrin property (but Serbian, while they 
are waiting for the division to be legally resolved), nor a 
factor of legitimate defense. Moreover, it is not such a bad 
thing that the Serbian fleet has been moving further away from 
our border. 
  It is quite another matter as to what will happen when 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> becomes the Republic of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, and when it has 
to defend itself on all sides against a spreading <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> 
aggression. The Slovenes, Croatians, Muslims, and Albanians had 
no other solution. It is therefore probably not necessary to 
point out that we are not dealing with fools and politically 
illiterate megalomaniacs such as Admiral Isakovic -- who 
addresses the people from The Galeb [formerly Tito's ship] in 
the manner of Tito -- but with clear-headed criminals who could 
be said to rank among the most notorious in the world.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Tirana</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 26</DATE> (ATA) -- On <DATE>May 22-23</DATE>, <DATE>1994</DATE>, the 
financial police in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Public 
Order</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General's Office</ORGANIZATION> exercised control in the 
border areas along the <LOCATION>Buna River</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Lake of Shkodra</LOCATION> to 
intercept <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> bound smugglers of fuel. Three tankers, an 
<ORGANIZATION>IFA</ORGANIZATION> [expansion unknown] vehicle, and a van which had transported 
fuel as well as three persons filling barrels with fuel to be 
moved across the border were intercepted in the area of Kamice 
village. 
  Four motor boats coming from <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, five Montenegrin 
citizens and an Albanian, who had come to get fuel from barrels 
along the <LOCATION>Lake of Shkodra</LOCATION>, were intercepted in the area of the 
Kasan village. Another 14 Albanian citizens, who were making 
ready to ship the fuel by motor boat were intercepted as well. 
Among them was a person armed with a hunting rifle. 
  Barrels of fuel and three Albanian citizens, smuggling 
fuels, 
were intercepted in the Samrish village along the <LOCATION>Buna River</LOCATION>. 
Also, Montenegrin motor boats which has crossed the Albanian 
water frontier for fuel contraband were intercepted. 
  In the area of the Murriqan village, again along the <LOCATION>Buna 
River</LOCATION>, three Albanians were intercepted while smuggling fuel 
across the frontier in collaboration with Montenegrins, who fled 
immediately on a motor-boat as the Albanian order forces 
intervened. 
  In the end of the control on contraband and violation of the 
embargo imposed by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, acts which run counter to 
the laws of the Albanian state, 24 Albanian and five Montenegrin 
citizens were denounced for criminal prosecution, and five 
vehicles, about 160 barrels of oil as well as large quantities 
of empty barrels were intercepted. 
  It is not the first time that the financial police bodies 
and 
those of the public order have exercised unexpected controls to 
prevent smuggling of fuel into <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Over the recent 
months, pipes were discovered in the <LOCATION>Lake of Shkodra</LOCATION>, which 
served the transportation of these fuels into the Montenegrin 
territory. Several tankers have also been intercepted recently 
in <LOCATION>Malesia</LOCATION> e Madhe, which had transported fuel out of the 
Albanian frontiers. For this reason, customs officials as well 
as public order employees of the border crossing point were 
detained.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, Jan 20 (AFP) -- More than 100 Bosnian 
Serb refugees in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> have been drafted by Bosnian Serb 
forces, with the complicity of local authorities and the rump 
Yugoslav army, an opposition official said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [20 <DATE>January</DATE>]. 
  Movement orders addressed to the refugee "reservists" began 
arriving by mail 10 days ago, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> Social Democratic Party 
official <PERSON>Milorad Raznjatovic</PERSON> said here. The call-up is being 
carried out in collaboration with the rump Yugoslav army and the 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> police, <PERSON>Raznjatovic</PERSON> said. Movement orders received 
by one refugee, sent by the "defence ministry" of the 
self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, instructed him to report 
to a Yugoslav army barracks in <LOCATION>Tivat</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, "in order to 
fulfil his military obligations in the Serbian republic army," 
he said. 
  Should the draftee fail to report, he will be "questioned," 
the orders specify. Bosnian Serb authorities are apparently 
well-informed about the refugees in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Raznjatovic</PERSON> 
said, as the movement orders were correctly addressed to each 
refugee. The head of the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegro Refugee Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Djordje 
Scepanovic</PERSON>, denied any collaboration with Bosnian Serb 
authorities. "The forced call-up of refugees by the country 
they fled from is forbidden by the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> Convention on 
refugees," <PERSON>Scepanovic</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The Bosnian Serb forces have often called on the refugees to 
enlist, but "on a voluntary basis, not by call-up orders and 
warnings," he said. The movement orders call on the refugees to 
serve in <LOCATION>Herzegovina</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina</LOCATION>, where the 
Bosnian Serb army is fighting to take control of <LOCATION>Olovo</LOCATION>, a 
strategic site north of <LOCATION>Sarajevo</LOCATION> on the route to <LOCATION>Tuzla</LOCATION> 
[geographical information as received].

<FÊP=106> [Commentary by <PERSON>Dragoljub Vukovic</PERSON>: "Montenegrinhood Virus </F>
Activated"] 
  [Text] At the recent extraordinary session of the Peoples' 
Party of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION>, the amendment to the statute, 
which was supposed to emphasize the Serbian dimension of the 
party, was not passed. In connection with this precise 
amendment, a senior party official, Vice President <PERSON>Dr. Bozidar 
Bojovic</PERSON>, remarked that the excessive display of Serbian 
sentiments has done more harm than good to the party. Not long 
after this, a split within the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian Radical Party</ORGANIZATION> [SRS] of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, the second strongest Serbian party in the republic, 
unexpectedly took place when a group of three federal deputies 
(<PERSON>Dusan Boskovic</PERSON>, <PERSON>Radovan Vukcevic</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Slavoljub Scekic</PERSON>) 
renounced their loyalty to <PERSON>Dr. Vojislav Seselj</PERSON> [head of the <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>] and opposed the decision to make the <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> "unitarian," 
thus negating the autonomy of the Radicals in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. This 
opposition has been portrayed as defense of "the honorable state 
of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>," to which the untouchable leader of the Serbian 
Radicals responded with an accusation that those who were until 
recently his assistants have verged toward "Montenegrin 
separatists." 
  Under the leadership of <PERSON>Dr. Novak Kilibarda</PERSON>, who has proved 
to be a much more skillful politician than many thought, the 
Peoples' Party of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> has been suspected of 
insufficiently emphasizing its Serbian nature and not showing 
enough concern for Serbian interests on several occasions. It 
has transpired, however, that those who left the party because 
of these suspicions and formed new ones, have done a service to 
<PERSON>Dr. Kilibarda</PERSON> and his "populists [members of the Peoples' 
party]" and condemned themselves to the political wilderness. 
Without abandoning the realm of the national, <PERSON>Dr. Kilibarda</PERSON>, 
with the support of younger and more emancipated people around 
him, has tried (and to a great extent succeeded) to spare the 
Peoples' Party of being the exporter of Serbianity to 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Unlike some others, "the populists," have realized 
that there is no great number of Serbs in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> who would, 
in place of their Montenegrin caps, stick a Serbian cap 
[sajkaca] on their heads. Even though they do not accept the 
Montenegrins as a separate nation, their support for the 
preservation of the Montenegrin state's integrity within the 
federal association with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> (and other Serbian lands) makes 
them a potential partner of those political forces in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> 
that care about this statehood, too, but add national autonomy 
of the Montenegrins to it. The very fact that the Peoples' 
Party of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> does not question <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> being a state 
("with <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> always, under <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> never") points to the 
acknowledgement of a special Montenegrin political subjectivity, 
independently of whether a clear idea about this exists with 
"the populists" or not. For the Serbian nationalists, prone to 
unitarist ideas and amalgamation, such a Peoples' Party is 
potentially "separatist" and their side uses the slightest hint 
of proximity between "the populists" and the Liberal Alliance to 
produce direct or indirect accusations in this sense. 
  Speaking of the Peoples' Party of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> attempts to 
emancipate itself from romantic and rudimentary nationalism and 
emphasize its democratic and civic traits, it is also worth 
bearing in mind that its leaders wish to place the party within 
the framework of Western political culture. "Gentlemen, there 
is an association of the democratic parties of the world, or 
rather of the Euro-American civilization, and many parties tried 
to profile themselves so that they could enter this association 
in as inconspicuous a manner as possible. Because when one 
joins, you know, one wins many favors," <PERSON>Dr. Kilibarda</PERSON> emphasized 
at the party convention in <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION>. 
  Unlike the <ORGANIZATION>Peoples' Party</ORGANIZATION>, which had the hallmark of an 
authentic Montenegrin display of Serbian sentiments from the 
outset, the <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION> entered Montenegrin territory as an echo of 
<ORGANIZATION>Seselj</ORGANIZATION>'s nationalist and chauvinist uproar, and has more or less 
remained at this political level. 
  Suddenly, the unexpected unity has given way to discord, 
while the loyalty to <PERSON>Dr. Vojislav Seselj</PERSON> has transformed itself 
into accusations about dictatorship and the like. When <PERSON>Milika 
Dacevic</PERSON>, better known as Ceko, whom <PERSON>Seselj</PERSON> had made a war lord 
and then stripped him of the function, introduced him to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and then chased him out, says: "We are not 
peasant Serbs from <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, we are Serbs from <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>," then 
it is not improper to conclude that the incubation period of the 
Montenegrinhood virus is over even among some Radicals. It may 
be true what <PERSON>Vojislav Seselj</PERSON> has been saying about Boskovic, 
<LOCATION>Vukcevic</LOCATION>, and Scekic, namely, that they turned against him 
because he dismissed them as not capable enough; however, the 
seriousness of the warnings by <PERSON>Dusan Boskovic</PERSON> about the risks of 
a policy that ignores <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>'s specific status cannot be 
overlooked. 
  Departing from the assumption that one can equally display 
Montenegrin and Serbian sentiments in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, based on the 
example of the Peoples' Party and the <ORGANIZATION>SRS</ORGANIZATION>, one can conclude that 
it is more difficult for the Serbian political parties to 
resolve this paradox than for the Montenegrin ones. The 
political parties that do not question the ethnic specifics of 
the Montenegrins naturally also appear as the firmest guarantors 
of Montengrin statehood. Their dilemma can only be: Should the 
state be independent or integrated in a sort of border 
community. The Serbian political parties, however, are torn 
between Serbian integrationist tendencies and a Montenegrin 
specificity that they cannot circumvent. Their defense of 
statehood can be sincere, but it lacks sufficient basis, while 
their blatant negation of this statehood is plunging them from 
the heights of Mt. Lovcen among "the common" Serbs, to which 
most of them would agree only with difficulty. However, by 
staying at these heights, regardless of the fact that they might 
nationally feel Serbian, they are subconsciously becoming 
Montenegrins in a political sense.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Seki Radoncic</PERSON>: "Into the Minister's Ear"] </F>
  [Text] The fear citizens of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> have of having their 
phones tapped is a legacy of the communist times, but also a 
consequence of this government's loose use of the word "traitor" 
for those who do not share its political opinions. Finally, an 
important reason for suspicion arises from the fact that only 
the Montenegrin police in all of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> are not subject to the 
oversight of a multiparty parliament. 
  It is the public's general belief that eavesdropping is done 
on a large scale, says <PERSON>Slobodan Franovic</PERSON>, justice secretary of 
the executive board of the LSCG [Liberal Alliance of 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>]. "It is not our view that certain agencies that 
exist in all states should not take advantage of certain methods 
which represent some departure from certain principles of human 
rights, such as the principles of secrecy of the mail or 
inviolability of other means of communication between 
individuals. However, this must conform to the standards that 
prevail in the world." 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Liberal Alliance</ORGANIZATION> has announced "that it will take the 
initiative for evaluation of the constitutionality of the <ORGANIZATION>Law on 
Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION>, that is, of Article 23, under which the 
minister of police can order the <ORGANIZATION>SDB</ORGANIZATION> [state security service] to 
take steps that depart from the inviolability of the mail and 
allow eavesdropping." 
  The Constitution of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, Franovic says, provides that 
this can be done only on the basis of a court order. However, 
the present Law on <ORGANIZATION>Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> allows this on the basis of 
a decision of the minister of internal affairs. So, we want the 
court to evaluate this and issue a decision, that is, to 
establish civilian control over the work of the police. We will 
soon file a petition with the <ORGANIZATION>Constitutional Court</ORGANIZATION> as to whether 
one provision of the <ORGANIZATION>Law on Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> conforms to the 
provision of the constitution. Specifically, concerning the 
procedure whereby the constitution allows departure from the 
principle of inviolability of the mail and other communications. 
"I personally believe," <PERSON>Franovic</PERSON> says, "since this is more than 
obvious, that the <ORGANIZATION>Constitutional Court</ORGANIZATION> will find that this 
provision of the <ORGANIZATION>Law on Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION> does not conform to the 
constitution." 
<H5>  Eavesdropping on Telephone Conversations </H5>
  The <ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> does not resist when the police monitor telephone 
conversations. In all the post offices in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, that is, 
there are separate rooms through which subscriber cables pass, 
where eavesdropping devices and telephone recording devices have 
been installed; post office employees are not allowed to enter 
except in special cases. 
  Aware of this kind of collaboration between the police and 
the post office, the former Democratic Party [DS] filed a 
criminal charge back in <DATE>1990</DATE> against several persons because of 
warranted suspicion they committed the crime of unauthorized 
eavesdropping and recording. 
  The basic public prosecutor's office responded to the 
complaint of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> in mid-1991 by confirming that 
"in 26 <ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> there are in fact rooms with 
what are called `cable taps' in which is possible to monitor and 
record other people's telephone conversations." However, it also 
informed the plaintiff that it found no legal basis for 
undertaking criminal prosecution of the "suspects." 
  It is of interest that the basic public prosecutor's office 
said at the time "that the powers of the republic secretary (now 
minister) of police under Article 24 of the <ORGANIZATION>Law on Internal 
Affairs</ORGANIZATION> are too vague...." 
  The prosecutor's office also observed the following: The 
summary definition of this authority, as represented in the law, 
affords an opportunity for arbitrariness and willfulness on the 
part of the agency of the state and an erroneous assessment of 
the existence of grounds for invoking the authority. In the 
judgment of the basic public prosecutor's office, this is 
incompatible with basic civil rights.... 
  The basic public prosecutor's office promised at that time 
that it would initiate amendment of the legislation in effect in 
the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Assembly</ORGANIZATION>. However, that never went beyond an 
empty promise. 
<H5>  Bugging Facilities </H5>
  In the meantime the police have made technical advances, and 
now conversations in <LOCATION>Kolasin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cetinje</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Danilovgrad</LOCATION> can be 
monitored from <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION>, conversations in <LOCATION>Kotor</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tivat</LOCATION> from 
Herceg-Novi, and conversations in <LOCATION>Zabljak</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Pljevlja</LOCATION>. 
  In addition to eavesdropping on telephone conversations, the 
police frequently eavesdrop on conversations in facilities they 
have bugged. The bugging of facilities (offices, apartments, 
houses...) is done by installing highly sensitive microphones in 
the walls (especially under wallpaper), light fixtures, pieces 
of furniture, or anywhere the police imagination can think of. 
The bugging of a facility may be temporary or permanent, again 
depending on the police assessment. This method has one 
technical deficiency. That is, the place where the conversations 
are taped and recorded must not be very far from the place that 
is bugged. For example, if a person "subject to operational 
scrutiny" goes to a hotel, then through collaboration between 
the police and the desk clerk, he is sent to a room that is 
permanently bugged. Usually between eight and 10 rooms are 
bugged in the larger hotels. One of the hotel rooms is always 
"at the service" of the police, and that is the location of the 
"operative" who listens in and tapes conversations of the person 
or persons in whom the police are interested. 
  Policemen, depending on the need, also know how to install a 
hidden camera. They may use three methods at the same time: 
monitoring the telephone conversations, bugging the rooms, and 
tailing. The bugging of a room is defeated most easily by 
turning on the radio or TV, and turning on a water faucet has 
also proved an effective means of defense. 
  In any case, all the observations of the police, reports, 
taped conversations, and so on are coded separately and put in 
the same file. The first and last name of the "suspect" are 
never used as the code. So, the person, the facility, and the 
measure (eavesdropping or tailing), the action, and the file 
itself are given separate codes. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin SDB</ORGANIZATION> also monitors and records telephone 
conversations on behalf of the KOS [counterintelligence 
service]. Although by law the KOS, our sources say, is required 
to file a request, order and decision of the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin MUP</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Internal Affairs</ORGANIZATION>] for such "services," 
eavesdropping is done on no more basis than a verbal agreement 
between the heads of these two agencies. 
  The equipment which the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin MUP</ORGANIZATION> has for monitoring 
telephone conversations is nevertheless not quite as good as 
what the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian MUP</ORGANIZATION> has. That is, the <ORGANIZATION>Serbian SDB</ORGANIZATION> has the 
"5001" system, which is the most up-to-date and was purchased 
from the French, Germans, and English. This system allows 50 
telephones to be monitored from a single point. The system also 
allows computer monitoring of a particular subscriber in that it 
prints out data on all the numbers called. This system can also 
block a large number of telephone lines at the same time, 
normally if the "security people" judge that certain people 
should be prevented from contacting one another by telephone. A 
journalist of <ORGANIZATION>POLITIKA</ORGANIZATION> has expressed the opinion that "whoever 
has this equipment in his hands has control of the country." 
<H5>  Who Is Monitored? </H5>
  The Montenegrin police regularly follow all the major fairs 
of police equipment in the world. MONITOR has learned that <PERSON>Bosko 
Bojovic</PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin SDB</ORGANIZATION>, attended the world's 
fair of police equipment, technology, and weapons two months ago 
in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. He was accompanied by a well-known <LOCATION>Podgorica</LOCATION> 
businessman, which could suggest that soon even "our" <ORGANIZATION>MUP</ORGANIZATION> will 
be technically upgraded. As is natural, the price of this police 
equipment will be paid for by the citizens of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, and 
many will thus be financing eavesdropping on their own 
conversations. 
  For someone to be monitored, there must be warranted 
suspicion of his extremist activity, an activity aimed at 
bringing down the order established by the Constitution. 
Although they cannot be put in that group, <PERSON>Nikola Samardzic</PERSON>, 
former foreign minister, and then <PERSON>Blagoje Lucic</PERSON>, current federal 
minister, as well as <PERSON>Branko Abramovic</PERSON>, former agriculture 
minister in the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin Government</ORGANIZATION>, have been monitored, our 
sources say. 
  If it is true that current ministers have been unlawfully 
monitored, then this greatly strengthens the suspicion that 
certain opposition leaders are monitored in <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. For that 
matter, it has already been leaked to the public that <PERSON>Slavko 
Perovic</PERSON>, leader of the LSCG, has been bugged and that this 
operation was allegedly done by the police under the code 
"Godfather." It is no secret at all that the eavesdropping on 
certain opposition politicians is spoken about openly in the 
other opposition parties. But what is the eavesdropping on 
opposition leaders compared to the bugging of <PERSON>Dobrica Cosic</PERSON>, 
whom the Serbian SDB "bugged," according to the press, while he 
was president of the <ORGANIZATION>FRY</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>]? 
  For the present there is no hard evidence that the police 
are 
monitoring the telephone conversations of party leaders in 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>. Provided, of course, the arrested leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>SDA</ORGANIZATION> 
[Democratic Action Party] are excluded. However, <ORGANIZATION>MUP</ORGANIZATION> personnel 
who work in the "ear department," we have learned, have their 
hands full of work and every morning put envelopes containing 
recorded conversations on the desk of <PERSON>Bosko Bojevic</PERSON>. He then 
informs <PERSON>Nikola Pejakovic</PERSON>, minister of internal affairs, about 
the content of the conversations and other knowledge generated 
by the operations. 
  The minister of police, our sources say, reports all the 
more 
sensitive and major operations of the <ORGANIZATION>MUP</ORGANIZATION> (which include the 
monitoring of important persons) to <PERSON>Momir Bulatovic</PERSON>, president 
of <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mile Djukanovic</PERSON>, prime minister, and of course 
<PERSON>Zoran Zizic</PERSON>, the inevitable deputy prime minister responsible 
for monitoring the operation of the police. Since <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> is 
the only state in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that does not have a parliamentary body 
to oversee the work of the police, it is a closed circle. 
  The police were supposedly depoliticized back in <DATE>1989</DATE>. We 
have had a chance to see what this looks like in practice by 
watching the TV screen when the camera showed the 
"depoliticized" chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Montenegrin SDB</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bosko Bojevic</PERSON>, 
attending a closed party congress of the incumbent party. 
Strange that he should not have attended the open congresses of 
the <ORGANIZATION>People's Party</ORGANIZATION> or the Liberals. Or perhaps he knew in 
advance what they would be saying and adopting there, and he did 
not want to waste his time?

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>D. Becirovic</PERSON>: "<PERSON>Dragoslav Avramovic</PERSON> Speaks With </F>
Montenegrin Energy Officials: <MONEY>19 Million Dinars</MONEY> for Power Plant 
Repairs"] 
  [Text] The governor requested a precise specification 
of costs; national income must double over the coming months; 
demand that petroleum be exempted from all duty. 
  Niksic, 6 Jun--In order to perform essential repairs on 
Montenegrin electric power plants--at <LOCATION>Perucica</LOCATION>, Pivo, and 
<LOCATION>Pljevlja</LOCATION>--<MONEY>19 million dinars</MONEY> must be secured in the shortest 
term. The electric power industry does not have the money, and 
if all the deposits in Montenegrin banks were devoted to the 
repairs, the electric power installations would barely be put in 
order. But the demand that prices be increased will not be 
popular with the government. 
  The governor of the NBJ [<ORGANIZATION>National Bank of Yugoslavia</ORGANIZATION>], Prof. 
<PERSON>Dragoslav Avramovic</PERSON>, listened politely to energy officials and, 
wielding figures, he "slightly lowered" their demands as he 
went. Because the repairs must be made to the installations, 
<PERSON>Avramovic</PERSON> and Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON>Krunoslav 
Vukcevic</PERSON> said that the energy officials should precisely 
calculate the costs and send those figures to the government and 
governor so that this work, which cannot wait, is done solidly 
and on time. 
  The energy officials also mentioned the possibility of 
paying 
off debts by increasing the price of electricity. However, 
<PERSON>Avramovic</PERSON> said that his program looked at the infrastructure as 
a whole, but that it is now obvious that there are major price 
imbalances in this area. Although prices of electric power are 
low (one-third of the world price), the prices of 
telecommunication services and railroad transportation are 
equally above prices in the world, and something must be done in 
that sector. 
  One of the sore spots in Montenegrin economic life is 
petroleum. Energy officials are seeking to secure from the 
national energy pool the quantity of petroleum provided for 
<LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION>, while "Jugopetrol" director <PERSON>Nikola Dragomanovic</PERSON> put 
forward the demand that petroleum derivatives, which we import 
at prices two to five times higher than the price on the world 
market, be exempted from customs duty and that the market for 
petroleum in our country be free. 
  "If we got rid of customs duty, excise taxes, and controls 
over petroleum, what would happen then?" the governor asked. 
  "The supply would probably be better, with lower prices," 
Dragomanovic responded. 
  In response the comment by some of the participants in the 
meeting that food is expensive in our country, more expensive 
than in the world, <PERSON>Avramovic</PERSON> said that those calculations are 
not accurate, which does not mean that food cannot be cheaper. 
  There was also discussion of wages, whereby the governor 
said 
that it is inexplicable that wages have risen enormously for 
some structures in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>, even though they are still low 
compared to world levels.
