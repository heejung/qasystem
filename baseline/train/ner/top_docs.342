   <ORGANIZATION>Prism Entertainment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> said it terminated a proposed merger agreement with closely held <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Entertainment Group</ORGANIZATION> because <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> imposed "new conditions to the merger relating to financing." 

   Atlantic had asked Prism to approve additional financing, which it intended to use prior to completion of the transaction, Prism said. 
The financing was to have been partly secured by Prism, which "could have put us at risk if the transaction fell through," said a spokesman for Prism, a videocassette distributor. 

   <PERSON>Thomas J. Coleman</PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> motion picture distribution and television concern, said the problem was that "the transaction was taking too long to close . . . and we had to restructure the deal." 
He said <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> secured the financing anyway, totaling more than <MONEY>$12.5 million</MONEY>, and that it is starting its own video distribution without Prism. 
Under the terminated agreement, <PERSON>Mr. Coleman</PERSON> was to have become chairman and chief executive of the merged companies.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Prism Entertainment Corp.</ORGANIZATION> reported a <PERCENT>92%</PERCENT> plunge in profit for the fiscal-second quarter ended <DATE>July 31</DATE>, citing a drop in videocassette sales to rental and retail outlets. 

   The entertainment concern said net income in the latest quarter totaled <MONEY>$36,000</MONEY>, or <MONEY>two cents</MONEY> a share, compared with <MONEY>$457,000</MONEY>, or <MONEY>21 cents</MONEY> a share a year earlier. 
The latest period results include <MONEY>$24,000</MONEY> of tax credits, compared with <MONEY>$94,000</MONEY> in the previous year. 
Sales slid <PERCENT>3.4%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$5.2 million</MONEY>. 

   Prism said video retailers continue to seek hit films from major studios, leaving fewer funds for the purchase of the "B" movies that Prism licenses. 

   <PERSON>Barry Collier</PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, cited cost reductions initiated last year, which he said enabled the company to report a slim profit despite lower sales and more than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in expenses related to a now-terminated merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Entertainment Group</ORGANIZATION>. 

   For the six months, net fell <PERCENT>56%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$438,000</MONEY>, or <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> a share, from <MONEY>$988,000</MONEY>, or <MONEY>45 cents</MONEY> a share. 
The latest period included tax credits of <MONEY>$96,000</MONEY> compared with <MONEY>$106,000</MONEY> a year earlier. 
Revenue in the latest period dropped <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>, to <MONEY>$10.1 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$11.5 million</MONEY>. 

   For the six-month period, <PERSON>Prism</PERSON> said sales of its <ORGANIZATION>Fox/Lorber Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION> television-syndication unit rose more than <PERCENT>54%</PERCENT> but that the climb failed to offset a <PERCENT>29%</PERCENT> plunge in the company's basic business -- the sale of videocassettes to rental and "sell through" retail markets.

   <ORGANIZATION>Prism Entertainment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s television distribution unit said it plans next <DATE>Monday</DATE> to launch a daily half-hour financial news program called "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Business."

While <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> attributed its move to a soft advertising market, <PERSON>David M. Fox</PERSON>, chief executive officer of Fox/Lorber, said he believes the new program, which he hopes will be carried by about 80 stations, will succeed because of production costs "dramatically lower" than <ORGANIZATION>Disney's</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The Prism programming will be produced by a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Financial News Network</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Fox</PERSON> said the programs will draw on the network's film footage and use production facilities and a staff already in place. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Financial News Network</ORGANIZATION> is a division of <ORGANIZATION>New York-based Biotech Capital Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Prism, in addition to its television distribution activities, makes and licenses videocassettes.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor <PERSON>Kevin Costner</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Universal Pictures
Inc.</ORGANIZATION> are suing a video company, saying it is trying to profit from
the hit movie ``Field of Dreams'' by marketing a film in which
<ORGANIZATION>Costner</ORGANIZATION> played a minor role.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> lawsuit says <ORGANIZATION>Prism Entertainment Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
has distributed a <DATE>1985</DATE> film, ``Chasing Dreams,'' in which <PERSON>Costner</PERSON>
played an ``extremely minor role.''
   The videocassette cover prominently displays <PERSON>Costner</PERSON>'s picture
and name, according to the lawsuit filed <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring ``misrepresentations''
in the marketing of ``Chasing Dreams,'' Prism's profits from the
videocassette, and unspecified punitive damages.
   ```Chasing Dreams' was neither critically acclaimed nor
financially successful,'' wrote plaintiffs' attorney <PERSON>Frank Rothman</PERSON>.
``It was shown only in approximately 40 movie theaters in the
midwestern <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   Prism President <PERSON>Barry Collier</PERSON> declined comment, saying he had
not seen the lawsuit.
   In the hit ``Field of Dreams,'' <PERSON>Costner</PERSON> plays a farmer who
builds a baseball diamond in his corn field where ghost players,
including ``Shoeless'' <PERSON>Joe Jackson</PERSON> and other members of the <DATE>1919</DATE>
Chicago ``Black Sox'' come to play.
   Costner is shown on the cover of ``Chasing Dreams'' wearing a
baseball uniform but does not play a baseball player in the film,
according to the lawsuit.
   ``Field of Dreams'' has grossed <MONEY>$63 million</MONEY> since its release
<DATE>last year</DATE> but has yet to be released on videocassette, the lawsuit
says. Universal owns <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> distribution rights to the film.

   Savin Expecting
   To Post a Profit
   For 1st Quarter

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Savin Corp. expects to report a profit
for the first quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss, as
it began to benefit from placements of its Prism I color
copier, said E.P. van den Boogaard, the copier marketer's new
chairman.
   Savin also announced a long-term supply accord with
Colorocs Corp., which designs the Prism I. And the company
also is still accepting and counting votes from holders of
common shares on four proposals. Savin had asked its
shareholders to, among other things, give the company more
flexibility when paying dividends and to let the company
award certain options.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> estimates pretax earnings of
<MONEY>$400,000</MONEY>, compared with a year-ago loss of <MONEY>$1.1 million</MONEY>.
Savin declined to disclose the after-tax number, but <PERSON>Mr.</PERSON> van
den <ORGANIZATION>Boogaard</ORGANIZATION> said it would be printed in black ink. A
year-earlier, <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> had a loss of <MONEY>$930,000</MONEY>, or <MONEY>three cents</MONEY> a
share.
   Savin estimated that revenue advanced <PERCENT>3.3%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$92 million</MONEY>
from <MONEY>$89 million</MONEY>. The first quarter is usually <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION>'s
weakest, said <PERSON>Mr. van den Boogaard</PERSON>, who took the top post
late last month.
   Mr. van den <ORGANIZATION>Boogaard</ORGANIZATION>, 46 years old, also is president and
chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>HCS Technology N.V.</ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>
distributor of facsimile machines, copiers, and computer
hardware and software. <ORGANIZATION>HCS</ORGANIZATION> recently boosted its voting stake
in <LOCATION>Savin</LOCATION> to <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> by buying the <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> holding of <ORGANIZATION>Colorocs Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
Mr. van den <ORGANIZATION>Boogaard</ORGANIZATION> took the chairman's post from <PERSON>Charles
Muench</PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Colorocs</ORGANIZATION>.
   At a special meeting last month, <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> presented eight
proposals to shareholders. Holders agreed to cut the par
value on the common and four classes of preferred stock; to
let <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> pay dividends on Series-A preferred in common
stock; to increase authorized Series-C shares; and to make
some changes in a stock-option plan.
   The special meeting was postponed to <DATE>March 29</DATE> and then to
<DATE>April 20</DATE> to allow common-share holders to continue to vote on
proposals to let <ORGANIZATION>Savin</ORGANIZATION> pay Series-C dividends with more
Series-C; to grant certain stock options; to grant an option
on three million Series-C shares to <ORGANIZATION>HCS</ORGANIZATION>; and if this third
proposal fails, to grant to <ORGANIZATION>HCS</ORGANIZATION> as much as <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> of
common or Series-C stock.
   If <ORGANIZATION>HCS</ORGANIZATION> receives and exercises the option on the three
million Series-C shares, it would invest as much as <MONEY>$21
million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Savin</LOCATION>, increasing its voting stake to <PERCENT>63%</PERCENT>.
   The votes that are coming in still largely favor the
proposals, <PERSON>Savin</PERSON> said, declining to provide specific numbers.
The company has said that the initial failure of the four
ballot measures, which require approval from two-thirds of
the common shares, stemmed from the difficulty of getting its
many holders to vote.

   <ORGANIZATION>BAT Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> it would sell its
18 <ORGANIZATION>John Breuner Co.</ORGANIZATION> furniture stores to <ORGANIZATION>Prism Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a
merchant bank in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, for <MONEY>$92.5 million</MONEY> in cash.
   The deal is to be completed in about two months through <ORGANIZATION>BATUS
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary of BAT, the conglomerate said.
   Breuners, which is based in <LOCATION>San Ramon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, was bought by
BAT in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   The sale is one step in BAT's strategy of focusing on its
tobacco and financial services businesses to fight off a 13.4
billion-pound, or <MONEY>$22 billion</MONEY>, hostile takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION>Hoylake
Investments Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, an investor group led by Anglo-French financier
Sir <PERSON>James Goldsmith</PERSON>.
   Part of this restructuring includes the sale of all BAT's retail
operations in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The others to be sold include Saks Fifth Avenue, <ORGANIZATION>Marshall
Field</ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON>Ivey</PERSON>'s and Breuners' furniture rental business. The
conglomerate said it hopes to have all the sales completed by the
middle of this year.
   Prism was founded last year by <PERSON>Dennis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steven Wong</PERSON>, who have
backgrounds in merchant banking, venture capital and real estate,
BAT said.
   Prism also owns a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION>Barker Bros</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Co.</ORGANIZATION>, a
chain of 11 high-quality furniture stores in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>,
BAT said.
   Prism intends to operate the two retailers independently, it
said.
   The combined annual revenue of Breuners and <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> exceed <MONEY>$200
million</MONEY>, BAT said.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Technology: Designers check out the chip library - A quick
way to produce 'mixed signals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the electronics industry, <DATE>last year</DATE>'s product is already a dinosaur. The
market lifetime of many types of electronic products is shrinking rapidly,
forcing manufacturers to accelerate design and development cycles.
One bottleneck has been the development of custom semiconductor chips;
devices that are designed to meet the specifications for a particular
product.
In the digital world of computers, several short-cut 'semi-custom'
approaches to chip design are well established. But bridging the digital and
'real world' of analogue signals is more difficult. Demand for such 'mixed
signal' chips is rising with the use of increasingly sophisticated
electronics in, for example, cars, household appliances and industrial
control applications.
The automatic breaking systems found on some cars and the control devices
used in washing machines require both digital and analogue circuits. Home
automation, lighting control and any type of motor control also span the
digital to analogue divide.
Producing such combinations of digital, analogue, power and memory circuits
on a single chip, to provide lower cost, smaller and more reliable devices,
is one of the most challenging tasks facing the semiconductor industry.
Doing so fast enough to keep pace with accelerating product life cycles is
even more demanding.
Taking a new approach to the problem, <ORGANIZATION>Texas Instruments</ORGANIZATION>, the leading US chip
maker, has devised a new design method it calls Prism based upon 'reusable
engineering'.
In concept, Prism methodology can be likened to a library that has
integrated circuit elements on its shelves instead of books. When a customer
outlines a need for a new semiconductor, the TI design team does not have to
create it from scratch.
Instead, the engineers can go to the 'library', find predefined modules and
re-use them to meet the customers' needs.
The techniques make it easier to customise semiconductors, meaning designers
can add unique capabilities to their products more quickly than their
competitors, providing a critical time-to-market advantage. The chip design
time can be cut from a year to as little as three months, and full
production can be achieved in just six months, TI claims.
Prism also permits a new level of integration - combining multiple
semiconductors with different functions on a single chip - thus decreasing
the component count in new electronic systems by as much as 50 per cent.
'Prism methodology addresses a number of our customers' most important
concerns,' said <PERSON>Tom Engibous</PERSON>, senior vice-president of <ORGANIZATION>TI</ORGANIZATION>'s semiconductor
group.
'It shortens time-to-market, reduces development cost, lowers component
count and makes it easier to design the end products. Current customers in
automotive electronics have been pleased with the results enabled by Prism
methodology, and we are expanding its use into other areas.'
Another important element of the Prism approach is that it permits reuse of
test programs and qualification data, meaning new test procedures do not
have to be redefined for each product. This represents a significant step
forward in reducing the time required to get a new chip to market.
The Prism concept also extends to the manufacturing process, which is
segmented into modules so that only the steps that are needed to produce a
specific chip are used.
An important advance achieved by <ORGANIZATION>TI</ORGANIZATION> has been to squeeze power transistors,
used in high-voltage applications, into the same miniature geometries that
are standard for digital circuitry.
For the end user, faster development of more highly-integrated chips
promises lower prices and more features. In the automotive market, for
example, automatic breaking, cruise control and other features found mostly
on top-of-the-line expensive cars can be expected on lower cost models.

FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prism Leisure ahead 38% but warns on first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prism Leisure Corporation, the USM-quoted computer games and music group,
yesterday reported a 38 per cent profits rise, but a warning that trading in
the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> of the current year had been 'somewhat disappointing'
pushed the shares down 5p at 167p.
<PERSON>Mr Geoff Young</PERSON>, chairman, said the <DATE>Christmas quarter</DATE> remained the company's
most significant trading period.
Pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to <DATE>April 2</DATE> rose to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds
1.33m) on turnover 24 per cent higher at Pounds 19.4m. Earnings per share
increased to 14.2p (10.4p) and a recommended final dividend of 3.03p makes a
total for the year of 4.18p (3.27p).
<PERSON>Mr Young</PERSON> said the computer games division, and in particular the
merchandising operation, once more performed strongly. The audio and video
side however, had a difficult year, with turnover reduced.
The German subsidiary had a good year, with both turnover and profits up,
while Prism's pub quiz offshoot made a marginally lower contribution than in
previous years, but still 'performed creditably', said <PERSON>Mr Young</PERSON>.
In its first full year within the group, <PERSON>Paul Lamond</PERSON> - mainly trading in
board games - performed in line with expectations and contributed 'a useful
profit'.

<LEADPARA>  MODERN BINOCULARS offer so much that choosing the right one can become
confusing.;   There are hundreds of models available, ranging from $10 sport
glasses to autofocus binoculars utilizing the latest in microchip technology
and priced at $700 or more.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Venture  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ARE YOU SETTING YOUR SIGHTS ON A PAIR OF
BINOCULARS?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the Active Life; See also related story on P. 7G of
this section; Gearing Up  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Before you shop, do some homework.;   (check) Are your binoculars going to
be primarily for viewing wildlife, sports, stars or a combination? Will you
use them in normal light, or in the shadows of late evening or deep forest?
Will they be routinely exposed to elements or relatively protected? Is
durability a factor?;   (check) How much are you willing to spend is the final
determination. If you are only going to use the binoculars once or twice and
leave them stored the rest of the time, you can probably get away with a
lower-priced model.;   Don't just settle on the cheapest pair. You will regret
it later. Generally, the higher the price the better the optical quality and
the more durable the housing -- to a point. Beyond <MONEY>$250</MONEY> to <MONEY>$300</MONEY> you probably
won't notice the difference.;   Here are some basic specifications:;   Power
or magnification determines how much an object is enlarged. A 7x35 binocular
magnifies seven times, or makes an object appear seven times closer. You will
find some binoculars with a 10x magnification, but unless you plan on using a
tripod stay away from these models. Any gain in magnification is lost by the
corresponding magnification of movement.;   Objective size refers to the
diameter of the front or objective lenses. A 7x35 binocular's objective lens
measures 35 millimeters across. Larger objective lenses allow more light
through and are better in low light situations.;   The "exit pupil" of a
binocular is determined by dividing the larger number by the smaller number.
For example, a 7x35 binocular has an exit pupil of 5mm (35 divided by 7). The
larger the exit pupil number, the more light is being transmitted to your
eyes. A 3mm to 5mm exit pupil is generally adequate for normal viewing. An
exit pupil of 7mm is best for low-light use.;   "Field of view" is the width
or amount of area that you are able to see through binoculars at 1,000 yards.
The field of view for a 7x binocular is normally seven degrees, or 369 feet.
This information is always printed on the instruction sheet if not on the
binocular body. Any binocular with a nine degree field of view or over is
considered a wide-field model. A wider field of view is helpful for wildlife
viewing.;   Prisms bend the light entering the binoculars, allowing you to see
an upright image with increased magnification and brightness.;   <PERSON>Porro</PERSON> prism
binoculars are bulkier and heavier, but offer an accurate sense of depth of
field. Roof prisms are more expensive, but offer a lighter and more compact
alternative with virtually the same features as a porro prism model. Depth of
field is not as good, however.;   Focusing is either fixed, center or
individual. Fixed is convenient, but loses in overall image quality and
versatility. Center focusing adjusts both eye-pieces at once and is usually
the preferred option. Individual focusing is a pain!;   Finally, opt for
waterproof housing -- which won't handle prolonged underwater submersions well
-- when the anticipated use is in dusty or moist environments.;   Here are
some tips on binoculars:;   (check) Never touch binocular lenses with your
fingers. Instead, remove grit and grime with a few puffs of a blower brush,
which can be found in most photo stores, and then brush away any remaining
particles. Remove haze and fingerprints by gently wiping with a lens tissue
dampened with a drop of lens cleaner.;   (check) Don't leave your binoc's in
the hot sun, the trunk of your car or anywhere heat may warp the casing.;  
(check) Keep your binoculars stored in a padded nylon or leather case. Add a
packet of silica gel to help absorb any moisture.;   (check) Only clean the
exterior of your binoculars with a lint-free cotton cloth or a silicon
impregnated cloth that some manufacturers supply with your purchase.  </TEXT>

   With mounting concern over the loss of free sporting
events on broadcast television, one of the country's biggest
cable operators is taking the unusual step of opposing a
professional team's plan to air its games exclusively on
cable.
   Comcast Corp., owner of the Philadelphia cable system, is
mounting a campaign to pressure the Philadelphia 76ers
basketball team to reconsider its plan to take the games off
broadcast television and sell them to the cable networks
PRISM and SportsChannel America for a higher fee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> is stirring up support among local politicians,
and got a boost from the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House
Telecommunications Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Edward Markey</PERSON>, who put out a
news release urging the 76ers to reconsider the deal.
   PRISM and the 76ers, who haven't yet closed the deal,
declined to comment. "We aren't going to debate our business
in the newspapers," says <PERSON>Donald Heller</PERSON>, vice president and
general manager of PRISM.
   <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> says that while getting the basketball games
exclusively on its system via PRISM might enhance its local
cable service and even help lure new subscribers, the <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> of
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> residents who don't subscribe to cable would be
deprived of the games. <PERSON>Brian Roberts</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION>,
says that is likely to alienate consumers and add to the
perception that cable is siphoning programming from broadcast
TV. Moreover, he says, it will increase his company's own
programming costs -- a bill that <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> will ultimately have
to pass along to subscribers.
   Even if <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION>'s campaign against the cable deal isn't
successful, it is still a shrewd public relations move. <PERSON>Mr.
Roberts</PERSON> held a news conference with local media on <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
and has been in contact with both the mayor's office and
local congressmen on the issue. Rep. <PERSON>Markey</PERSON>'s statement,
which <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> also made available, commended <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> "for putting the interests of the fan above profits,"
and said that depriving <LOCATION>Philly</LOCATION> sports fans of 76er games
would be "unconscionable."
   Cable operators are becoming increasingly sensitive to
charges that they may speed the demise of free sports on
television. Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> and others called for a
moratorium on new sports programming for cable TV, worried
that cable's foes would use the issue as part of an effort to
reregulate the industry. Many national events, such as
prizefights, are already exclusive to cable or available only
to a handful of cable subscribers that have pay-per-view
technology. A plan by <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National
Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cablevision Industries Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to show some
of the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympics on pay-per-view has also stirred
controversy.
   But the issue is particularly volatile on the local level.
At present, only one other major basketball team -- the <LOCATION>New
York Knicks</LOCATION> -- is exclusive to cable. Most local sports teams
currently split their games between cable networks like
<ORGANIZATION>SportsChannel</ORGANIZATION> and broadcast TV. However, with soaring
players' salaries and team owners eager to up the ante on
television rights fees, <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON> warns that the 76ers deal
may be just the beginning of a trend.
   "This issue is symptomatic of what is going on in
professional sports," says <PERSON>Mr. Roberts</PERSON>. "If this trend
ultimately ends up with no sports on broadcast television, I
believe it is bad business and bad policy."
   Other cable operators and industry experts agree that the
trend is worrisome, both for the cable industry and for
sports teams. <PERSON>Paul Bortz</PERSON>, whose <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bortz &amp; Coddington</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> consults with cable companies and sports teams over
rights issues, says he recommends against such exclusive
deals. "For a team to retain broad popularity in a community,
it needs to keep a minimum of ten or fifteen games on
broadcast TV," he says.
   Although terms of the 76ers deal under discussion with the
cable network weren't made public, the cable network is said
to be offering a premium of about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> more than the amount
the team was offered by the local broadcaster which had been
airing the games. <PERSON>Mr. Bortz</PERSON> notes, however, that higher fees
don't translate into retained loyalty from fans. Unlike a
national sporting event, such as a boxing match, "circulation
at the local level is just crucial" for teams such as the
76ers, he says. "A franchise's popularity is a very fragile
thing."
   PRISM and <ORGANIZATION>SportsChannel</ORGANIZATION> are both owned by the cable joint
venture of <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cablevision</ORGANIZATION>. PRISM is a premium channel
for which subscribers must pay extra, while <ORGANIZATION>SportsChannel</ORGANIZATION> is
offered as part of the basic cable package. Under the
contract for the just-completed 76ers season, PRISM carried
all the team's home games while local broadcast station
WPHL-TV aired away games. Under the proposed new deal, the
games would be split between PRISM and <ORGANIZATION>SportsChannel</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> carries both services on its cable system.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its computer games division helped Prism Leisure
report record profits for the 12 months to <DATE>March 28</DATE>.
Shares of the USM-quoted group rose 10p to 150p after the announcement of
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.33m, up 37 per cent on the comparable Pounds
975,000. Turnover improved to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.5m).
<PERSON>Mr Geoff Young</PERSON>, chairman, said the computer games side had exceeded
expectations: 'The customer profile has continued to improve and now covers
many major retailers,' he said.
The audio and video operation maintained profits in difficult trading, but
the German subsidiary, which began trading last <DATE>July</DATE>, produced an
'encouraging' profit, <PERSON>Mr Young</PERSON> said.
Cash balances at the year-end amounted to Pounds 1.5m.
A proposed final dividend of 2.37p brings the total to 3.27p - a 20 per cent
rise - covered over three times by earnings of 10.4p (8.4p) per share.

  [Abstract] A technical sighting system for prevention of 
railroad train collisions is being designed, a major role being 
assigned to semaphores. Its three basic tasks are to detect 
objects (obstacles), to identify them, and to decode their 
encoded position. A telephoto camera with an optoelectronic 
receiver of semaphore lights feeds images to a detector (image 
converter). The latter sends signals to: 1. an object identifier 
followed by a semaphore lights color analyzer, 2. a 
stereorangefinder, 3. a path analyzer. A generator of brake 
activation signals, upon receiving signals from these three 
sources, transmits an output signal to the brake servomechanism. 
The stereorangefinder and the tracking device are interfaced, 
the latter sending signals to a light source for the road. In 
the stereorangefinder a right prism with mirror faces is placed 
symmetrically between two terminal reflectors of incident light. 
This prism combines the light coming from both reflectors into a 
single beam and sends that beam through an intensity regulator 
into an objective followed successively by a focus magnifier and 
a beam splitter. Two hoods, one around each reflector, prevent 
entry of sunlight or the headlight beam of a train into the 
system. The spectral sensitivity band of the system is 0.45-0.90 
?m, which covers both visible and near infrared light so that 
the system can respond to semaphore lights of all three colors: 
green (0.51-0.55 ?m) - yellow (0.57-0.59 ?m) - red 
(0.62-0.78 ?m) semaphore lights. Object-obstacle 
identification is based on geometrical characteristics. The 
color of a semaphore light is identified by spectral 
discrimination. The path analyzer has an autointerrogator with 
an exclusive-NOR gate, and a decoder followed successively by a 
comparator, a memory, and an autoresponder. Figures 4; 
references 3.

<PERSON>Marion Gail Weiss</PERSON> held up her slender hands, palms facing inward, in front of 
her to make the point. "I had this image," the architect says, "of women's 
hands, all those women's hands and the unrecognized work those women did." 
</P>
<P>
Soon that image will be transformed into a centerpiece -- of 10 triangular 
prisms of glass -- in a monument to the women of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> who have 
served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, a 31-year-old assistant professor of architecture at the <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Maryland</ORGANIZATION> for the last year, and <PERSON>Michael Manfredi</PERSON>, 36, an architect in <LOCATION>New York 
City</LOCATION>, were announced recently as the winners of the competition to design the 
memorial, which was authorized by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>. It will cost <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> -- 
to be raised by private funds -- and is scheduled to be completed by <DATE>1992</DATE>. The 
site, which is at the Memorial Gate Area at <LOCATION>Arlington National Cemetery</LOCATION> -- 
where millions of Americans pay their respects to the country's war dead -- is 
directly across from the <LOCATION>Lincoln Memorial</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge was the sensitivity of the site and the sensitivity of the 
subject -- the role of women in the military. For too long, they have been 
unseen," <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"This sheds light on their unrecognized achievements," added <PERSON>Manfredi</PERSON>, her 
design partner. "We didn't want this to be garish or upstage any of the other 
sites. We wanted this to be part of the family of monuments." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wilma L. Vaught</PERSON>, the retired <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> brigadier general who is president of 
the nonprofit Women in <ORGANIZATION>Military Service</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>America Memorial Foundation</ORGANIZATION> that 
oversaw the selection process, praised the design, which will feature 39-foot 
prisms and incorporate the main features -- the wrought iron gates, the curved 
wall known as the "Hemicycle" and wide plaza -- already on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful monument and representation of women's contribution to the 
military," she said. "It is also very uplifting." The announcement of the 
winning design had been made to coincide with <ORGANIZATION>Veteran</ORGANIZATION>'s Day, she said, and to 
celebrate the commemoration of <ORGANIZATION>National Women</ORGANIZATION>'s Veterans Recognition Week. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> explained the symbolism of the design, selected from among 137 entries in 
the competition. In addition to the 10 prisms -- "hands by day, illuminated 
candles by night" -- there will be four staircases leading from the ground 
level to a terrace. "They symbolize the slow passage for women, their struggle 
and ascent in the military," <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In her chosen field of architecture, <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> said she wished there were fewer 
barriers for women as well. "I wish I could say it was easier," she admitted, 
"but it is difficult for women to get ahead. But I'm optimistic that there are 
more and more role models for women." 
</P>
<P>
This professional pairing began in <DATE>1984</DATE> when <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> -- a <DATE>1983</DATE> graduate of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Yale School of Architecture</ORGANIZATION> -- joined the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> architectural firm of 
<ORGANIZATION>Mitchell Giurgola</ORGANIZATION>. There she met <PERSON>Manfredi</PERSON>, who had graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Cornell</ORGANIZATION> with 
a master's degree in architecture in <DATE>1979</DATE>. The two joined forces for such 
clients as <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Volvo</ORGANIZATION>. They also became friends, the kind of friends who are 
apt to finish each other's sentences. They even look somewhat alike: they are 
slight, dark-haired and partial to black clothing. 
</P>
<P>
When they chose to branch out on their own <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, they decided to open 
offices in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Manfredi</PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Winston 
Churchill High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION>, had family. 
</P>
<P>
So far, their combined work has been included in an exhibit organized by the 
Architectural League of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> called "Vacant Lots" for their design for 
low-income housing in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, who divides her time between <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, is also at work on an apartment project on upper Fifth 
Avenue in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nothing prepared them for this professional breakthrough. "We're really 
still starting out," she said. "This is an amazing feeling for us. We're very 
thrilled to have won. It is an amazing opportunity for us." 
</P>
<P>
Although they were paid <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> as one of four finalists in <DATE>June</DATE> to go into the 
second phase -- completion of a scaled-down model -- and will be paid <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> 
for their continued work on the project, not large sums by architectural 
project standards, they agreed it was not a labor for money. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Weiss</PERSON>, who grew up near <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, recalled that her father had served in 
the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in the late <DATE>1940s</DATE>. And <PERSON>Manfredi</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Dorothy</PERSON>, served as a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Army</ORGANIZATION> nurse for 11 years, beginning in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> during World War II. It was 
<PERSON>Dorothy Manfredi</PERSON> who first showed her son the clipping about the competition 
and urged the duo to enter. 
</P>
<P>
When the monument opens, women will be able to place their hands at the base of 
the prisms where women's memories of their military experiences will be 
inscribed. They will be able to stand inside the monument and walk the curved 
time line, which will explain women's role in the military since the 
Revolutionary War. They will also be able to enter the heart of the monument 
and use computers to read the register of names of women who have served their 
country. (For <MONEY>$25</MONEY>, any woman who has served in the military can register to be 
included in the computer files; it is part of the ongoing effort to raise money 
to complete the memorial.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited about the idea of people coming to this memorial," <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> 
said. "Women who've served in the military will bring their grandchildren and 
tell their stories and later their children will come telling the stories. The 
thing that's unique is that it doesn't commemorate dead people, but it 
commemorates all those who served. It's also a living memorial and will be 
there to tell a story and to inspire all those women who will serve in the 
future."

  [Abstract] An optical <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> network with a four-function 
optical exchange-switch for a digital optical switching network 
is presented. The principle of the optical implementation of the 
four-function exchange-switch and <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> network via an 8-pixel 
liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) and special 
polarizing prisms is discussed in detail. The optical system and 
experimental results with twisted-nematic liquid crystal plates 
are given. 
  Figures 1, 3, 4, and 6, reproduced below, show an <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> 
interconnection network (<LOCATION>P.S.</LOCATION> = perfect shuffle, <ORGANIZATION>A-L</ORGANIZATION> are the 
twelve 2 x 2 switches), a schematic diagram of the optical <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> 
network with four-function optical exchange-switch (I and II are 
polarizing optical prisms, lines AB and CD indicate polarizing 
films, C[.sup]0[/] and C[.sub]4[/] are two of the eight 
pixels in the LCSLM, and PB[.sup]1[/] and PB[.sub]2[/] are 
prism blocks), the four states of the exchange-switch 
corresponding to the different states of the liquid-crystal 
pixels, and a schematic diagram of the optical <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> 
interconnection network with four-function optical 
exchange-switch arrays, respectively. Figures 2, 5, and <DATE>7</DATE>, not

<TEXT>     Once you've entered enough data, you can view or print your family tree,
culled from the thousands of names you input. Then, when you want to find
about more about <PERSON>Uncle Max</PERSON>, who homesteaded near <LOCATION>Devils Lake</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>, back at
the turn of the century, you simply search for Max.;    You'll need a hard
disk and 640 kilobytes of random-access memory to run Prism. A free version
can be found on computer bulletin boards. It's limited to 50 people but will
give you a good idea how the program works. The full-blown version costs <MONEY>$44</MONEY>
and can be ordered from <PERSON>Gary R. Austin</PERSON>, <DATE>1459</DATE> Tenth St., <LOCATION>Grand Rapids</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>
49504. Austin also will send you the limited bulletin board version for <MONEY>$5</MONEY>, to
cover shipping.;    PROFESSIONAL MASTER KEY -- If accidentally formatting your
hard disk is a recurring nightmare, get yourself a backup program, such as
Backup, and use a utility such as <ORGANIZATION>PMK</ORGANIZATION> that will bring back those files. Aside
from its unformat features, <ORGANIZATION>PMK</ORGANIZATION> also will show you a directory of any kind of
hard or floppy disk, unerase files, find files using wild cards, sort files,
delete files, rename them and even let you edit text files with a text editor
called Tiny Edit. If security is a concern, <ORGANIZATION>PMK</ORGANIZATION> will erase all data from a
hard or floppy disk or erase all data from a particular file.;    If <ORGANIZATION>PMK</ORGANIZATION>
sounds like it's a cross between Xtree and the <ORGANIZATION>Norton Utilities</ORGANIZATION>, two
commercial utilities, it is similar, but, as with most shareware programs, it
costs a lot less. If you're downloading <ORGANIZATION>PMK</ORGANIZATION> from a bulletin board, look for
Version 3.2. To register, send <MONEY>$35</MONEY> to <ORGANIZATION>Public Brand Software</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 51315,
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION> 46251.;    HOME INSURANCE -- There are a lot of good
reasons for taking inventory of your worldly possessions, not the least of
which are the possibilities of theft or fire. This shareware program takes you
by the hand on a tour through your home. As you catalog your possessions,
you'll be prompted for serial numbers, descriptions and replacement costs,
among other details.;    The folks at Homecraft Software recommend that you
take a day for this task. It's a day well spent because insurance companies
like to have the cold, hard facts when you're faced with a loss. This program
also lets you figure out how much insurance you need, and it lets you group
special items that may require additional insurance. Then you can print
reports and make some intelligent decisions about how much insurance you
need.;    To register for Home Insurance, send <MONEY>$62.95</MONEY> to <PERSON>Steve Hudgik</PERSON>,

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Life company farms out
derivatives management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confederation Life, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s fourth biggest life company, has passed on the
management of its derivatives portfolio to <ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets</ORGANIZATION>.
Many companies have become increasingly nervous about using derivatives,
following losses in recent months by <ORGANIZATION>Metallgesellschaft</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble</ORGANIZATION>,
and others.
While it is highly unusual for a company to farm out all its derivatives
management to an outside specialist, the growing need for sophisticated
operational controls and computer systems when using derivatives has made it
increasingly difficult for companies to manage risk effectively in-house.
SBCM will take over the risk management activities of <ORGANIZATION>Confederation Treasury
Services</ORGANIZATION> under guidelines and policies set by the company. 'We will manage
their books, but some transactions will require authorisation,' said SBCM.
It will use its Prism front-to-back office system, developed in-house, to
perform services such as daily valuation, risk analysis, trade
confirmations, payments and rate resets.
Prism supports <ORGANIZATION>SBCM</ORGANIZATION>'s current portfolio of over 10,000 swap transactions in
17 currencies. SBCM's <ORGANIZATION>Derivatives Products Group</ORGANIZATION> has 170 employees in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>, having poached teams from <ORGANIZATION>Pru-Bache</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Security
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE>.

The Beijing-owned Bank of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> opened for business in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> in a 
70-story, prism-shaped skyscraper that dominates the city's skyline and has 
sparked superstitious worries among residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,289-foot-tall skyscraper, designed by Chinese-American architect <PERSON>I.M. 
Pei</PERSON>, is the tallest building in the British colony, which is to be handed back 
to the Communist mainland in <DATE>1997</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's four right-angled triangular prisms, placed together to form 
a long, thin square column topped by twin antennas, have been condemned by many 
of the territory's superstitious residents. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars of fung shui -- literally the study of wind and water -- say the 
building's design is a sure sign of bad luck. The sharp edges on the 
interlocking triangles that make up the sides of the building are said to be 
like daggers, the twin antennas that top off the tower like empty chopsticks. 
Both symbols are bad omens, according to fung shui. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the more superstitious residents living near the building have hung 
small mirrors outside their windows to reflect the tower's bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The project ran eight months behind schedule and <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> over 
budget.

<HEAD>Air Force Has Champagne Taste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> has spent hundreds of <MONEY>millions
of dollars</MONEY> on gold-plated chandeliers, golf course projects and
other luxuries to boost morale, internal <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> documents show.
   Back in <DATE>1985</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> decided to refurbish its officers'
club at the <LOCATION>Mildenhall</LOCATION> base in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> at a cost of <MONEY>$75,000</MONEY>. The
service's champagne taste, however, hardly matched the appropriated
amount.
   Gold-plated chandeliers valued at <MONEY>$145,000</MONEY> were installed, solid
oak paneling lined the walls and fireplaces with marble fixtures
completed the decor. The final tally was more than <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> with
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> taxpayers picking up the tab.
   The internal <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> audits, conducted in <DATE>April</DATE> and <DATE>May of
this year</DATE>, reveal widespread waste and abuse in the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
management of its Morale, Welfare and <ORGANIZATION>Recreation Activities</ORGANIZATION>.
   Golf course projects at <ORGANIZATION>Myrtle Beach Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> cost nearly
<MONEY>$600,000</MONEY>, while parties for a departing officer at <ORGANIZATION>Ramstein Air
Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> totaled <MONEY>$26,000</MONEY>.
   In a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON>Barbara
Boxer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, called for leadership from the highest levels of
the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> to crack down on these abuses.
   The documents reveal ``a mindset among some senior <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
officials that the bases they command are their own personal
fiefdoms, with appropriated funds to be used at their discretion
regardless of law and regulation,'' <PERSON>Boxer</PERSON> said in the letter.
   According to the documents, strict restrictions on excessive
spending on renovation projects have been either ignored or
circumvented. Projects valued at more than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> must be
reported to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. In some instances, however, major projects
were split into smaller projects to avoid seeking congressional
approval.
   Even the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> auditors expressed dismay at the renovation
projects.
   In the documents, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> management at the base in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
argued that the chandeliers couldn't be standard-issue.
   ``Low quality chandeliers could not act as the main
architectural highlight of a room as the existing chandeliers do.
The crystal used would not have the capability to break apart the
available light in a room into its primary colors (prism effect),''
the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In response, the auditors said ``spending an additional <MONEY>$15,900</MONEY>
in appropriated funds to purchase chandeliers that have the correct
`prism effect' is not appropriate.''
   Other instances of abuse include relocation of a skeet shooting
club at <ORGANIZATION>Tinker Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>. The estimated cost of
the project was <MONEY>$722,000</MONEY> and it was included in the cost of a
construction project for basing of the B-2 stealth bomber.
   But when it was discovered that the project was <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> over
budget, the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> proposed eliminating the work stations at the
facility rather than the <ORGANIZATION>Skeet Club</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I find it appalling that the weaknesses in the management and
oversight of Morale, Welfare and Recreation operations have been
repeatedly documented by <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> auditors,
whistleblowers and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, that <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY>
are being illegally spent on parties, golf courses and officers
clubs, yet internal recommendations to remedy the problems have
been ignored,'' <PERSON>Boxer</PERSON> said in the letter.

<TEXT>
   A grove of bronze trees, a cluster of
illuminated glass prisms and a platform overlooking <ORGANIZATION>Arlington
National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> were among features of surviving designs <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
the first phase of competition to select a memorial to women in
military service.
   The ultimate winner from the finalists will be selected in
<DATE>November</DATE> by five judges.
   Retired <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Wilma L. Vaught</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Women
in Military Service</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>America Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> prizes were
awarded to three teams.
   They were <PERSON>Teresa Norton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tybee Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, and associates
<PERSON>Cleve Harp</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Overholt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sergio Chavarria</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter S. Christman</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Martha Enzmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ming T. Shaing</PERSON>; <PERSON>Gregory A. Galford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maria L.
Antonis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>; and <PERSON>Michael A. Manfredi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and
associates <PERSON>Marion G. Weiss</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ellen D. Sands</PERSON> and <PERSON>Thomas Schumacher</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The memorial is to be built with private funds with ground
breaking by <DATE>1991</DATE>, in accordance with legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1986</DATE>. It is to be located at, and is designed to complete, the
memorial gate of <LOCATION>Arlington Cemetery</LOCATION>. The gate was left unfinished
during the Depression.
   Harp said the grove of 49 trees in the <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> team's design was
designed to symbolize a guard of sentries. He said an underground
hall would be lit from above through a glass floor allowing the
shadows of the trees to fall into the hall. The plan also calls for
a waterfall in connection with the pool that is a feature of the
memorial gate.
   <PERSON>Galford</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> team's design would include a
spiraling ramp recessed into the four-acre site in front of the
gate. He said it also would include rooms dedicated to women's role
in each of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s wars, and a platform overlooking the cemetery
and the grave of <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Manfredi</PERSON> said the New York-Washington entry would involve 10
clear glass prisms, illuminating exhibits telling the story of women
in the military. The spires would be about 18 feet high, he said.
The 10 niches of the existing structure would be pierced by stairs
and become gateways to the cemetery.
   Gen. <PERSON>Vaught</PERSON> said judges recommended making a fourth entry,
submitted by <PERSON>Stephen D. Siegle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margaret Derwent</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, an
alternate in case one of the other three dropped out. Instead, she
said, the foundation chose to makle the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> entry an additional
finalist, although its designers did not share in the prize money.
   Unlike the other entries, the Siegle-Derwent design calls for
building an educational-cultural center.

METALRAX, the engineering group, is the ideal candidate for a bit of
profit-taking and deputy chairman <PERSON>Douglas Hammond</PERSON> clearly feels the same
way. He sold 150,000 shares at 120p leaving himself with 346,000.
When interim results were announced at the end of <DATE>September</DATE>, the chairman
said the company looked forward to the coming year with greater confidence
than had been felt for quite some time. Brokers are forecasting profits for
the present year of Pounds 7.7m, rising to Pounds 8.2 in <DATE>1994</DATE>.
<PERSON>Geoffrey Simon</PERSON>, chairman of Prism Leisure, has sold 421,000 shares at 130p.
Business for this computer game wholesaler has been going well. The shares
have outperformed the market by over 100 per cent in the past 12 months and
the prospective p/e ratio for the year to <DATE>March 1994</DATE> is 11. PN <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON>,
chief executive of <PERSON>Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith</PERSON>, the quoted surveying
group, has sold 150,000 shares at 46p. Surprisingly, with just under 2m
remaining, <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON> is one of the smaller shareholders on the board. <PERSON>Ronald
Sinclair</PERSON> sold 750,000 at 47.5p on <DATE>September 13</DATE> so further selling would
indicate a clear trend.

      New Process May Boost
   Biodegradable Plastics
   ANTI-PLASTIC sentiments stirred by a mounting national garbage-disposal crisis have companies scrambling to rush biodegradable plastics to the market. 
But these materials all have one problem: starch. 

   Biodegradable products deteriorate as their molecules are eaten by microorganisms. 
Plastic molecules, however, are too big for microorganisms to consume. 
So, the molecules are mixed with starch, which the bacteria or fungi can eat, breaking the plastic molecules down into smaller, bite-sized pieces. 
But starch also weakens plastic's structure and can introduce microorganisms into food packaging. 

   <PERSON>Ramini Narayan</PERSON>, the head of organic and polymer research at <ORGANIZATION>Purdue University</ORGANIZATION>, has overcome these difficulties with a process that has attracted the interest of such big plastics makers as <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mobil Corp</ORGANIZATION>. 

   To prevent microorganisms from devouring the plastic as it sits on a grocery shelf, <PERSON>Mr. Narayan</PERSON> uses cellulose acetate, a natural plastic derived from wood pulp, instead of starch. 
Cellulose acetate is prone to attack by microorganisms only after a reaction with soil changes its chemical structure to cellulose. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Narayan</PERSON> has developed a "copolymer" that grafts the molecules of cellulose acetate and synthetic plastics, which have different chemical structures, together in a "tight fit." 
The result, he says, is a plastic that retains its properties and yet is biodegradable in a landfill. 

   Wineries Profit Using
   Home-Made Nitrogen
   TO PREVENT wine from turning into vinegar, wineries use nitrogen to shield the alcoholic beverage from oxygen when it is being put into a barrel or bottle. 
Most wineries use highly pressured cylinders of liquid nitrogen. 
But the supercooled gas is expensive. 
So, some wineries have discovered a cheaper source of nitrogen. 

   Fetzer Vineyards of <LOCATION>Redwood Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, now uses a plastic membrane made by <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto Co.</ORGANIZATION> to extract nitrogen from air. 
"It is the first time that we're aware of any winery using this technology," says <PERSON>Alexander Snage</PERSON>, market manager for <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION>'s Permea division, which makes the Prism Alpha membrane. 

   Air separation membranes are a relatively young invention. 
The <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> chemical maker developed a first-generation membrane 10 years ago to separate hydrogen from nitrogen in ammonia, and carbon dioxide from methane. 
It developed the Prism Alpha two years ago and sold the technology to apple growers, who use it to blanket their plucked apples from oxygen, which extends the fruit's life up to nine months. 

   Air consists of <PERCENT>78%</PERCENT> nitrogen, <PERCENT>21%</PERCENT> oxygen and other gases. 
To separate the elements, compressed air is forced through the Prism Alpha membrane, which allows only nitrogen to pass through. 
"You can buy our system and produce nitrogen at the site at a fraction of the cost of having nitrogen shipped to your plant," says <PERSON>Mr. Snage</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Monsanto</ORGANIZATION>. 

   'Super Oxygen' Eases
   Environmental Problem
   SAFE DISPOSAL of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, once widely used as insulation in electronics and transformers, has been a nagging problem ever since they were found in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> to be deadly. 

   PCBs' virtues -- chemical stability and high heat resistance -- have made them difficult to burn. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> approves incineration, but the process gives off dioxin, which is substantially more toxic than PCBs themselves. 
So the safest method of disposal has been storage in sealed containers. 

   Chemists have tried unsuccessfully to render PCBs chemically harmless, which would allow them to be disposed safely. 
In fact, <PERSON>Donald Sawyer</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION>, who discovered a way to break down such chlorinated pesticides as DDT, and other chemists believed that PCBs couldn't be broken down. 

   Now <PERSON>Mr. Sawyer</PERSON> and his researchers at the university have discovered that PCBs can be made to react with an oxygen atom that has "a lot of energy," says <PERSON>Hiroshi Sugimoto</PERSON>, one of the researchers. 
They combined two oxygen atoms and added an electron to form a highly charged "superoxide ion," and found that it broke down highly chlorinated PCBs into harmless bicarbonate of soda and table salt. 

   A Process to Produce
   Wrinkle-Free Cottons
   TEXTILE MAKERS blend cotton with polyester or other synthetic materials to produce wrinkle-resistant fabrics. 
But polyester doesn't absorb moisture, so permanent-press clothes aren't as cool as those made from all-cotton fibers. 

   Now, <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> chemists say they have developed a way to make all-cotton, permanent-press apparel. 
The process also uses non-toxic polycarboxylic acids, while the method for making most current permanent-press fabrics involves formaldehyde, which has caused cancer in laboratory animals. 

   <PERSON>Clark M. Welch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bethlehem K. Andrews</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s research facilities in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> use four groups of chemicals, or "catalysts," to bind polycarboxylic acids to fibers, making them wrinkle-resistant. 
Fabrics are soaked in the acids and the catalysts, and then quickly heated for no more than 90 seconds at temperatures as high as 410 degrees Fahrenheit, which bonds the acids with the cellulose molecules of the cotton fibers. 

   The ability of these acids to make fabrics wrinkle-resistant has been known for nearly two decades, but chemists had found them impractical to use. 
Without the catalysts, the process would take hours. 
And at such high temperatures, "the fabric would burn up," <PERSON>Mr. Welch</PERSON> says. 
"The catalysts are the key."

It's easy to make this a video holiday season. Christmas videos for children 
can be inexpensive and the great majority are animated. 
</P>
<P>
Many are put together poorly with lazy animation and silly songs. There are, 
however, some grand exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mickey</PERSON>'s Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> tape and disc) has become a perennial 
favorite. It is a clever adaptation of the <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON> classic retelling 
the story of <LOCATION>Ebenezer Scrooge</LOCATION> in amusing Disney terms: <ORGANIZATION>Scrooge McDuck</ORGANIZATION> (who 
else?) is the repentant miser; <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> is <PERSON>Bob Cratchit</PERSON>; Goofy is <PERSON>Marley</PERSON>'s 
Ghost; <PERSON>Black Pete</PERSON> is the <ORGANIZATION>Spirit of Christmas Future</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong making it a Disney video <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. Very Merry Christmas 
Songs (<ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> tape) is a genuine crowd pleaser with <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON> and the gang singing 
12 holiday favorites including "Deck the Halls" and "The 12 Days of Christmas." 
Other Disney releases include A <ORGANIZATION>Disney Christmas Gift</ORGANIZATION>, a collection of Yuletide 
scenes from a variety of <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s animated classics; <ORGANIZATION>Jiminy Cricket</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Christmas, a celebration with Pinocchio's pint-sized conscience and his friends 
(including <PERSON>Mickey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> Pan and Snow White), and A <PERSON>Walt Disney Christmas</PERSON>, six 
vintage <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> cartoons including "The Night Before Christmas" and "<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s 
Christmas Tree." 
</P>
<P>
After <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s classic animation, everything seems to go downhill, although 
some may prefer the bite of <PERSON>Dr. Seuss</PERSON>' How the <PERSON>Grinch Stole Christmas</PERSON>, a 
faithful adaptation of the children's classic (<ORGANIZATION>MGM/UA</ORGANIZATION> tape). 
</P>
<P>
There's also a collection of seven classic cartoons from the <DATE>1930s</DATE> and <DATE>'40s</DATE> 
called Christmas Comes but Once a Year (Shokus tape, less than <MONEY>$13</MONEY>), including 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." A vintage <DATE>1952</DATE> "Howdy Doody" TV program, in 
which <ORGANIZATION>Howdy</ORGANIZATION> and Clarabell rescue <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> on Christmas Eve, is an added 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Don't dismiss other feature-length cartoons because the animation seems 
amateurish next to the Disney product. Some are worth your children's time: 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mr. Magoo</PERSON>'s Christmas <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> tape) is an unexpectedly superior 
adaptation of the <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> tale with an original musical score by <PERSON>Jule Styne</PERSON>. 
This animated special should keep you and your children satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
George and the Christmas Star (<ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> tape) is an amusing story about a 
lonely man who wants to get a star out of the sky for his Christmas tree and 
comes back with a lot more than that, including the gift of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
A <PERSON>Charlie Brown Christmas</PERSON> (HiTops tape) is one of the popular TV productions 
based on <PERSON>Charles Schulz</PERSON>'s cartoon strip. Poor <PERSON>Charlie Brown</PERSON> will make any child 
feel good about being him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas on Sesame Street (<ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> tape) Big Bird, <PERSON>Bert</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ernie</PERSON> and the 
rest of the gang offer intelligent commentary, and there is a surprisingly 
moving adaptation of O'Henry's classic Christmas story "The Gift of the Magi." 
</P>
<P>
You're on your own with many animated specials featuring familiar cartoon 
characters (listed below). Only choose them if your children are particular 
fans of the character. Forget any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Casper's First Christmas" (<ORGANIZATION>Worldvision</ORGANIZATION> tape) has the friendly ghost joined by 
<ORGANIZATION>Yogi Bear</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Boo Boo</PERSON> and Huckleberry Hound; "The <PERSON>Berenstein</PERSON> Bears' Christmas 
Tree" (<ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> tape) is typical stuff with Papa Bear trying to find the perfect 
tree; "Raggedy <PERSON>Ann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andy</PERSON> and the Great Santa Claus Caper" (MPI tape); 
"B.C.-A Special Christmas" (<ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> tape) lives up to the cartoon strip's 
potential; "Glo Friends Save Christmas" (<ORGANIZATION>Vestron</ORGANIZATION> tape) is pretty routine stuff 
only for those who bought the toys featured in the made-for-TV special; 
"Christmas Comes to Pac-Land" (Goodtimes) has Pac-Man helping <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION>; 
"Rudolph's and Frosty's Christmas in <DATE>July</DATE>," "Frosty's Winter Wonderland and the 
Leprechaun's Gold" and "Rudolph's Shiny New Year" (<ORGANIZATION>Lightning Vestron</ORGANIZATION> tape) 
feature the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Snowman in pretty silly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other animated videos: "Silent Night" and "The Night Before Christmas" with the 
voices of the <ORGANIZATION>Obendorf Boys Choir</ORGANIZATION> (Media tape); "Pinocchio's Christmas" 
(<ORGANIZATION>Vestron</ORGANIZATION> tape) features the voice of <PERSON>Alan King</PERSON>; "Christmastime for Teddy 
Bears," a read-along video musical; "A Star for Jeremy" (<ORGANIZATION>Lorimar</ORGANIZATION> tape) explains 
why there is a star at the top of Christmas trees; "Snow White Christmas" 
(Prism tape) brings back a poorly animated Snow White who battles a poorly 
animated Evil -ueen so the kingdom can have a Merry Christmas; <PERSON>Calvin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>'s 
elf, stars in "<LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>'s Christmas Elf" (<ORGANIZATION>United Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> tape); "A Christmas 
Tree" and "Puss-'n'-Boots" (Prism tape) and "<LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION> and the Ice Cream Bunny" 
(<ORGANIZATION>United Entertainment</ORGANIZATION> tape) are more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for the perfect Christmas present, one that reaffirms the 
closeness of family in the best holiday tradition, then there is really only 
one to choose: A Child's Christmas in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Vestron</ORGANIZATION> tape). This is a 
sensitive, intelligent rendering of the <PERSON>Dylan Thomas</PERSON> memoir of a <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION> 
spent with parents and grandfather. <PERSON>Denholm Elliott</PERSON> is a perfect guide, and the 
cast captures <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>' words and memories with special grace and tender ness. 
It's a home video present for the entire family to view during the holidays 
because it affirms values of family, love and the spirit of <DATE>Christmas</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Another live-action Christmas video is <PERSON>Shari</PERSON>'s Christmas Concert (Fries tape). 
This is a one-woman tour de force by ventriloquist <PERSON>Shari Lewis</PERSON> (with an 
important assist from puppet Lamb Chop). If adults sometimes believe that <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> 
seems at times to suffer from a terminal case of cuteness, children still adore 
her. JOE <PERSON>SALTZMAN</PERSON>

  [Text] The outside world views the region of <LOCATION>Central Europe</LOCATION> 
through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations, Slovak Foreign 
Minister <PERSON>Eduard Kukan</PERSON> told <PERSON>Ildiko Nagy</PERSON>, our correspondent in 
<LOCATION>Bratislava</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Nagy</ORGANIZATION>] For <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION>, its relationships with the <LOCATION>Czech 
Republic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> are most important in the Central European 
region, at present. The latter is so in spite of the fact that 
it is not as we would like it to be, <PERSON>Eduard Kukan</PERSON>, Slovak 
foreign minister, told a Hungarian radio correspondent today. 
Then he continued as follows: 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Kukan</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Slovak</LOCATION>, fading into <ORGANIZATION>Nagy</ORGANIZATION>'s report in Hungarian] 
The outside world views this region in which we live, <LOCATION>Central 
Europe</LOCATION>, through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations. It is 
in the interest of the international organizations--and the 
minister was convinced of this as UN ambassador--to stabilize 
this relationship, so that the number of sources of tension in 
the world does not increase, so that this region does not 
constitute a serious problem for the international organizations. 
  The current <ORGANIZATION>Slovak Government</ORGANIZATION> observed with pleasure that 
its 
first statements, by which it would like primarily to encourage 
the Hungarian side to start a dialogue, were received favorably 
by its Hungarian counterparts, the foreign minister said. 
  To my question of whether the start of a dialogue could take 
place in <DATE>April</DATE>, <PERSON>Kukan</PERSON> replied that no decision had been reached 
on this yet, but a relationship ought to be developed between 
the two neighboring countries, regardless of the governments 
that happen to be in power. The Hungarian elections are the

  [Abstract] A comparison revealed that of two portable 
optoelectronic instruments that with a scanner based on a 
12-facet prism with differently tilted facets and matched 
optical channels has advantages with respect to angular 
resolution, image quality and nonparallelism of the axes over an 
instrument with a scanner based on five pairs of two-mirror 
rhombi with separate IR- and visible-wavelength channels. The 
two compared instruments are the OEP-1 and the OEP-2. A table 
gives their comparative technical specifications; a block 
diagram of the first identifies 12 components and a block 
diagram of the second identifies 14 components. These two 
annotated block diagrams are used in a detailed discussion of 
instrument structure and functioning. The comparison of the 
experimental and theoretical performance of the two types of 
systems revealed that in the OEP-1 its energy potential is not 
fully realized due to the great diameter of the entrance pupil 
of the optical unit and the lesser _D_T[.sub]equiv noise[/] 
level. Moreover, its angular resolution is poorer than for the 
OEP-2 both due to the lesser focal length (153 vs. 170 mm) and 
due to special features of the scanner and the presence of 
separate channels, resulting in the worsening of angular 
resolution. The angular resolution of the OEP-1 could be 
increased by increasing its focal length, but that would 
considerably increase its size and weight. The OEP-2 can ensure 
greater linear scanning fields than the OEP-1, which makes it 
possible to use photodetectors with a greater number of sensing 
elements. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (1):  Russians will decide their own future

Looking at <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> today can be done through three possible prisms. Through
one, we would see economic and political improvement, albeit springing from
 -and to an extent dragging with it - considerable chaos.
Through another, we would see a further and perhaps even more damaging
confrontation between political powers and or economic collapse - albeit not
leading back to a reassertion of a communist regime.
The final one is muddling through - albeit with a question mark over how far
'through' gets you, and to where.
Let us take the first, and most pleasant point. After the elections of <DATE>last
December</DATE> which produced such a strong showing for the right-and-left
nationalist groupings, the trimming of the radical reformers from the
cabinet did not result in an abandonment of economic reform. On the
contrary: in many ways the government under <PERSON>Mr Victor Chernomyrdin</PERSON>, prime
minister, squeezed more tightly on credit and inflation, to keep the latter
under 10 per cent a month - good by recent Russian standards.
In <DATE>March</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Michel Camdessus</PERSON>, the managing director of the <ORGANIZATION>International
Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>, went to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to agree a loan of Dollars 1.5bn as the second
part of a systemic transformation facility - a soft loan to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> which
assisted in generating further lending from the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and greater
international business interest and confidence.
At the same time, <PERSON>Mr Anatoly Chubais</PERSON>, the deputy premier in charge of
privatisation, has completed his great task of giving away Russian state
industry to the population in exchange for vouchers. The next phase, in
which the remaining shares will be bought for money and when, it is hoped -
and there are some signs that the hope is realistic - Russian and foreign
investment begins to restructure these companies, should now begin.
In part, this has been made possible by a political truce which contrasts
extremely favourably with the fevered and inimical relations which existed
between President <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> and his government on the one hand and the
former Supreme Soviet on the other for most of 1992-93.
The leaders of the two parliamentary houses are a presidential ally - such
as <PERSON>Mr Vladimir Shumeiko</PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>Federation Council or Upper House</ORGANIZATION> -
and a potential opponent turned ally, such as <PERSON>Mr Ivan Rybkin</PERSON>, speaker of the
<ORGANIZATION>State Duma</ORGANIZATION> or lower house.
Although an early vote by the <ORGANIZATION>Duma</ORGANIZATION> released the ringleaders of the
parliamentary revolt of <DATE>October last year</DATE>, a more recent one, in <DATE>June</DATE>,
confirmed a tight budget on a second reading in spite of intense pressure
from the military and industrial lobbies.
The constitution which was voted in on a referendum in <DATE>December 1993</DATE>
unambiguously confers most power on the president, greatly moderating the
struggle for primacy between the legislative and executive branches. The
armed forces - including the military, the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and the
re-vamped security force, the former <ORGANIZATION>KGB</ORGANIZATION> - are directly subordinated to the
president and so far continue to show loyalty of the kind which brought them
in on his side, if belatedly, in the confrontation with the Supreme Soviet
last <DATE>October</DATE>. Under this general peace, entrepreneurship thrives.
Especially in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St Petersburg</LOCATION>, the effects of this become more and
more obvious, as shops begin to transform themselves from mere distribution
points to much more attractive sales venues, as a wider range of goods
become available, and as competition begins between companies for customers.
Russian banks and financial companies, though many are still weak, now begin
to produce larger and more powerful entities which are beginning to shape up
to foreign competition and are training staff in the skills to make that
possible.
Let us take the second prism. Through it, one sees a political and economic
climate which is not peaceful, but static with ominous movements below the
surface. The tight budget has been passed by parliament, but most economists
and politicians believe it will be impossible to meet, and that it will
buckle before the military and other demands - sparking high inflation,
perhaps hyperinflation, by the end of the year.
Privatisation, though its first stage is formally accomplished, has mainly
made quasi-private monopolies of what were previous state monopolies - that
is, less under any kind of control which might have moderated their
predatory and uncompetitive behaviour.
The parliamentary lull is also temporary, on this view. It is the period in
which the opposition forces - especially the ultra-nationalist Liberal
Democratic Party led by <PERSON>Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky</PERSON>, the communists and others -
are extending their organisation and support, ready for an assault on the
presidency and the government later in the year when the economic situation
worsens.
The constitution is not really accepted by many of the political parties,
and may not prove robust enough to withstand any serious challenge.
President <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, though apparently recovered from a shaky period at the
beginning of the year which saw him disappear from view for weeks on end, is
still detached from government and is given to governing by decree through a
closed inner circle of advisers.
In the states surrounding <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, conditions are mostly worse - the Baltic
states, especially <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latvia</LOCATION>, are an exception. In particular,
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> continues to plunge downwards economically and to produce political
stasis - a state of affairs which impacts directly on <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, since the
Ukrainian region of <LOCATION>Crimea</LOCATION> is seeking closer ties with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and eastern
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> also supports a pro-Russian policy in contrast to the still-radical
nationalism of the west of the country.
The Caucasian states, though no threat, are extremely unstable, as is
<LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION>. The other Central Asian states are stable enough, but
desperately poor.
Crime is now an epidemic, from corruption to highly-organised Mafia-style
criminality. Official corruption means an assumption of bad and dishonest
government on the part of most of the public: the organised crime instils
fear, most of all in those trying to start or maintain businesses.
The last year has seen violent deaths of a number of bankers and prominent
businessmen: their fellows now huddle in heavily-protected offices behind
security guards. At a more mundane - but perhaps as damaging - level,
widespread tax evasion deprives the state of huge amounts of tax revenue and
contributes to its weakening as well as to the decay of the infrastructure.
A last turn of the prism. Muddling through - which might describe much of
the policy this year - has the attractiveness to the governing elite and to
many others of implying no radical change.
Inflation may go up, but may again be corrected. Politics will be at times
unstable, but no one powerful enough has enough stake in violent change to
attempt to institute it. Privatisation does not produce much improvement in
enterprise behaviour initially but, bit-by-bit, the better managers and
companies find it in their interest to modernise and restructure - leaving
the bad to decay and die, even if preserved long after effective extinction
to maintain employment.
The nationalists and the communists continue to exercise a malign influence
on policy, especially foreign policy - but not so much as to turn the
country back into autarky or outright hostility to the west, or to any other
group of states - <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is too weak for that kind of adventure.
<PERSON>Mr Yeltsin</PERSON> does not innovate but is not toppled: parliament does not bring
in the necessary legislation but does not make another grab for power: the
government does not fully control the economy but is not so weak as to lose
power entirely. Through all of this, the tender shoots of private enterprise
continue to grow as best they can - sometimes failing, sometimes partially
succeeding, but generally increasing.
No one can say which of these courses will be closest to the one which
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> takes: there are far too many imponderables. The west can assist
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to avoid the worst and can contribute at the margins by helping
Russians to help themselves wherever the goals are clear and achievable. But
ultimately, as always, the fate of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> depends on the Russians
themselves.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (6): New premium on training
 -Trends point to changing patterns of employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT drawn to <ORGANIZATION>Telford</ORGANIZATION> has been by far the most important factor in the
employment growth of <LOCATION>Shropshire</LOCATION>. For the medium term, at least, this trend
is likely to continue. But the shape of the labour force is changing in a
way which puts a premium on training.
At the time of the last census in <DATE>1987</DATE>, when the population of the county
was about 400,000, the number of jobs in the county was nearly 130,000,
roughly 10,000 more than in <DATE>1980</DATE>. But a breakdown of jobs, by district
council area, showed that at best there had been a marginal increase and in
some cases a small decline in job numbers in the <LOCATION>Bridgnorth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Shropshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oswestry</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Shrewsbury</LOCATION> and Atcham, and <ORGANIZATION>South Shropshire</ORGANIZATION> areas.
Only in the <LOCATION>Wrekin</LOCATION> district, which contains <ORGANIZATION>Telford</ORGANIZATION>, was there a marked
increase.
Work carried out by <ORGANIZATION>Prism Research</ORGANIZATION> for a county labour market assessment
commissioned by the new <ORGANIZATION>Shropshire Training</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Enterprise Council</ORGANIZATION> (TEC)
points out that between <DATE>1984</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>, 'Telford alone accounted for 95 per
cent of all new jobs. These trends are expected to continue to <DATE>1993</DATE> with
8,000 new jobs forecast throughout the county; 1,000 through natural growth
and 7,000 through the <ORGANIZATION>Telford</ORGANIZATION> effect.'
Projections of the <ORGANIZATION>County Council</ORGANIZATION> suggest that that between <DATE>1989</DATE> and the
year <DATE>2006</DATE>, the labour force could increase in size by between 22,500 and
40,000. The minimum figure is derived from forecast natural change and
migration. The maximum figure could be reached if there is a high level of
economic activity.
Two points emerge from these separate forecasts. First, if employment growth
is to be more evenly spread over the county in the next decades, land supply
for new commercial activity will have to be greater outside the Wrekin and
<LOCATION>Oswestry</LOCATION> areas. The decline in the rural economy will have to be halted by
welding new sources of employment on to farming and its associated
industries.
Second, although absolute numbers of jobs and people to fill them may
increase, the constituent parts of the labour force will gradually change,
thus demanding a change in the recruitment policy of companies in the
county. <ORGANIZATION>Prism Research</ORGANIZATION> has highlighted three features: a 16 per cent decline
in the number of school leavers, to 5,000, between 1989-93; a decline in the
number of those aged between 16 and 44 years; and increase in those older
than 45.
Against this background, the expected labour needs include not only
operatives for manufacturing industry but those with managerial,
professional and technical skills to underpin the growth of manufacturing
industry and those with clerical and secretarial skills to support it. The
services sector has already started to expand in the <LOCATION>Telford</LOCATION> area and
<LOCATION>Shrewsbury</LOCATION> traditionally has been a strong commercial centre with an
influence stretching into <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>.
Prism Research concludes that 'employers will need to consider alternative
labour sources such as women returners to meet recruitment needs' and,
because <PERSON>Shropshire</PERSON> traditionally has not had a strong demand for managers,
professionals and clerical staff, there is a growing necessity for 'more
employers to train and develop existing staff.'
Obviously, however, entrants to the labour force will be a minority. The
<ORGANIZATION>Shropshire TEC</ORGANIZATION> notes that, 'As 80 per cent of the employees of the year <DATE>2000</DATE>
are currently in employment, employers already hold the key to most of their
future labour needs. The competitiveness of individual businesses can be
greatly enhanced through an appropriately trained and skilled workforce.'
The responsibility for providing the framework in which this process of
skill enhancement, of matching skills to needs, of fostering commercial
acumen, now falls on the <ORGANIZATION>Shropshire TEC</ORGANIZATION>, which formally started operations
on <DATE>April 2 1991</DATE>.
The timing was less than encouraging. The onus of effort will fall on
companies currently coping with recession, historically the part of the
economic cycle when there is a tendency to cut spending on investment and
training. At the same time, the UK government is reducing spending on youth
and employment training; indeed, there is an abundance of local complaints
that, proportionately, <PERSON>Shropshire</PERSON>'s spending is being reduced by a greater
amount than the average national fall.
Certainly, in budgetary terms, the <ORGANIZATION>Shropshire TEC</ORGANIZATION> is one of the smallest of
82 around the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, with an overall budget for the financial year 1991-92 of
about Pounds 12m. Most of that will be spent on youth and employment
training, picking up the mantle of the <ORGANIZATION>Training Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Roy Knott</PERSON>, the chief executive, says that in the face of reduced
government spending, the TEC is 'spreading the pain evenly' among the
companies and institutions which provide training. The biggest of these is
<ORGANIZATION>Shropshire County Council</ORGANIZATION>, which forecasts expenditure on training in 1991-2
of Pounds 5.56m and income from it of Pounds 5.53m. Its training contract
with the TEC this year will be smaller than its contract with the <ORGANIZATION>Training
Agency</ORGANIZATION> last year.
The scale of the operation is indicated by the fact that in early <DATE>January</DATE>,
there were 2,402 people engaged in youth training throughout <LOCATION>Shropshire</LOCATION>,
while a further 4,700 were taking part in various adult training schemes,
including employment training.
Out of its overall budget, <ORGANIZATION>Shropshire TEC</ORGANIZATION> has some Pounds 2m to spend on
local initiatives and on enterprise support, largely the administration of
the enterprise allowance. Support for small business is crucial to the
growth of the county economy: 90 per cent of businesses employ less than 25
people and the self-employed sector has grown by 20 per cent since <DATE>1981</DATE>. The
growth has been most marked in the <LOCATION>Telford</LOCATION> area and least marked in the
south of the county.
It is a significant comment on the county economy that while the TEC is
seeking to devolve its encouragement of training and enterprise down to six
area boards, mirroring the district councils, it has also set up a special
committee of private and public sector leaders to do the same thing
exclusively for agriculture.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Since the <DATE>1980</DATE>'s, femtosecond (fs) lasers have been made 
primarily from <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> (colliding pulse mode-locked) dye lasers. In 
recent years, although the use of a Ti-doped sapphire laser to 
produce fs pulses appears to be very promising and is 
progressing very rapidly, the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser still remains an 
important tool in applied research on femtosecond science 
because the associated technology and equipment are more mature, 
devices are easier to obtain, more robust and stable. Earlier, 
the shortest light pulse produced by a <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser was 27 
fs.[.sup]1[/] Lately, a shorter pulse has been 
reported.[.sup]2[/] In this work, an 18-fs pulse is directly 
produced by a modified <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser. As far as the authors know, 
this is the shortest pulse ever produced by this type of laser. 
The auto-correlation curve of the pulse intensity shows that the 
pulse is an optical soliton. When the 27-fs pulse is compressed 
to 21 fs and 18 fs, the pulse reflecting higher orders of the 
soliton disappear. The pulse becomes close to a 
fundamental-soliton hyperbolic secant (Sech[.sup]2[/]) 
intensity profile. This is a new phenomenon not observed before, 
and indicates that the selection and tuning of <ORGANIZATION>SPM</ORGANIZATION> (spontaneous 
phase modulation) and GVD (group velocity dispersion) are 
critical to pulse compression. We believe that this is also an 
advantage of the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser in generating fs pulses. It is 
difficult for other types of laser to match it. 
<H5>  2. Experimental Principle and Setup </H5>
  The <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser has advanced considerably since 
<DATE>1981</DATE>.[.sup]3[/] The greatest improvement has been to install 
a four-prism group-velocity compensator.[.sup]4[/] This 
enables the laser to compress chirped pulses, in addition to its 
gain saturation effect and absorption saturation effect (the 
colliding pulses enhance the absorption saturation effect). It 
is analogous to the compression of the chirped pulses in an 
optical fiber by the negative group velocity of the material 
into a soliton pulse. Therefore, a <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser is also known as a 
quasi-soliton laser. These two pulse-compression mechanisms 
enable a <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser to produce shorter pulses, but also add to 
its complexity and variability. After taking the two 
pulse-compression mechanisms into account, the width of the 
Sech[.sup]2[/] pulse as a function of various parameters can 
be solved from the self-consistent equation of the optical field 
inside the cavity:[.sup]5[/] 
  _t_[.sup]2[/] = 1/g[.sub]0[/] (a[.sub]1[/] - 
a[.sub]2[/]x - b[.sub]1[/]y) (1) 
  where g[.sub]0[/] is the net gain at the center frequency 
_o_[.sub]0[/]. The first term in the parenthesis, 
a[.sub]1[/], is the gain dispersion term and it reflects the 
effect of the bandwidth of the pulse _D__n_. The larger 
_D__n_ 
is, the smaller a[.sub]1[/] becomes and the easier a short 
pulse can be obtained. In the third term, b[.sub]1[/] 
represents the gain change caused by fast saturation of the 
absorber, and y represents the pulse energy. In the second term, 
a[.sub]2[/] is the GVD and x is the chirp parameter. This 
term reflects the <ORGANIZATION>SPM</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>GVD</ORGANIZATION> compression effects. In a <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> 
laser, two nonlinear optical processes can produce <ORGANIZATION>SPM</ORGANIZATION> and also 
lead to chirping. One is a negative chirp caused by a 
reflectance change from a slow absorption saturation effect and 
the other is a positive chirp caused by the fast <PERSON>Kerr</PERSON> effect of 
the solvent in the absorber. Under normal conditions, the chirps 
generated by these two processes cancel each other because of 
opposite signs. The resultant net chirp is insignificant. 
Although pulse compression is possible by GVD tuning, the effect 
is not significant. The pulse width is primarily determined by 
the bandwidth of the gain. The narrowest width is 30-40 fs. We 
found that a higher pulse intensity inside the cavity not only 
enhances the gain and absorption saturation effects but also 
makes it easier to obtain a shorter pulse.[.sup]6[/] More 
importantly, the leading factor is to make the positive chirp 
produced by the fast <PERSON>Kerr</PERSON> effect of the absorber solvent far 
greater than the negative chirp produced due to dye saturation. 
It was calculated that when the peak pulse power is greater than 
0.2 x 10[.sup]6[/] W, the pulse has a larger positive chirp. 
It is easier to obtain a shorter pulse by way of negative GVD 
compression. At the same time, a larger positive <ORGANIZATION>SPM</ORGANIZATION> broadens 
the frequency spectrum of the pulse to lift the restriction 
imposed by the gain bandwidth. On the basis of this unique 
property of the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser, we made some improvements in areas 
such as resonant cavity design, dye concentration and pumping 
condition that result in a larger frequency bandwidth and a 
larger positive <ORGANIZATION>SPM</ORGANIZATION>. Thus, a suitable negative GVD compensation 
can be introduced by tuning the prism GVD compensator to obtain 
a narrow fs pulse. It is estimated that with a large positive 
chirp and an ideal GVD compensation, it is possible to compress 
a pulse from its normal width of 30-40 fs by a half. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> dye laser is a system comprised of six mirrors and 
four prisms. Compared to a classic <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> system, its unique 
feature is the use of an anti-symmetric folded cavity as a 
sub-cavity for its gain medium and absorber. This design not 
only provides better aberration compensation but also permits 
near-normal incidence and reflection at all mirror surfaces, 
i.e., a quasi-linear cavity.[.sup]7[/] This design improves 
the mode of the light beam to produce a TEM[.sub]00[/] 
output. The frequency band of the continuous light (without the 
absorber) is also significantly broadened and the tunable range 
is 580-620 nm. In the meantime, the system employs a 
shorter-focus pumping lens to lower the <ORGANIZATION>CW</ORGANIZATION> operating threshold, 
in turn raising the pulse energy inside the cavity. Furthermore, 
a thicker absorption coating is used to produce a larger 
positive chirp. All these measures make it easier to produce a 
shorter pulse. 
  The width of the femtosecond pulse from the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser is 
measured by a computer-controlled precision non-co-linear 
auto-correlator.[.sup]8[/] The frequency doubler <ORGANIZATION>KDP</ORGANIZATION> is 0.30 
mm thick and the accuracy of the instrument is less than 1 fs 
(single-pass). Human error is eliminated by using an IBM-PC to 
measure, calculate and plot pulse width. The power spectrum of 
the fs pulse is automatically recorded using a scanning 
monochromator. 
<H5>  3. Experimental Results and Discussion </H5>
  Figure 1 shows the intensity auto-correlation curves of a 
series of short fs pulses from the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser. The figure also 
shows the corresponding FWHM (full height half maximum) values 
(assuming a Sech[.sup]2[/] profile). The shortest pulse is 18 
fs. These short fs pulses were obtained under the same set of 
conditions, such as absorber dye DODCI concentration [congruent] 2 x 
10[.sup]-4[/] mol/L and pumping power [congruent] 6 W (full line), by 
carefully adjusting the position of the saturated absorber 
relative to the sub-cavity (approximately 100 ?m from the 
focal point) and the negative GVD compensation amount of the <ORGANIZATION>GVD</ORGANIZATION> 
prism to achieve a suitable balance between <ORGANIZATION>SPM</ORGANIZATION> and GVD. A 
shorter pulse corresponds to a less negative GVD compensation 
value. Figure 2 shows that when the pulse is compressed to less 
than 30 fs, higher-order soliton behavior becomes more apparent. 
There is a small base on each wing. When the pulse is compressed 
to below 20 fs, the bases disappear and the pulse agrees with 
the Sech[.sup]2[/] profile. Variations in pulse width and 
pulse base reflect the chirped pulse compression process. If the 
compression effect is greater than any pulse broadening effect 
due to other factors, the pulse behaves like a higher-order 
soliton. The upper part of the pulse is more compressed than the 
lower part, such as that shown in the intensity auto-correlation 
curve for the 27-fs pulse. This corresponds to the situation of 
a third-order soliton.[.sup]9[/] The energy at the base may 
be compressed to the center of the pulse or to somewhere far 
away, causing both sides close to the center to collapse to form 
a negative base. The pulse shape agrees with the 
Sech[.sup]2[/] profile. From the 21-fs and 18-fs intensity 
auto-correlation curves shown in Figure 1, this situation has 
been predicated by existing femtosecond pulse transmission 
theory. It will be discussed in detail in a separate paper. 

<FIGID=JPRS-CST-006-14A>      Figure 1. Intensity Auto-Correlation Curves for fs Pulses </FIG>



<FIGID=JPRS-CST-006-15A>      Figure 2. Power Spectra of the 27-fs Pulse (a) and 18-fs </FIG>


  The power spectra of fs pulses from the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser show that 
when the pulse is narrowed, the band is broadened and the center 
shifted toward the red. Furthermore, it exhibits a soliton pulse 
pattern. Figure 2(a) shows the power spectrum corresponding to 
the 27-fs pulse. It has a peak at 630 nm. It also has a wide 
band within a half-width of 620-635 nm and forms a spectrum 
seat. This is similar to the behavior of a soliton pulse 
observed by <PERSON>Mollenauer</PERSON> in his optical fiber 
experiment.[.sup]10[/] When the pulse is compressed to 21 fs 
and 18 fs, the base disappears, the pulse becomes more symmetric 
and the frequency distribution is also broadened. Figure 2(b) 
shows the frequency distribution of the 21-fs-wide pulse. Its 
FWHM is 17.8 nm. Its time-bandwidth product, i.e., 
_D_t_D__n_, 
is [congruent] 0.292, which is slightly less than that of an ideal 
Sech[.sup]2[/] curve of 0.315. However, it is far greater 
than that of an exponential decay (i.e., _D_t_D__n_ [congruent] 
0.11). 
This indicates that the pulse is close to a Sech[.sup]2[/] 
curve, rather than an exponential decay. The intensity 
auto-correlation curves for the 21- and 18-fs pulses shown in 
Figure 1 are in excellent agreement with the theoretical 
Sech[.sup]2[/] curves (dotted lines). 
  In conclusion, the shortest pulse obtained to date from the 
<ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> laser is 18 fs. Furthermore, its soliton behavior has been 
observed. This further demonstrates the superiority of the <ORGANIZATION>CPM</ORGANIZATION> 
laser as a distributive quasi-soliton laser and its capability 
to generate shorter pulses. We believe that even shorter pulses 
can be produced by modifying the dye composition, increasing its 
frequency bandwidth and improving its stability.

OSCAR <ORGANIZATION>Wilde</ORGANIZATION>'s best known work always had a claim to be the wittiest play in
the English language. In <PERSON>Nicholas Hytner</PERSON>'s exquisite new production at <LOCATION>The
Aldwych</LOCATION>, it wins the prize hands down.
Savouring the delights, I shall come to <PERSON>Maggie Smith</PERSON>'s Lady Bracknell last.
There is plenty more on show. The two parts that hit you most, almost as if
they had never been played before, are <PERSON>Claire Skinner</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Cecily</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margaret
Tyzack</PERSON>'s Miss Prism. This is a Cecily (remember the pronunciation - Sissely)
who will never be upstaged by <PERSON>Gwendolen</PERSON>. She may be a girl of 18 brought up
in the country, but she is fairly brimming with determination and
self-confidence: a Lady Bracknell in embryo. It is no disrespect to <PERSON>Susannah
Harker</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Gwendolen</PERSON> to say that this is the first time that <PERSON>Cecily</PERSON> seems to
be the better part. Ms <PERSON>Harker</PERSON> accepts the downgrading with grace.
The secret about <PERSON>Ms Tyzack</PERSON>'s Miss Prism is that she is really and obviously
attractive from the start: not at all the plain spinster sometimes
suggested. She is a very clever woman, and not ashamed of it. And that, too,
is one of the secrets of <PERSON>Hytner</PERSON>'s production: The Importance is presented as
a highly cerebral, even intellectual play. True, the women are more
intelligent than the men, but that only adds to the wit.
Possibly not everyone knows that 'earnest' was once the in-word for 'gay'.
That again adds to the fun: the young women in the play know this perfectly
well, which is why they love the name and <PERSON>Lady Bracknell</PERSON> has a particular
reason for disliking it.
Intellectual in-jokes abound. Take the frequent references to the German
language. Is it a precise or a romantic form compared to English? Note the
peculiarly modern use of the word 'entrapped' and <PERSON>Cecily</PERSON>'s near borrowing
from <LOCATION>Lear</LOCATION> in 'Never, never, never'. The Importance is such a good play that
you can enjoy it for the plot and the performances alone.
Hytner's production pulls out every stop. The sets by <PERSON>Bob Crowley</PERSON> get better
and better as we move from Half-Moon Street in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W something, to the
garden and then the morning-room at the <ORGANIZATION>Manor House</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Woolton</LOCATION>. There can be
few more pleasurable comic scenes than <PERSON>Gwendolen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cecily</PERSON> together at tea
outside the house. Remember the business of the sugar lumps.
If the men are intellectually inferior, they can still act. Watch the sudden
swelling in <LOCATION>Richard E Grant</LOCATION>'s cheek when, as Algernon dressed in mourning
clothes he confronts the brother he has invented, then banished. The facial
movements are even better than most of his lines.
With incidental delights like that, who needs Lady Bracknell and how can she
played in a way that seems fresh? Ms <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> triumphs by presenting Lady B as
an immensely well educated woman, up with the latest statistics and
intellectual fashions. To be sure, she is a snob to boot, but that makes her
the more formidable: she knows how to be a snob well. She also has a proper
respect for money and an understanding of investment.
Ms <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> deals with the famous 'handbag' line by taking it in her stride as
not being especially remarkable. Then she strikes: the stress comes a little
later with 'the line is immaterial'. This is a marvellous example of an
actress teasing the audience, then creating a new reading. See towards the
end, the way she says of Algernon: 'He has nothing, but he looks
everything.' Physical movements again crown the text. In short, this is a
perfect evening, and it adds to the pleasure that other women should be
allowed to run Lady Bracknell close.

   PARIS -- There are two rules about having a mistress in
France. The first is that an extramarital affair is
considered acceptable, even admirable, for a public figure.
The second is that the press never writes about it.
   "Adultery is part of French culture," shrugs Erik Emptaz,
the editor of Le Canard Enchaine, a satirical weekly that
regularly reveals the affairs, bar the amorous ones, of
France's predominantly male leaders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   How vulgar, the French say, to make an issue of the sex
lives of presidential candidates, <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justices and
others, as has been happening in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> "Can one still
court a woman in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> without moral terrorism
winning a complete victory?" sneered <PERSON>Anne Sinclair</PERSON>, a French
TV journalist, in an interview with film maker <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>.
"<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has always been extremely immature about sexuality,"
<PERSON>Mr. Allen</PERSON> replied.
   This veneer of self-righteousness is suddenly looking
fragile, however. The reason: A foreign upstart has breached
the unwritten French rule about unwritten French affairs. The
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> establishment is unnerved, wondering whether the rules
are still valid. If not, it frets, will those many discreet
liaisons turn out to be dangerous after all?
   "Taboos are not eternal," warned one news magazine,
L'Evenement <PERSON>du Jeudi</PERSON>, in a nervous commentary on the matter.
"We all hope it's not the thin end of the wedge," confides
the editor of a national daily.
   The main cause of this alarm is <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION>, a gossipy weekly
that is loosely modeled on People magazine of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
published by a French subsidiary of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann</ORGANIZATION>
group. Usually, it's filled with inoffensive tales of the
rich and famous. Then, in its issue of <DATE>Dec. 23, 1991</DATE>, it
gate-crashed the salon.
   In a breathless report headlined, "Their love shines
through the screen," <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION> linked <PERSON>Patrick Poivre d'Arvor</PERSON>, the
debonair but slightly disheveled anchorman of French TV's
most-watched news program, with <PERSON>Claire Chazal</PERSON>, his Dior-clad
colleague who reads the news at weekends. The report not only
claimed they were lovers, but gave details of how they
allegedly had met for many a clandestine rendezvous at a
hotel near the Arc de Triomphe.
   There were even pictures.
   The reaction was furious. "I was disgusted," says <PERSON>Mr.
Poivre d'Arvor</PERSON>, a 45-year-old who is married with four
children. "It left terrible scars." (<PERSON>Ms. Chazal</PERSON> hasn't
commented.)
   PPDA, as <PERSON>Mr. Poivre</PERSON> d'Arvor is often called for short, is
no stranger to publicity. The French press had a field day,
for example, when he visited <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> during the <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> crisis to
interview <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>, and met a French hostage couple who
begged him to save their baby. He smuggled the 18-month-old
out in his luggage.
   Nor did he hide his feelings for <PERSON>Ms. Chazal</PERSON>, 34. In an
interview published a month before the <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION> article, <PERSON>Mr.
Poivre d'Arvor</PERSON> said she had been "a very close friend for a
long time." Still, as a professional journalist, he says he
believes it is "very important that there are limits, yellow
lines that don't get crossed." Voici crossed, so he sued.
   French libel laws aren't like American ones. They place a
much stronger emphasis on protecting individual privacy than
free speech. Truth may not be a sufficient defense.
   At <ORGANIZATION>Prisma Press</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, there was "a huge
fuss for a couple of days," says one official. "It wasn't the
form so much as the content. The story read like a police
report." <PERSON>Axel Ganz</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Prisma</ORGANIZATION>'s president and a rising star at
<ORGANIZATION>Bertelsmann</ORGANIZATION>, says the article was "a mistake," and insists he
respects French traditions of privacy. The PPDA affair, he
adds, has been "settled." That's news to <PERSON>Mr. Poivre d'Arvor</PERSON>,
who says he hasn't heard from <PERSON>Mr. Ganz</PERSON> and is continuing with
his suit.
   If the affair were just a one-time incident unlikely to be
repeated, Parisian society could breathe easy. What is
troubling, however, is the suspicion that privacy isn't what
it used to be -- and that sex may sell as well in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> as
it does everywhere else.
   In the old days, the closest anyone came to writing about
affairs was when Le <ORGANIZATION>Canard Enchaine</ORGANIZATION> revealed that
then-President <PERSON>Valery Giscard</PERSON> d'Estaing had been involved in
a car collision with a milk delivery van very early one
morning. The paper didn't need to say more.
   But now, not only was the <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION> issue in question snapped
up, but it was quickly followed by cover stories about <PERSON>Ms.
Chazal</PERSON> in two rival magazines. Mindful of the legal pitfalls,
they dwelled mainly on her childhood (ordinary), her career
rise (rapid) and her blond hair (dyed). The only men
mentioned were her father and brother.
   The French establishment already had one eyebrow raised at
an equally surprising, albeit unrelated, breach of etiquette.
Just a few weeks previously, former Prime Minister <PERSON>Michel
Rocard</PERSON> had taken the extremely unusual step of announcing in
public that he was splitting up with his wife, <PERSON>Michele</PERSON>.
   The disclosure, in an interview in Le Point magazine, had
all the appearance of a pre-emptive strike. Although nothing
had appeared in print until then, the news about the
separation was well known in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mr. Rocard</PERSON> said he
hoped his statement would be the last word on the matter. "We
have the good fortune of not being afflicted by the American
syndrome," he said at the time.
   The French still claim to be indifferent to the private
affairs of public figures. "I don't see why the sentimental
life of people should play a role. The citizen isn't
interested," says <PERSON>Mr. Poivre d'Arvor</PERSON>, the anchorman, who also
hosts a public affairs program called "The Right to Know."
   "<PERSON>Axel Ganz</PERSON> is just trying to sell magazines," snarls
<PERSON>Patrick Mahe</PERSON>, the editor of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> Match, a longer-established
glossy weekly. "If a dancer from the <ORGANIZATION>Crazy Horse</ORGANIZATION> {a <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>
nightclub} told <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION> that she had had an affair 12 years ago
with a leading politician, people would laugh and say, aren't
you lucky, madam."
   <ORGANIZATION>Paris Match</ORGANIZATION>, insists <PERSON>Mr. Mahe</PERSON>, doesn't consider <ORGANIZATION>Voici</ORGANIZATION> to
be competition, and wouldn't dream of publishing anything
about people's love lives -- unless, of course, they happen
to be a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presidential candidate. Paris Match recently
devoted four pages to <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s alleged affairs,
including a picture of <ORGANIZATION>Gennifer Flowers</ORGANIZATION>.
   "There's a false morality," says <PERSON>Mr. Ganz</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Prisma Press</ORGANIZATION>.
Prominent people "employ PR people who behave wildly to get
you to publish things," he says, "and yet if you write about
who they are living with, then it's suddenly taboo."
