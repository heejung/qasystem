   This <ORGANIZATION>Media General-Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> poll is

<TEXT>
   This <ORGANIZATION>Media General-Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> poll is based
on telephone interviews <DATE>Nov. 10-20</DATE> with 1,084 adults in the
continental <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example,
for Republicans.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>

   As a substitute for the Republican plan for a tax cut that would raise federal revenues, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats are now officially offering a plan for a tax increase. 
Revenues aside, they just prefer high taxes. 

   Democrats of the now-dominant variety may have to agree that cutting the capital-gains tax to <PERCENT>19.6%</PERCENT> would raise revenues in the initial year (in our view also over the long term). 
Still, they complain, this is a tax cut that benefits only the "wealthy." 
And "the wealthy" should pay higher tax rates. 
So the <ORGANIZATION>House Democratic</ORGANIZATION> leadership has proposed to stop the capital-gains tax cut and instead increase the top rate on the highest personal incomes from <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT>. 
Since this change would affect only the very top tier of income, it wouldn't raise much money, but this is not the object. 

   Rather, <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats have been convinced that high taxes are good politics. 
They take their instruction from Majority Leader <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, who believes that his own presidential-primary campaign proved this is the way politics works before being swept aside by the invincible <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> juggernaut. 
So the pretty-much open object of the <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> rate is to punish success, and thereby garner the votes of the nonsuccessful. 
Voters are presumed to be too dimwitted to recognize that the <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> proposal is the camel's nose under the tent, to be followed by higher taxes for the rich, the near-rich, the not-so-rich and everyone else. 

   At long last, in short, the political choice that defined the past three presidential elections is now the central issue of congressional politics. 
As it has developed over the past few months, the battle over a capital-gains cut has produced for the American electorate a rare opportunity to understand the two ideologies now competing for their assent. 
Turning the <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> proposal into law would not only bust <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s promise not to raise taxes but also would displace the competing philosophy of government established by <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> over the eight years of his presidency. 

   The House Democrats have decided conclusively that the party's identity will sink or swim on the issue of taxes. 
They want more. 
The Democrats believe that the government is the most important institution in the nation's life, that the government exists to create programs and raise whatever taxes are necessary to fund those programs. 
It is really the most remarkable thing to see one of this country's major political parties espousing such a vision in the <DATE>late 20th century</DATE>. 

   By contrast, <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s support for tax cuts and his opposition to increased federal spending were based on his belief, stated at every opportunity, that the federal government and its great panoply of programs were smothering private initiative in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
He sought to reverse the Democrats' idea that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s growth and greatness depend on government initiatives and that the government is entitled to the taxes necessary to sustain and expand its responsibilities. 
It depends instead on letting all workers keep most of the country's newly produced wealth and on letting them decide, individually, how best to spend and invest the wealth their work has created. 
Under this regime, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is now experiencing its seventh straight year of economic growth. 

   Happily, not all Democrats have embraced the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> leadership's vision. 
The capital-gains cut now on the table was authored by a <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Democrat and supported by five Democratic colleagues on the <ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means Committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that he opposes the <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> plan. 
Connecticut's freshman Democratic Senator <PERSON>Joseph Lieberman</PERSON> recently wrote an eloquent plea to his party on this issue: 

   "The argument of some Democrats against a cut in the capital gains tax -- that the rich will benefit more than the rest of us -- misses the point and is politically divisive. 
Lower- and middle-income people won't realize most of the tax savings for the obvious reason that they have less capital, but they could get something better: a job, if they have none, or a better job, if they are underemployed. 
After all, the whole idea of a capital gains tax cut is to induce people who have capital to move it into new investments that will make <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> more productive and competitive and benefit all of us with greater economic opportunity and security." 

   Senator <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> and presumably some of his fellow Democrats recognize that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is not a land of seething, resentful workers bereft of opportunity. 
The populism being peddled by Rep. <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats reflects a complete misunderstanding of how <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> works and, not so incidentally, how <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> votes.

<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> lands in the middle of the pack
in rankings of life expectancy and death rates in 33 developed
nations, according to new figures from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> health officials.
   Atop the list: <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the average life expectancy is 75 years,
trailing <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> by 4.1 years, but beating the lowest of the 33,
<LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, by more than five years, the national <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease
Control</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The average Hungarian lives 69.7 years, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> also ranked near the middle of the 33 nations
in death rates from all causes: 828.4 deaths are reported for each
100,000 people each year. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was best at 628.8; <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> worst at
1,242.
   The leading cause of death in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, heart disease,
hits harder here than in other countries. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mortality rate
from heart disease was 382 per 100,000 per year for men and 214 for
women, compared with 339 and 206 in the other 32 developed
countries.
   Throughout the 33 countries, heart disease accounted for <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> of deaths, with cancer causing <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> and stroke
causing <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT>.
   Fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries _ about 1.5
million a year _ are attributed to smoking, the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Fewer Americans smoke, compared with the other countries; <PERCENT>31
percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> males and <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> of American females smoke,
compared with <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> of men and <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT> of women in the
other countries.
   ``The large number of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking
indicates that reduction of this risk factor would substantially
increase life expectancy in the developed world,'' the
Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study included countries defined as developed according
to a <DATE>1963</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> standard pegged to reproductive rates: countries
where the average woman has fewer than two daughters who,
themselves, survive their childbearing years.
   Such areas include the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, some Latin American nations, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study cited life expectancies and death rates in the
latest available statistics for each country, from <DATE>1984</DATE> to <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Life expectancies for the 33 countries: <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> 76.3 years,
<LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> 75.1, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> 74.3, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> 71.5, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 76.5,
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> 71.0, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> 74.9, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> 73.2, <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> 74.8,

<HEAD>Poll Says Americans Favor Arms Treaty But Don't Trust Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans overwhelmingly favor the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range nuclear missile treaty but share fears in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
that <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> cannot be trusted to comply, according to a <ORGANIZATION>Media
General-Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> poll.
   The poll also found that Americans view Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail
Gorbachev</PERSON> nearly as favorably as they do President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, and
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> out-polls <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> among college-educated Americans.
   Seventy-three percent of those polled in the national survey
supported the accord to eliminate medium-range missiles, and as
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nation's long-range
arsenal in half.
   But <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> said the Soviets can't be trusted to live up to
their arms control agreements. That reflected sentiment in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which last week demanded clarification of the anti-cheating
rules in the pact.
   The poll was conducted among a random sample of 1,204 adults
interviewed by telephone from <DATE>April 29-May 8</DATE>, ending less than a
month before <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> meet in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   As strongly pro-treaty as they were, a near-majority of
Americans were not willing to drop <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s proposed missile
defense system known as ``Star Wars'' in exchange for a Soviet
agreement to a big cut in nuclear arms. Forty-nine percent opposed
such a trade while just one-third supported it.
   The public was split on the issue along political and
ideological lines: Republicans and conservatives strongly opposed
dropping Star Wars for a big missile cut, while Democrats and
liberals favored such an agreement.
   Without an agreement, <PERCENT>56 percent</PERCENT> said work on <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> should
proceed as it is now or be increased, while <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> said it
should be reduced or dropped. There again was a political division:
<PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> of Republicans wanted work on Star Wars kept up,
compared with <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> of Democrats.
   Similarly, there was an ideological division in support for the
medium-range treaty and for a treaty, if one can be reached, to
halve the long-range arsenals. The pacts fared worst among
conservatives _ <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> were opposed _ and best with liberals,
whose opposition was in single digits. About <PERCENT>67 percent</PERCENT> of
conservatives and <PERCENT>83 percent</PERCENT> of liberals were in favor.
   The survey found broad support for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s handling of
U.S.-Soviet relations, with <PERCENT>71 percent</PERCENT> approving, and a high
positive view of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> generally, with <PERCENT>59 percent</PERCENT> rating him
favorably.
   Nearly as many _ <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> _ expressed a positive view of
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, the poll found. Among college graduates, <PERCENT>71 percent</PERCENT>
rated <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> favorably while <PERCENT>62 percent</PERCENT> viewed <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> favorably;
among those who have done postgraduate work, <PERCENT>76 percent</PERCENT> saw
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> favorably, compared with <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> favorable for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had the approval of the poll's respondents for his May
29-June 2 summit with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. Seventy-eight percent
said the president and the Soviet leader should meet at regular
intervals even without any major items on the agenda.
   The survey gave a mixed report on U.S.-Soviet competition.
Forty-one percent said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had more political
influence in the world and just <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> said the Soviets had
more political influence. Thirty-eight percent said the countries
were about equally influential.
   The rating was closer on military strength: <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> said the
Soviets were stronger militarily, <PERCENT>28 percent</PERCENT> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
was stronger and <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT> said the countries were about equally
strong.
   Poll respondents largely rejected the opinion of critics that
nuclear arms treaties may increase the chance of non-nuclear war. A
majority said the medium-range missile treaty would not make much
difference in the chance of conventional war in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and <PERCENT>26
percent</PERCENT> said it would decrease the chance.
   Just <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> said the treaty would increase the chance of
conventional war in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. That figure doubled, though, when
respondents were asked if abolition of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear
weapons would increase the chance of non-nuclear war; <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>,
still a minority, said it would.
   The poll had a margin of sampling error of three points. <ORGANIZATION>Media
General Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>,
publishes the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Times-Dispatch</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> News Leader,

<TEXT>
   Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>'s
opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his
resignation and kept <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> shut down <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with a general strike
intended to force him out.
   An estimated <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of offices and industries were shut by
the strike, which appeared to be gaining support on its second day.
Most shops and stores were closed, public transportation was halted
and many government employees did not go to work.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> is out of cash because of pressure from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
to force the ouster of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who is the real power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as
commander of its 15,000 soldiers and police. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar is the
national currency and the supply has been cut off.
   Most government workers were paid only <MONEY>$75</MONEY> of their midmonth
wages last week and the <MONEY>$33 million</MONEY> end-of-the-month payroll for
the 130,000 public employees problably won't be met. Pension checks
due <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> have been delayed, at least until <DATE>March 28</DATE>.
   Hunger is spreading among workers as well as the poor,
unemployed and elderly. Many washerwomen, cleaning women, maids and
cooks have lost their jobs because there is no money with which to
pay them.
   <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>, the civilian <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> chose to run the
government, said on television <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> the general would
resign in exchange for ``a national dialogue'' to reconcile
differences with opponents of the regime. He prefaced the offer
with a diatribe against the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The implication was that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, under federal court indictment
in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on narcotics and money laundering charges, would stay in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and might retain power behind the scenes.
   Calling the offer a ``noble gesture,'' <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON> said <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
pledged ``as an officer and a gentleman'' to resign before
presidential elections scheduled for <DATE>May 1989</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON>, who has the title ``minister in charge of the
presidency,'' said he would not accept <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s resignation unless
``all of the political forces in the country'' join ``a national
dialogue.''
   Noriega put <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON> in office <DATE>Feb. 26</DATE>, after President <PERSON>Eric
Arturo Delvalle</PERSON> tried to fire the general and the legislature
dismissed <PERSON>Delvalle</PERSON> instead.
   Delvalle, still recognized by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, is hiding in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. His dismissal began a run on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s banks and they were
closed the next week.
   Pressure from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has included freezing virtually all
Panamanian funds in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, including revenue from the
<LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration spokesmen rejected the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> proposal.
Last week, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> turned down a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plan for him to leave <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
and live in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
   The general said his plan was a ``Panamanian solution'' to the
crisis.
   ``I have no reason to talk to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' he told
reporters after <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON>'s speech. ``I talk to Panamanians.''
   <PERSON>Guillermo Cochez</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic
Party</ORGANIZATION>, said the proposed discussion would occur in a panel of 33
members, 22 of them supporting <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   ``This is not a dialogue,'' he said ``It's just cynicism.''
   <PERSON>Aurelio Barria</PERSON> said: ``The general has to go _ immediately, not
eventually.
   Barria is a leader of the <ORGANIZATION>National Civic Crusade</ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of
200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called
the general strike. It was organized <DATE>last June</DATE> to lead the campaign
against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   Solis Palma spoke on television for 30 minutes, devoting all but
the last five minutes to castigating the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He accused
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> of ``economic aggression'' in ``an undeclared state of
war.''
   He claimed the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wants to renege on the <DATE>1977</DATE>
treaties under which the <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal</ORGANIZATION> will be turned over to this
country at <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Dec. 31, 1999</DATE>.
   The canal, guarded by about 10,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops, has been
operating normally despite the crisis. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> sent 300
more soldiers <DATE>Monday</DATE>, most of them security personnel.
   Because of increasing hunger, the Rev. <PERSON>Francisco Verar</PERSON> said his
Roman Catholic church in the poor <LOCATION>San Miguelito</LOCATION> suburb is feeding
more families every day.
   ``If we had not done this there would have been chaos, even
cases of death,'' he said. ``We have people who have gone five, six
days without food.''
   Longshoremen, on strike for more than a week, voted
overwhelmingly <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to stay out but accepted part payment of
back wages despite fears of compromising their position.
   ``There are mothers and fathers who have to feed their
children,'' said <PERSON>Luis Asprilla</PERSON>, a union leader.
   In some parts of <LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION>, workers formed vigilante groups to
guard stores and other places of employment. Looting occurred
during street protests against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> last week.

   As <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> seeks to overcome his negative
ratings in presidential campaign polls, he might draw hope from
recent history: <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> suffered equally low ratings in his
races and overcame them to win.
   But this year there is an important difference, poll analysts
say. While <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> won by beating opponents who were viewed even
less favorably than he was, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> faces a far more popular opponent
in Gov. <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>.
   Dukakis has scored high favorable ratings in polls this <DATE>spring</DATE>,
though not as high as <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> at his pinnacle of popularity in
<DATE>June</DATE> of the <DATE>1976</DATE> election year. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has scored poorly, though not
nearly as poorly as <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> at his nadir in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Such measures, taken by asking if poll respondents have a
favorable or unfavorable view of candidates, provide an important
guide to vote-getting ability. A poor score ``means that there's a
chunk of people who don't like you,'' said <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> pollster
<PERSON>Kathleen A. Frankovic</PERSON>. ``They probably won't vote for you _ unless,
of course, they can't stand the other guy more.''
   Strategists on both sides have focused lately on favorability
ratings, with <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON>Leslie Dach</PERSON> contending
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was ``sitting on some of the highest unfavorable ratings of a
presidential candidate in recent memory.''
   <PERSON>Dach</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he based that claim on Gallup Poll figures,
but the <ORGANIZATION>Gallup Organization</ORGANIZATION> said its past figures are not
comparable to its current ones because it changed its questions and
procedures. In other, comparable polls, other candidates have rated
considerably worse than <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> rates now.
   Still, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s negative rating is high _ <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> favorable to
<PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> unfavorable in a <ORGANIZATION>CBS News-New York Times</ORGANIZATION> poll in <DATE>May</DATE>, <PERCENT>51
percent</PERCENT> favorable to <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> unfavorable in a <DATE>May</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>ABC
News-Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> poll, 53-40 favorable to unfavorable in a
Gallup poll this week.
   Contrast the ratings for Dukakis: 38-14 favorable to unfavorable
in the CBS-Times poll, 64-11 in the ABC-Post's, 70-20 in <LOCATION>Gallup</LOCATION>'s.
   The general election campaign, though, hardly has begun. ``We're
looking at where these people are starting out,'' <PERSON>Frankovic</PERSON> said.
``<PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> is starting out very nicely. <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> is
starting out with as many people disliking him as liking him. So
he's got some work to do.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s negatives are by no means historic. All three candidates
in the <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE> elections _ <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>
_ had as bad or worse favorability ratings during their campaigns.
In <DATE>June 1980</DATE>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s CBS-Times rating was a dismal 33 favorable
to 60 unfavorable.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s 33-35 score in the CBS-Times poll was comparable to
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s 38-38 favorability rating in <DATE>September 1980</DATE>. But <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
had the advantage of facing <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>, the unpopular incumbent.
   While <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> does not have an unpopular opponent, there has been
some movement in <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' rating: He went from <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT>
unfavorable in a Gallup Poll in <DATE>May</DATE> to <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> unfavorable the
new Gallup Poll.
   The key issue is not where a candidate stands when considered
alone, but where he stands in relationship to his opponent. ``In
<DATE>1976</DATE> people liked both of them,'' said <PERSON>Frankovic</PERSON>. ``In <DATE>1980</DATE> they
really didn't like either of them. And in <DATE>1984</DATE> you had a popular
incumbent.''
   Even <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s advantage was not apparent from the start. In
<DATE>January 1984</DATE>, an <ORGANIZATION>ABC News-Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> a 54-38
favorable rating and <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> a 48-30 rating. But <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> didn't
know about <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>; many went against him, and he lost in a
landslide.
   As many, <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT>, didn't know about <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> in the ABC-Post
poll in <DATE>May</DATE>, and pollsters noted that his high favorable rating
came amid positive publicity as he chalked up a string of primary
victories over <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> has a quarter of the people who have to get to know
him,'' said <PERSON>Kelly Hanley</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. ``<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is going
to start talking about <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' record, and we'll see how people
react to that.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, with the Republican nomination wrapped up, was out of the
news in <DATE>May</DATE>. With voters not yet focused on the race, his rating
may have been more a reflection of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s lagging popularity than
of his own standing.
   ``Those negatives don't represent some personal shortcoming with
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> as much as some dissatisfaction with the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration,'' said <PERSON>Larry Hugick</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Gallup Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
``I don't think people have much of a sense of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> yet
to give a response to these questions.''
   The issue for the campaigns, the analysts said, is whether <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
can establish his own, positive identity separate from <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, and
whether he can capitalize on the public's unfamiliarity with
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bush Doesn't Have Them, But How Much Does It Matter?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> looks for votes on Capitol
Hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his
savings and loan bailout plan, his clout is limited by the fact
most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last
<DATE>November</DATE>.
   House members and political analysts differ among themselves on
the impact of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s lack of coattails.
   But there is no argument that while <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was carrying 40 of the
50 states, voters by the millions were opting for divided
government by choosing a Republican president and a <ORGANIZATION>Democratic
Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There was a big message in this election and <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>
picked it up,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Tony Coelho</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
Democratic whip.
   Coelho praised <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for ``trying to establish a level of trust
that hasn't existed for 12 years.''
   ``You run independent of everyone,'' said Republican Rep. <PERSON>Lynn
Martin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>.
   But she insisted that a president's persuasive ability is not
tied to the results of the last election.
   ``If the president calls you and asks you to vote for something,
any living member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> who says it is easy to say no, is
absolutely saying that for a press statement,'' she said. ``After
the election it isn't Democrat or Republican, it's the president.''
   An analysis of the <DATE>1988</DATE> election results, published in the
<ORGANIZATION>National Journal</ORGANIZATION>, found that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ran ahead of the successful <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
candidate in only 56 of the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> districts.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> out polled only 26 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Half of
the Democrats were from the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s strongest region in the
presidential vote.
   While those numbers might be viewed as a sign of the president's
electoral weakness, they might more accurately reflect the strength
of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members. Of the 435 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> winners in <DATE>1988</DATE>, only 63
received under <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the vote.
   By contrast, when <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> was elected in <DATE>1980</DATE>, he ran
ahead of 59 Republican winners. In addition his coattails were
credited with giving Republicans control of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> for the
first time in a quarter century and with a <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> pickup of 33 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
seats.
   Did that make a difference?
   ``It was very easy to deal with reluctant Republicans or
persuadable Democrats'' during <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s first two years in office,
said Rich Bond, a Republican consultant who was involved in trying
to generate support for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s agenda.
   Reagan's clout on Capitol Hill diminished sharply after the <DATE>1982</DATE>
midterm election when the Democrats won back 26 <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> seats.
   ``It was back to business as usual,'' said Bond.
   ``I've always been the Republican in whose district our
presidential candidates did least well,'' said Rep. Bill Green of
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> whose district runs along the East Side of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>.
Green was re-elected with <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> of the vote, while <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was
receiving only <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> against Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>.
   ``I was the only Republican elected in a district <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> didn't
carry in <DATE>'84</DATE>,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION>.
   Green describes himself as a progressive Republican and his
support for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> votes declined from a high of <PERCENT>55
percent</PERCENT> of the time in <DATE>1981</DATE> to <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, according to
Congressional Quarterly.
   The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> congressman said, ``Plainly in <DATE>1981</DATE> one of the
things <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had going for him in winning votes in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was
the ability to persuade marginal Democrats in certain parts of the
country that if they didn't come along they'd be very vulnerable in
<DATE>1982</DATE>.
   ``Obviously, that kind of capacity is lacking (for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>) at this
point.''
   <PERSON>Tom Mann</PERSON>, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, said, ``We're getting to the point where there will be
zero correlation between presidential and congressional returns.
   ``It reinforces the view on Capitol Hill that their electoral
fates are not shared with the president and therefore there are no
electoral ties that bind. Whatever incentives they have for working
with the president, elections are not one of them.''
   ``Not many members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> are going to quake in their boots
when presidents try to force them to do things,'' said <PERSON>Norman
Ornstein</PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>American Enterprise
Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Presidents win by big margins; presidents win by small
margins; members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> go marching on,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Stephen Hess</PERSON>, who served on the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> staffs of presidents
<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>, said members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> get a sense of a
president's clout in their districts from polls and letters and
from their trips back home.
   ``They don't need to look at last <DATE>November</DATE>'s election returns to
know how well <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> stands in their district and, of course,
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> probably stands in their district better than he did on
<DATE>November 8</DATE>.''
   ``A president is not a hapless giant,'' said <PERSON>Hess</PERSON>. ``There are
appointments members want, there are grants that they want, there
are an awful lot of symbolic things that they want.''
   <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON> echoed that view.
   ``What the president has to offer members is not really
electability,'' she said. ``It's coming in for fund-raisers, it is
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, it is members feeling they are working with the
president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to accomplish something.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON> has accused the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> of ordering thousands of rebels to re-enter <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>
and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane
Joan.
   Meanwhile, it was reported today that some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> charities trying
provide humanitarian relief to Nicaraguans hurt by the hurricane
claim they are being hampering in their efforts by the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration.
   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION> have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> in a nationwide radio and
television address.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> press officer <PERSON>Anita Stockman</PERSON>
denied the allegations. ``No <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.
   Rebel spokesman <PERSON>Bosco Matamoros</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that the
Contras were receiving only <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> humanitarian aid.
   ``The fact is <PERSON>Mr. Ortega</PERSON> is trying to conceal the continuous
buildup they have carried out with the help of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Matamoros</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration had re-armed the rebels,
known as Contras, and instructed them to ``sabotage and slow
reconstruction work and delay the coffee harvest,'' economically
vital to <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s already staggering economy.
   ``Facing a threat such as this when we are facing the
consequences of this hurricane, Nicaraguans are obliged to mobilize,
organize, to fulfill the job of defending the country,'' <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said.
   Some private <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> organizations complained the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
administration has refused to assist their efforts to deliver
donated goods to <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and has even threatened to declare
shipments of construction supplies illegal under the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic
embargo of the country.
   ``It's kind of appalling that the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> are interfering in the process of disaster aid,'' <PERSON>Richard
M. Walden</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Operation California</LOCATION>, a Los Angeles-based
relief group organizing an airlift to <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> next week, was
quoted as saying today in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> officials denied any deliberate
effort to block private aid, but they acknowledged the
administration has taken few steps to assist the charities, the
<ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The Soviet-backed Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported
Contras agreed in <DATE>March</DATE> to halt offensive operations in their 7-year
civil war. The government unilaterally has extended the truce on a
month-to-month basis. The current extension ends <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Ortega offered no proof of his allegations and did not say that
mobilization meant the government was allowing the cease-fire to
lapse.
   Most of the Contras retreated to base camps in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> after the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> refused to renew arms aid. Legislation approved by
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> does allow delivery of food, shelter, clothing and medical
services to the rebels.
   The leftist government frequently has compared the effort to
survive last week's killer hurricane to its struggle against the
Contras. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> repeated his assertion that an end to
<ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> aid would be the best hurricane assistance the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
could offer.
   Citing the latest government data, <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said Hurricane Joan
left 103 dead and 186,950 homeless. Previous government figures
estimated the number of dead at more than 60, with about 300,000
homeless.
   <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said 110 people were missing, an additional 178 were
seriously hurt and 324,861 were evacuated from their homes; 29,152
homes were destroyed; 33 bridges were destroyed and 33 others
damaged, and 400 miles of roads suffered direct damage.
   The cattle and fishing industries, and rice, cotton, grain,
sugar, cacao and African palm crops suffered serious damage and
``unmeasurable'' ecological damage was done, <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said.
   The storm ripped across 200 miles of Nicaraguan territory from
the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   ``The data indicate we met our main goal, to save lives,'' <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON>
said.
   He thanked <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>European
Economic Community</ORGANIZATION> for their aid and said <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> also promised help.
   The president called the aid ``necessary and urgent.''

   Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> will make
another visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> next month to address the <ORGANIZATION>United
Nations</ORGANIZATION> and will meet with President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> also is expected to meet with President-elect <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON> while he is in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
a report by <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier, British Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> announced
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON> would visit <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> <DATE>Dec. 12-14</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> met with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> last <DATE>December</DATE>, the third
of their four summit meetings. They signed a treaty to abolish <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said last week he was interested in a meeting with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>
if it could produce progress on arms control, human rights or
regional disputes.
   But first, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said, he would have <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON>, who he
has named his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard A. Shevardnadze</PERSON> and with foreign ministers
of the <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. ``I am acquainted
with him,'' the president-elect said. ``What I want to see is
progress. I`ve never supported meetings just for the sake of having
meetings.''
   Reagan first met with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, in
<DATE>November 1985</DATE>. They held their second summit in <DATE>1986</DATE> in <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION>,
then met in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> last <DATE>December</DATE> and in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> May 29-June 2.
   The two superpowers are close to an agreement to sharply reduce
their strategic nuclear weapons, but are wrestling with problems
over how to verify some of the cutbacks.
   On the regional front, the Soviets have suspended the withdrawal
of their troops from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>. But the pullout is not supposed to
completed until <DATE>Feb. 15</DATE>, and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration officials have
expressed confidence the Soviets would meet the deadline.
   <PERSON>Phyllis Oakley</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said of a
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> visit: ``There has been no official announcement from the
<LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> on this question. Therefore it is inappropriate for us to
comment now.''

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans want the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, not
national governments, to control nuclear and chemical weapons and
to take the lead in keeping peace in the world, according to a poll
released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Roper Organization</ORGANIZATION> survey also found strong support for
increased American financing of <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> programs for peace, food
production, population control and health.
   In conflicts among countries where the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has an
interest, <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> forces should be used in an effort to accommodate
all parties, said <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> of the nearly 2,000 adults surveyed.
   Only <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should use force to
impose its own solution; <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> said ``it depends,'' and <PERCENT>14
percent</PERCENT> had no opinion.
   ``That is, in effect, a tough policy choice, and we were
surprised to see a 3-to-1 margin of support for <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> intervention
rather than unilateral <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intervention,'' said <PERSON>Jeffrey Laurenti</PERSON>
of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Association of the U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION>, a private non-profit group
that commissioned the poll.
   Of the respondents, <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> wanted <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>
members to spend more money settling regional conflicts peacefully,
<PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> favored less spending, <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> said the right amount
is spent now, and <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> had no opinion.
   The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> should have the power to control the
manufacture and spread of chemical weapons in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
other countries, said <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT>, but <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> opposed that and
<PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT> were unsure.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> control over nuclear weapons manufacture and proliferation
was favored by <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT>. The same percentage opposed it and <PERCENT>18
percent</PERCENT> were unsure.
   <PERCENT>Sixty percent</PERCENT> said all <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> members should pay their full dues
regularly rather than withholding funds to force changes. Fourteen
percent said funds could be withheld, the same number said ``it
depends'' and <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> had no opinion.
   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> withheld more than a <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>
from the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> in recent years to force fiscal reforms and
because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization.
   Reagan finally said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would pay all back dues if
current reforms continued, and President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has reaffirmed the
pledge.
   When asked how much money the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>
member countries should spend on <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> projects, the respondents
favored more funds for most social programs, including eradicating
disease and improving health care; slowing population growth
through birth control; increasing world food production, and
protecting the environment.
   <PERSON>Burns Roper</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Roper Organization</ORGANIZATION>, said the poll
indicated for the first time in more than a decade that more
Americans thought the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> was doing a good job than felt
it was doing poorly.
   It was conducted <DATE>March 11-18</DATE> through personal interviews with
nearly 2,000 adults chosen at random. <PERSON>Roper</PERSON> said the margin of
error was about <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT>.

   President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> is not going to play ``big colossus of the North'' and use
military force to get Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio
Noriega</PERSON> out of power.
   In a question-and-answer session with high school students in
this <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> suburb, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was asked if he thought it would be
necessary to resume <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military control in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to protect the
safety of the canal zone.
   ``No, we're going to abide by the canal treaty (relinquishing
the canal to the Panamanians by the turn of the century),'' he
replied. ``And we're not going to be the big colossus of the <ORGANIZATION>North</ORGANIZATION>
once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of
living and business and trying to guide and direct them.''
   The president said the Panamanians ``have a very difficult
problem there. We think that they're moving toward solving it with
the reaction of the people to the man that has caused so much of
this problem.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wants ``to be of help in any way
we can, and so we've helped them in that regard in the economic
restraints that we've put down there so that there can be pressure
focused on this particular individual.''
   ``But there's no danger of us coming in with our power and
muscle and saying, `This is the way it has to be.'''
   Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>federal Agency for International Development</ORGANIZATION> has
agreed to release <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> in emergency funds to buy food for the
poor in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The food will be purchased in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> if it is available and
distributed through <ORGANIZATION>Caritas</ORGANIZATION>, a Catholic relief agency said AID
spokesman <PERSON>Jim Kunder</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> is out of cash because <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> cut off the supply of
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> into exile. The general was indicted in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
   The Panamanian government was unable to fully meet a <MONEY>$33 million</MONEY>
payroll for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching
off a series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once
considered loyal to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Government Orders Soldiers Not To Harm Americans, Hardship For

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said it ordered its
soldiers not to give <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> a pretext for armed intervention
and it failed to meet another payroll for civil servants, dampening
Easter celebrations.
   Thousands of people lined up for meals provided by charity,
casualties of the 5-week-old campaign to try to force the ouster of
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto leader, <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio
Noriega</PERSON>.
   The office of acting President <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON> issued a
communique <DATE>Thursday</DATE> alleging the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was looking for an
incident that could justify military intervention.
   It cited a letter from <PERSON>Solis</PERSON> to <PERSON>Javier Perez de Cuellar</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, that said recent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military movements in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and its territorial waters constituted a security threat.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> have orders to refrain from using
lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forces
of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or against <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> civilians or against property
or installations of citizens or the government of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>,'' the communique says.
   Solis was apparently referring to the passage of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
helicopter carrier <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> through the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE> and
military exercises being conducted by troops stationed at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Southern Command</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war,'' <PERSON>Solis</PERSON> said. ``Under no circumstances will <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
allow itself to be provoked nor will it lend itself to the
fabrication of an incident.''
   It mentions the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>, which the
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration said was necessary to protect <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> students
there.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, police and soldiers arrested and beat several
foreign journalists, including Americans, during a raid on a <LOCATION>Panama
City</LOCATION> hotel. The next day, presidential spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>
condemned the incident.
   ``It has always been a principle that we will protect American
citizens as best we can. And while we have said that we don't plan
to go in (to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>) militarily, it is also important to note that
there are limits,'' he said.
   The government shut down on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for the <LOCATION>Easter</LOCATION> weekend
without paying most of its 130,000 public employees for the second
time in a month.
   It failed to meet the <MONEY>$33 million</MONEY> payroll despite the collection
this week of <MONEY>$19 million</MONEY> in quarterly tax revenues. About <MONEY>$5.5
million</MONEY> was said to be taxes and fees from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies doing
business in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted 92-1 for a resolution urging
President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to cut off the flow of money from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
corporations to the regime of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who is under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> indictment
on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   Most Panamanians are short of cash and food as a result of an
11-day-old general strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in
part by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> freeze on <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> of Panamanian assets
in American banks.
   The sanctions were imposed after the Noriega-orchestrated ouster
<DATE>Feb. 26</DATE> of President <PERSON>Eric Arturo Delvalle</PERSON> in retaliation for
<ORGANIZATION>Delvalle</ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to fire <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   Banks have been closed since <DATE>March 3</DATE>.
   With most businesses and industries observing the general
strike, the largest congregations of people were found in the food
lines of welfare agencies.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Laurino Duran</PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> relief
society, said his organization was feeding 9,000 families a day.
   ``The number is growing daily,'' the priest said, adding that
the effort is costing <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> a month, which the church receives
in donated cash and food.
   Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>National Civic Crusade</ORGANIZATION> were meeting to plan new
strategies in their frustrated effort to oust <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   ``We'll be talking over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, discussing where we go from
here,'' said <PERSON>Roberto Aleman</PERSON>, an attorney and director of the
Crusade, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor,
political and other groups.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He'll Return Body Of American Killed In 1986 Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON> said he is willing to hand over
the body of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pilot killed during the <DATE>1986</DATE> air raid on <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>,
the official news agency <ORGANIZATION>JANA</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON> said the body of Capt. <PERSON>Paul Lorence</PERSON> would be given to his
family ``through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>.
   Lorence, 31, of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Fernando Ribas-Dominicci</PERSON>, 33,
of <LOCATION>Utuado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>, were in an F-111 that disappeared during the
<DATE>April 15, 1986</DATE>, raid on <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Benghazi</LOCATION>. The other 17 <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> bombers returned safely to their bases after dropping about
100 tons of bombs on the two cities.
   The attack was in retaliation for what the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration
said was <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>'s support for international terrorism. Libyan
authorities said the raids killed about 40 people, including
<PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON>'s 15-month-old adopted daughter.
   ``The brother leader has also invited the family of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
pilot (Capt. <PERSON>Paul) Lorence</PERSON>, whose plane was shot down during the
failed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> barbaric and savage attack on <LOCATION>Tripoli</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Benghazi</LOCATION> ...
to take possession of his body which will be handed through the pope

   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, embarking on a 12-day
trip to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>, vowed <DATE>Monday</DATE> to address
``head-on ... concerns that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is a nation in
decline.''
   Before leaving the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on his second trip abroad since
taking office, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> addressed the annual meeting of <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   He told the newspaper publishers his trip to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> was designed
to underscore the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commitment to the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> rim and gain
``firsthand familiarity'' with the area.
   Moreover, he said some American and Asian observers wonder if
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ``is really a great nation in decline,'' with
high budget and trade deficits a sign of malaise.
   Those observers ask themselves, ``Can we (the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>)
still be relied on to play a leadership role in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>? And,
if not, who else is there to replace us?
   ``An important purpose of my trip is to address these concerns
head on ...,'' <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said. ``The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is focusing on the
region as never before.''
   He said he intends to remind the Asian allies ``that the current
wave of `declinist' thought in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is hardly a new
phenomenon.''
   Elaborating, the vice president said, ``Books predicting
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s imminent fall from world leadership have made the
best-seller list and prophets of American decline have become
virtual academic celebrities.
   ``All of this naturally arouses a good deal of apprehension
among our friends and allies in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.''
   He did not identify any ``declinists'' by name.
   Periodically, he said, waves of pessimism have swept the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>. Yet, he added, such national introspection is healthy
because ``it's usually a sign of renewal, not of decline.''
   <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said the overall purpose of his whirlwind trip, which
will take him and his wife, <PERSON>Marilyn</PERSON>, to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, is to show that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
intends ``to play an important role in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.''
   In a question-and-answer session with the <ORGANIZATION>AP</ORGANIZATION> group, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said
one of the things he's most enjoyed about his first 100 days in
office is his involvement in foreign policy.
   The vice president, who visited <ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> soon
after he was inaugurated, said most of his trips as senator had
been back home to <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>.
   From <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> flew to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to meet with former
President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> before he left for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   Quayle and his wife met briefly with <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Nancy</PERSON>,
at <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s office in a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> skyscraper. Posing for
photographers, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> presented a wrapped American flag to <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>,
the same flag that had flown over the American embassy in <LOCATION>Kabal</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, until the Soviet troops invaded in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   When the Soviets announced their attention to leve <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>,
the flag was once again hoisted above the embassy on <DATE>May 15, 1988</DATE>.
   ``I'm very proud to have this...I have a feeling this will find
its way into the <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> library,'' said the smiling former
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> also said he thought President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had done a good job
in the first 100 days. ``He is there to keep in progress the things
we did for eight years,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said.
   Later in the <TIME>evening</TIME>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> was to receive an award presented
by <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s financial backers at a Republican fund-raiser.
   On his return to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> will tour <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s
Prince <PERSON>William Sound</PERSON> to see for himself cleanup efforts after the
<DATE>March 24</DATE> grounding of the tanker <ORGANIZATION>Exxon Valdez</ORGANIZATION>, which dumped 10.1
million gallons of crude oil in the sound.
   Trade, space, defense, environmental pollution and chemical
warfare were issues <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said he would bring up with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> allies.
   His journey, in which he will combine substantive talks with
sightseeing and social events, is taking place shortly before the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 20 years. Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S.
Gorbachev</PERSON> is visiting <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in <DATE>May</DATE>.
   ``We recognize the Soviet interest in sharing in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s economic
boom and in increasing its access to the region,'' he said.
   ``But <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> has a long way to go to achieve that goal,'' he
said.
   However, he said, the Soviets continue to modernize military
forces in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and has one of its largest fleets stationed in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   The special relationship forged between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> during <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s presidency will thrive
under <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> but on a more businesslike footing, analysts
predict.
   That relationship is likely to be nurtured at the annual <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>
summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, beginning <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> is siding with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in a dispute with <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>
over short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> has
demanded that the West open negotiations with the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> to reduce
the number of missiles, while the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> want to
modernize the weapons.
   After the summit, and a stop in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is
scheduled to travel to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for talks with <PERSON>Mrs.
Thatcher</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> had made a point of meeting with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> during his
two terms as vice president, and following his election in <DATE>November</DATE>
described him as a ``worthy successor'' to <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   Reagan and <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> were ideological soul mates who
operated on a first-name basis and with obvious personal warmth
during the eight years that their conservative administrations
overlapped.
   Things aren't likely to be as folksy with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   ``I don't think the chemistry's going to be there,'' said <PERSON>John
Young</PERSON>, faculty member of the <ORGANIZATION>London School of Economics</ORGANIZATION>
international history department.
   ``I think there's going to be less warmth there. I think there
was genuine mutual admiration between <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Margaret
Thatcher</PERSON> because they are kind of believing people,'' <PERSON>Young</PERSON> said.
   ``They believe in a cause to fight for and they admire each
other for standing up and fighting ... President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, through his
background, is far more a wheeler-dealer kind of character,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Charles H. Price II</PERSON>, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s ambassador to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, predicted
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s relations with <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> will be even closer than his
predecessor's because both are ``hands-on'' managers.
   ``I think with <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, in a sense, she will have a more
special relationship than <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> had,'' Price told American
reporters before returning to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Former Secretary of State <PERSON>Henry Kissinger</PERSON> agreed, telling
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Sky Television:
   ``The relationship, good as it was between President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>, will be at least as good, if not better, between
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>.
   ``<PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> based his relationship very much on personal
intuition,'' <PERSON>Kissinger</PERSON> said. ``President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is a man who is more
reflective about the conceptual matters.''
   <PERSON>Peter Jay</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> from 1977-79, said
personal relations between leaders has little impact on policy or
decision making.
   But he pinpointed one factor that he said could make <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
relations with the British leader different from <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s.
   ``President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> actually knows about and is interested in
government and <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> knows about and is interested in
government both at the national and international level,'' <PERSON>Jay</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> has regularly backed the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> _ sometimes
alone.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> was the first to deploy <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cruise missiles in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1983</DATE>, and it was the only ally to support the <DATE>1986</DATE> U.S. bombing
raid on <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>.
   Despite her personal reservations, <PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON> publicly
endorsed the <DATE>1987</DATE> U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove the missiles, and
in <DATE>January</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Royal Air Force Base Molesworth</ORGANIZATION>, 50 miles north of
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, became the first <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> cruise missile base to be disarmed.
   Reagan, in turn, approved vital arms supplies and intelligence
to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1982</DATE> Falkland Islands War against <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> was a study
in contrasts: the deepest recession since the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION>
followed by the longest peacetime economic expansion in history.
   It was a decade in which the spiraling inflation, economic
stagnation and successive oil shocks of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> were replaced by
new headaches _ huge budget and trade deficits, and fears the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was becoming a second-rate economic power.
   It was the decade when Americans went on a spending spree,
financed by foreign capital.
   The profligacy meant that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, the world's richest
creditor nation at the start of the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, ended up as the largest
debtor nation, facing the threat of declining living standards as
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wealth moves into foreigners' hands to pay the interest.
   Reaganomics, defined in vastly different ways by friend and foe,
dominated the decade. <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> campaigned for the presidency
on a pledge of cutting tax rates, boosting defense spending and
balancing the budget, all at the same time.
   ``Voodoo economics,'' sniffed <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s competitor
for the <DATE>1980</DATE> Republican nomination. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was proven correct, but in
winning the presidency in <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> took his own no-new-taxes
pledge.
   He promised to boost spending on education, environmental
cleanup and the war on drugs, all without a tax increase. He
promised a balanced budget, as well. It would be accomplished with
something called a flexible freeze, but <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> never got specific
about which programs he would put on ice.
   As a consequence, the federal government recorded a <MONEY>$152.1
billion</MONEY> deficit in <DATE>1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s first year in office, more than
double the deficit in <DATE>1980</DATE>, <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>'s last year as president.
   The national debt, the accumulation of all the past deficits,
had not reached <MONEY>$1 trillion</MONEY> when <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> took office. As the decade
ended, the national debt was closing in on <MONEY>$3 trillion</MONEY>; <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had
piled up more red ink than all of his predecessors put together.
   Despite that, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> held true to his promise to cut tax rates,
persuading <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to slash the top personal rate from <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>
to <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT>.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> also succeeded in slaying the inflation dragon. As the
decade began, the country was in its worst economic predicament
since the <ORGANIZATION>Great Depression</ORGANIZATION>, a long-simmering bout of inflation
fueled by successive oil shocks that had sent consumer prices into
double-digit territory, climbing by <PERCENT>12.5 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1980</DATE> alone.
   <PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON>, serving as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve Board</ORGANIZATION>,
used high interest rates to dampen economic growth and whip
inflation, getting support for the task from <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. The medicine
worked, but not before interest rates hit levels not seen since the
Civil War, devastating the housing industry and shoving the country
into the steep 1981-82 recession.
   At its depth, 12 million Americans were out of work, the
unemployment rate hit <PERCENT>10.8 percent</PERCENT>, its highest level since the
Depression, and news reports focused nightly on soup lines and
crowded public shelters.
   But the hard times have been followed by 84 months of
prosperity, a period of growth unmatched in peacetime and nearly
three times longer than the average expansion period.
   While growth was slowing as <DATE>1989</DATE> ended, economists held out hope
that falling interest rates would spur a rebound in economic
activity in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   Despite the long expansion, the percentage of Americans living
in poverty refused to budge below <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT>, remaining higher
throughout the decade than it had been at any time during the
<DATE>1970s</DATE>. The gap between the wealthiest Americans and the poorest
also widened to its broadest range in 40 years.
   Critics blamed the high poverty rate on holes in the ``safety
net'' that <PERSON>David Stockman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s budget director, had erected to
protect the neediest from the pain of government budget cuts.
   It wasn't only people on welfare who were squeezed. The income
for a typical American family last year was <MONEY>$32,191</MONEY>, which meant
that even with more two-earner households and a long expansion,
family incomes had only made it back to where they had been in <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   Democrats attributed the modest income gains to the fact that
high-paying industrial jobs were being replaced by minimum-wage
jobs in the service sector, transforming the country into a
``nation of hamburger flippers.''
   Nonsense, said Republicans, who pointed to the 20 million jobs
created since the recession ended in <DATE>1982</DATE>, a level of job growth
that sent unemployment down close to <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT>, the lowest it has
been since <DATE>1973</DATE>.
   The modest wage gains didn't stop Americans from going on a
spending spree. The heavy consumer purchases and the huge
government budget deficits fueled the expansion.
   The trouble was that much of the demand was met by foreign
producers, as the country's trade deficit widened to historic
levels. The broadest measure of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade was in surplus as the
decade began, deficits in merchandise trade being more than covered
by Americans' earnings on their overseas investments.
   But a huge surge of imports, spurred by a strong dollar, pushed
the current account deficit to a record <MONEY>$154 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, with
only modest improvement since that time.
   The billions of dollars flowing into foreign hands came back
into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as a wave of investments in everything from
high-rise office buildings to Hollywood movie studios. For the
first time since <DATE>1914</DATE>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investments overseas were exceeded by
foreign investments in this country, presenting a host of problems
concerning how the interest owed to foreigners will be paid.
   But still, economists saw reasons for optimism in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. The
crumbling of the communist bloc was expected to produce a ``peace
dividend'' of lower defense spending that would help the federal
government balance its books.
   In addition, many analysts were looking for the low personal
savings rates of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> to begin rising in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> as the Baby
Boom generation moves into middle age.
   A larger pool of savings could spell big dividends for the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, lowering the cost of capital and allowing American
businesses to make the investments in research and modernization
that will be needed to keep up with the Japanese and other global
competitors.

<HEAD>`Pebbles' Would Cut Cost of Space-Based Defense, Pentagon Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Implementing the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
space-based defense plan could reduce the <MONEY>$69.1 billion</MONEY> pricetag
attached to the early development stage of Star Wars research, says
a <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> official.
   Lt. Gen. <PERSON>George L. Monahan Jr.</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic
Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION>, told members of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Appropriations
defense</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that Brilliant Pebbles could trim the
cost of Phase I of Star Wars. He did not provide specifics.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has invested about <MONEY>$17 billion</MONEY> in SDI,
commonly known as <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION>, and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> panel
expressed reservations about the direction and the high price of he
research program.
   ``The members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and their constituents must ask
themselves whether the nation can afford SDI and whether the return
on the investment is justified,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Inouye</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Hawaii</LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Inouye called current spending on Star Wars ``robust,'' and said
the <MONEY>$17 billion</MONEY> ``could have been funded in other weapons.''
   Sen. <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Iowa</LOCATION>, criticized the research program as
``ill-defined with conflicting goals.''
   ``<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> told us SDI is to protect people. It looks like
we're going to protect missiles,'' <PERSON>Harkin</PERSON> said.
   But <PERSON>Monahan</PERSON> sought to assure the lawmakers as he described the
Brilliant Pebbles process and the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s current plans.
   <PERSON>Monahan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Science Board</ORGANIZATION> and the Jasons, a group
of university professors, mostly physicists, will review the
concept for the department this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   ``This fall, subsequent to Brilliant Pebbles study efforts ...
we will reexamine our space-based architecture with a view toward
the degree of incorporation of this concept,'' <PERSON>Monahan</PERSON> said.
   Under the system, 3,000 to 5,000 satellites, about three feet
long and weighing less than 100 pounds each, would be placed in
orbit about 400 miles above the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Brilliant Pebbles is supported by outgoing SDI chief, Lt. Gen.
<PERSON>James Abrahamson</PERSON>, who predicted in a <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE> memorandum that it
could be deployed in space for about <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>, far less than the
estimates of <MONEY>$45 billion</MONEY> for other SDI orbital systems.
   <PERSON>Monahan</PERSON> said recent budget cuts have forced the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> to
delay work on some Star Wars research, including a six-month slip
in development of a tracking satellite and a two-year delay in a
demonstration experiment.
   <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> has proposed cutting the fiscal
<DATE>1990</DATE> budget for <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> from the <MONEY>$5.9 billion</MONEY> called for by
former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to <MONEY>$4.6 billion</MONEY>.
   Overall, five-year spending on <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> would be cut from <MONEY>$41
billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$33 billion</MONEY>.
   In an appearance last month before the <ORGANIZATION>House Armed Services
Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Cheney</PERSON> said money for <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> ``will buy us the
capability to look aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles.''
   ``If Brilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate
deployment date of the current space-based missile program would
slip by two years,'' <PERSON>Cheney</PERSON> said. He did not set a date.

   Chinese students said they feared being shipped
back to their homeland after the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> upheld President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
veto of a bill protecting them from deportation when their visas
expire.
   ``Many students fear they will be sent back. I'm scared for all
my friends,'' said <PERSON>Yuan Liu</PERSON>, 30, a Chinese student enrolled at
<ORGANIZATION>Brandeis University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I think it's a sad day for us,'' said <PERSON>Pei Min Xin</PERSON>, 33, a
doctoral student at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> who led the pro-democracy
protests in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> <DATE>last spring</DATE>. ``I'm afraid that the president
will continue his policy of accommodating the Chinese dictators.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the bill to eliminate that requirement was unnecessary
because he has signed an administrative order allowing Chinese
students to stay in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The president said the legislation could have damaged <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
relations with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, which has condemned the action and threatened
to curtail exchange programs if it becomes law.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted 62-37 <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to override the presidential
veto, four votes short of the two-thirds necessary. The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted
overwhelmingly <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to reject <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s veto.
   Xiaxia Gong, 33, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> graduate student, was among several
Chinese students gathered at the <ORGANIZATION>China Information Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>
who said the failed legislation would have given them a sense of
security.
   Many of the students fled to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> after the Chinese
government cracked down on the protests in <LOCATION>Tiananmen Square</LOCATION>. Under
the visa's requirements, bearers must return to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> when their
visas expire and live there for two years before they can apply for
a new one.
   The students fear that the president's order could be reversed
someday, leaving them vulnerable to deportation to their homeland
where they might be jailed.
   ``I don't believe <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Gong</PERSON> said. ``How can we believe
someone who has already cheated and sent high-level officials to
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> when he said he would not? We don't want our destiny put in
someone else's hands.''
   In Salem, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, Chinese students at <ORGANIZATION>Oregon State University</ORGANIZATION> said
they couldn't understand the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> vote.
   ``It did send a message to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, but it did not stand for human
rights,'' <PERSON>Wang De Qian</PERSON>, co-vice president of the university's
Chinese student association.
   Shu <PERSON>Ouang</PERSON> said the student association ``did not want to
override the president, but the veto. We want to send a stronger
message to the Chinese butchers.''

<FP=106> [Commentary by <PERSON>Peter Seidlitz</PERSON>: "Triumph of the Realists"] </F>
  [Text] President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s decision to renew the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] clause will have a favorable effect on 
trade and cooperation between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. This 
is the gist of a statement published by the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> as a reaction. 
  The business-like statement does not reflect the overt 
triumph the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> feels. A few days before the 
fifth anniversary of the clearing of <LOCATION>Tienanmen Square</LOCATION>, which 
claimed at least several hundred if not thousands of lives on 4 
<DATE>June 1989</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has now also joined those who 
follow the popular slogan of "business first." The Europeans 
assumed such a pragmatic position a long time ago. <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s head of government who held his own with his tough 
course in <DATE>1989</DATE>, forcing reform-minded <ORGANIZATION>CPC</ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON>Zhao Zhiang</PERSON> into 
political exile, is expected on official visits in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>. That is realpolitik. 
  President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> decided that trade and human rights would 
henceforth be separated. This ends the annual tug-of-war about 
the renewal of tariff privileges. One year ago, the same 
President still linked the two issues and explicitly made the 
granting of preferential trade treatment dependent on an 
improvement of the human rights situation in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>. 
  Under the pressure of <ORGANIZATION>Big Business</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has 
now 
backed out and admitted its helplessness. After all, if the 
<LOCATION>West</LOCATION> is not even able to intervene in the cruel massacres in 
<LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION>, exerting pressure on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, which is 
bursting with strength, is absolutely impossible. 
  The renewal of the tariff privileges means that Chinese 
consumer goods -- such as shoes, clothes, toys, electronic 
equipment -- remain cheap in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s biggest market. Products worth <MONEY>$33 billion</MONEY> go 
from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Investments and trade are 
helping <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to modernize the country. In the best case, this 
will in time lead to political transformation. There is no 
alternative. Nobody can wish for political chaos in the 
overpopulated country. 
  Reversely, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and multinational concerns, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> service 
sector enterprises such as banks and bond houses, and even 
fastfood restaurants such as <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Kentucky Fried Chicken</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Pizza Hut</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Burger King</PERSON>, are now hoping for big business. So 
far, as with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has had a huge trade 
balance deficit with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> only sells 
products worth <MONEY>$8 million</MONEY> to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. According to reports, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 
is said to order 50 <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> aircraft in a single mammoth order 
worth <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> in return, so to speak, for granting the tariff 
privileges. The resumption of military contacts with the 
objective of armament sales has also been initiated. 
  The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> business world is, therefore, satisfied with 
President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s decision. And <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> rejoices, too. 
After all, the bulk of exports to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is shipped through this 
city, which will be a British colony until <DATE>1997</DATE>. <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> 
would have lost enormous transactions. After this political 
U-turn, the Americans argue that changes or an easing of the 
politically tense situation would be achieved through economic 
relations rather than through political pressure. The slogan is 
change through business.

<HEAD>Government Admits Controversial Groups to Its Charity Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> listed 389
charities, including several controversial ones, that will take
part in a massive employee solicitation drive that raises about
<MONEY>$160 million</MONEY> a year from federal workers.
   A homosexual group, the <ORGANIZATION>Lambda Legal Defense</ORGANIZATION> and Educational
Fund, is among 19 groups whose applications were included in the
Combined Federal Campaign after initially being turned down.
   ``I assume, frankly, that there was simply a desire to keep
Lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission,'' defending
homosexuals and homosexual rights in court, said executive director
<PERSON>Thomas Stoddard</PERSON>.
   ``Frankly, it is a thrilling prospect for us,'' he said. ``Being
listed helps fulfill our mission.''
   He said his was the first overtly homosexual group to win the
right to participate. He said he could not anticipate how much
money would come to the group since designating it as a charitable
recipience ``may be viewed by the employee as one degree of coming
out.'' The fund, with a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> budget, was established in <DATE>1972</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Constance Newman</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Personnel
Management</ORGANIZATION>, said that after personally reviewing rejected
applications, she approved 19 rejected organizations, gave
qualified approval to eight, left six pending and denied approval
to 55, of which 33 had not complied with requests for additional
information.
   Those given qualified approval for one year spend more than <PERCENT>25
percent</PERCENT> of their receipts on administrative and fund-raising costs,
normally grounds for exclusion.
   Approval went to a range of causes, some potentially
controversial. Among them are the <ORGANIZATION>Firearms Civil Rights Legal
Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>United Palestinian Appeal</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Human Life
International</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Black Law Enforcement
Executives</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United States Military Sports Association</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Living
Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Operation California</LOCATION>.
   Anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life
Educational Trust Fund, and abortion rights groups, such as the
<ORGANIZATION>Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund</ORGANIZATION> and Planned
Parenthood-World Population, already were listed. So were such
conservative groups as the <ORGANIZATION>National Right to Work Legal Defense
Foundation, Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and such liberal outfits as People for the
American Way.
   Being listed can bring large amounts of money to an organization
at virtually no cost _ or it can bring nothing if employees do not
specifically designate the charity.
   The fund drive raises over <MONEY>$160 million</MONEY> from 4 million federal
employees, including military people and postal workers, with the
average giving <MONEY>$60.68</MONEY>.
   It is the largest employee solicitation in the country, <ORGANIZATION>OPM</ORGANIZATION>
said, although Americans individually gave <MONEY>$87 billion</MONEY> to churches
and charities in <DATE>1988</DATE>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel</ORGANIZATION>.
   Federal employees may designate up to five charities from a list
that, when local groups are included, in some instances numbers as
many as 1,000.
   About <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the gifts are designated. Of the rest, about
<PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> goes to the local <ORGANIZATION>United Way</ORGANIZATION> campaign, <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> to a
group of 33 international service agencies, <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> to national

<HEAD>Reagan Says His Greatest Achievement Was Staying Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking back on nearly eight years as president,
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> said with a short, dry laugh that his greatest
achievement may have been staying alive.
   The 77-year-old <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> chief executive, who was shot in the chest
in <DATE>1981</DATE>, commented in the second of a three-part series on his
presidency broadcast <DATE>Friday</DATE> on British television's independent
Channel 4.
   <PERSON>David Gergen</PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the public
attitude toward <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> changed after the assassination attempt.
   ``You may not agree with him. You may think he's too simple .. .
not a man of the world, but there is a sense of conviction about
him,'' <PERSON>Gergen</PERSON> said. ``A strength of character emerges in the
shooting which transforms his presence.''
   The 50-minute program called ``Walking Tall'' covers <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s
first term.
   It starts with former aide <PERSON>Michael Deaver</PERSON> recalling that he
found his boss sleeping under a mound of bedcovers on the morning
of his inauguration, <DATE>Jan. 20, 1981</DATE>.
   ``I said, `Governor.' There was kind of a grunt,'' <PERSON>Deaver</PERSON> said.
``And I said `Good God, in an hour and a half you're going to be
sworn in as the 40th president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.' He rolled
over and said, `Do I have to?'.''
   Much of the program focused on assessments by political analysts
and former members of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s administration.
   To <PERSON>Howard Baker</PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, ``<PERSON>Ronald
Reagan</PERSON> is the most presidential man I've ever known. That will be
his principal legacy. And by that I mean he knows exactly who he
is. He is president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and he has no trouble with
that. He is not offended by it, upset by it or intimidated by it.''
   <PERSON>Stuart Spencer</PERSON>, a long-time adviser, said: ``Nobody in American
politics has better style and form than <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>.''
   <PERSON>Howard Philips</PERSON>, chairman of the Conservative Caucus political
group, called him ``the most typical, the most American, the most
average _ but in a good sense, in a likeable sense _ president we
could ever imagine.''
   The president's policies of increasing defense spending, cutting
social programs and refusing to raise taxes came in for tough
criticism.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was asked how he responded to the fact that he never
balanced the budget and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> now is the world's
biggest debtor nation.
   ``I'm just as critical of it as I was before I got here,'' he
replied.
   <PERSON>Donald Regan</PERSON>, former treasury secretary and chief of staff, said
the president never discussed economics or finance with him. <PERSON>Regan</PERSON>
said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> made budget cuts almost impossible.
   <PERSON>David Stockman</PERSON>, the former budget director who urged <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to
raise taxes, had a harsh assessment:
   ``After time, when the full extent of the damage is clear, and
the heavy price we will pay for years to come is evident,
historians will record Reaganomics as the singular greatest episode
of sustained economic mismanagement in the <DATE>20th century</DATE> history of
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   Regan called that ``sour grapes on the part of <PERSON>David Stockman</PERSON>''
and added: ``He never got what he wanted, which was solely to have
taxes raised. ... That was not an antidote to get us out of
recession'' in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   Some of the first term's major events were shown, including the
assassination attempt, the <DATE>October 1983</DATE> bombing of a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Marine</ORGANIZATION>
barracks in <LOCATION>Beirut</LOCATION> that killed 243 military personnel and the
invasion of <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> two days later.
   Recalling the assassination attempt, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said: ``I heard what
I thought was firecrackers. ... I didn't feel a bullet hit me.''
   When asked what was his greatest achievement, he said:
``Sometimes I think,'' then laughed and continued, ``just staying
alive.''
   Even <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s critics praised his ability to control the media.
   ``These people have understood that they have a powerful
instrument of news management in their hand,'' said <PERSON>Richard
Neustadt</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> professor and author of
``Presidential Power,'' who described <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s mastery of the photo
opportunity and disdain of formal news conferences.

   Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Daniel Ortega</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that
<PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> was the ``scapegoat'' for crimes committed by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government and the person who really should be tried is former
President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   North was convicted <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of three felony counts in
connection with the Iran-Contra case, which shadowed the <DATE>last two
years</DATE> of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration.
   Ortega, on a swing through <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, also told a news
conference that he hoped to improve relations with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> has become the scapegoat for the crimes committed
by the government of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> against <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON>
said.
   ``But who was behind the actions of <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>? Who was the
boss of <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>? Who promoted the policy followed by <PERSON>Oliver
North</PERSON>? He's called <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>. The person who ought to be
standing in the dock is <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, not <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON>.
   Ortega also said President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ``seems clearly to have been
mixed up in these crimes.''
   He said his government had ``hopes and optimism'' that the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would change its policies toward <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has maintained an economic embargo against the country
in addition to backing the Contras.
   Ortega is on a 10-nation tour to win economic aid for his
country's battered economy and to enlist Western European help in
persuading the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to normalize relations with <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
   He avoided questions about whether he had received promises of
aid from the countries he has visited thus far: <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> edged
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in a survey of opinions toward world leaders in
Republican-dominated Orange County, but both ran behind British
Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, according to
a poll released <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times-sponsored survey of <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> residents
also revealed that <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> think the Cold War between the
superpowers is coming to an end.
   The results came in the county that gave <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and former
President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> their largest margins of victory of any <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
county in the presidential elections of <DATE>1980</DATE>, <DATE>1984</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Asked, ``Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of these
world leaders,'' positive ratings were as follows: <PERCENT>79 percent</PERCENT> for
<PERSON>Mrs. Thatcher</PERSON>, <PERCENT>76 percent</PERCENT> for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> for <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, <PERCENT>67
percent</PERCENT> for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> for Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON>Yitzhak
Shamir</PERSON>.
   The poll, which involved 600 adults in the county southeast of
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, had a <PERCENT>4 percentage point</PERCENT> margin of error, the newspaper
said.
   ``The message is that <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> is more in the mainstream of
American thinking than the perception,'' said longtime <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
adviser <PERSON>Stu Spencer</PERSON>. ``Thinking on the Cold War undoubtedly is
changing due to <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s policies.''
   The poll, taken <DATE>Jan. 13-17</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, also found that more Orange County residents see <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and
the Third World as a threat to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> than the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   Thirty-one percent said the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION> presented the greatest
threat to the future of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Just <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> said the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> presents the greatest threat, while <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> felt
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> was the greatest threat.
   On the issues of abortion, AIDS education and pornography, <LOCATION>Orange
County</LOCATION> residents again showed a softening of their perceived
conservative tendencies.
   Sixty percent opposed a <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ban on abortions and <PERCENT>56
percent</PERCENT> opposed a ban on the rental of X-rated films at video stores.
   Regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> favored
teaching youngsters in public schools about the use of condoms as a
means of controlling the spread of the deadly AIDS virus.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General <PERSON>Edwin
Meese III</PERSON> handed over to this island's military authorities two
speed boats to be used to fight drug trafficking.
   The long, sleek boats were confiscated from traffickers trying
to smuggle cocaine into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said.
They can reach speeds of 65 mph.
   Smugglers use this <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island nation as a transit point
for cocaine from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> bound for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``The Dominican Republic seems to be determined ... that
narcotics trafficking should be totally eliminated,'' <PERSON>Meese</PERSON> told
Gen. <PERSON>Antonio Imbert Barrera</PERSON>, the armed forces minister, on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Meese spoke on the first day of a five-nation Latin American
tour. He arrived by <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> jet and was due to leave <ORGANIZATION>Santo
Domingo</ORGANIZATION> today for <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>. Meese also will visit <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>.
   The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>. Drug runners have turned to the island as governments on the
neighboring islands of <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> tightened
surveillance of boats and planes.
   President <PERSON>Joaquin Balaguer</PERSON>, elected to a fifth term in <DATE>May 1986</DATE>,
has made the war on drugs a top priority. In <DATE>December 1986</DATE>, the
Dominican air force shot down a small plane that did not identify
itself upon demand. Officials later said it was carrying hundreds
of pounds of cocaine.
   In recent months, police and soldiers have seized cocaine
shipments weighing hundreds of pounds and valued at <MONEY>millions of
dollars</MONEY>. But suspected smugglers in high-powered boats often outran
the patrol boats of the <ORGANIZATION>Dominican coast guard</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``These (confiscated boats) are going to put the <LOCATION>Dominican
Republic</LOCATION> one step ahead of the smugglers,'' said one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The boats were confiscated from traffickers apprehended while
trying to smuggle drugs into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, he said.
   One is a 31-foot <PERSON>Chris Craft Scorpion</PERSON> with twin 235 horsepower
Mercury engines and the other a 33-foot Sonic Carrera 33RX, he
said. The value of the boats, delivered from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast
Guard</ORGANIZATION> C-130s, was not disclosed.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> also plans to supply five small, twin-engined
Cessnas to the Dominican air force under the <ORGANIZATION>Military Assistance
Program</ORGANIZATION>.
   Accompanying <PERSON>Meese</PERSON> were his wife, <PERSON>Ursula</PERSON>; the chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Drug

<TEXT>
   Iran told the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> today that
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> committed a ``barbaric crime'' in shooting down
an Iranian airliner and denied <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> claims that the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> warned the
jetliner before the attack.
   Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Ali-Akbar Velayati</PERSON>, in an angry speech,
accused the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> of a premeditated attack on the airliner
with 290 people aboard and demanded the withdrawal of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces
from the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>.
   ``This was the most inhuman military attack in the history of
civil aviation,'' he said.
   He accused the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> of ``arrogance, indifference and a
campaign of lies ... to justify this barbaric crime at any cost...
   ``This was a premeditated act of aggression against the
integrity of Tehran ... a massacre,'' he said.
   Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> called the accident a ``terrible
human tragedy'' but told the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> shares the
responsibility.
   ``The critical issue is not the how and why of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> Air 655,''
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said. ``It is the continuing refusal of the government of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>
to comply with (a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution), to negotiate an end
to the war with <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> and to cease its acts of aggression against
neutral shipping in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>.''
   He said <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> ``allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle.
That was irresponsible and a tragic error.''
   The meeting was requested by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>, which sought a condemnation
of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It adjourned after <PERSON>Velayati</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> spoke
and was scheduled to resume <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Iran also sought a condemnation of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from the
governing council of the <ORGANIZATION>International Civil Aviation Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
The council agreed today in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> that the world body should
investigate the incident, but only four of the 33 members _ <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>,
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION> _ spoke in favor of U.S
condemnation.
   Diplomats said the 15-member <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> was not in
agreement on a resolution or statement that would be acceptable to
all parties and would not be vetoed by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. As one of
the council's five permanent members, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has veto
power.
   Velayati quoted the radio transcript of recordings between
Flight 655 and control towers and said it shows that, contrary to
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> version, the plane never received warnings from the
<LOCATION>Vincennes</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 3</DATE>.
   ``It was traveling in an established civilian air corridor and
transmitting an internationally recognized signal to identify
itself ... Claiming mistaken identity is absurd,'' <PERSON>Velayati</PERSON> said.
   He rebutted <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> claims that the plane was descending in an
attack mode, that it was transmitting ambiguous civilian and
military signals and that it was outside a recognized air corridor.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> said the cruiser's crew mistook the A300 <ORGANIZATION>Airbus</ORGANIZATION> for a
fighter jet and the plane ignored radioed warnings.
   <PERSON>Velayati</PERSON> said the council should compel the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and
all foreign forces to leave the gulf.``Anything less would be a
further evasion of responsibilitry by the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The appearance of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> ambassador, was considered
a major gesture of hopes for better relations with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> after
nearly nine years of hostility. A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> vice president has not
addressed the council in years.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> under former
President <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> from <DATE>1971</DATE> to <DATE>1973</DATE>. This is believed to be
his first appearance at the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> since. President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has
appeared six times.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> denied any political
motivation for the appearance by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee.
   ``The vice president does not normally appear before the
<ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> and in this way we can again highlight our
position,'' <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> already has expressed deep regret for the
attack and promised compensation to the families of the victims,
but not to the Iranian government.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> in
<DATE>November 1979</DATE> after Iranian revolutionaries stormed the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> and took Americans hostage, holding them for more
than a year.
   But both <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> clearly want to avoid a
bitter public confrontation in the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION>, and both sides
have been restrained in their statements here and elsewhere.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has backed off from its call for the council
to impose a mandatory, global arms embargo against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
   Secretary of State <PERSON>George P. Shultz</PERSON> has said that before the
airliner was shot down, Iranian officials had sent probes about
opening a dialogue with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION>, the No. 2 leader, Parliament Speaker <PERSON>Hashemi
Rafsanjani</PERSON>, has urged moderation and restraint and opposed violent
retaliation for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attack. He previously has said <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> must
stop offending the international community, end its isolation and
gain political friends and trading partners.

   <PERSON>Lech Walesa</PERSON> faces a runoff in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s
presidential contest, but if it were up to the 36,000 Poles who
cast ballots in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> he'd already be in office.
   ``He is the only man for the job,'' <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> cab driver
<PERSON>Alexander Gorka</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``He can take the country out of the
critical situation it's in.''
   Walesa, the Solidarity leader who led the revolt against four
decades of Communist rule in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, got <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the vote
among Poles in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> who voted <DATE>Saturday</DATE>,
said Consul <PERSON>Andrezj Jaroszynski</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.
   Citing unofficial figures, he said Prime Minister <PERSON>Tadeusz
Mazowiecki</PERSON> placed second with <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> of the ballots cast by
36,006 voters in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>.
   Upstart emigre businessman <PERSON>Stanislaw Tyminski</PERSON>, who beat
<PERSON>Mazowiecki</PERSON> for second in voting in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, had about <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of
the North American vote.
   In <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Walesa</PERSON> had just under <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the vote with 44
of 49 provinces reporting. Tyminski, with <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT>, made a
surprise showing by beating <PERSON>Mazowiecki</PERSON>, who had <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> of the
vote. Three other candidates trailed far behind. Final results were
expected later today.
   A <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE> runoff will be held between the two top vote-getters if
neither wins an outright majority.
   <PERSON>Gorka</PERSON>, who drove from <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Polish Consulate</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to vote, said he cried when he cast his ballot for <PERSON>Walesa</PERSON>,
who had been favored to win.
   ``It was such an important day for me,'' <PERSON>Gorka</PERSON> said. ``It was
the first time in my life I had the freedom to vote in a truly
democratic election in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.''
   Turnout was lower than expected in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, where only 9,810 of
more than 40,000 eligible voters went to three polling places,
<PERSON>Jaroszynski</PERSON> said.
   The metropolitan area has a larger bloc of Poles and
Polish-Americans, a total of 800,000 to 1.2 million, than any
municipality outside <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>.
   More than 16,000 ballots were cast in <LOCATION>New York state</LOCATION>, according
to the consulate in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Pushing for Foreign Investment Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investment in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is
expected to accelerate dramatically this year, but the true scope
of overseas ownership remains hidden, a congressional critic
complains.
   ``We need to know if foreign ownership is concentrating itself
in key areas of our economy _ energy, steel, banking _ whether
foreign ownership is gaining control of key sectors of the American
economy,'' says Rep. <PERSON>John Bryant</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Texas</LOCATION>.
   Bryant came into the spotlight last year as sponsor of a
provision of the 1,000-page trade bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. It
would have forced a major increase in the amount of disclosure
required of foreign investors.
   Lawmakers eventually dropped <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON>'s heavily debated plan in an
unsuccessful effort to win President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s approval. And it is
not part of the revised version of the trade bill now under debate.
   But <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> is still pushing legislation to require foreign
owners to register their major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assets with the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce
Department</ORGANIZATION>, including business, industrial, real estate and farm
holdings.
   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration opposes his bill because ``they don't
want to look like the folks that gave away the store,'' the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>
Democrat said.
   Prospects for getting the bill to the president's desk this year
are not especially bright, but <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> vows not to give up.
   To bolster his case, he cites a private study released <DATE>last week</DATE>
showing foreign ownership in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> more than tripled
since <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Economic Leadership Institute</ORGANIZATION> said foreign
investors own about <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> of prime commercial real estate in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, and <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> in
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>.
   It said they own <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manufacturing base, hold
a majority interest in concrete and consumer electronics
industries, and a significant portion in machine tools, chemicals
and auto parts.
   Nearly 3 million Americans are employed full or part-time as a
result of foreign investment, the study said.
   It acknowledged, however, that foreign investments still account
for no more than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assets.
   <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> said it is ``foolhardy'' to believe foreign investors
will avoid the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> if they must register their holdings
because ``every other country collects careful data'' without
scaring off business.
   <PERSON>Nancy LeaMond</PERSON>, president of the institute, said: ``In our
innermost circle of trading partners, we are the only nation that
swings the door open unconditionally to virtually every
investment.''
   Treasury Secretary <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> and former Cabinet
official <PERSON>Elliot Richardson</PERSON> claim <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON>'s bill is anti-competitive.
   <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> that
it would discourage foreign investment and result in higher <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
interest rates and an economic slowdown.
   <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> called the reporting requirements burdensome. He said
sufficient data already have been collected by 16 federal agencies
and that investors would have to reveal business secrets.
   In its study, the institute said an ``unprecedented transfer of
American assets to foreign control is under way.''
   Since <DATE>1980</DATE>, foreign direct investment in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
expanded by more than <PERCENT>215 percent</PERCENT>, while American investment abroad
jumped by one-fifth that rate, the study said.
   Foreign buy-outs are expected to make up as much as <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> acquisitions <DATE>this year</DATE>, up from <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, said the
study, which based its findings on the latest available data from
the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION> and other sources.

<TEXT>
   Iraq <DATE>today</DATE> ordered 33-year-old reservists
to report for military duty, its third major call-up of reserves in
recent weeks.
   The ruling <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Command Council</ORGANIZATION> also issued a statement
of defiance on <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, saying it wanted peace but would not cave in
to demands by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and its allies.
   The council said it rejected American attempts to impose a date
for a meeting between <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON>James
A. Baker III</PERSON>. The two sides have been unable to agree on a date for
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> to visit <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>.
   Baghdad newspapers reported the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Defense</ORGANIZATION> has recalled
men born in <DATE>1957</DATE> to bolster the mobilization of almost 500,000
soldiers already in <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>.
   Saddam said on <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> he would send 250,000 men - seven new
divisions, apparently drawn from reserve forces, and 150,000
reservists and draftees.
   The move came after President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> announced <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces in the
<LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> would be increased by about 200,000 - to almost
450,000 military personnel in the region - by early <DATE>January</DATE>.
   Since then, <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> has recalled about 60,000 reservist farmers and
an unknown number of others aged 30, 31 and 32.
   <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> has a force of 500,000 regular soldiers and 480,000
reserves, the sixth largest army in the world. The country of 17
million has about 900,000 men aged 18 to 22 and 1.3 million aged 23
to 32, according to the <ORGANIZATION>International Institute for Strategic
Studies</ORGANIZATION>.
   The newspaper reports said recruiting offices had informed them
that the 33-year-olds, should report to their units in a week. The
number of affected men was not known.
   Iraq usually recalls its reserves through statements read over
state television and radio. There was no explanation why that
procedure was not followed this time.
   After the <DATE>Aug. 2</DATE> invasion of <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, a U.S.-led multinational
force assembled in the gulf to confront <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> resolution has
authorized the use of force to liberate <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> unless <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>
withdraws its troops by <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE>.
   Iraq had suggested that Foreign Minister <PERSON>Tariq Aziz</PERSON> travel to
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> today for talks there, and that <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> come to <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Jan. 12</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> rejected that date, saying it was too close to
the <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> deadline set by the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> to
withdraw from <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> or face military action.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Command Council</ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <ORGANIZATION>Saddam</ORGANIZATION>,
issued a statement broadcast over <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> radio saying:
   ``We seek peace. We want dialogue for the sake of peace. We
respect legitimacy and seek the application of the international
law on the nation's causes. However, we reject capitulation.''
   It said the Iraqi leaders ``reject the unilateral imposition of
dates as the president of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.A.</ORGANIZATION> wishes vis-a-vis the dialogue
to which he agreed.''
   The statement said <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> was not afraid of the ``fleets and
forces of oppression.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rightist <ORGANIZATION>Republican
Nationalist Alliance</ORGANIZATION> handily defeated the governing Christian
Democrats in legislative and municipal elections this week,
election officials announced.
   The defeat presented President <PERSON>Jose Napoleon Duarte</PERSON>, the
staunchest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ally in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, with the prospect of an
uphill climb in his final year in office. Presidential elections
are set for <DATE>March 1989</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mario Samayoa</PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Elections Council</ORGANIZATION>,
told journalists ``more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT>'' of the votes cast on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> went to the alliance, known by its Spanish acronym of Arena.
He declined to be more specific, saying complete returns would be
ready shortly.
   The announcement <DATE>Monday</DATE> of a majority for <ORGANIZATION>Arena</ORGANIZATION> signaled a
triumph even greater than the rightists had predicted.
   They had 13 deputies in the outgoing 60-seat <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>,
which the centrist Christian Democrats controlled with 33 seats.
   Arena appeared assured of at least 31 seats in the new chamber.
The party predicted it would have 35. Local media projected 33-35
seats for the rightists. The Christian Democrats were expected to
get about 22 seats.
   Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla boycott call and threats of
violence to cast ballots. The guerrillas said the elections were
illegitimate, contending that free and fair elections could not be
held in wartime.
   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> sent <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> almost <MONEY>$600 million</MONEY> in military and
economic aid last year, more than the amount given to any country
in the hemisphere.
   Arena candidate <PERSON>Armado Calderon Sol</PERSON>, a 39-year-old lawyer, won
the mayor's race in <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>, the capital and home to 1.5
million of the country's 5 million people. <ORGANIZATION>Calderon Sol</ORGANIZATION> defeated
Christian Democratic candidate <PERSON>Alejandro Duarte</PERSON>, the president's
son.
   <PERSON>Samayoa</PERSON> said Arena won most of the rest of the country's
municipalities.
   Arena benefited from a groundswell of popular discontent with
the Christian Democrats. Duarte won the presidency in <DATE>1984</DATE> on a
platform of ending the war and improving the Salvadoran economy.
   The 8-year-old war continues, unemployment is estimated at <PERCENT>40
percent</PERCENT> and annual inflation is estimated at nearly <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT>.
   Arena's campaign slogan was ``Change for the Better.''
   Arena President <PERSON>Alfredo Cristiani</PERSON>, who kept his assembly seat,
told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> his party would try to reach agreement on
fundamental points with all parties represented in the legislature,
including how to wage the war.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make
them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not
leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said.
   He indicated that <ORGANIZATION>Arena</ORGANIZATION>, which has considerable support and good
connections with military officers, would work to step up
offensives against the rebels.
   ``This low intensity conflict idea should be erased,'' he said,
referring to smaller-scale, U.S.-backed counterinsurgency tactics
that have been adopted by the Salvadoran army.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> hailed <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION>'s
national elections and called them a strong victory for the
democratic process.
   Sen. <PERSON>Richard Lugar</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ind.</LOCATION>, who led an observer team named by
President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, called the election honest and important
``because power transferred peacefully'' and ``the rebels didn't
win.''
   <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Charles Redman</PERSON>, asked whether the
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration had any reservations about a rightist
victory, said that ``we don't choose sides in these kinds of
elections.''
   The fiercely nationalistic Arena was formed in <DATE>1981</DATE>, with
retired army Maj. <PERSON>Roberto d'Aubuisson</PERSON> its founder. D'Aubuisson has
strongly criticized the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and is considered the driving
force behind early <DATE>1980s</DATE> death-squads.

<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s popularity has soared in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since the last superpower summit, and Americans
increasingly support <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military cuts to reflect the lessened
tensions, a survey found.
   As President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> prepare
to meet in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> this week, the national Media
General-Associated Press poll found both leaders continuing to
command great popularity among Americans.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> slipped only slightly from his overall rating in a
similar poll before the last summit in <DATE>December</DATE>, even though a
third of the respondents now think less highly of him because of
his crackdown on <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>.
   Most striking in the new survey were growing expressions of good
will toward <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s old Cold War foe. Forty-one percent of the
respondents said they held favorable views of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>,
well up from <PERCENT>24 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>last November</DATE> and <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> in a <DATE>1987</DATE>
survey.
   Fourteen percent of the respondents in the new poll had
unfavorable opinions of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> had a
neutral view.
   In another measure of growing trust, a relatively low <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT>
believed the Soviets seek to dominate the world. That fear factor
stood at <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>last November</DATE> and <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> in a <ORGANIZATION>CBS News-New
York Times</ORGANIZATION> poll a year ago.
   The new Media General-AP survey was conducted by telephone <DATE>May
11-20</DATE> among a random sample of 1,143 adults across the country. It
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus <PERCENT>3 percentage points</PERCENT>.
   The summit starts <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> amid continuing upheaval in the
communist world. <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> is pushing reforms of the Soviet system
while struggling to contain independence movements in some of the
Soviet republics. His Eastern European allies, once viewed as
puppets, largely have abandoned communism.
   Possibly because of <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s difficulties, the survey found
some sense that the initiative in superpower relations has shifted
to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. In <DATE>November</DATE>, <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> said <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was doing more than
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to reduce tensions, but in the new survey that fell to <PERCENT>33
percent</PERCENT>.
   At the same time, those saying <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was doing more to ease
tensions rose from <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>November</DATE> to <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> now. The
rest were unsure.
   Similarly, <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was doing enough to encourage
Soviet reforms _ up from <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>November</DATE> _ and <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT>
said he was being too cautious, down from <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>November</DATE>.
Again the rest were unsure.
   In view of the lessened tensions, <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> in the new survey
said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should reduce its military spending
significantly, up from <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> who favored such cuts last
<DATE>November</DATE>.
   Additionally, nearly four in 10 said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should
immediately begin reducing its forces in <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>. While
still a minority, that was up from <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   The poll found some lingering suspicion of the Soviets. Half
said the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> cannot be trusted to live up to arms control
agreements _ about the same as in <DATE>November</DATE>, but down from <PERCENT>61
percent</PERCENT> a year ago.
   On <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> said the breakaway Baltic republic
should back off from its claim of independence from the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> and hold negotiations, while <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> said it should push
its claim. The rest had no opinion.
   But there was support for gradual independence for the Baltic
states. Fifty-seven percent favored the actions of <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Latvia</LOCATION>, which have claimed independence, while just <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT>
favored the actions of <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION>, which wants independence but has
not formally claimed it.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> has responded to <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>'s claim by denying it
shipments of oil and other supplies. While <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT> said the
embargo has made them think less highly of <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, <PERCENT>48 percent</PERCENT>
said it had not changed their view.
   Overall, <PERCENT>63 percent</PERCENT> had a favorable impression of <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> and
<PERCENT>69 percent</PERCENT> held a favorable view of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. As in earlier surveys,
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> outpolled <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, <PERCENT>79-68 percent</PERCENT>, among the best-educated
respondents, those with postgraduate schooling.
   An overwhelming <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of all respondents approved of the
way <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is handling relations with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.

topped the list.;    This year, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was cited by <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of

"respondents" were the number of people contacted or the number who replied to
questions. Japanese polls usually do not include margins of error because
pollsters believe their inclusion would make the samplings seem more
scientific and accurate than they really are.  </TEXT>

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON>Elliott Abrams</PERSON> is a man not given to compromise
or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political
enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy,
where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered.
Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs means
to soldier on until the end of President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s term.
