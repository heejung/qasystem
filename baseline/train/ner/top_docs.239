   Former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> was listed
in serious condition <TIME>this morning</TIME>, recovering from a near drowning
in her backyard pool, and a doctor says she could be out of the
hospital within a week.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' said <PERSON>Dr. James Little</PERSON>, a neurologist.
``She's very close to normal right now. I think she will continue
to improve. As best as I can tell right now, she probably will
regain full mental functions.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>'s condition was upgraded <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> from
critical to serious but stable, and she continued to improve <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman <PERSON>Kari Larsen</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, 52, gave the thumbs-up sign <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to her intensive
care unit nurse and was able to talk.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said <PERSON>Dr. William J. Deaton</PERSON>, a pulmonary specialist.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit <TIME>this morning</TIME>,'' <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON>
said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``She is vastly improved.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, who gained national attention during the <DATE>1974</DATE>
Watergate impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter
to <ORGANIZATION>Brackenridge Hospital</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after being found floating
face-down in her pool.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>'s live-in companion, <PERSON>Nancy Earl</PERSON>, called paramedics,
who restored her pulse and breathing.
   <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said she came ``within four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   ``She does not know what happened and was clearly concerned
about it and had indicated that she didn't think she would go
swimming alone again,'' <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> was breathing <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> only with the help of a
ventilator, but <DATE>Sunday</DATE> the device was gone and she was responding
to questions and talking, doctors said.
   <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, the Democratic vice presidential candidate,
telephoned a message for <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON>Carolyn
Hinckley Boyle</PERSON> said. <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> made a seconding speech for
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s nomination at the recent <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   Doctors said it isn't known what caused <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> to lose
consciousness in the pool, but the lack of oxygen caused cardiac
arrest.
   <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said he expected <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> to remain in intensive care
for 48 hours and to be hospitalized for about a week.
   The doctors said <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, who has been confined to a
wheelchair for several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis. She
swims as therapy.
   ``She has muscle weakness, and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said.
   Doctors were uncertain how long she was in the pool before being
discovered. <PERSON>Ms. Earl</PERSON> said she returned from a short errand to find
<PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> unconscious in the pool.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> in <DATE>1966</DATE> became the first black state senator in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
history. In <DATE>1972</DATE>, she was the first Southern black elected to
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction, serving until <DATE>1978</DATE>, when she left
politics after three terms in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to teach at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Texas</ORGANIZATION>.

   Former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> was
``vastly improved'' and giving the thumbs-up sign to her hospital
nurse <DATE>Sunday</DATE> following a near-drowning in her swimming pool.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said <PERSON>Dr. William J. Deaton</PERSON>, a lung specialist treating <PERSON>Ms.
Jordan</PERSON>.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of

   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her

   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, 52, who gained national attention during the <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>
impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter to
<ORGANIZATION>Brackenridge Hospital</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after she was found floating
face-down in her pool.
   <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said she came within ``four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> apparently lost consciousness while in the pool.
Deaton and <PERSON>Dr. James Little</PERSON>, a neurologist, said it isn't known
what caused her to lose consciousness, but that the lack of oxygen
then caused cardiac arrest.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> had been in critical condition in the hospital's
intensive care unit, but <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> that ``she's
upgraded now. She's certainly stable, in a much less serious
condition.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> was breathing without the aid of a mechanical
ventilator, responding to questions and trying to make sure a
<DATE>Monday</DATE> dental appointment was canceled. ``She obviously has pretty
good mental recall if that's her biggest concern,'' <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' <PERSON>Little</PERSON> said. ``She's very close to normal
right now. I think she will continue to improve. As best as I can
tell right now, she probably will regain full mental functions.''
   The doctors said <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, who has used a wheelchair for
several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis but her condition
shouldn't have had an effect on the incident.
   ``She has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON> said.
   Little said possible causes for her losing consciousness were a
sudden heartbeat irregularity or a seizure. But hospital tests
showed ``her cardiac status has been very stable. She's had no
evidence of seizure activity,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> delivered a nominating speech for vice presidential
candidate <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National
Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> telephoned a message to <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>
on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON>Carolyn Hinckley Boyle</PERSON>.
   Visitors to the hospital have included <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON>Ann
Richards</PERSON>, who delivered the keynote address at the convention; <PERSON>Walt
Rostow</PERSON>, a former aide to President <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON>; University of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> women's basketball Coach <PERSON>Jody Conradt</PERSON>; plus <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>'s two
sisters and live-in companion, <PERSON>Nancy Earl</PERSON>, who found <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> in
the pool.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> is a fan of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>' Lady Longhorns,
and nurse <PERSON>Barbara Tucker</PERSON> said the basketball team's former star,
<PERSON>Fran Harris</PERSON>, visited before leaving for the Olympic trials.
   ``When I remember seeing <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> on TV, I frequently remember
the thumbs-up sign that things are OK. She's probably given me that
about 20 times today,'' <PERSON>Ms. Tucker</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> in <DATE>1966</DATE> became the first black state senator in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
history. In <DATE>1972</DATE>, she was the first Southern black elected to

   Former Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>, recovering from a near
drowning, talked politics with reporters and her nurses <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
and said she's feeling much better.
   ``I really feel great. All I know is right now, I could not die
because this is the Democrats' year and I have got to be around to
celebrate it,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, 52, who remained in fair condition
at <ORGANIZATION>Brackenridge Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> gave the seconding speech for <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate at the party's
recent <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sitting in a chair in her hospital room, <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> remarked on
the good wishes she has received from across the nation.
   ``I have received cards, telegrams, letters, flowers from all
over this country,'' she said. ``If I did have the desire to return
to active politics, I think I could make a good run at national
office. I am very grateful and I feel very fortunate to have so
many people feel do deeply and care so much for me.''
   The former three-term congresswoman and first black state
senator in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> history said she has no plans to leave her current
teaching job at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas' Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``My plans were and are to continue to teach ... and to continue
to educate young minds to take over this country,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> said she didn't remember much about the accident that
happened around noon <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. She lost consciousness while in her
backyard swimming pool and was found face-down in the pool by her
roommate.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, who uses a wheelchair because she suffers from what
doctors say is a disease similar to multiple sclerosis, swims for
exercise. She said she hopes the accident won't make her afraid to
continue.
   ``I hope that I'm not traumatized by this event so I refrain
from doing that ... I enjoyed it,'' she said.
   She also said she was grateful for the efforts of the emergency
medical service technicians and hospital helicopter crew who
rescued her.
   ``It's a compilation of people who did superb work to see to it
that I can sit here today and talk to you. And I thank them and am
grateful for it,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> is being treated in the hospital's critical care
unit. Doctors said she may remain hospitalized for about four more
days.

   Former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> remained in
critical condition early <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after she was found floating
unconscious in her swimming pool, authorities said.
   ``She's been awake off and on through the <TIME>night</TIME>, but she goes
right to sleep,'' said <PERSON>Sheryln Gembol</PERSON>, a nursing supervisor at
<ORGANIZATION>Brackenridge Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're trying to let her rest.
   ``They're going to be running some more tests throughout the day
<DATE>today</DATE>. They know it was not a heart attack or a stroke, but as far
as what made her unconscious in the pool, they're not sure,'' she
added.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, who rose to fame during the Watergate impeachment
hearings, was found in the pool about noon <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by a woman who
lives with her.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON>, 52, was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
Paramedics ``said she had a pulse, was trying to breathe and they
were able to help her breathe en route to hospital,'' said hospital
spokeswoman <PERSON>Carolyn Boyle</PERSON>.
   At a briefing <DATE>late Saturday</DATE>, a doctor said <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> was being
treated for fluid in her lungs but showed no signs of heart or
brain dysfunction.
   ``She has full recovery of her intellectual functions. Her vital
signs are much better,'' <PERSON>Dr. William Deaton</PERSON> said. Though she
remained in critical condition, ``the capital `c' is not so big as
when she got here.''
   ``She has to heal her own lungs, which she will hopefully do,''
added <PERSON>Deaton</PERSON>, a lung specialist. He said <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> apparently lost
consciousness while swimming alone in the pool, for unknown
reasons. A lack of oxygen then caused the cardiac arrest, he said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> has had medical problems for several years and has
used a wheelchair to get to her job on the faculty of the <ORGANIZATION>Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> has refused to discuss the illness, calling it ``a
mobility problem'' and denying it was <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON>'s disease or bone
cancer. Deaton described it as a progressive loss of ``nerve
function in her lower extremities'' similar to multiple sclerosis.
   In <DATE>1966</DATE>, <PERSON>Ms. Jordan</PERSON> became the first black state senator in
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. In <DATE>1972</DATE>, she was the first Southern black elected to
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction.
   She gained a national reputation during the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary
Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1974</DATE> hearings that ended with a vote to press
impeachment charges against President <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>. She stirred
television audiences when she declared, ``My faith in the
Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total.''

<HEAD>Delegates Finally Get a Towering _ A Really Towering _ Democrat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For once, a really towering Democrat _ not the
towering kind evoked in political rhetoric _ addressed the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>, the senator from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> who once played on two
world champion <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Knicks basketball teams, got the kind of
reception from convention delegates that marks him as a political
comer.
   The hall blossomed with orange and blue signs, not for <PERSON>Michael
Dukakis</PERSON> or <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, but for ``<PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s
pride.''
   At 6-foot-5, <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> was too tall to use the prompting devices
on either side of the podium, so his speech was scrolled up on a
television screen across the hall.
   ``This is a real first for me tonight,'' he said. ``It's the
first time I've spoken to a national convention and the first time
I've performed in The Omni wearing long pants.''
   The convention hall normally is used for <LOCATION>Atlanta Hawks</LOCATION> games.
   Bradley made everybody's list of vice presidential possibilities
early in the Democratic campaign, but he took himself out of
consideration last month.
   ``Does it make any difference who is president of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>?'' he asked.
   ``Did Lincoln make a difference? Did <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON> ... Ask
anyone who lived through the depression if <PERSON>Franklin Delano
Roosevelt</PERSON> made a difference. Ask any European who has democracy if
<PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON> made any difference. Ask anyone who cares about human
rights if <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> made a difference.''
   By the time <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> took the microphone, before <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen</PERSON>'s name was put in nomination for the vice presidency, the
convention hall was filled to overflowing.
   The delegates let loose with some of the most enthusiastic
cheering of the <TIME>night</TIME> when former Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, a
heroine of Democrats since the Watergate days of <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>,
seconded <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s nomination.
   ``Why?'' she asked. ``First of all because he's my senator and I
wasn't planning to come to this convention for any purpose'' other
than that.
   ``Our minds are turning away from `Hooray for <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>' and we
are now confronted with the hard reality of a natioln which desires
to become solvent again,''
   ``We want to retake the moral high ground,'' she said.
   ``The rostrum was lowered to desk height to accommodate <PERSON>Ms.
Jordan</PERSON>'s wheelchair. She suffers from a degenerative bone disease.
   True to his word, the fire marshal closed the doors at <TIME>7:30
p.m.</TIME>, shutting out hundreds for the third night. The smart people
got in early.
   Rep. <PERSON>Claude Pepper</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, the oldest <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> member at age
87, sat on the front row of his state's delegation for his 13th
Democratic convention _ every one since <DATE>1940</DATE> when <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> was
nominated for his third term.
   ``It's a well-run convention, well-handled,'' he said. ``It
shows <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' good management skills. We're going to be
victorious.''
   But you couldn't sell that to many Democrats who had to miss
dinner to make it inside the hall. Long lines formed at The Omni's
food concessions, where the menu consisted of pizza, hot dogs,
popcorn and ice cream bars.
   Inevitably, some concessions ran out of food.
   That did nothing to dampen the spirit of <PERSON>John Economos</PERSON>, a
restaurateur from <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. He carried a hand-lettered sign
that read, ``Vote for <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>.'' Nothing unusual about
that, except it was in Greek.
   All was hope and promise in the convention hall on the <TIME>last
night</TIME>.
   ``Do you feel the excitement in the air?'' asked the chairman,
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   ``Yes!'' shouted the delegates.
   ``Are we going carry the South this year?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Will we win in <DATE>November</DATE>?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Do you promise me that?''
   ``Yes!''

<HEAD>Gramm: Convention Will Have Texas Accent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Next week's <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION> will
have a distinct <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> accent, says the man who will nominate <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON> for president.
   ``It is clear in this convention that I'm doing the nominating
and another Texan's doing the accepting, and that's pretty much
what conventions are about. So it's a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> show from that point of
view,'' <PERSON>Sen. Phil Gramm</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Texas</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   However, <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said, those watching the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> convention will hear
something quite different from last month's Democratic convention,
where <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> state Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> set the tone with several
wisecracks about <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> during her keynote speech including that the
wealthy vice president was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   ``You're going to see a stark contrast between my speech and the
speeches you heard at the Democratic convention,'' <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said he plans to use his speech to highlight the
differences between Vice President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>.
   ``I am not a good name-caller. People don't care what I think
about <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> in terms of some cutesy-poo thing I might
call him,'' he said.
   Still, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Republicans have a tough act to follow.
   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> officials have referred jokingly to last
month's <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> as their state
convention due to the prominent role played by Texans.
   Among them were <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, the vice presidential
nominee; <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, the keynoter; <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, convention chairman; former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Barbara
Jordan</PERSON>, who seconded <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s nomination; Agriculture Commissioner
<PERSON>Jim Hightower</PERSON>, who gave a prime-time speech, and state Rep. <PERSON>Lena
Guerrero</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Austin</LOCATION>, who helped present the party platform to
delegates.
   Democrats also believe the selection of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> as <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>'
running mate will help their ticket carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the nation's
third-largest state, and its 29 electoral votes. A total of 270
electoral votes are needed to win the presidency.
   ``The campaign in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is going to be a hotly contested
campaign,'' <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said. ``We've got to put before the people of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> those two records. If we don't win in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> given <PERSON>Michael
Dukakis</PERSON>' record, we don't deserve to win.''

But not everybody belted it out with the same raucous vigour.
Take the lead tenor from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. There was a time when <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>
could hold an audience in <LOCATION>Madison Square Garden</LOCATION> in the palm of his hand on
any given evening.
That stopped 15 years ago. 'Bradley back in the <LOCATION>Garden</LOCATION>' - to quote the
buttons on every <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> delegate in sight - was not wearing basketball
sneakers and a number 24 shirt, but the dark suit and tie of a professional
politician increasingly regarded as the Democratic party's thoughtful
conscience and, albeit less widely, as its best presidential candidate - not
this year but before too long.
Senator <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON>'s keynote address on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> showed him at his least,
and most, impressive. On the down side, one conclusion is safe. Rumour has
it that he has spent almost as many hours practising his public speaking as
he did his jump shot. If so, it was to much less effect.
The <PERSON>Garden</PERSON> did not hang on his every word, not in comparison to his
fellow-keynote speakers. Governor <PERSON>Zell Miller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, for example, had
them rocking in the aisles with his full-frontal assault on the Republican
opposition.
Yet even he paled into insignificance when the final act. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>,
black and now confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, delivered a
soaring, cadenced civics lecture, in its way as memorable as the address she
gave in the same arena to the <DATE>1976</DATE> convention when a congresswoman from
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
As a formal speaker, <PERSON>Mr Bradley</PERSON> still lacks the necessary attributes of
timing and delivery. He swallows his good lines and talks on when his
audience is applauding.
There are other considerations. First, one speech does not necessarily a
political <DATE>summer</DATE> or winter make. <PERSON>Mr Mario Cuomo</PERSON> gave a great one to the <DATE>1984</DATE>
convention and is still only governor of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>; Governor <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>
delivered a terrible one to the <DATE>1988</DATE> convention and is about to be the
Democratic presidential nominee.
Second, there was, as ever, substance to the <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> speech. The theme -
facing up to collective responsibilities rather than indulging in
'individual thrills' - is not new for him, but he is developing it all the
time. It is one that is not easily reduced to slogans.
'What we face is a crisis of meaning,' he said in one of his pithier
passages. 'Without meaning, there can be no hope; without hope there can be
no struggle, and without struggle there can be no personal betterment.
Individualism degenerates into greed without agreement on its limits. The
microchip may be faster than the human brain but it isn't connected to a
heart. A new drug might defeat a disease but it won't eradicate hatred.'
Or, again on a more hopeful note: 'It is sometimes said Americans lack a
sense of tragic life. It would be more correct to say that Americans are not
content to let tragedy have the last word. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is history's
greatest experiment in the elimination of despair.'
This is the sort of reflective philosophy that political conhear. Add to
them <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>'s reflections - the need for equality of sacrifice,
including social entitlement programmes, the impermissibility of racism, be
it black or white, and the imperative of valuing reason over emotion in
assessing character - and it cannot be said that the Democrats were sent
home to bed with nothing to think about.
The vague sense of dislocation is that this was not the intended dual theme
of the first night. One part of this was to be a lot of Bush-bashing, to
which <PERSON>Mr Bradley</PERSON> ponderously contributed. Perot-pulverising, however, was
much less in the score, though there was some of it from Governor <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>.
The Democrats have worked out that the Bush-Perot conflict helps them.
The other element was to demonstrate that this is no longer a party of
pot-smoking, draft-dodging subversives - not in living memory have its
delegates been presented with such an orgy of flag-waving patriotism,
derived from Republican choreography.
Emotions were wound up not, as in days of yore, by the haunting and
socially-conscious songs of <PERSON>Woody Guthrie</PERSON> (This Land is Your Land) and by
gospel choirs, but by a succession of marching and big bands straight out of
high school and <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> floor shows. This was designed as a celebration of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, marred only by the fact that a whole line of white tubas was
clearly emblazoned with the name of their Japanese manufacturer.
Dissent was also dismissed with Republican efficiency. When 600-odd
delegates began chanting 'let <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> speak' on behalf of the former governor
of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the other <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ron</PERSON>, the party chairman, moved briskly to
other business. It will require an act of some magnanimity for the
Californian to be permitted to address the convention. <PERSON>Mr Nelson Mandela</PERSON>,
who is to speak tonight, was much easier to fit in at short notice.
Hardly a word was heard from the podium that might embarrass the party
nominee. <PERSON>Barbara Boxer</PERSON>, running for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, got in a dig
at the free trade agreement with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, which <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> basically
supports, and <PERSON>Mr David Dinkins</PERSON>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> mayor, went further than <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>
in demanding that US cities be rebuilt before those in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>.
But that was about it. Unless <PERSON>Mr Cuomo</PERSON>, who is to nominate <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>
tonight, publicly urges him to come clean and raise taxes, as he did on
television on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, departure from the party line is not scripted.
The delegates responded to this new direction. They cheered at every
invocation of their national spirit and at every imprecation against the
Republicans. The <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> delegation leader epitomised the spirit of the night
by declaring that he was from 'the state which knows how to spell potato'
(which Vice-President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> does not).
In this mood, they might have expected something more rollicking from <PERSON>Bill
Bradley</PERSON>. When he talked, so did they, among themselves, which is standard
practice most of the time, but not necessarily in front of keynote speakers
in prime televised time. It took a Jordanesque gift of oratory to make them
listen.
It was indeed a first night which, for all that its target was
middle-America, was not without its subtle contradictions. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> will
have to square them when he speaks before the final curtain.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>' choice of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen</PERSON> to be his running mate drew praise from fellow Democrats
today, with several of them likening it to another
Massachusetts-Texas ticket _ <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON>
in <DATE>1960</DATE>.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in <DATE>1960</DATE> _ and it will do the same for the nation in <DATE>1988</DATE>,''
said <PERSON>Sen. Edward Kennedy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, younger brother of the late
president.
   Dukakis and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> both were quick to draw the comparison
between this campaign and the <DATE>one 28 years ago</DATE>.
   ``The <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> ex'es were good for the
country and good for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE> and it's going to
be a real winner in <DATE>November</DATE> of 88,'' <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   ``Selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential
act _ if I can use that word _ that I will do,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said in
introducing his running mate. ``<PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> brings to this ticket
and will bring to this nation years of experience.''
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s ``selection gives the Democratic Party a strong ticket
for <DATE>November</DATE> _ and even more important, the strong prospect of
eight solid years of effective new leadership for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said.
   Texas State Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>, who will be the keynote
speaker at next week's Democratic convention in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, called
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``a level guy'' who ``will make a great vice president''
and added:
   ``There's always been a sort of Austin-to-Boston, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>,
connection, and I think that this ticket adds that same sort of
magic.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> also said that <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> would boost Democrats'
chances in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, one of the states that <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' likely Republican
opponent, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, calls home.
   Sen. <PERSON>Paul Simon</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ill.</LOCATION>, whose own hopes for the presidential
nomination were dashed earlier this year, agreed that <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> could
help the Democratic ticket in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and said he thought the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
senator might help the Democrats carry <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> as
well.
   ``<PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> is a skilled and seasoned lawmaker,'' <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>
said. ``This is an excellent choice, and this is a winning ticket.
   ``Democratic prospects in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> will be
boosted immediately and, when the American people get to know <PERSON>Lloyd
Bentsen</PERSON>, it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> added.
   Arkansas Gov. <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, who will deliver the nominating
speech for <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, said he also believed that <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> would help
the Democrats carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and would help the party across the
region.
   ``I like and respect him very much,'' <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said.
   Sen. <PERSON>Barbara Mikulski</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Md.</LOCATION>, said she believes ``<PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>
will be a fine addition to the Democratic ticket. He knows his
issues and he knows his politics. Best of all,'' she said, ``he
knows how to beat <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>. He did just that in <DATE>1970</DATE> to become
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator.''
   In <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, where Democrats had been pushing home state <PERSON>Sen. Bob
Graham</PERSON> for the No. 2 spot on the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> ticket, state Rep. <PERSON>Mike
Abrams</PERSON> also offered praise for <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and said a Dukakis-Bentsen
victory in his state is ``doable.''
   ``We all know it's going to be tough,'' said <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON>, who is
coordinator of the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. But, he added, the
choice of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``shows a sensitivity to the South'' and ``brings
defense and foreign policy and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> experience,'' all
considered crucial to a Democratic victory in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.
   Even backers of <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>, who came in second to <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> in
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of
those the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor had considered for the second
spot, seemed satisfied with <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> state Rep. <PERSON>James Burke</PERSON>, who was the state campaign
coordinator for <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, said, ``We would have preferred to have
had <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON>.'' He added, though, that ``<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> is a better choice
than some of the others he could have picked.''
   <PERSON>John White</PERSON>, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and said it would ``make <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> a hell of a battlefield.''
   Union activists also praised <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, saying that the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and
layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this
year.
   ``<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
<PERSON>Robert McGlotten</PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION>. ``And he
let his colleagues know how he felt.''
   <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON>, who four years ago was picked as Democrat
<PERSON>Walter Mondale</PERSON>'s running mate, said she was ``delighted'' at the
choice of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>.
   ``I think it's an indication that Governor <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> intends to
run a strong national campaign,'' <PERSON>Ms. Ferraro</PERSON> said.
   On the Republican side, <ORGANIZATION>Senate Minority</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
ticket, said he thought <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> ``couldn't have picked a better
man.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Lynn Martin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Ill.</LOCATION>, who is national co-chairwoman of
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s presidential campaign, called <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``a nice man who's
able'' but said she still anticipated that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> would be able to
carry <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of <DATE>1960</DATE>, she
said: ``I'm sure we're going to hear <DATE>1960</DATE> ad nauseum. There's a
slight difference of course. He (<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership (as <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> majority
leader, had been); nor is <PERSON>Dukakis John Kennedy</PERSON>.''

   <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>, tapped as the keynote speaker
for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>today</DATE> she will consult
with advisers to apparent nominee <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> and rival <PERSON>Jesse
Jackson</PERSON> before preparing her speech.
   She also suggested, on a light note, that she might be a
good-luck charm for the party.
   Noting that fellow <PERSON>Texan Barbara Jordan</PERSON> was the only previous
female keynoter at a Democratic Convention, in <DATE>1976</DATE>, she said,
``That year the Democrats went to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> so maybe they saw
my selection, having another female, as a good omen.''
   Before the convention, she said in an interview on CBS-TV, ``I
wanted to be sure to look at the Democratic platform. I wanted to
consult with both the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> campaign and the <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> campaign.
And of course I welcome any help and any advice that I get.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> is known for using blunt rhetoric tempered with
wicked humor to get her point across.
   At a recent <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> fundraiser in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, one man
after another _ none of them minorities _ came to the podium to
speak. Finally it was the turn of <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> state
treasurer and potential <DATE>1990</DATE> gubernatorial candidate.
   ``Now are there any other white men who haven't spoken yet?''
she said sweetly. ``God knows we don't want to leave any of you
out.''
   The audience roared with laughter, as <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>' audiences
usually do. And, as usual, her audience got the message.
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, her stump style was praised by <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> chief
<PERSON>Paul G. Kirk</PERSON> as he announced her selection as the speaker whose
address will open the party's convention next month in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   The 54-year-old <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said at a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> news
conference, ``has the ability to tell it like it is.''
   <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> had urged the selection of a woman keynote
speaker, the first since Rep. <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> shared that honor with <PERSON>John
Glenn</PERSON>.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' the party chief said, ``not only because of the importance
of the family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives,
but I think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the
American family and the realities of all of that.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, the first woman in 50 years to hold statewide
office in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, is the divorced mother of four grown children.
   In <DATE>1976</DATE>, her first attempt at elected office, <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>
defeated an incumbent <LOCATION>Travis County</LOCATION> commissioner. In <DATE>1982</DATE>, the
state's incumbent treasurer, under indictment for official
misconduct, withdrew from a Democratic runoff against her. She won
the general election and was re-elected without opposition in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   After the <DATE>1982</DATE> election, <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> moved quickly to change
operations in the state treasury. She also made staff changes,
boosting the number of women and minorities on the job in the
170-employee agency. She now claims the agency payroll has an
ethnic and sex balance reflecting the state's general population.
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that women's issues are ``the same
issues that affect all other human beings'' _ but with a twist.
   ``The difference is the role, sociologically, that women have
played. That is we are the caretakers, the nurturers,'' she says.
``It usually falls to us when any time hard times and bad times
hit.''
   It's a message often repeated by <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>. If you can make a
household work, she says, you can succeed in government.
   ``Most homemakers don't know what enormous skills they have.
Putting three meals on the table each day is a pretty big job in
itself, much less doing the laundry and car pooling,'' she once
told a reporter.
   Her professional success has come despite personal challenges.
In <DATE>1980</DATE>, after being confronted by family members, she sought
treatment for alcoholism. She says she has not had a drink since
then, and she has been active in helping others battle alcoholism.
   Shortly after her treatment, she and husband <PERSON>David Richards</PERSON>
separated, and in <DATE>1984</DATE> the two obtained what they both said was an
amicable divorce.
   <PERSON>Richards</PERSON>, a lawyer, was on hand <DATE>Monday</DATE> when his ex-wife talked
to reporters about being selected to give the keynote speech. She
acknowledged him as someone who ``played a very large role in my
life, politically and personally.''
   Beyond the convention and helping to put a Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>' most immediate goal is the <DATE>1990</DATE> Texas
gubernatorial race. She has not formally declared her intentions,
but sent out her first exploratory fund-raising letter <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said she is not certain what effect her half-hour
in the political spotlight in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> will have on her
gubernatorial race.
   ``I suppose if I'm good it will help,'' she said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``And
if I'm bad it won't.''

   Milder winds and temperatures gave
firefighters the upper hand <DATE>today</DATE> in a wildfire that engulfed 524
homes and businesses in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara County</LOCATION> and in other blazes
that burned more than 90 homes.
   Two Californians died in the fires _ a state prisoner serving as
a firefighter and a 37-year-old <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> woman found near the
wreckage of her home in a burned-out neighborhood, authorities said
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   Wildfires, most set by arsonists, charred more than 18,700 acres
by <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in a six-county area north, east and south of <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>. Arson was blamed for the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> fire and another
that charred 66 homes in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> before
it was contained.
   Losses could surpass <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara County</LOCATION> and
<MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION>, officials said.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said <PERSON>Kay O'Brien</PERSON>, who
fled her <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> home with her husband carrying only family
pictures and a retirement watch. The home and all their possessions
were lost.
   A county survey completed late <DATE>Thursday</DATE> found 524 structures
destroyed, including 315 single family homes. Officials previously
said 567 homes and businesses had been destroyed.
   Calm wind and overnight temperatures in the 50s helped 800
firefighters subdue the blaze. Officials hoped to contain the fire
by noon <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Juanita Freel</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's pretty calm out there now,'' <PERSON>Robert Ooley</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Santa
Barbara County</LOCATION> fire spokesman, said <DATE>today</DATE>. ``It's still smoldering
somewhat, but it's nothing like before. It's certainly on the
downside now.''
   Elsewhere, firefighters controlled blazes in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and at
<ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone National Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, but large fires raged in
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where six firefighters
died <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, a lightning fire in the <ORGANIZATION>Tonto National Forest</ORGANIZATION>
destroyed a cabin built in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> by <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> novelist <PERSON>Zane Grey</PERSON>.
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> declared states of
emergency in the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> areas. The governor
also authorized separate <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> rewards for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the arsonists in both blazes.
   Hospitals reported admitting 13 people for fire-related injuries
and treating 55 others.
   <PERSON>Karen Terrill</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state forestry department,
said in a statement <TIME>this morning</TIME> that a state prisoner died as a
result of injuries suffered while fighting a <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION> fire.
   The victim was <PERSON>Victor Ferrara</PERSON>, 22, according to spokeswoman
<PERSON>Patty Perez</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>San Bernardino</LOCATION> Medical Center. Ferrara, who died
late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, was burned when his crew was overrun by wind-driven
flames, <PERSON>Ms. Terrill</PERSON> said.
   In all, 1,200 state prisoners are helping in the firefighting
effort.
   In <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, the body <PERSON>Andrea Gurka</PERSON>, 37, was found this
morning in a creek bed behind her home in the area where the fire
began, said county fire spokesman <PERSON>Charlie Johnson</PERSON>.
   ``She apparently had attempted to flee her residence when it was
being overrun by flames <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   Late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, in the suburban community of <LOCATION>Claremont</LOCATION>, 30 miles
east of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, an arson-suspected blaze burned out of control
along brush-laden hillsides and consumed 400 acres, authorities
said. Police blocked several residential streets although no homes
were evacuated.
   Police in <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> were looking for two young men after
witnesses said they saw one of them toss a butane lighter from a
moving car into the brush off the road where the fire started, said
<PERSON>Chris Gray</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Glendale Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> battalion chief.
   The 4,000-acre arson fire that broke out <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE> in a
valley between <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and the nearby town of <LOCATION>Goleta</LOCATION> was one
of the worst on record here. Damage to homes alone was estimated
initially at <MONEY>$190 million</MONEY>, and the figure was expected to top <MONEY>$500
million</MONEY>, said county Supervisor <PERSON>Bill Wallace</PERSON>.
   No more homes appeared threatened today.
   Authorities have said an incendiary device was found at the
fire's origin, but they haven't given details.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Santa Barbara City Council</ORGANIZATION> voted <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to call off the
<DATE>July 4</DATE> fireworks at the city beach. Mayor <PERSON>Sheila Lodge</PERSON> implored
residents not to celebrate with their own fireworks. <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>,
which posted a record 109 degrees <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, has tinder-dry foliage.
   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> helicopter dropping water on flames
crashed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in <LOCATION>San Marcos Pass</LOCATION>. The pilot suffered
only scrapes and bruises.
   Firefighters surrounded <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of a 4,500-acre wildfire in
<LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION> today, but not before it destroyed eight
homes, said Capt. <PERSON>David Parks</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of
Forestry</ORGANIZATION>.
   The blaze was set as a controlled burn <DATE>June 19</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland
National Forest</ORGANIZATION> but jumped fire lines three times, officials said.
   A 2,500-acre blaze burning today near <LOCATION>Lake Henshaw</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego
County</LOCATION> forced the evacuation of a Boy Scout camp and 20 homes,
authorities said.
   Four earlier brush fires in the county blackened about 1,700
acres before firefighters contained the blazes.
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area that straddles Orange
and <LOCATION>San Bernardino</LOCATION> counties blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at
least 14 homes. Officials hoped to control the blaze late today,
state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Forestry</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Jerry Hendershot</PERSON> said.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' said
department spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION>Sharon Sellers</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're not happy about
that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigation of
arson in the <LOCATION>Carbon Canyon</LOCATION> blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   In east-central <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, officials said the 24,000-acre <ORGANIZATION>Tonto
National Forest</ORGANIZATION> fire was about <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> contained <TIME>this morning</TIME>.
The fire that began with a lightning strike has destroyed about 50
homes and forced the evacuation of more than 1,200 people.

<HEAD>Cast As Conservative, Bentsen Celebrates Differences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, cast in the role of
conservative on the new Democratic ticket, has decided not to bury
his differences with the more liberal <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, but to
praise them.
   Before millions of Americans who watched <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s convention
on prime-time television, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> senator served notice that he
does not believe Democrats must ``march in lockstep'' to win the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   His speech was not as dynamic as that of the presidential
nominee, and it did not rouse the crowd to the heights attained by
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' oratory. But <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> had his own way of telling his party
he balances the ticket nicely:
   Democrats, he said, ``are not gray grains of oatmeal in a bland
porridge of privilege ... We have differences of opinion. But on
the basic issues of justice and opportunity, we stand united.''
   If the party does not expect great things of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s rhetoric,
it does expect great things of him in <DATE>November</DATE>. The senator, whose
name has been described as ``magic'' in the state of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, was
picked for the ticket to win his home state, and its 29 electoral
votes, for the Democrats.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen camp has also made it clear <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> will
spend a good deal of time in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, which has been Reagan-Bush
territory of late.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and his aides have stressed those issues on which he and
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> agree: economic growth, jobs creation, women's rights and
better housing, health care and education for all citizens.
   But <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> is more conservative than <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and many Democrats
on many issues, including his support of school prayer, the <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION>
rebels in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and his opposition to gun control.
   Still, the quiet-spoken senator, who has a vaguely patrician
air, had plenty of supporters <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Dukakis, in his own remarks, paid tribute to <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, saying he
would speak up if the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Council</ORGANIZATION> came up with the
``cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Dan Rostenkowski</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ill.</LOCATION>, who nominated <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> and works
with him closely on Capitol Hill, called him ``straightforward ...
smart ... and tough.''
   ``He is a sensible, reasonable, rational, common-sense good
choice for vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION>,'' said former Rep.
<PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. ``I believe that he is the best choice you
could come up with to give us a strong and winning ticket this
<DATE>November</DATE>.''
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> also won praise from <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> for his longtime
support of civil rights. On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, just as <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s name was
being entered in nomination, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> issued a written endorsement
of the senator.
   ``While I may disagree with both Governor <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and Senator
<PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> on some important issues, our interests converge in
building a coalition to beat the Republicans this <DATE>fall</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>
said.
   Still, when the voice vote was taken to acclaim <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> the
nominee, many <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> supporters shouted ``no,'' voicing their
continued displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the
ticket. Fifteen members of <ORGANIZATION>Bentsen</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> delegation refused to
join in the celebration. Signs reading ``No Contra aid'' were
sprinkled through the convention hall.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s own speech drew loud and sustained applause only when
he mentioned <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, but the senator was unruffled.
   ``Just wonderful, really excited,'' he beamed as he left the
podium with <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> to attend a round of post-convention parties.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Finishes Radiation Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> is finished with the radiation
treatments for a stubborn eye ailment that has impaired her vision
but will not know for at least two months how effective the
treatments have been.
   The first lady underwent the last of 10 radiation treatments on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, said <PERSON>Anna Perez</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>'s press secretary.
   After receiving the 10-minute radiation dose at <ORGANIZATION>Walter Reed Army
Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> returned to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and took her
daily swim in the outdoor, heated swimming pool, said <PERSON>Ms. Perez</PERSON>.
   She also attended a briefing on the Head Start education
program, hosting volunteers from the organization.
   ``She feels great,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Perez</PERSON>.
   Doctors will not know for at least two months, and maybe as long
as four, whether the radiation was effective in treating the
symptoms of Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that earlier
affected <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>'s thyroid as well, said <PERSON>Ms. Perez</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> began the radiation treatments after the steroid drug
prednisone failed to improve her eyes. She suffers eye irritation,
double vision and bulging eyes as a result of the Graves' disease,
which was diagnosed early last year.
   The disease initially caused her thyroid to be overproductive,
but a one-time radioactive treatment rendered the thyroid inactive
and cured that effect of the disease.
   The low-level radiation treatments were intended to decrease
swelling behind the eyes, in the small muscles that control eye
movement.
   Although suffering from eye irritation, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> has maintained
a schedule of public appearances, both with her husband and by
herself.
   Should the radiation fail, surgery would be an option, experts
say.

<HEAD>From a Wartime Christmas Dance to Living in the White House</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She was 16 and home for the holidays from
finishing school. He was 17 and an <LOCATION>Andover</LOCATION> senior decked out in a
tux for the Christmas dance at a <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, country club.
   It was <DATE>December 1941</DATE>. Three weeks earlier, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> had gone to
war. George ``Poppy'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> already had decided to enlist as soon as
he turned 18.
   But on <TIME>this evening</TIME>, his attention was drawn to the tall,
slender girl with wavy, reddish-brown hair, twirling around the
dance floor in a green-and-red holiday dress with one of his tennis
buddies.
   The friend was happy to oblige <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> with an introduction to
<PERSON>Barbara Pierce</PERSON> of nearby Rye, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   Before they reached the floor, the band switched from a <PERSON>Glenn
Miller</PERSON> tune to a waltz that was beyond <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s dancing ability. So
the couple sat down and talked.
   And talked.
   A few nights later, on their first date, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> borrowed his
folks' big car _ the one with the radio _ to fill the air in case
conversation faltered.
   But, as writer <PERSON>Donnie Radcliffe</PERSON> recounts in a new biography of
<PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON>, ``he need not have bothered.''
   ``Years later he would tease that she started talking that night
and hadn't stopped since,'' writes <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON> in ``Simply <PERSON>Barbara
Bush</PERSON>: A Portrait of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Candid First Lady.''
   The book follows the Bushes from their wartime marriage to the
oil fields of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to the political career that led them from
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and now, after 29 moves in 44 years of marriage,
to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Radcliffe</PERSON>, who has covered first ladies and the <LOCATION>East Wing of</LOCATION> the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1969</DATE>, recalls <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> saying
on a campaign flight last fall that if he won, ``there's one
prediction I'll make ... <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will fall in love with <PERSON>Barbara
Bush</PERSON>.''
   ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> did,'' adds <ORGANIZATION>Radcliffe</ORGANIZATION>. ``In no time at all, her white
hair, her wrinkles, her size-14 figure and her fake pearls became
the new standards by which American women could measure themselves
_ and hope to measure up.''
   She clearly cuts a different figure than the petite ex-actress,
<PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>, who last occupied 1600 <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION>.
   As <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> quipped at a <DATE>1986</DATE> charity dinner: ``As you know, we
have a lot in common. ... She fights drugs; I fight illiteracy. She
wears a size three _ so's my leg.''
   Born in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 8, 1925</DATE>, she was the third of <PERSON>Marvin</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Pauline Pierce</PERSON>'s four children.
   He was an engineer who turned to publishing. She was, in
<LOCATION>Barbara</LOCATION>'s memory, an ``absolutely ravishing'' woman with a green
thumb, an inveterate joiner of civic causes and a spendthrift. The
Pierces lived well, but beyond their means, in a five-bedroom brick
home in upscale Rye.
   When <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>'s older sister <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> went off to <ORGANIZATION>Smith College</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Vogue</LOCATION> immortalized her on its cover as ``College Girl of the Year.''
   Back home, <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> was a tomboy, 5-foot-8 and 148 pounds at age
12. She recalls looking ``like Porky Pig.''
   At <PERSON>Ashley Hall</PERSON>, the finishing school in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, she
set school records at speed-knitting, swimming underwater (2{ times
across the pool) and, according to <LOCATION>Radcliffe</LOCATION>, ``eating the most
hot, buttured biscuits in one meal without being caught.''
   After that holiday dance, the teen-age couple had a whirlwind,
if long distance, romance, with the letters postmarked ``ANDOVER''
turning up almost daily in <LOCATION>Barbara</LOCATION>'s school mailbox. He took her to
his senior prom at the prestigious prep school outside <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   A few weeks later, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and began the training
that would make him its youngest pilot.
   After <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>'s graduation in <DATE>1943</DATE>, she spent 17 days with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
and his family at their oceanfront home in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, where she was a
hit with <PERSON>Dorothy Walker Bush</PERSON>, the clan's tennis-playing matriarch.
   Barbara dropped out of <ORGANIZATION>Smith College</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1944</DATE> after her freshman
year, planning to marry <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Sept. 2, 1944</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s torpedo bomber, with ``Barbara''
painted on its side, was shot down by Japanese gunners during a
raid on Chichi Jima.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> bailed out after dropping his four 500-pound bombs; the two
crewman with him didn't make it. An American submarine rescued the
flier, who returned home on <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION>, with a Distinguished
Flying Cross and 58 combat missions.
   The wedding took place a few weeks late, on <DATE>Jan. 6, 1945</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was mustered out of the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August</DATE> and enrolled at
<ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>. Barbara worked part-time at the <ORGANIZATION>Yale Co-op</ORGANIZATION> and boasts that
``by the time we moved from <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, I knew how to wash diapers and
cook dinner.''
   <PERSON>George Walker Bush</PERSON>, the first of their six kids, was born in
<DATE>July 1946</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> breezed through <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> in three years, making Phi Beta Kappa
as an economics major, captain of the baseball team, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Delta Kappa Epsilon</ORGANIZATION> fraternity and member of Skull and Bones, the
elite, secret student society.
   They headed off to <LOCATION>Odessa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, to embark on a career in the
oil fields.
   <PERSON>Pauline Pierce</PERSON> kept sending her daughter Tide until <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>
convinced her mother the grocery stores in <LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> were bigger
than the ones in <LOCATION>Rye</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mrs. Pierce</PERSON> was killed in a car accident in
<DATE>1949</DATE>.
   Tragedy struck again in <DATE>1953</DATE>, when doctors told the Bushes their
3-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>, was dying of leukemia. They took her to
<ORGANIZATION>Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> seldom
left her side. The child died 10 weeks before her 4th birthday.
   Her hair began going gray during <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>'s illness. For years, at
the suggestion of her mother-in-law, she dyed the gray away, but
abandoned that in <DATE>1970</DATE>, tired of the greenish hue her hair acquired
whenever she swam in a pool.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> was always a full-time mother, ferrying the children
to Little League games and myriad other activities, packing them
into the station wagon to drive to <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION> each <DATE>summer</DATE>, and
meting out most of the discipline.
   She said <DATE>earlier this year</DATE> that when the family nest finally
emptied, ``I went through sort of a ... difficult time really
because suddenly women's lib had made me feel that my life had been
wasted.''
   The blues did not last long. She stepped up her volunteer
activities and discovered a favorite cause: literacy.
   ``I once spent the <DATE>summer</DATE> thinking of all the things that
bothered me _ teen pregnancy, drugs, everything _ and I realized
everything would be better if more people could read and write,''
said <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>, who also had experienced the difficulties of
helping son Neil overcome dyslexia.
   She is often credited as serving as a goad to her husband's
social conscience.
   At times she has made headlines, including her ``rhymes with
rich'' crack about <PERSON>Geraldine Ferraro</PERSON> in <DATE>1984</DATE> and support for a ban
on AK-47s after a man killed five children in a <LOCATION>Stockton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>,
schoolyard.
   She has since tried to steer clear of public policy statements.
   That ``muzzle'' is nothing new, she told reporters.
   ``I muzzled myself about <DATE>1967</DATE>, when <PERSON>George</PERSON> went into the
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. ``It's a decision I made many years ago that
when I disagreed with <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, I tell him in private.''

<HEAD>Fire Declared Controlled as Victims Face Mammoth Task of
Rebuilding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> brush fire that burned
hundreds of homes was brought under control <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as scores of
fire victims across <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> began the formidable job of
recovery.
   The declaration was issued at <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME>, 5{ days after the blaze
was set by an arsonist in <LOCATION>San Marcos Pass</LOCATION> and blew down the
foothills of the coastal mountains through hundreds of homes on the
outskirts of <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>.
   A small crew of firefighters backed by a helicopter and two
engines watched for smoldering hotspots, but the blaze was
considered controlled because no flames showed within 300 feet of
fire lines cut through the brush.
   But while victory over the 4,500-acre fire took less than a
week, people burned out of more than 450 dwellings were only
beginning a long process of rebuilding and emotional recovery.
   It was the same story in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION>,
where 66 hillside homes were damaged or destroyed in a arson blaze
<DATE>June 27</DATE>, and in the aftermath of a 6,640-acre blaze that straddled
the Orange-San Bernardino county line and destroyed 14 homes last
week. Both fires were caused by arson, officials said.
   In <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Emergency Management
Agency and state Office of Emergency Services</ORGANIZATION> opened centers to
take applications for low-interest loans and grants.
   Fires also continued to burn in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, organizations like the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salvation
Army</ORGANIZATION> continued supplying victims with immediate essentials,
including clothing, medicine, and in some cases psychological aid.
   ``The stress and emotional trauma is paramount right now. We
have many severely traumatized people,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Elizabeth Quirk</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>.
   More than 340 families were registered with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and the number was expected to top 600. Six shelters
that housed more than 1,000 people during the fire were closed, and
efforts focused on finding regular housing.
   <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, which already has committed <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> in direct
services to victims, will provide the first month's rent and
security deposit.
   The question will be whether there is enough housing in the
area, <PERSON>Ms. Quirk</PERSON> said.
   On the rebuilding front, <LOCATION>Santa Barbara County</LOCATION> was in its second
day of issuing demolition permits. On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, 280 people began the
permit process, said spokeswoman <PERSON>Jayne Brechwald</PERSON>.
   Residents also will need permits for temporary housing,
electrical poles and similar fixtures that must be in place before
construction can start. Permit fees were waived for the time being.
   A private relief center was established at the <ORGANIZATION>Goleta Youth
Sports Center</ORGANIZATION> to help people reach contractors, architects, and
real-estate and insurance agents.
   Despite the breadth of help coming to the region, experts
predicted a very lengthy recovery.
   ``We'll probably still be taking care of fire victims for at
least a year,'' <PERSON>Ms. Quirk</PERSON> said.
   Red Cross had on hand 650 local volunteers and was ready to
supply victims with some furnishings, occupational supplies like
uniforms and tools, and personal items like eyeglasses,
prescription medicines and dentures.
   Four roving food trucks have served 4,000 meals in the fire area
since the blaze began.
   Help has come from across <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. A <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s department
store gave <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> for direct dispersal to victims.

   Three emergency workers were
hospitalized and several hundred people were evacuated from their
homes when a fire at a swimming pool supply company created a cloud
of chlorine gas, authorities said.
   The workers were released <DATE>Saturday</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>Desert Hospital</ORGANIZATION> and no
serious injuries were reported in this desert resort, said police
Sgt. <PERSON>Tom Barton</PERSON>.
   The fire at <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Pool Mart</ORGANIZATION> broke out <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, and
residents were asked to leave a 1-square-mile area, including <LOCATION>Palm
Springs Regional Airport</LOCATION>.
   Arriving commercial and private flights were diverted to <LOCATION>Ontario
Airport</LOCATION>, some 50 miles to the west. Outgoing flights were canceled
and the airport was evacuated, said city spokeswoman <PERSON>Barbara Erdman</PERSON>.
   The exact number of evacuees was not determined, but 150 people
went to an evacuation center at <ORGANIZATION>Raymond Cree Junior High School</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Barton</PERSON> said people were allowed to return home about <TIME>9:30 p.m.</TIME>
   Several people complained of breathing difficulty and eye
irritation, but no one other than the emergency workers was
hospitalized, <PERSON>Barton</PERSON> said.
   ``I could smell the chlorine in the air. It made my nose burn
and it gave me a slight headache,'' said <PERSON>Hazel Reed</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>,
who was vacationing in <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>.
   ``When my chest started hurting, that's when I decided to leave
my home,'' said <PERSON>Donna Winters</PERSON>, who said her daughter also had chest
pains.
   <PERSON>Nina Smith</PERSON> said she at first ignored a police call to evacuate
her home because she was afraid to venture out on foot.
   ``I stayed because I have no car. I put towels on the floor in
front of the door so that nothing could seep through,'' <PERSON>Ms. Smith</PERSON>
said. Eventually she called a friend to drive her to the evacuation
center.

<HEAD>Kirkpatrick to Speak at GOP Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Kirkpatrick announcement in top 4 grafs, picking
up in 4th graf pvs, Ms. Richards</NOTE>

   Republican officials said <DATE>today</DATE>, one day after the Democrats
named Texan <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> as their convention keynote speaker, that
<PERSON>Jeane J. Kirkpatrick</PERSON> would be ``one of the featured speakers'' at
the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> convention in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, was traveling to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> today to visit a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> research
center and a neighborhood safety program. Democrat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>
was touting his <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> record on housing issues before
focusing again on the search for a running mate.
   The Republicans announced the convention role for <PERSON>Ms.
Kirkpatrick</PERSON>, a favorite of conservatives, after the Democrats said
they had chosen <ORGANIZATION>Texas State Treasurer Richards</ORGANIZATION>, a fiery populist
orator, to deliver the keynote speech and ``set the tone'' for the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> next month.
   <PERSON>Ms. Kirkpatrick</PERSON>, a former Democrat, gave a widely publicized
speech attacking the Democrats at the <DATE>1984</DATE> Republican convention.
Republican Party chief <PERSON>Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.</PERSON> said the
announcement of the keynote speaker for the <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> meeting
would probably come in the next ten days.
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, 54, will be the second woman in party history to
deliver the convention-opening address.
   Today, in an interview on CBS-TV, she mentioned fellow Texan
<PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>'s keynote speech in <DATE>1976</DATE> and added, ``That year the
Democrats went to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> so maybe they saw my selection,
having another female, as a good omen.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said she would consult with advisers to <PERSON>Jesse
Jackson</PERSON> as well as <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> before preparing her speech. ``I welcome
any help and any advice that I get,'' she said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, says he is weighing which of a dozen issues
left out of the party platform to bring up at convention. His
comments came after Democrats, meeting in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, agreed to a platform draft and an overhaul of
party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was part of the sellout crowd of 21,785 in <LOCATION>Atlantic
City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, who watched <PERSON>Mike Tyson</PERSON> knock out <PERSON>Michael Spinks</PERSON> in the
first round and retain the undisputed heavyweight crown.
   Dukakis will travel on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to meet with
several dozen senators, including some who have been mentioned as
possible running mates.
   Among them is <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Sam Nunn</PERSON>, although he said <DATE>Monday</DATE> he
was not providing the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> campaign with background and
financial information it has requested of prospective running mates.
   <PERSON>Nunn</PERSON> said he had told <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and campaign chairman <PERSON>Paul
Brountas</PERSON> that a spot on the Democratic ticket is ``not on my
agenda.'' Brountas is heading the search for a running mate.
   Another prominent senator, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bill Bradley</PERSON>, last week
said he had informed <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> that he did not want to be considered.
And the <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</ORGANIZATION> reported today, citing
unidentified sources, that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>Tom Foley</PERSON>, who has
said frequently that he doesn't want to be vice president, had
chosen not to have <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' aides examine his personal background
and finances.
   Those under consideration, according to sources, include
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON>Bob Graham</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Nunn</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Glenn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and
<PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and Reps. <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Lee
Hamilton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>.
   Sen. <PERSON>Dale Bumpers</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>
also reportedly have been asked to provide information to Brountas.
   Aides said there was no timetable for making or announcing the
choice for he second spot on the ticket.
   <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> has continued to talk about his own qualifications as a
running mate for <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>. And although he says he's happy with
parts of the platform, he is indicating that some points of
disagreement will be brought up at the convention.
   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in the
platform,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. But he noted that his forces had
``protected our right to ... protest or raise other issues in
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.''
   One of those issues might be a call for the creation of a
Palestinian homeland _ rejected by the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> forces for inclusion
in the platform.
   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate
anyone,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Rosemont</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>.
   In announcing the selection of <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> as the keynote
speaker for the Democrats, party chief <PERSON>Paul G. Kirk</PERSON> said she would
``set the tone for Democrats in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and... draw the
distinctions between the party of the working American people and
the party of the establishment.''
   In <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, the divorced mother of four grown
children, said: ``I probably will be talking very much about
American families. I think that's what I know the most about, other
than my professional job.''
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Madeleine Kunin</PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON>Norman Mineta</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, former <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Toney Anaya</PERSON> and Little Rock,
<LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Lottie Shackelford</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> met <DATE>Monday</DATE> with <ORGANIZATION>Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> amid more bad news in the polls.

<TEXT>
   Texas Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>, in a highly
personal keynote address, told the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration had turned <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
working class into the forgotten class. ``We can do better,'' she
said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> recounted a letter from a <LOCATION>Lorena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> mother of
three who said her family income of <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> a year makes life a
constant fiscal challenge.
   ``We're the people you see every day in the grocery store,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Richards</PERSON> said, quoting from the unidentified woman's letter. ``We
obey the laws, pay our taxes and fly our flag on holidays.
   ``We plod along, trying to make it better for ourselves and our
children and our parents. We aren't vocal anymore. I think maybe
we're too tired,'' the woman wrote. ``I believe people like us have
been forgotten in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said the woman was right.
   ``Of course you believe you're forgotten. Because you have been.
This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a
puzzle that can't fit together. They've tried to put us in
compartments and separate us from each other. Their political
theory is divide and conquer,'' she said.
   ``No wonder we feel isolated, confused. We want answers and
their response is that something is wrong with you,'' <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>
added. ``Well nothing's wrong with you ... that you can't fix in
<DATE>November</DATE>.''
   ``When it comes right down to it, this election is a contest
between those who are satisfied with what they have _ and those who
know we can do better,'' she said. ``That's what this election is
all about.''
   Using her trademark rapier wit, she singled out Vice President
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, the probable <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee.
   ``For eight straight years <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> hasn't displayed the
slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he is
after a job that he can't get appointed to, he's like <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>
discovering <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. He's found child care. He's found education,''
she said.
   ``Poor <PERSON>George</PERSON>, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot
in his mouth,'' <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said.
   She received a big laugh with her opening line, when she chided
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s claim that he is a Texan. He claims a <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> hotel suite as
his legal residence.
   ``I am delighted to be here with you <TIME>this evening</TIME> because after
listening to <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> all these years, I figured you needed to
know what a real <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> accent sounds like,'' said the <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
native who speaks with a sure-enough <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> drawl.
   ``I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than
100 days, the
Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-St
ockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-Geoge Bush-era will be over,'' she said to
sustained applause from the Democrats.
   <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, who watched the speech on television, telephoned <PERSON>Ms.
Richards</PERSON> to congratulate her on ``a great speech.''
   According to press secretaqry <PERSON>Dayton Duncan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> told <PERSON>Mrs.
Richards</PERSON>, ``What am I going to say on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>? You said it all.''
Dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON>, whose keynote address four years ago
propelled him to national prominence, also had high praise for <PERSON>Ms.
Richards</PERSON>' effort.
   ``I think it was like lighting a fuse for these Democrats,''
<PERSON>Cuomo</PERSON> said from the <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> anchor booth where he watched the address.
``They're ready to go.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> had high praise for <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, to whom she is
committed, and for runner-up <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>.
   She said <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> ``can open our hearts and our minds and stir
our very souls. He's taught us that we are as good as our capacity
for caring.''
   She touted <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> as a man ``who knows that this country is on
the edge of a great new era.
   ``Behind his calm there's an impatience to unify this country
and get on with the future,'' <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said.
   And she praised <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' designated
running mate, as someone who ``understands <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> from the barrio
to the board room.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> also carried through on her promise to note the
importance of letting a woman make the keynote address. She noted
that former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>, another Texan, was the
keynote speaker in <DATE>1976</DATE>.
   ``Two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you
give us a chance, we can perform. After all, <PERSON>Ginger Rogers</PERSON> did
everything that <PERSON>Fred Astaire</PERSON> did. She just did it backwards in high
heels,'' <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, a 54-year-old divorced mother of four grown
children, spoke of being a grandmother, and of wanting to tell her
grand-daughter Lily ``how very lucky she is. That for all our
differences, we're still the greatest nation on this good earth.''
   ``I just hope _ like her grandparents and her great grandparents
before _ that Lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that
echoes in homes across <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>: That we can do better.''

<HEAD>Doctor Ordered To Continue Dialysis For Unwanted Patient</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kidney specialist has been ordered
to provide dialysis for another week to a woman refused the
life-giving treatment by more than a dozen other doctors.
   But a temporary restraining order issued <DATE>Friday</DATE> also said <PERSON>Jeanie
Joshua</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION> must go elsewhere for treatment after the order
expires <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>UCLA Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> has accepted her for dialysis, but <PERSON>Ms.
Joshua</PERSON> said the 80-mile trip three days a week would be impossible
for her in her weakened condition.
   ``This is going to be a slow death. There's no way I can
withstand it,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Joshua</PERSON>. A friend now drives her 40 miles to
<ORGANIZATION>Cottage Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Joshua</PERSON>, 38, claims kidney specialists from <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION> have refused to treat her because of her <DATE>1986</DATE> lawsuit
against a <ORGANIZATION>Santa Barbara</ORGANIZATION> specialist that contends impure water was
used in the blood-purifying dialysis procedure. The suit is pending.
   Her current physician, <PERSON>Dr. David W. Doner Jr.</PERSON>, told the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> Times he was dropping <PERSON>Ms. Joshua</PERSON> because she was too
aggressive in directing her medical treatment and because he could
not find another specialist to see her if he needed to leave town.
   <PERSON>Ms. Joshua</PERSON> described herself as an assertive patient who
sometimes refuses to take tests or treatments she disagrees with.
   Three medical groups representing 11 doctors in southern <LOCATION>Santa
Barbara</LOCATION> and Ventura counties have refused to see her, she said.
   <PERSON>Doner</PERSON> has a legal right to drop the woman as a patient, his
lawyer said. ``It's well-established law that a physician may select
which patients he cares for,'' said <PERSON>Harold M. Haider</PERSON>.
   The few court cases on the issue have generally upheld a doctor's
right to drop a patient or refuse to accept someone as a new
patient, said <PERSON>Arthur Caplan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Biomedical
Ethics</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION>.
   But arrangements have usually been made to provide
life-sustaining treatment even to combative or abusive patients, he
said.
   ``There are cases where patients have been dialyzed while
shackled to a bed or with an armed guard present,'' <PERSON>Caplan</PERSON> said.
``You can't just be abandoned in a life-and-death situation.''

<TEXT>
   Wildfires ignited by arson and
accident crackled across <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> after
ravaging more than 560 homes and other buildings in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara
County</LOCATION> and more than 90 homes elsewhere.
   A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> firefighting helicopter crashed in <LOCATION>San
Marcos Pass</LOCATION> northwest of <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, and the pilot broke his
leg. The aviator was taken to a hospital, said <LOCATION>Santa Barbara County</LOCATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Bill Douros</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said a return of gusts that fanned
flames <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was unlikely. Hot, dry winds had fanned the
flames, which scorched 14,000 acres of brush in a four-county area
north, east and south of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   Fires also burned in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   A destructive blaze in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> was
contained after destroying or damaging 66 hillside homes <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   No deaths were immediately reported. One person was severely
burned in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and three firefighters were seriously
injured in <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION>, authorities said.
   <LOCATION>Santa Barbara County</LOCATION>, where rugged brush-covered hills rise
sharply from the coastline, was hit hardest. A 4,000-acre arson
fire that broke out late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and the
nearby town of <LOCATION>Goleta</LOCATION> was one of the worst on record here. It
continued to burn <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and firefighters would offer
no estimate of when it might be contained.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said county
sheriff's department spokesman <PERSON>Tim Grasey</PERSON>.
   The fire destroyed some neighborhoods; in other cases, it leaped
over houses and left them standing improbably amid ruins.
   Desert winds up to 60 mph pushed the fire through the hills
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, giving some residents little time to flee.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said <PERSON>Kay O'Brien</PERSON>, who
fled her home with her husband carrying only family pictures and a
retirement watch. The home and all their possessions were lost.
   ``We woke up <TIME>this morning</TIME> and wanted to brush our teeth, but we
didn't even have a toothbrush,'' she said.
   The toll in the <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> area was put at 567 homes and
other buildings. <PERSON>Bill Wallace</PERSON>, a county supervisor, said the homes
alone were worth <MONEY>$190 million</MONEY>, and said the damage figure could go
as high as <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>.
   Firefighters controlled blazes in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone
National Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, but other fires raged unchecked in
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where six firefighters
died <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, a lightning fire in the <ORGANIZATION>Tonto National Forest</ORGANIZATION>
destroyed a cabin built in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> by <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> novelist <PERSON>Zane Grey</PERSON>.
   Two units of specially trained <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming Air National Guard</ORGANIZATION>
firefighters have been ordered to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to help fight the
wildfires raging out of control near <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>John
Cornelison</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming Adjutant General</ORGANIZATION>'s office.
   The soldiers will travel to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> in two C-130 aircraft
equipped with firefighting systems capable of dumping 3,000 gallons
of fire retardant in less than eight seconds, <PERSON>Cornelison</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>George Deukmejian</PERSON> toured <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> and declared states of emergency to release additional
state money and pave the way for federal assistance.
   Deukmejian also authorized a <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the arsonist.
   Fire danger loomed high throughout <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, where
the brush is parched by four years of drought. A heat wave entered
its third day after setting record highs over 100 degrees in many
areas.
   In <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION>, a blaze in the hills above Clareont
threatened a school and 10 houses. The 50-acre blaze started in the
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and burned out of control, authorities said.
   In <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION>, residents of the hilly neighborhood struck by an
arsonist sorted through the ashes, all that was left of many
expensive homes.
   ``I guess we'll just tighten our belts and get on with life,''
said <PERSON>Dennie Gill</PERSON>, a produce wholesaler whose home was destroyed.
``It was a nice house.''
   Witnesses said they saw one of two young men in a car toss a
butane lighter into the brush off <LOCATION>Verdugo Road</LOCATION>, where the fire
started, said <PERSON>Chris Gray</PERSON>, a battalion chief in the <ORGANIZATION>Glendale Fire
Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION>, a controlled burn that got out of hand when
winds unexpectedly changed bore down on the city of Corona after
destroying 12 homes and charring 2,200 acres, said Corona police
Sgt. <PERSON>Rick Bourgault</PERSON>.
   ``Some of the smoldering areas came right up to the back yards
of houses,'' said <PERSON>Bourgault</PERSON>. ``There's lots of smoke and hot spots.
Some of the hot spots whipped up into pretty good fires.''
   An arson blaze in the <LOCATION>Carbon Canyon</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>San Bernardino
County</LOCATION> blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at least 14 homes, with
hundreds more threatened, said <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Maria Sobal</PERSON>.
   The fire was <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> contained and firefighters worked
feverishly to beat rising winds, said <ORGANIZATION>California Department of
Forestry</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION>Sharon Sellers</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' she said.
``We're not happy about that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigaton of
arson in the <LOCATION>Carbon Canyon</LOCATION> blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   Three inmates working as firefighters were in good condition
recovering at <ORGANIZATION>Sherman Oaks Community Hospital</ORGANIZATION> after suffering
first- and second-degree burns <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a 150-acre fire near
<LOCATION>Hemet</LOCATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON>Johna Rogovin</PERSON>.
   ``The wind shifted on them really quickly and there was nothing
they could do,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Riverside County Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Deborah Bennett</PERSON>.
   The fire was contained early <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, she said.
   In the <LOCATION>Moreno Valley</LOCATION> area of the county, fire destroyed three
homes and three outbuildings. Four firefighters were injured.
   In <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>, a fast-moving blaze erupted near <LOCATION>Lake
Henshaw</LOCATION>, consuming 75 acres and forcing the evacuation of a Boy
Scout camp, said <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Forestry</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Audrey Hagen</PERSON>.
   Four earlier brush fires blackened about 1,700 acres before
firefighters contained the blazes.

   <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> told black leaders today that running mate <PERSON>Lloyd
Bentsen</PERSON> has been a civil rights advocate since ``way back when in
the <DATE>1940s</DATE>,'' while a disappointed <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> was described as
flabbergasted at the way he has been treated by the Democratic
nominee-to-be.
   Jackson convention manager <PERSON>Ron Brown</PERSON> said negotiations with the
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> campaign have been halted.
   ``It is now up to <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> to make it a unity
convention,'' <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and his aides could not understand what they
felt was a deliberate <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> snub of <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>, who learned from
reporters that <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> was the vice presidential choice.
   ``Basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled,''
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said.
   At the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association</ORGANIZATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Colored People</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> sought black
support in a speech that was mostly a straight campaign talk.
   <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Benjamin Hooks</PERSON> told <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>, ``You know, knowing
<PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> has been good for you.''
   And <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> replied, ``Yes, <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>, I learned a lot from <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> and
I've learned a lot from you....And I'm still learning.''
   As <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> wrestled with how to unify the party in
advance of nest week's convention in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, most Democrats sang a
chorus of praise for the 67-year-old <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> senator after his formal
introduction as <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' running mate at <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Faneuil Hall</ORGANIZATION>.
Hopeful refrains citing the parallels with the <DATE>1960</DATE> Kennedy-Johnson
ticket were heard again and again.
   ``He's a terrific guy. He's very tough, very smart,'' <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>
Gov. <PERSON>Neil Goldschmidt</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>.
   Former Vice President <PERSON>Walter F. Mondale</PERSON>, the <DATE>1984</DATE> Democratic
presidential nominee, said <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> ``has been a source of good
sense, moderation and decency throughout his years of public life.''
   ``He knows how to beat <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>,'' said <PERSON>Sen. Barbara
Mikulski</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Md</LOCATION>. ``He did just that in <DATE>1970</DATE>'' _ when <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>
defeated <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for the first of three terms in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, the Republican nominee-to-be, called <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' choice of
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman ``interesting'' but refused
to say more.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s supporters were quick to argue that Democrats still won't
carry the state <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> calls home _ and its 29 electoral votes _ in
the <DATE>November</DATE> balloting.
   ``He is desperate. He knows he can't win without carrying
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Bill Clements</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>. ``It ain't going
to work.''
   But the <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> problem loomed as the major stumbling block
between <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> and seamlessly positive four days in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> referred to <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s long committment to
civil rights.
   ``He was committed to civil rights and equal opportunities way
back then, way back then in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> then addressed the meeting, with an admonition from
Hooks.
   ``You may as well know you've got a hard act <DATE>today</DATE>, so do your
best,'' <PERSON>Hooks</PERSON> said. ``Many of our delegates wanted to see <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> in
this position.''
   Former party chief and <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> adviser <PERSON>John White</PERSON> echoed those
sentiments about his fellow Texan: ``He's got one of the best civil
rights records in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. He voted against the poll tax when he
was in the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> back in the '50s.''
   It was clear that the Democratic ticket needed to calm some
angry <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> backers.
   ``I did think he was very rude not to let <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> know
beforehand,'' said <PERSON>Beulah C. Wright</PERSON> of Main Line, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION>
delegate.
   ``I frankly think he's made life a lot more difficult for
himself and will have to work a lot harder,'' said Rep. <PERSON>Ron
Dellums</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION> supporter from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   Jackson spoke to <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, delivering an emotional
speech that drew cheers from the overflow crowd.
   ``I may not be on the ticket, but I'm qualified! That's what I
know! Qualified!'' Jackson shouted. ``I will never surrender.''
   The civil rights leader promised that he would press his stands
on the issues at the convention that opens <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``We go to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> not to smile and style and profile, but to
deliberate and debate our nation's priorities,'' <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ann Lewis</PERSON>, a top <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> adviser, said <DATE>today</DATE> that the
presidential hopeful will strike a positive tone at the convention.
   ``You're going to see a <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> who is forward looking,
who's talking about the fall, who's talking about the issues,'' she
said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Earlier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, at a news conference, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> insisted he was
not angry at the <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> decision.
   ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be
angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive,'' he said.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> had clearly been upset that he learned of
<PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' choice from reporters rather than from the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>
governor directly.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> ahead of all the Democrats, addressing
them early on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. He didn't mention <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>, but he did praise
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>.
   ``I salute him for running the race, for being heard, and he
deserves a salute from us,'' the vice president said.
   Late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, on the way to baseball's All-Star game in
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had only a brief remark on the choice of <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>:
``That's interesting. That's what I think about it.''
   Dukakis often compares himself to the last president from
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> _ <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> _ and invited more comparisons of
his decision for <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> with <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>'s selection of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Sen.
<PERSON>Lyndon B. Johnson</PERSON> in <DATE>1960</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> put it this way: ``The <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> axis
was good for the country and good for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1960</DATE>
and it's going to be a real winner in <DATE>November of '88</DATE>.''
   ``There's something lucky about a Massachusetts-Texas
connection,'' said <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Bob Jordan</PERSON>.
   ``The Boston-Austin axis is reborn,'' applauded Rep. <PERSON>Richard A.
Gephardt</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, a former contender for the Democratic
nomination.
   ``He will help the ticket in the south and all over the
country,'' added <PERSON>Sen. Albert Gore Jr.</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, another former
hopeful for both the presidential and vice presidential nominations.
   Another former hopeful, <PERSON>Sen. Paul Simon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, said,
``When the American people get to know <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, it will
strengthen the ticket everywhere.''
   The preparations for <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s opening session in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
intensified as construction work in the convention hall was wrapped
up. The trickle of delegates, party pros and news people arriving
in the city turned to a steady flow.
   Polls in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> said <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON> would help <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> there, but
nationally the polls said the voters knew little of the Texan.
   ``It's like dropping a rock in a pond and having no ripples. ...
They're both unknowns'' to Californians, said <ORGANIZATION>Golden State</ORGANIZATION> pollster
<PERSON>Mervin Field</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>, fiery populist and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> state
treasurer, was chosen <DATE>Monday</DATE> to deliver the keynote speech and
``set the tone'' for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>
next month.
   Party chief <PERSON>Paul G. Kirk</PERSON> said <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> ``has the ability to
tell it like it is'' as he announced that the 54-year-old will be
the second woman in party history to take the podium to deliver the
opening address of the meeting. She is the first woman to hold
statewide office in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> in half a century.
   <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said the Democratic nominee-to-be <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> was
consulted on the choice and was interested in having a woman to
step to the podium on <DATE>July 18</DATE>.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said, ``not only because of the importance of the
family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that women are
going through in the daily work lives and family lives, but I think
it is symbolic of the importance of women to the American family
and the realities of all of that.
   ``And the fact that, let's face it, that is a strength of the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> and a weakness of <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> and the
Republicans.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, who held a news conference in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,
shortly after <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON>'s announcement, said American families are
``what I know the most about, other than my professional job.''
   Known for her sparkling rhetoric, <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> said she honed
her speaking ability on the soap boxes of small-town <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   ``For about the past 10 years I've been making speeches at the
<ORGANIZATION>Madisonville Cattleman's Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>McAllen</LOCATION>
Mexican-American Democrats convention and the <ORGANIZATION>Nacogdoches Chamber
of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> and in any number of places that you think of,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Richards</PERSON> said. ``It's sort of like, `How do you get to <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie
Hall</ORGANIZATION>?' You just practice.'''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON>, who plans to seek the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> governorship in <DATE>1990</DATE>,
emerged over the weekend as the likely choice for the keynote job,
which offers a national audience to impress or disappoint. The only
other woman ever to have the role was former Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>,
also of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, who shared the job with <PERSON>Sen. John Glenn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said he was happy to announce that <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> would ``set
the tone for Democrats in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and to draw the distinctions
between the party of the working American people and the party of
the establishment. <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> is a mainstream Democrat and a
fiery populist from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, one of <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s adopted states.''
   ``She has the ability to tell it like it is and speak in the
language ... working Americans can understand and relate to,'' he
added.
   Kirk was asked if the selection of another Texan for a prominent
role at the <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> meeting <DATE>July 18-21</DATE> was indicative of the
importance of the state in the <DATE>fall</DATE>. House Speaker <PERSON>Jim Wright</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is the convention chairman.
   ``In fact, when you look at the <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION> map, you can't
do enough for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said.
   Kirk defended <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>'s role as chairman of the convention,
despite the investigations focusing on charges of unethical
behavior against the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> speaker.
   ``There is no hesitancy on my part or on the part of the
Democratic Party about Speaker <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>'s role at the convention,''
<PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said.
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Madeleine Kunin</PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON>Norman Mineta</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, former <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Toney Anaya</PERSON> and Little Rock,
<LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Lottie Shackelford</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Kirk</PERSON> said in answer to a question that he would be glad to serve
as <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman through the general
election, even though his term expires right after the convention.
But after the election, ``That will be that.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Richards</PERSON> was born on <DATE>Sept. 1, 1933</DATE>, outside of <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
A graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Baylor University</ORGANIZATION>, she was first elected to office as
a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Travis County Commissioner's Court</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE>. In
<DATE>1982</DATE>, she was elected state treasurer, the first woman to hold
statewide office there in over 50 years.
   She is a divorced mother of four grown children.

THE ONE cloud on President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s sunny inaugural week grew a little
larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms <PERSON>Zoe Baird</PERSON>, faced
tough questioning from senators concerned that she had broken the law in
employing illegal aliens for her household.
Ms <PERSON>Baird</PERSON> repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that
awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to
ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms <PERSON>Dee Dee Myers</PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> press secretary, said <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> stood by her and expected her to be
confirmed.
Senator <PERSON>Orrin Hatch</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the
committee, Senator <PERSON>Larry Pressler</PERSON>, the Republican from <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, has
declared he will vote against confirmation.
But <PERSON>Mr Hatch</PERSON> also reported that his constituent mail was running heavily
against <PERSON>Ms Baird</PERSON> and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in
the person of Ms <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON>, the black <ORGANIZATION>Texas University</ORGANIZATION> law professor
known for her high principles.
'The ethical high ground for <PERSON>Zoe Baird</PERSON> is to request that her name be
withdrawn,' <PERSON>Ms Jordan</PERSON> said. Earlier this week, <PERSON>Ms Patricia King</PERSON>, also black
and a <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> law professor, had maintained in a powerful
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post column that the nation's chief law enforcement officer could
not be someone who had recently broken the law.
Elsewhere, the new administration, if not the president himself, began to
get down to work. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> was preoccupied with welcoming 2,500 guests to
a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> open day. But <PERSON>Mr Warren Christopher</PERSON>, confirmed on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as
secretary of state, talked to <PERSON>Mr Nelson Mandela</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>African National
Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

   Surgeons completed a rare double-lung
transplant operation on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Floyd Spence</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>
<DATE>early today</DATE>, officials at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Mississippi Medical
Center</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Spence</PERSON>, 60, was in critical but stable condition following the
5-hour surgery, which ended at <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME>, said hospital spokeswoman
<PERSON>Barbara Austin</PERSON>.
   Spence, suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease, flew to
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> from <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, after being
notified of a possible set of donor lungs in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   ``The transplant team said the surgery proceeded as
anticipated,'' <PERSON>Austin</PERSON> said. ``He'll remain in the hospital probably
four or five weeks to recuperate.''
   Members of the transplant team flew to <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>
and returned late <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with the organs after determining
the lungs were in good enough shape to transplant, hospital
spokeswoman <PERSON>Janice Quinn</PERSON> said.
   Surgeons opened <PERSON>Spence</PERSON>'s chest about an hour before the lungs
arrived at about <TIME>10:45 p.m.</TIME>, hospital officials said.
   Spence appeared alert and in good spirits as he was wheeled into
the hospital. The legislator's son, <PERSON>David Spence</PERSON>, said the family
was confident about the outcome of the operation.
   ``The surgeons are very optimistic about the condition of the
donor's lungs, with <PERSON>Floyd</PERSON>'s physical condition and with his
tolerance to the operation,'' said <PERSON>Randy Mashburn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Spence</PERSON>'s
district administrator. ``They are very upbeat.''
   At one point last <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Spence</PERSON> was put under intensive care
at <ORGANIZATION>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> in critical condition.
Afterward, the congressman went on the list of potential organ
transplant recipients.
   Double-lung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide
and only 12 times in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> _ three times at <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> and
nine times at <ORGANIZATION>Toronto General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> under the auspices of the
<ORGANIZATION>Toronto University School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>.
   Eight of the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> patients are still living, but only one of
the three from <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION> remains alive. <ORGANIZATION>University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>
officials attributed one of the two deaths to factors unrelated to
either the surgery or respiratory ailments that led to the
operations.
   <PERSON>Dr. Sesshadri Raju</PERSON>, professor of surgery and director of the
transplant program at <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, said last month that with a normal
recovery, <PERSON>Spence</PERSON> would be able to resume a normal schedule after
six months with ``surprisingly'' few physical restrictions.
   Confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of
oxygen, <PERSON>Spence</PERSON> has made few public appearances since his <DATE>October</DATE>
hospitalization.
   However, he has filed for re-election. The nine-term Republican
will face Democrat <PERSON>Jim Leventis</PERSON> in the <DATE>November</DATE> election.

<SO> </SO>

<TEXT>
   Amid the stories about the two resigned <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> officials yesterday, the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post had another story: "Independent Counsel Subpoenas <PERSON>Ursula Meese</PERSON>'s Job Records." 
It now develops that Independent Counsel <PERSON>James McKay</PERSON> is investigating <PERSON>Mrs. Meese</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$40,000-a-year</MONEY> job with the <ORGANIZATION>Multiple Sclerosis Society</ORGANIZATION>. 
"According to sources familiar with <PERSON>McKay</PERSON>'s inquiry, the independent counsel has been trying to determine whether the Meeses' close friend, <PERSON>E. Bob Wallach</PERSON>, in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending <PERSON>Ursula Meese</PERSON> for the jobs." 
<PERSON>Mrs. Meese</PERSON>'s job is matching MS patients with employers. 

   Whatever is going on here, the one thing we may fairly conclude is that it is worthy of investigation. But if it merits the attention of special prosecutors and reporters, then the town may hold enough such stories to command the attention of many such investigations. Last <DATE>December</DATE>, a <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION> reporter produced a long story listing 73 relatives of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> members who have worked for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in paid jobs since mid-1986. By law, members may not hire their own relatives, but the law says nothing about them working for other Members or for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> itself. Here is a partial state-by-state summary, current at the time of <ORGANIZATION>UPI</ORGANIZATION>'s story:

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> won senior citizens' hearts
and charmed guests at fund-raisers for a Republican congresswoman in
a whirlwind visit to <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> arrived at <ORGANIZATION>T.F. Green State Airport</ORGANIZATION> around <TIME>11:30 a.m.</TIME>,
attended two fund-raisers at a hotel for Rep. <PERSON>Claudine Schneider</PERSON>,
visited a senior citizens center in suburban <PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> and left
shortly after <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME>
   About 30 people waited outside the Omni Biltmore hotel for a
glimpse of the popular first lady, but the <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> forced
them out from under an awning and into the rain to make room for her
entourage.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> told about 700 people who paid <MONEY>$150</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> apiece to
attend the fund raisers about her husband's programs and her
campaign for literacy, but didn't mention the campaign <PERSON>Miss
Schneider</PERSON> is contemplating against <PERSON>Sen. Claiborne Pell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-R.I.</LOCATION>, next
year.
   Asked about the potential Pell-Schneider contest at a hotel news
conference, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> initially ducked the issue. ``I like her just
where she is today,'' the first lady said.
   A few minutes later, she said, ``<PERSON>Claudine Schneider</PERSON> is qualified
for anything. ... I'm just not going to fool around in the internal
politics of <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>. She can be anything.''
   The 42-year-old congresswoman was first elected to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1980</DATE>, and has built a reputation as an environmental advocate. She
has yet to declare her plans for <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The fund raisers raised about <MONEY>$170,000</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Schneider</PERSON>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Bob Rendine</PERSON>.
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Cranston Senior Services</ORGANIZATION> center, about two dozen
schoolchildren and a handful of adults awaited <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>, but the
most they got was a glimpse of her red suit and trademark triple
strand of fake pearls.
   Her folksy, down-to-earth personality, though, won rave reviews
from senior citizens.
   ``There's no airs about her. I think she's great,'' <PERSON>Rose Cirelli</PERSON>
of <PERSON>Cranston</PERSON> said as she watched <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> join about 20 people
dancing to the tune, ``<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> was less successful as she took several shots with a
pool cue in the center's pool room.
   ``Do I have to call a ball?'' she asked.
   ``No, you have executive privilege,'' a player replied.
   After missing an easy shot, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> turned and said, ``You
ought to see me on the tennis court.''

   Sen. <PERSON>Phil Gramm</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> he will offer
the nation a glimpse of <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s ``vision of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'' when he
gives the nominating speech for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National
Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   Gramm is the latest Texan to come to the fore as both parties
battle for the <ORGANIZATION>Lone Star State</ORGANIZATION>'s 29 electoral votes in the <DATE>November</DATE>
election.
   The state's senior senator, <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, is the Democratic
nominee for vice president; <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is an adopted Texan who calls
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> home, and at the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
state Treasurer <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> gave the keynote address, Agriculture
Commissioner <PERSON>Jim Hightower</PERSON> spoke during prime time, and former Rep.
<PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> seconded <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s nomination.
   ``It is a great opportunity for me to talk about the vice
president, about his service to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, which ranges over almost
half a century _ from his days as a naval pilot flying off the
(USS) <LOCATION>San Jacinto</LOCATION> to being the greatest vice president we've ever
had,'' said the junior senator from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   In his speech in two weeks in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, he said, he plans to
``really remind people what the world was like that cold day in
<DATE>January</DATE> when <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> took the oath of office
... their proud record and what they've achieved.''
   He will contrast those accomplishments to the record of
Democratic nominee <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>, he indicated.
   <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> was a Democratic representative when <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> took
office in <DATE>1981</DATE>. He resigned his seat in <DATE>1983</DATE>, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> the next year.
   He was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Minority</ORGANIZATION> Leader <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity.''
   <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said he was on a trip to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> during the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' <PERSON>Gramm</PERSON> said.

<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s vision of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.''

   The second of five children wounded in a
school shooting rampage by a babysitter was released from the
hospital <DATE>Friday</DATE>, as authorities continued their investigation into
the assailant's background.
   No new information has emerged in the probe of 30-year-old
<PERSON>Laurie Dann</PERSON>, who fatally shot herself after killing one youngster
and injuring six other people <DATE>May 20</DATE> in this wealthy <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>
suburb, said Police Sgt. <PERSON>Gene Kalvaitis</PERSON>.
   Toxicology reports have turned up no evidence of drugs in her
system, but complete findings will not be available until the end
of next week, said <ORGANIZATION>Cook County Medical Examiner</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Dr. Robert Stein</PERSON>.
   Six-year-old <PERSON>Robert Trossman</PERSON>, who was shot in the chest by <PERSON>Ms.
Dann</PERSON> in a bathroom at <ORGANIZATION>Hubbard Woods School</ORGANIZATION>, was released <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME> from <LOCATION>Evanston Hospital</LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON>Barbara Traeger</PERSON>.
   The child most critically injured when <PERSON>Ms. Dann</PERSON> opened fire in a
classroom, 8-year-old <PERSON>Lindsay Fisher</PERSON>, was upgraded from fair to
good condition a day after being to a regular pediatric ward, <PERSON>Ms.
Traeger</PERSON> said.
   The first shooting victim to be released from the hospital went
home <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   One other injured youngster at <ORGANIZATION>Evanston Hospital</ORGANIZATION> was in good
condtion, while the two other people who were injured were reported
in fair condition at <LOCATION>Highland Park Hospital</LOCATION>, said a spokeswoman
there, <ORGANIZATION>Sue Masarrachia</ORGANIZATION>.
   No information was released <DATE>Friday</DATE> about a friend of <PERSON>Ms. Dann</PERSON>'s
who was arrested <DATE>Thursday</DATE> for allegedly making threatening
telephone calls similar to those <PERSON>Ms. Dann</PERSON> made in the weeks before
the shooting spree.
   <PERSON>Sheri L. Taylor</PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION>, was committed
involuntarily <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to psychiatric treatment at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, but spokeswoman <PERSON>Debbie
Jenkins</PERSON> said no update would be made until next week.
   Documents filed <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Cook County Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON>Ms.
Taylor</PERSON> had signed for voluntary admission to the hospital's
psychiatric unit, agreeing to stay if necessary up to 30 days, when
she will be reevaluated.
   Police said <PERSON>Ms. Taylor</PERSON> was taken into custody <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE> at
the Highwood convenience store where she worked. <PERSON>Ms. Taylor</PERSON> later
surrendered a .357 Magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where
she lived.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Madison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Ms. Dann</PERSON> had been living, has
said she apparently acted alone in obtaining poison she used to
lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she sent or
delivered to acquaintances before <DATE>last week</DATE>'s shooting spree.
   No one was seriously sickened.

   At least two bystanders failed to help two
toddlers found floating face down in an apartment swimming pool, and
a fire department official said he was baffled by their inaction.
   ``Anybody in their right mind _ you'd think they would, but they
didn't,'' said Capt. <PERSON>C.A. Beasley</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Beasley</PERSON> said two men stood by while <PERSON>Taffidie McGough</PERSON>, 2, and her
15-month-old half-sister, <PERSON>Tiffidie Anne</PERSON>, were rescued from the pool.
   Tiffidie Anne was found floating face down in the shallow end of
the pool and was declared dead at the scene.
   Taffidie was on the bottom of the pool near her sister. She
didn't show a pulse but was revived en route to the hospital,
officials said. She remains in critical condition and on life
support systems at <ORGANIZATION>Texas Children's Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON>Tina
Foster</PERSON> said.
   One man told <PERSON>Beasley</PERSON> there appeared to be ``dolls or dogs'' in
the pool.
   ``Regardless of what they thought they were,'' <PERSON>Beasley</PERSON> said. ``I
can't imagine anybody standing there looking at two kids in the
pool. They would be better off out of the pool no matter what.''
   District Attorney <PERSON>John B. Holmes</PERSON> said there are no criminal
sanctions for failing to rescue the children.
   ``But common sense suggests that no caring, thinking human being
would stand handily by while two kids were drowning,'' he said.
   The girls apparently left their apartment <DATE>Sunday</DATE> morning while
their mother slept and wandered into the pool.
   The girls' mother, <PERSON>Tammie Patterson</PERSON>, 20, said she learned her
children had fallen into the pool when an unidentified man knocked
on her door.
   ``I don't understand why they didn't'' try to save the children,
said <PERSON>Ms. Patterson</PERSON>.
   ``It's too late,'' she said. ``I've got one baby that's dead and
one baby who's fighting for her life.''

'SICKIE' MARCIKIC IS HOLDING THE ATTENTION OF MASTERS SWIMMERS IN PROGRAM AT 
UCSD

<P>
Motivation by curiousity. It's not a concept widely used by coaches training 
athletes with visions of either national recognition or Olympic fame. 
</P>
<P>
But for one "Sickie," it's working. 
</P>
<P>
Ron (Sickie) <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON> is the man, sometimes clown, behind the <ORGANIZATION>UCSD Masters</ORGANIZATION> 
swimming program. 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic has the task of holding the interest of 325 participants, swimmers who 
otherwise might stay away. To do so, <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON> calls on his imagination to 
motivate. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear a lot of weird clothes," said <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON>, 39. "A lot of times our 
swimmers will show up just because they want to see what I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic's odd outfits include bright shorts, mismatched shoes and funny hats. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's program is the largest of 24 regional San <ORGANIZATION>Diego/Imperial Swim Masters</ORGANIZATION> 
clubs, all of which are governed by <ORGANIZATION>United States Masters Swimming</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>La 
Jolla Jewish Community Center</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Carlsbad Masters</ORGANIZATION> have 115 swimmers each, an 
Allied Gardens club called "Different Strokes" has 80 and <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> has 50 
members. 
</P>
<P>
There are 1,300 masters swimmers in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, making it the third largest 
region in the country and in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, the state with the most clubs and 
members. <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> is first with 6,557 swimmers, and the <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles/Orange County/Santa Barbara</LOCATION> region is second with 2,356 members. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these swimmers are like <PERSON>Larry Hill</PERSON>, 50, a computer programmer for the 
<ORGANIZATION>San Diego Unified School District</ORGANIZATION>. He returned to swimming in <DATE>Marcikic</DATE>'s 
program eight years ago after a layoff of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sickie provides a lot of variety," he said. "If I don't come, I feel like I'm 
missing out. I'm a better swimmer now than I was in high school and college." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Camille Thompson</PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 1976 Olympic swim team in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, has 
been with the program for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches are great," she said. "Sickie makes it fun. He does crazy things. 
There's always something going on to keep people interested." 
</P>
<P>
In a sport in which it becomes increasingly tiresome to stare at a painted line 
at the bottom of the pool, lap after lap, Marcikic dreams up wild workouts to 
arouse interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I make up strange sets for them," he said. "I'll make them swim on their 
backs, feet first, going backwards, all sorts of different things. You treat 
them like kids but are able to talk to them like adults. The bottom line here 
is fun." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic also has staged some unconventional dry-land activities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he staged such a bizarre golf tournament -- players were required to 
hit the ball with a baseball bat on one hole and with a pool cue on another -- 
that the group was told not to come back to the course. And this <DATE>summer</DATE>, the 
group will hold its first bowling tournament, at an unsuspecting alley to be 
named later. 
</P>
<P>
But to portray the program as a pool of games is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Of the athletes enrolled in <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>'s program, <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON> said approximately half 
are serious triathletes or swimmers in training. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a well-organized workout," <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON> said. "And it's not easy. 
When you're training as many as 80 to 100 people in the water in one workout, 
you don't want to hurt the people who are serious. But you don't want to burn 
out the ones who are there for fun either." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Marcikic</ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON>Jeff Milton</PERSON> four years ago to work with more serious 
swimmers such as triathletes <PERSON>Scott Tinley</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mark Allen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julie Moss</PERSON> and 
multiple masters world-record holders <PERSON>Barbara Dunbar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Betsy Jordan</PERSON>. Milton, 
33, also is swimming coach at <ORGANIZATION>University City High School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The less-serious participants swim to stay in shape, to feel good about 
themselves and to escape, for 1 1/2 hours a day, the grind of high-stress jobs. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Milton</PERSON> said: "They love to be told what to do. They have to be told to get off 
the wall just like high school kids. And they have to do a 50 butterfly on 
their birthday no matter who they are." 
</P>
<P>
In a pool, a doctor and a doorman are indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of professors, doctors, lawyers, many well-respected people 
in the community," <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON> said. "But once they're on deck, in their Speedos, 
you don't recognize them. They're just as crazy as anyone, and they're looking 
for the same results. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Matthew Belshin</PERSON>, 29, is a former competitive swimmer turned retail developer 
for <ORGANIZATION>Trammell Crow Company</ORGANIZATION>. Belshin said he relies on swimming to keep his 
sanity, and he likes the absence of a hierarchy in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what a lot of the people do," he said. "In the pool, 
everyone's the same. This is a time to escape work. People don't talk about it 
much." 
</P>
<P>
County Superior Court <PERSON>Judge Tony Joseph</PERSON>, 52, has been swimming under Marcikic 
for two years. In a masters meet in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>, he won the men's 50-54 
500-yard freestyle. He says swimming is a great way to escape the pressures of 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have something you do that is completely separate from law," 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> said. "It's easier to stay awake all day if you start out doing this." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great program," said <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>, 34, a silver-medalist in the 
400-meter medley relay in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>. "It's a good melting pot here, and you get 
the hours you need." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon View Pool is open for <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>'s masters swimming at <TIME>6 a.m. Marcikic</TIME> and 
<PERSON>Milton</PERSON> divide the pool for two different workouts from 6-7:30. UCSD is also 
open for workouts from <TIME>7:30-9 a.m.</TIME>, noon-1<TIME>:30 p.m.</TIME> and 6:30-8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In masters swimming, the training is much less intense then when <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Charlie Campbell</PERSON>, a first-year <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> member and <DATE>1972</DATE> Olympian, were swimming 
four to six hours a day training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
After a 15-year break from the sport, <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> -- a member of the 400 medley 
relay team that set a world record in <DATE>1971</DATE> -- has returned to swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming was a way of life for me," he said. "When you're a kid, you're a 
semi-pro. Now, this is a chance to get a good workout. We do less distance then 
when I was a kid. This is a program that's sophisticated and low-key. They give 
you whatever you can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>: "It's not like the old days. You can get out when you want. I 
swim with <PERSON>Jeff</PERSON>, and he's a great motivator. He knows where to draw the line." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Milton</PERSON> said family and job commitments force the shorter workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We can make it just as tough, but not as long," he said. "They don't have the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic and <PERSON>Milton</PERSON>, who have both coached youngsters, enjoy the built-in 
discipline of the adults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to coach adults," <PERSON>Marcikic</PERSON> said. "We're not just coaches to them, 
we're friends. It's not a customer/client relationship. Swimming isn't their 
whole lives. I have to build that into their workout because they won't always 
be able to be here." 
</P>
<P>
According to USMS Executive Director <PERSON>Dorothy Donnelly</PERSON>, there are 24,000 
registered members swimming on 435 clubs across the country. There are more men 
than women registered nationally, but <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>'s male-female ratio is fairly even. 
</P>
<P>
Locally and nationally, for both men and women, the most popular age group is 
25-35. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, <ORGANIZATION>Masters</ORGANIZATION> swimmers competed in age groups that were divided into 
10-year increments, beginning at 25 and stopping at 65-plus. Now there are 
five-year increments. The youngest group is <DATE>19-24</DATE>, the oldest 95-up. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two men competing in the highest age group. UCSD's <PERSON>Tom Lane</PERSON> is 
one of them. He holds nine national and four world records in the 90-94 
division, despite the fact he is blind. 
</P>

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by
former Rep. <PERSON>Barbara Jordan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> seconding the nomination of
<PERSON>Sen. Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> for vice president at the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic
National Convention</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
   Thank you. That is quite a greeting.
   We engaged in an important task at a very important time. We are
positioning ourselves for the <DATE>last decade of the twentieth century</DATE>.
   Our minds are turning away from, Hooray for <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>. And our
minds _ and we are now confronting the hard reality of a nation
which desires to become solvent again.
   Competitive again. A nation which desires to have the trust of
its allies and its compatriots. We want _ we want to retake the
moral high ground. Now, to be what we want to be, to become the
people we want to become, we have to be moved to action by what is
reasonable, sensible, logical and rational.
   <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> is a sensible, logical and rational choice for
vice president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   You know, the people who founded <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> were very smart. Those
founders warned us not to become overcome by factions, but to rely
on reason as our guide. If we rely on reason as our guide, reason
will temper and tender our emotions.
   Reason will help us to do the right things. Reason will tutor us
toward doing the right things.
   I say that <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> is a rational and sensible and
reasonable choice.
   Why?
   First of all, he's my senator. And I wasn't planning to come to
this convention for any purpose. But when <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> was tapped
by <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> as his choice for vice president of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, I knew that if <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> wanted me to come and second
his nomination, I could not resist doing that, and I'm here to do
it tonight.
   You know, <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> has been in the <LOCATION>United States Senate</LOCATION> for
almost eighteen years. <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> is a man who has an instinct
for doing what is right. <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> does not have to be
pressured and lobbied to do the right thing.
   Now, <PERSON>Robert Bork</PERSON> _ <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> voted no on that nomination.
And do you know what: <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> didn't have to be pressured
into voting no for <PERSON>Bork</PERSON>.
   He said _ <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>: ``Bork will put our civil rights and
our civil liberties at risk, and we cannot afford to do that, and
that's why I vote no.''
   You heard then <PERSON>Rostenkowski</PERSON> tell you about <PERSON>Bentsen</PERSON>'s service on
the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> and now as chairman on the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
Do you realize that the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Committee</ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over
practically everything that affects our lives, the lives of each
and every one of us.
   <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> is patient and he managed legislation, the trade
legislation involving 24 committees of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>,
meeting over eight months, <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> was patient and moved it
through. Now, the president vetoed it, but <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> got the
momentum for trade legislation going, and that momentum will not
dissipate lightly.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Keeps Own Counsel on Abortion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> she is keeping
silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy
``whichever way I go,'' and detract from her work on illiteracy,
the homeless, hunger and AIDS.
   ``I think that should be left to the people who are courageous
enough, number one to run for office, and number two who can do
something about it,'' she told three reporters at a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
reception for disabled award winners.
   Asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections _ notably
the governor's races <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> _ she said
that she is not a ``single-issue'' person and indicated voters
should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter.
   ``I think people ought to be thinking about fiscal
responsibility and past records and ... looking at the man as a
whole or the woman as a whole,'' she said. ``I'm not a single issue
man or woman,'' she said.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> told a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that he believes
Americans do not vote on the single issue of abortion. He recently
vetoed legislation that would have allowed federal funds to be
spent for abortions for poor victims of rape or incest.
   Asked why she will not give her own position on abortion, which
has become an increasingly polarizing issue in the wake of the
<ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>July</DATE> decision giving states greater leeway to
restrict it, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said: ``It does nothing but cause
controversy whichever way I go. I want people to be interested in
my projects,'' such as working for literacy and the homeless.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> announced in <DATE>February</DATE> that she would not speak out on
controversial policy issues, after she told a reporter that she
favored a ban on semi-automatic weapons, putting her in conflict
with her husband's public position.
   The first lady has spoken out on some issues of concern to
teen-age women, and says, ``We need a lot of education, to tell
these girls that there are opportunities out there for them, that
the door will be closed if they go ahead and have babies. It's very
old fashioned, I know.''
   After the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July</DATE> gave states expanded powers to
restrict abortion, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> lauded the ruling and <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said only,
``I go with my president.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> also said that she would like to go to the
<LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> superpower summit next month if Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail
Gorbachev</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON>, also goes.
   She said it had not been decided if she would go, but that ``I'm
one who loves to travel.''
   On another issue, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said her eyes are still irritated
from the thyroid condition she suffers known as Graves Disease.
   She said the steroid she has been prescribed to treat the
ailment, prednisone, has made her gain back some of the weight she
lost earlier in the year.
   ``I'm fighting a small problem, weight,'' she conceded, adding
that she swims a mile a day to keep in shape.
   Then she chided herself for complaining about her medication at
an event designed to honor people who have overcome major
disabilities.
   ``Of all the places in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to complain about taking
prednisone, this is not the party to complain about it,'' she said
as she stood among several wheelchair-bound award recipients.
   The <DATE>1989</DATE> Victory Awards were bestowed by the <ORGANIZATION>National
Rehabilitation Hospital</ORGANIZATION> to people who overcame physical obstacles
while making contributions to society.
   Among the award recipients were one chosen by the governor of
each state, and several selected by the <ORGANIZATION>National Rehabilitation
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, a private 160-bed institution in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   This year's recipients included: country singer <PERSON>Barbara
Mandrell</PERSON>, who suffered a near fatal car accident in <DATE>1984</DATE>; <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION>
singer <PERSON>Julio Iglesias</PERSON> who recovered from spinal-chord paralysis
after a car accident at age 20; <PERSON>Sen. Daniel Inouye</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Hawaii</LOCATION>, who
lost his right arm during World War II; <PERSON>Joni Eareckson Tada</PERSON>, an
internationally recognized artist who is paralyzed from the
shoulders down from a diving accident and draws with a pencil held
in her teeth; <PERSON>Skip Wilkins</PERSON>, a wheelchair-bound athlete who works as
a counselor to troubled teen-agers and and <PERSON>Bill Demby</PERSON>, a disabled
track and field athlete and professional counselor who lost both
legs in the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.

   <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> says an enormous rat swam by her in
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> pool recently but President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> came to her rescue
and ``drowned the beast.''
   The rat she encountered in the incident <DATE>several months ago</DATE> ``did
not look like a Walt Disney friend, I'll tell you that,'' she said
in an interview published by newspapers in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>, who was back in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> for the economic summit, said
her husband came to her aid at the outdoor pool.
   ``I swim with a mask, so as it went right by in front of me _ I
mean, it was enormous,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>, a mile-a-day swimmer.
``Fortunately, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> was there and drowned the beast. It was
horrible.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> grounds attract rats, she said, ``because we're
surrounded by parks and people drop food.''
   Or, she theorized it was an effort to get rid of the rodents
that may have led this one to find its way into the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
pool.
   ``They put some stuff out that only bothered rats, and what it
did is make them very, very thirsty. And this rat went for the
biggest water it saw,'' she explained.
   She also credited her English springer spaniel <PERSON>Millie</PERSON> with
helping reduce the local rat population.
   For a long time afterward, she said, she insisted that her
guards check to make sure there wasn't a rat ``in hiding'' before
she entered the pool.
   On another subject, she said her husband was ``absolutely
exhausted'' when he got to <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> from the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>
summit in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. But she added that they have both been delighted
by the warm reception Houstonians have given their international
guests.
   After viewing the friendly crowds along a motorcade route to
<ORGANIZATION>Rice University</ORGANIZATION>, ``I told <PERSON>George</PERSON> that this is the first time I've
gone that far in a car back and forth where everybody waved and no
unfriendly gestures,'' she said.
   She said <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s heat was not too much for the summit spouses.
   ``All of these ladies have been in hot places before,'' she
said. ``I've been to <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> on state trips and you just learn to
glow in public. ... How much are they outdoors? Nothing. Twenty
minutes at the most.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> took several of the spouses to <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
for a tour of the Alamo and other sights.
   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> released a full transcript of <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>'s
interview <DATE>Monday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Chronicle</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Post</ORGANIZATION>, the
<LOCATION>San Antonio Light</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>San Antonio Express News</ORGANIZATION>.

FIREFIGHTERS STRETCHED TO COVER THE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRES: ALTHOUGH CREWS HAVE BEEN SENT TO BATTLE THE SANTA BARBARA BLAZE, LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least 100 <LOCATION>Ventura County</LOCATION> firefighters have been dispatched to help battle 
the disastrous <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> fire, but officials said they have managed to 
maintain comprehensive fire protection throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that we get everybody we possibly can to cover the local 
stations," said <PERSON>Sandi Wells</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Ventura County Fire Department</ORGANIZATION>. "We don't 
leave any part of the county uncovered, ever." 
</P>
<P>
By bringing virtually every firefighter on duty, the county Fire Department has 
maintained crews of at least one fire engine and three firefighters per truck 
at each of the county's 32 stations, <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, firefighters with local city departments and other agencies are on 
standby to help if needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On normal days, about 130 county firefighters, or nearly one-third of the 
385-member force, are on duty at any one time, officials said. Typically, 
county firefighters work three 24-hour shifts every nine days. 
</P>
<P>
But when emergencies occur, county firefighters join with city fire departments 
to activate a backup network to maintain the same number of engines and 
firefighters to cover local neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Such an emergency was called when county firefighters, already stretched thin 
by the brush fire in <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION>, were dispatched to <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 
<TIME>afternoon</TIME>. As of <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, 100 firefighters remained in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> -- about 
one-quarter of the county force. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, about 200 county firefighters helped crews from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest 
Service</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Forestry</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles County</LOCATION> Fire 
Department fight the brush fire that consumed 585 acres near <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION>. As of 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, only seven county workers remained as part of the firefighting force 
in the <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION> hills. 
</P>
<P>
When emergencies occur, the county Fire Department dips into the mutual aid 
system. Under this plan, participating fire agencies make firefighters and 
equipment available to neighboring communities, call in off-duty officers to 
work at local stations, and often require firefighters and other employees to 
work overtime to maintain a full level of service. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stretched in the sense that we would have to bring in other outside 
agencies if we were to have another major fire in the county now," said 
dispatcher <PERSON>Lisa Hines</PERSON>. "But as for normal, everyday emergencies, we're fully 
covered." 
</P>
<P>
Under the system, fire departments from the cities of <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oxnard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santa 
Paula</LOCATION> and a volunteer contingent from <ORGANIZATION>Fillmore</ORGANIZATION> are assisting the county Fire 
Department in covering the county surrounding their areas. A six-member 
firefighting unit at <ORGANIZATION>Camarillo State Hospital</ORGANIZATION> is also available to help out. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Maria Tejada</PERSON>, assistant to the executive director at <ORGANIZATION>Camarillo State Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, 
said the hospital's fire engine returned <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from filling in at a county 
fire station in <LOCATION>Thousand Oaks</LOCATION>. The hospital's water tank truck remained on duty 
at the <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION> fire. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>, the city's Fire Department sent one fire engine and three 
firefighters to <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, said information officer <PERSON>Barry 
Simmons</PERSON>. Off-duty firefighters were called to relieve those firefighters, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And an <LOCATION>Oxnard</LOCATION> fire engine, with three firefighters, was due to return from the 
<LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> fire <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>Battalion Chief Murray Glidden</ORGANIZATION>. Oxnard 
officials had also called in an off-duty crew to work overtime, filling in for 
the crew that was dispatched to <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other county agencies also stepped in to aid <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION> dispatched 38 deputies to assist 
authorities in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>. By <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, all but nine of the deputies had 
returned to <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Department spokeswoman <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> said the county was still standing by 
and was prepared to send to <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> those firefighters who have rested 
after the <LOCATION>Ojai</LOCATION> blaze, replacing workers exhausted from battling that fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those things that is changing continually," <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> said. "We 
could end up sending more."

<HEAD>First Lady Reports She Saw Rat in White House Pool</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Summit Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Lady <PERSON>Barbara Bush</PERSON> says she once encountered
a rat in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> swimming pool.
   ``It did not look like a Walt Disney rat, I'll tell you that,''
<PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Post</ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today.
``I was out of that pool so much faster than I thought I could.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON>, who swims daily for exercise in the heated pool, said
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> came to her rescue during the incident a few months
ago.
   ``I swim with a mask, and it just went right by in front of
me,'' she said. ``Fortunately, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> was there and drowned
the beast. It was horrible.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said the confrontation with the rat was the worst
experience of her 18 month in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.
   The first lady planned to take the wives of other heads of
government attending the seven-nation economic summit on a tour of
the Alamo and other historical sites at <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Noting the friendly crowds that greeted the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> motorcade
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at the start of the summit talks, <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said, ``I told
<PERSON>George</PERSON> this was the first time I've gone that far in a car ... when
everybody waved and there were no unfriendly gestures.''
   ``It's so wonderful,'' she said. ``George is tickled pink.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said she and her husband agree that foreign visitors
should see more than the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and West coasts of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   The president told <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Prime</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> at a
presummit social event last weekend that ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is not the
coasts. This is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Bush</PERSON> said. ``Well, it is. This is
what you want people to see.''
