<TEXT>
   In <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, where time zones can divide a
town, many people keep two reckonings of the hour to cope with
living in a ``time warp.''
   Hoosiers say the state's three time zones wreak havoc on
business and family life. At no time does the entire state follow
the same clock, creating timekeeping headaches from urban centers
to country hamlets.
   People live in one zone and work in another, children cross time
lines to and from school, prime time programming for televison is
complicated and meetings can be disrupted by delays, latecomers and
no-shows.
   One of three states exempted from the national time change _ the
others are <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> _ <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> is the only one with
fragmented zones. A large portion is permanently on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Standard Time</ORGANIZATION>, while the rest observes either Central time or
<ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> time and changes twice a year like the other 47 states.
   ``<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> has the most complex time observance of any place in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Joanne Petrie</PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>, the agency in charge of setting time
zones.
   Mayor <ORGANIZATION>John Ford of Union City</ORGANIZATION>, which is divided down the middle
by the Indiana-Ohio line, calls <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s change to daylight-saving
time a ``time warp.''
   He said most residents of the portion of <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>
will experience the anxiety of being an hour late for something as
those on the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> side of the line spring ahead. ``But they'll make
it up by being an hour early for something else,'' he said.
   ``The majority of people live the way it suits them, and in a
lot of places that involves keeping two different times in the same
househould,'' he said.
   Seventy-six of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s 92 counties _ including <LOCATION>Randolph
County</LOCATION>, in which <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, is located _ remain on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern
Standard Time</ORGANIZATION> as everyone else resets their clocks on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   Eleven other counties observe Central time and, on schedule,
switch from CST to CDT as of <DATE>Sunday</DATE> _ meaning that for the next
five months, their clocks will look just like the <ORGANIZATION>EST</ORGANIZATION> counties'
clocks. Five other counties that are close to <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> or
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> traditionally observe <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> time to remain in step
with those cities, switching as of <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to <ORGANIZATION>EDT</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s time zones are a compromise following years of local
and national debate. Officials say it's probably the best that can
be expected, though far from perfect.
   Prior to <DATE>1961</DATE>, the Indiana-Ohio line also divided the Central
and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> time zones. The line was later shifted to bisect the
state and then re-shifted to create current time boundaries.
   ``There's some sort of truce right now,'' said <PERSON>Chuck Coffee</PERSON>, a
speechwriter for Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Frank O'Bannon</PERSON>. ``It was much different
when the population was dependent on rail service and waited as
trains came to town,'' he said.
   <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> balks at joining with the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> time zone
in observing daylight saving time, officials say, because it lies
on the western edge of the zone and already has a relatively late
sunrise. Daylight saving time would exacerbate that, much to the
displeasure of farmers who relish the early daylight hours for
field work.
   Simply going on Central time is opposed by many others who feel
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> is more attuned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and eastern cities and changing
would put it out of step the entire year.
   ``Why would someone think that they are traveling within the
same state and the time's going to change?'' said <PERSON>Carolyn
McClintock</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Vanderburgh County</LOCATION> commissioner.

<TEXT>
   It will be another <DATE>summer</DATE> of confusion
in <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, where the time of day is strictly a matter of
opinion.
   Residents of this city divided by the Indiana-Ohio state line
are victims of the time change that annually splits <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION> into
what residents call ``slow and fast time.''
   When daylight-saving time went into effect nationwide at <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, most citizens of <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, went along. They are on
fast time.
   But those who live in <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, stay on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Standard
Time year-round</ORGANIZATION>, as do Hoosiers in 76 of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s 92 counties.
They are on slow time _ most of them.
   ``Most people have adjusted to it, but there's still
confusion,'' said <PERSON>Scott Stahl</PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Leroy Stentzil</PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, has lived in <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>,
since <DATE>1930</DATE> but still sets his clocks on <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> time. ``It's a
nuisance until you get used to it,'' <PERSON>Stentzil</PERSON> said.
   A few years ago, <PERSON>Stentzil</PERSON> had clocks in his house labeled
``Indiana Time'' or ``Ohio Time.''
   ``I don't do that anymore,'' he said. ``But it does cause
confusion. I've been late lots of times. Now if I'm invited to
something in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and I don't think about it, I'm there an hour
early. I keep reading material in my side pocket all the time.''
   In fact, most <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, residents will experience the
anxiety of being an hour late for something during the coming
months, said <PERSON>John Ford</PERSON>, mayor of the <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> side of <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>.
``But they'll make up for it by being early for something else.''
   The time change affects families who work on one side of the
state line but live on the other and merchants who must cater to
customers on both times, <PERSON>Stahl</PERSON> said.
   ``In some instances there are stores that stay on slow time no
matter what,'' <PERSON>Stahl</PERSON> said. ``The <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> stores go on fast time. There
are some stores that might split it down the middle. It just gets
confusing.
   ``If they're normally open until 5 o'clock fast time, that would
be 4 o'clock slow time. So maybe they'll move it a half hour and
close at <TIME>5:30</TIME>. That way it would be 4:30 slow time.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said most of the larger industries in <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, run
on fast time despite being in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>. Those include <ORGANIZATION>Union City
Body Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which produces step vans, and <ORGANIZATION>Sheller-Globe Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which
makes auto trim.
   ``Most of the businesses in cities such as <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
expect them to be following those hours,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said.
   However, <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, schools and government stay on slow
time. As a result, some parents are leaving for work while their
children are just beginning to prepare for school.
   ``Part of the people in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> go on the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> time, just like I
do,'' <PERSON>Stentzil</PERSON> said. ``And part of them don't. I used to laughingly
say: `I don't care if they put ABCs on the clock. I'll get along.'
But I'm an old man now, and it just isn't so easy to adjust.''
   Stentzil said if <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> legislators lived in <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION>, they'd
think again about the wisdom of exempting <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> from
daylight-saving time.
   Exemptions from daylight-saving time are <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Puerto
Rico</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>American Samoa</ORGANIZATION> and part of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>,
according to The World Almanac. Daylight-saving time starts the
<DATE>first Sunday</DATE> in <DATE>April</DATE> and ends the <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> in <DATE>October</DATE>.

   Pakistani troops fired on Indian
security forces who stopped a mob of Pakistani protesters from
storming across the border into disputed <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, officials said
<DATE>today</DATE>.
   At least three demonstrators were killed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, a <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s state-run TV said
the Indian guards killed as many as six.
   The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on
hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line
separating Pakistan-controlled <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> from the Indian-held region.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said Pakistani
troops then fired about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at
Indian border posts in the <LOCATION>Uri</LOCATION> sector.
   Indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about
half an hour, the spokesman said. No one was hurt.
   A Pakistani official in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> denied the accusations.
   ``Pakistani military authorities and the Foreign Secretary are
in touch with Indian authorities to remove the misunderstanding,''
said Additional Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Khalid Mahmood</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s top diplomat in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bashir Babar</PERSON>, was summoned
to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and today and apprised of
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s concern over the events, an Indian government spokesman
said.
   A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates the Indian and
Pakistani Kashmirs. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and Indian twice have gone to war over
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1948</DATE> and again in <DATE>1965</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Feb. 5</DATE>, at least one person was killed and 12 wounded when
Pakistani mobs tried to cross the cease-fire line near <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, 95
miles to the south.
   The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line were to express
support for Moslem militants who are fighting for independence for
the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the Pakistani mob retreated when soldiers of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
paramilitary border security force opened fire, said the Indian
spokesman who refused to be identified.
   ``The mob returned a second time by which time it had become
slightly dark,'' he said. ``That is when the Pakistani troops
opened fire.''
   A Pakistani spokesman, who also refused to be identified, said
Pakistani army patrols repulsed a mob of some 1,200 demonstrators.
Small groups broke away from the crowd and slipped into the
Indian-held territory, he said.
   An official of the Indian border security force, which normally
patrols the border, said the Indian army <DATE>today</DATE> took control of the
cease-fire line.
   Some men in the intruding crowd were armed with guns which they
fired occasionally, he said.
   ``It was becoming very difficult, our troops had to open fire,''
he said.
   <PERSON>Farouk Haider</PERSON>, vice-president of the militant Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front that is leading the uprising, said in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>
after the Indian firing that ``the situation is very confusing.''
   Thirty-one people were wounded in the shooting, <PERSON>Haider</PERSON> said.
Five were in critical condition in a hospital in <LOCATION>Muzzafarabad</LOCATION>, the
capital of Pakistan-controlled <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, he said, adding he knew of
only one death.
   The 40-year-old conflict over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> flared <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> after a
government crackdown and the arrest of 250 suspected militants.
Most of them were subsequently released, but the arrests sparked
widespread violence.
   At least 85 people have been killed since the crackdown began.
Most of the victims have been curfew-breaking protesters shot by
security forces in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   Srinagar, the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, has been the
center of the secessionist movement that has turned violent in
recent years.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> had earlier campaigned for
union with <LOCATION>Islamic Pakistan</LOCATION> but has in recent years demanded
independence and the status of a neutral country.
   About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 6 million people are
Moslems, making it the only Moslem majority state in predominantly
<LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>'s 25 states.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million
population. Hindus comprise <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>.

<FÊP=106> [Report by Surinder Oberoi] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 12</DATE> (AFP) -- <PERSON>Javed Mir</PERSON>, the 
president of the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> and 
most-wanted Kashmiri Moslem militant, was arrested here <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 
[12 <DATE>March</DATE>], witnesses and <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> sources said. 
  Mir, 30, the former commander-in-chief of the guerrilla wing 
of the Moslem separatist group, was arrested along with another 
man when the car in which they were travelling was stopped by 
border guards, the witnesses said. 
  The pair were pulled out of the car and whisked away by the 
Indian paramilitary troops, they said. The other man, whose 
identity was not immediately known, was later released. 
  JKLF sources here confirmed the arrest of the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> president 
but there was no immediate word from the Indian authorities. 
  The stocky and bearded Mir was one of the four founders of 
the Moslem separatist rebellion which began in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only 
Moslem-majority state in <DATE>1989</DATE> and his arrest is seen as a major 
setback to the movement. 
  Of the other three architects of the armed struggle against 
Indian rule, two are dead and the third is in prison. Mir, who 
worked for the state waterworks department before picking up a 
gun, carried a reward of 50,000 rupees (<MONEY>1,666 dollars</MONEY>) on his 
head and topped the list of Kashmiri Moslem militants wanted by 
the Indian authorities. 
  A native of <LOCATION>Sringar</LOCATION>, Mir has been accused by the Indian 
authorities of singlehandedly carrying out several deadly 
attacks against Indian troops deployed in the northern state. 
  The outlawed <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> is the second most powerful Moslem 
separatist organization in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahedeen</ORGANIZATION>, 
which favors a merger of the state with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
  Unlike the Hizbul and most other groups, the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> seeks 
independence for the Himalayan territory. 
  Mir is the third top leader of the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> to be arrested in 
the 
past fortnight and his arrest comes just a day after he made a 
surprise appearance at the main mosque in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> to deliver a 
speech from the pulpit. 
  Last week, Mir was among a group of Kashmiri Moslem leaders 
who met here with a team of 10 New Delhi-based diplomats who 
toured the strife-torn state. 
  More than 8,000 people have died in Moslem-separatist 
related 
violence in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
  <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, which holds the southern two-thirds of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, 
accuses <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, which controls the northern third, of arming 
and training the militants waging the fight against <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> rule. 
  Pakistan denies the charge but provides diplomatic support 
to 
a campaign which it describes as a legitimate struggle for 
self-determination.

   Hundreds of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> policemen went on
strike for five hours <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to support Moslem separatists's
demands that army troops called in to quell violence leave
Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Gov. <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, who uses only one name, appealed to the
separatists to lay down their arms on the fourth day of a crackdown
on the violent pro-Pakistani secessionist movement in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   At least 57 people, most of them protesters, have been killed
since an around-the-clock curfew was imposed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> on <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>
and surrounding towns.
   One Moslem militant was killed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when paramilitary
forces, fearing an attack, fired on a mob, a senior police official
said on condition of anonymity.
   Jagmohan, who has a reputation as a tough administrator, was
appointed governor of Jammu-Kashmir state by Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P.
Singh</PERSON> two weeks ago in an effort to curb the rebellion, the most
serious crisis <PERSON>Singh</PERSON> has faced since he took office <DATE>Dec. 2</DATE>.
   The Islamic militants, led by the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu Kashmir Liberation
Front</ORGANIZATION>, demand either independence for the state or union with
neighboring Islamic <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 5 million people are
Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems account for <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880
million people and Hindus make up <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>.
   Singh, a <ORGANIZATION>Hindu</ORGANIZATION> like <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, has sent hundreds of troops from
the nation's predominantly <PERSON>Hindu</PERSON> army and paramilitary forces to
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Ethnic tensions flared <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when a Moslem policeman was shot
to death by soldiers enforcing the curfew. Government officials
said the killing was an accident.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, hundreds of state policemen refused to
work. About 300 striking officers gathered on a downtown street,
waving rifles and shouting, ``Death to the Indian army!'' and
``Indians go back!''
   The strike was called off in the afternoon after <PERSON>Jitendra Narain
Saxena</PERSON>, the state's top police officer, and <PERSON>Mohammad A. Nomani</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>'s police inspector general, spoke to the protesting
policemen.
   Saxena later said: ``It appears that over the years, some
terrorist elements have infiltrated the state police force.''
   There are 40,000 men in the police force.
   Moslem residents of Srinager were jubilant over the strike and
many embraced officers when the curfew was lifted for an hour in
the morning.
   ``Policemen were resentful of certain things. The incident took
place due to lack of leadership and mismanagement,'' <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON> said
without elaborating.
   ``The issue has been sorted out. I do not think there is any
serious problem,'' he said.
   But one of the strike leaders, constable <PERSON>Mohammad Afzal</PERSON>, said
another walkout was planned for <DATE>Saturday</DATE> unless the soldiers leave
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and the government reinstates a police union banned in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   During the news conference, <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON> rejected suggestions by
some reporters that most Kashmiris wanted to secede and join
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   ``I have come here to help, to sort out the problems. Give me
some time. There is no magic in human affairs,'' he said.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has often accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of aiding separatists. Pakistan
denies the charge.
   Claimed by both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was divided into
Indian and Pakistani sectors by a cease-fire line that is monitored
by <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> military observers.
   The dispute over the territory, which has led to two wars, began
after <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> were partitioned upon gaining independence
from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>.

   Moslem snipers fired at Indian troops
from rooftops today and at least two people were killed and 300
injured in clashes between soldiers and Islamic militants,
officials said.
   About 500 armed state policemen holed up in a police complex
after a confrontation with the army and refused to continue the
crackdown against the militants.
   ``The whole city is up in revolt,'' said <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> police
inspector general <PERSON>Mohammad Nomani</PERSON>.
   The Islamic militants, who want <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> state to become
independent or merge with neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, marched out of
homes and mosques in defiance of a curfew.
   Nomani said at least 40 people, most of them militants, had died
since the violence began <DATE>late Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, a
predominantly Moslem city.
   He said a paramilitary policeman was killed today by a Moslem
sniper, and one Moslem protester was shot to death by the army.
   At least 300 protesters were injured today when troops fired on
a crowd of about 5,000 in a suburb of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, doctors at the
<ORGANIZATION>Soora Hospital</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all beds
in the hospital were occupied and the cafeteria had been converted
into a makeshift hospital.
   <PERSON>Mohammad Aslam</PERSON>, a policeman in the state constabulary, said a
fellow officer was killed by army fire.
   When soldiers refused to hand over his body to the state police,
about 500 armed officers took up positions in residential quarters
of the police complex and refused to report for duty, <PERSON>Aslam</PERSON> said.
   State police said they could not confirm the officer's death and
refused further comment.
   <PERSON>Aslam</PERSON> said the army and the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION>Central Reserve Police
Force</ORGANIZATION> wanted to disarm the state police, most of whom are Moslems.
The army and the paramilitary forces are mostly Hindu.
   ``We are not slaves,'' he said as his colleagues chanted in the
background: ``Army go back.''
   Thousands of Moslems took to the streets starting shortly before
<TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after government security forces rounded up
suspected militants. The government said it acted to control
escalating violence.
   Nomani said 251 people had been detained in raids but that all
except four had been released in an attempt to stop the violence.
   He estimated the militants' strength at 1,500 and said they had
at least 1,000 weapons, mostly automatic rifles.
   The city of 1 million was placed under around-the-clock curfew,
with only military vehicles and troops permitted on the streets.
   But bands of 50 to 100 men ignored the curfew today; at least 50
streamed out of one mosque in downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. Some hurled stones
at the troops, while outhers beat their breasts and shouted: ``You
Indians go back.''
   Teen-age boys hauled out an Indian flag and shredded it in front
of the soldiers. As the stones continued to fly, the army opened
fire. One demonstrator fell to the street dead.
   Before the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, 26 people had been killed this year in
confrontations involving Moslem militants and security forces.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> today, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Shabzada Yaqub Khan</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> conferred with Indian officials during a visit scheduled
before the latest violence.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has long accused Islamic Pakistan of supporting the
Kashmiri separatists, a charge routinely denied by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The old princely state of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was divided between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> when the two countries were partitioned and became
independent from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have gone to war three times since, the last
time in <DATE>1971</DATE>, but the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> frontier is still under dispute.
   <PERSON>Abdul Qayyum</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Azad Kashmir</PERSON> state, told a
news conference in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, today that more violence
could spark thousands to cross the 840-mile border into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   ``People are becoming deaf to reason and logic,'' he said.
   He said an alliance of nine political parties in
Pakistani-controlled <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> would lead a ``peaceful movement
across the cease-fire line'' if Indian troops continued what he

   The government on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> lifted curfew
restrictions for 12 hours, but shops remained closed and few people
ventured out because of a strike called by Moslem separatists,
witnesses said.
   A bomb went off in the city during the relaxation, but a senior
police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
were no casualties.
   No other violence was reported.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> spread a strike call by word
of mouth on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and <DATE>early Saturday</DATE>, local journalists
said, quoting shopkeepers in downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and its suburbs.
   The front is spearheading a four-decade-old campaign for
secession of Jammu-Kashmir state's predominantly Moslem Kashmir
valley from Hindu-majority <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Srinagar, the state's summer
capital, is the largest city in the valley.
   At least 76 people have been killed since the government
launched a crackdown on the secessionist movement on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> and
imposed around-the-clock curfews. Most of those killed were
curfew-violating Moslems shot by the security forces.
   The government reported no deaths between <DATE>Jan. 25</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE>,
when at least four people were killed. Three of them died when
paramilitary police opened fire on a mob defying curfew in the
nearby city of <LOCATION>Sopore</LOCATION>, police officials said. The fourth was a
Hindu shopkeeper who was shot by militants in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s strike in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> was to protest the <LOCATION>Sopore</LOCATION> deaths,
<PERSON>Kaiser Mirza</PERSON>, a local journalist, quoted shopkeepers as saying. The
curfew relaxation began at <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> and ended at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>
   <LOCATION>Mirza</LOCATION> said most shops did not open in the <TIME>morning</TIME> when curfew
was lifted, and a few shops that did open soon put down their
shutters when owners learned of the strike call.
   It was not immediately clear if the shops were closed fearing
attacks by the militants or to sympathize with the separatist cause.
   During earlier curfew relaxations, which began one week ago,
vegetable shops and groceries were crowded and streets were filled
with people and traffic. On <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, small groups of men
stood at street corners but there was little traffic, <PERSON>Mirza</PERSON> said.
   The Moslem militancy dates to <DATE>1947</DATE> when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> were
partitioned on religious lines after gaining independence from
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. The king of mostly <ORGANIZATION>Moslem Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> chose union with
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> instead of Islamic <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Moslem militants initially began agitating for union with
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> but in recent months have been demanding independence
instead.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of fomenting the trouble in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,
a charge <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> denies.
   The two countries have fought three wars, two of them over
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   The wars have left a slice of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> under <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s control
and a U.N.-supervised cease-fire line divides the valley into
Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   The Indian state of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, which comprises the valley
and the plains of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> to the south, is the country's only
Moslem-majority state. At least <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of its 5 million people
follow Islam.
   Nationwide, Moslems account for <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the 880 million
population.

   Troops searched from house to house
<DATE>Friday</DATE> for pro-Pakistan Moslems waging a violent separatist
campaign in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, and the government imposed a virtual news
blackout.
   At least 70 people, most of them Moslem militants, have been
killed since the government began a crackdown <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to try to
halt separatist violence.
   Witnesses in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of Jammu-Kashmir state,
said soldiers and paramilitary commandos of the elite <ORGANIZATION>National
Security Guard</ORGANIZATION> were searching the city. Similar searches were
reported in the nearby towns of <LOCATION>Anantnag</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Baramulla</LOCATION>.
   Many residents of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> refused to switch on lights after
dusk in protest of the crackdown.
   Journalists were confined to a hotel and told they would be
arrested, or even shot, if they stepped outside. They were denied
access to telex and telephone lines after the warning.
   In <LOCATION>Muzaffarabad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON>Sikander Hyat Khan</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Pakistani Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> said he would launch a Moslem ``holy war'' unless
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> schedules a special session to address the
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> issue.
   Muzaffarabad is the capital of <LOCATION>Pakistani Kashmir</LOCATION> and near the
cease-fire that has divided the region between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
since <DATE>1947</DATE>, when the subcontinent became independent of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
the two nations were created. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought four
wars, three of them specifically over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Most of the 5 million people in the <ORGANIZATION>Indian State of
Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> are Moslems. It is the only state with a Moslem
majority in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, a predominantly Hindu nation.
   ``If the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is not ready to play its role ... I will
tell them to go and fight,'' <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> warned of the people in <LOCATION>Pakistani
Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   He gave the world organization until <DATE>Feb. 17</DATE> to schedule a
special session. He said the deadline coincided with a scheduled
meeting all Pakistani political and religious parties in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Tariq Mahmood Butt</PERSON>, head of the student wing of the militant
<ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, said thousands of its members would
cross the frontier <DATE>Feb. 11</DATE> if the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> did not promise
action.
   Indian state television described the situation in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>
as ``by and large peaceful,'' but said paramilitary troops fired on
rioters <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Handwara</LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. A
government spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 11
people were killed and 14 wounded.
   Troops in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> tightened restrictions under the 24-hour
curfew and prevented residents from opening windows, said witnesses
reached by telephone.
   From various vantage points in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, a city of 1 million,
only heavily armed troopers and an occasional government official
could be seen on the streets. Several people reached by telephone
from inside and outside <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> said they had not heard gunfire.
   Police sources in <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, winter capital of the state, said
militants hurled a gasoline bomb at soldiers during house searches
but no one was injured.
   The increased security coincided with the Moslem sabbath and
<ORGANIZATION>Republic Day</ORGANIZATION>, which major towns and cities in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> usually
celebrate with military parades.
   Moslem separatists in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, who want the state to be
either independent or joined to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, declared the national
holiday a ``black day.''
   Television showed <PERSON>Jameel Qureshi</PERSON>, adviser to the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>
state governor, taking the salute at a parade in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Bakshi
Stadium</LOCATION>. No civilian spectators were shown and a policeman who was
there said none attended.
   District magistrate <PERSON>Ghulam Abbas</PERSON> told about 20 journalists at
the Hotel Broadway: ``If you go out of the hotel, you can be shot,
and if we find out you have gone out, you can be imprisoned for six
months.''
   Soldiers with submachine guns were posted around the hotel,
which is about a mile from downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. The door leading to
the roof of the five-story building was locked and telephone
service was halted after the warning by <PERSON>Abbas</PERSON>.
   Seven journalists returned to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> on a commercial flight
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. They said police took them to the <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>
airport by a circuitous route one officer said was designed to
skirt trouble. Police at the airport confiscated dozens of rolls of
film, they said.
   The Moslem separatist campaign is as old as the two nations, but
has escalated in recent weeks.
   Srinagar and surrounding towns were put under 24-hour curfew
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and soldiers and paramilitary troopers were deployed.
Their number has not been released, but is known to be at least in
the hundreds.

   Militant Moslem separatists escalated
their campaign for an independent <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, killing two more
hostages in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and bombing a crowded commuter train near
<LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> today, police said.
   About 1,000 troops in battle gear were trucked into <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>,
the center of the secessionist campaign in the mostly Moslem
northern state bordering <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The bodies of the two hostages were found <TIME>late Tuesday night</TIME>,
several hours after the body of another hostage was dumped near a
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> fire station. Their killings brought to at least 259 the
number of people killed in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since a government crackdown in
<DATE>January</DATE>.
   Telephone callers purporting to speak for the ``Mujahedeen
Kashmir,'' or Islamic Holy Warriors of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, claimed
responsibility for the bombing today that injured 34 people near
the <LOCATION>Malad</LOCATION> station on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION>
reported.
   Later today, police said they found five crude bombs hidden in a
water tank in another <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> suburb. It was not immediately known
whether the discoveries were connected with the train bombing.
   The <PERSON>Mujahedeen Kashmir</PERSON> was first heard of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when it
claimed responsibility for bomb blasts that injured at least nine
policemen in two <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> police stations.
   The <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> bombings were the first time any
Kashmiri separatists had claimed responsibility for attacks outside
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since the government of predominantly <ORGANIZATION>Hindu India</ORGANIZATION> launched
a crackdown on the Moslem secessionists <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>.
   Police found the bodies of the vice chancellor of <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir
University</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mushir Ul-Haq</PERSON>, and his secretary, <PERSON>Abdul Ghani</PERSON>, dumped
on a road near the city's airport late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the police official
said.
   Both men, who were Moslems, had been shot in the back.
   Earlier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, the body of <ORGANIZATION>L.M. Khera</ORGANIZATION>, a Hindu industrialist,
was discovered with five bullet wounds.
   ``The dastardly murders ... are the grossest violations of human
rights where innocent persons are being made victims of senseless
externally inspired and motivated violence,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman <PERSON>Aftab Seth</PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
   All three were kidnapped <DATE>Friday</DATE> and threatened with execution if
three top militants were not released. They were the first
civilians not accused of being police informers to be killed by
militants.
   The government had refused to negotiate. It imposed an
around-the-clock curfew after the kidnappings and detained between
300 and 400 people it suspected of links with the secessionist
movement.
   The killings triggered an even tighter crackdown on the
secessionists.
   About 100 Indian army trucks carrying an estimated 1,000
soldiers were seen moving into <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> today. The state government
ordered local police and civilians holding curfew passes to stay
off the streets until further notice, said a senior police official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> dozens of members of a Hindu militant group, the
<ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>, marched to the <ORGANIZATION>Pakistan Embassy</ORGANIZATION> and
held a demonstration.
   ``We will crush <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,'' shouted the demonstrators, who were
prevented from reaching the embassy gate by police.
   The group was formed in <DATE>March</DATE> to counter the <ORGANIZATION>Moslem
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, which is leading the secessionist
campaign.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON>, in the most aggressive statement yet
by an Indian leader, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> should be
``psychologically prepared'' for an armed conflict with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
over what he called the Islamic nation's territorial ambitions in
the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>.
   Singh made the comments in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> hours after <PERSON>Khera</PERSON>'s body
was found. He accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of fomenting the insurgency in the
northern state of Jammu-Kashmir and could ``make a limited
intervention.''
   Pakistan ``will not get away with it,'' <PERSON>Singh</PERSON> said. ``You will
have to pay a very heavy price and we have the capability to
inflict this cost.''
   Moslem-dominated <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is a former princely state whose Hindu
ruler opted for union with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE> when the subcontinent was
divided into Hindu-majority <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Islamic Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> fought wars over the region in <DATE>1948</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE>.
A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line separates the valley into Indian
and Pakistani sectors. The two countries also fought a war in <DATE>1971</DATE>
that led to the independence of <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>.

FT  17 JUN 94 / No peace yet in troubled Kashmir: Kidnappings highlight
unrest in spite of fragile gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The kidnapping of two British tourists by separatist militants in the
northern Indian state of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> highlights how far this troubled
region still is from peace.
Over the <DATE>last 12 months</DATE>, the Indian authorities have tried to create the
impression that the violence which has hit <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in the past four years is
being brought under control. They were so successful that tourists started
coming back this year: owners of hotels, houseboats and handicraft shops
thought their trade could at last see a revival.
The kidnapping has put in jeopardy this fragile gain in confidence. It is
now 11 days since <PERSON>Mr David Mackie</PERSON>, aged 36, and 16-year-old <PERSON>Kim Housego</PERSON>, son
of <PERSON>Mr David Housego</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> staff correspondent, were
captured while on trekking holidays with their families.
The incident has exposed the fact that despite considerable advances in
suppressing militants in the capital city of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and the surrounding
valley, the Indian security forces are far from crushing the separatist
fighters.
Even the government's own figures show violence remains widespread. In the
<DATE>five months to the end of May</DATE>, the death toll was broadly the same as for
the same months last year - 501 militants, 85 members of the security
forces, and 420 civilians (killed in militant attacks or in crossfire.) A
further 139 people were kidnapped. Altogether nearly 10,000 have died since
the fighting broke out in <DATE>1990</DATE>, according to official statistics. The
militants put the total at more than 20,000.
This is not to say the authorities have made no progress in the past year.
The security forces have killed or captured several top militant leaders and
disrupted lines linking militants with their sources of supply in
neighbouring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
Delhi scored a considerable coup last <DATE>November</DATE> by bringing to a peaceful end
a month-long siege of the Hazratbal mosque, the holiest Moslem shrine in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
'In <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> at least the improvement is palpable,' says a senior official
of the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> state government.
But even in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, life is far from normal. The paramilitary <ORGANIZATION>Border
Security Force</ORGANIZATION> patrols the streets and maintains sand-bagged bunkers. 'If
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> seems quiet it is because we have adjusted to life under
occupation, not that we have accepted it,' says <PERSON>Mr Abdul Ghani</PERSON>, a
representative of the <ORGANIZATION>All Party Freedom Conference</ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organisation
of Kashmiri political groups, some of which demand independence and others
union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
Moreover, while violence has declined in the Moslem heartland of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>
and the surrounding valley it has increased elsewhere - notably in the
southern districts with mixed Moslem/Hindu populations, including the hilly
<LOCATION>Doda</LOCATION> area, where militants recently assassinated two local leaders of the
right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party.
There is also a shift in the balance of power among the militants, with
groups linked to the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, the
pro-independence political organisation, losing ground to radical
pro-Pakistan Islamic groups.
They see the battle against <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> as a jihad - a holy war. Supplied with
arms from within <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and strengthened by the presence of small numbers
of Afghan and other battle-hardened Moslem fighters, these groups have
challenged the traditional dominance of the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>. Among these radicals
organisations is Harkat-ul-Ansar, which captured the two Britons.
The <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> seems unsure how to react. Some leaders want no compromises, others
appear to be putting out feelers to the Indian government, among them <PERSON>Mr
Yasin Malik</PERSON>, who was released from prison a month ago and promptly appealed
publicly for talks.
It is hard to see how the government can respond if the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> sticks to
demands for independence. But if it does nothing, it could miss a valuable
opportunity to create a point of contact with the militant movement. There
may not be much time - pro-Pakistan militants tried to shoot <PERSON>Mr Malik</PERSON>
<DATE>earlier this month</DATE> and could try again.
Delhi is aware that the longer the fighting goes on, the more the
pro-Pakistan Islamic groups are likely to gain ground, notably
Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, the biggest and most active organisation. <PERSON>Mr Rajesh
Pilot</PERSON>, the minister responsible for <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, has said repeatedly that he
wants to start a 'political process', meaning talks with Kashmiri groups,
followed by state-level elections and possibly an increase in autonomy from
<LOCATION>Delhi</LOCATION>.
'I feel there is more chance of the political process starting now than at
any time in the past two years,' he says.
But for most Kashmiri activists, hints of increased autonomy are worthless.
<PERSON>Mr Ghani</PERSON> says: 'If we don't leave <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, all this violence will have been
for nothing.'
Yesterday <PERSON>Mr Housego</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Pahalgam</LOCATION>, the area of the kidnapping, with
a group of journalists, in a move to encourage the kidnappers, who are
apparently nervous about the presence of Indian security forces, to release
their captives. If he succeeds it will at least remove one point of tension
in the troubled state.

   Indian paramilitary troops shot and
killed two innocent bystanders <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after Moslem militants
bombed a shopping center in this <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> city, witnesses said.
   The deaths were reported in the <LOCATION>Lal Chowk</LOCATION> area, where witnesses
said <ORGANIZATION>Border Security Force</ORGANIZATION> soldiers fired into a crowd after
militants campaigning for an independent <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> bombed the
three-story shopping complex.
   The victims, a Moslem and a Hindu, were businessmen who were
caught in the paramilitary gunfire, said witnesses and a man who
identified himself as the father of the Moslem.
   The deaths occurred in the <LOCATION>Lal Chowk</LOCATION> area of downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
The witnesses said Moslems campaigning for independence for the
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region bombed a three-story shopping center and that <ORGANIZATION>Border
Security Force</ORGANIZATION> soldiers opened fire on a mob.
   ``My son was closing the shop after the trouble started when
suddenly the <ORGANIZATION>BSF</ORGANIZATION> came and opened fire,'' said <PERSON>Mohammad Yusuf</PERSON>, whose
son, <PERSON>Shabir Yousuf</PERSON>, was reported killed.
   The government refused to either confirm or deny the deaths. The
state-run local radio said the shopping complex caught fire after a
cooking-gas cylinder exploded inside the building. The radio,
monitored in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, made no mention of paramilitary gunfire or
deaths.
   Also <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, at least six policemen and two bystanders were
injured when militants attacked a police bunker with a grenade in
downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, said witnesses who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In another part of the city, a bomb believed planted by
militants exploded in a post office. There were no injuries,
witnesses said.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, suspected militants blew up a truck, injuring
one person who was sleeping in the vehicle, witnesses said.
   At least 79 people have been killed since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> when Indian
authorities began a crackdown on the Moslem secessionist movement
in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, a part of Jammu-Kashmir state. Jammu-Kashmir is the
only Indian state with a majority Moslem population, and militants
support either independence or unity with neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,
which is mainly Moslem.
   Most of those killed have been shot for defying curfews.
   Srinagar is the largest city in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley and is the
<DATE>summer</DATE> capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. The city of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> is the
winter capital.
   In <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, about 200 Moslem state government employees
demonstrated <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> demanding that they be taken to <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>,
witnesses said. The demonstrators chanted anti-Indian slogans and
claimed that their lives were in danger in Hindu-dominated <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pakistan Accuses India of Sabre-Rattling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated press writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> dismissed
allegations of interference in <LOCATION>Indian-held Kashmir</LOCATION> as false and
untenable and accused <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> of ``whipping up a war psychosis and
indulging in sabre-rattling.''
   But the No. 2-ranking defense official said a hot-line between
senior military commanders of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> remains open and
the tense situation between the uneasy neighbors ``is gradually
moving toward normalcy.''
   The remarks by a foreign ministry spokesman and the deputy
defense minister Col. <PERSON>Ghulam Sarwar Cheema</PERSON> were in response to
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s latest charges <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is arming and training Moslem
separatists in Indian-controlled <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   ``No amount of sophistry can hide the fact that the insurrection
there is totally indigenous,'' the foreign ministry spokesman said.
``The root of the insurrection is the continued denial of the right
of self-determination of the people in Indian-occupied <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.''
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ``false
allegations and untenable assertions'' made <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by the Indian
government.
   <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> warned <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> it would not tolerate infringement of
its sovereignty in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, and a government spokesman refused to
rule out cross-border raids to eliminate suspected guerrilla camps.
   ``There will be no compromise on the measures necessary to
protect our integrity,'' the Indian government said in a statement.
   The foreign ministry spokesman said <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> regrets <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> ``has
persisted in its belicose statements after the foreign minister of
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> three days ago agreed with his <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
counterpart to exercise restraint.''
   More than 300 people have been killed in <LOCATION>Indian-held Kashmir</LOCATION>
since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> when Indian troops launched their latest and harshest
crackdown on Moslem separatists. Most were Moslem militants or
supporters shot by Indian troops during anti-India demonstrations
or while defying curfews.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> regularly accuses <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of arming, training and
financing the Kashmiri militants who want to secede from mostly
<LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION> and become an independent nation with neutral status.
Islamabad routinely denies the allegations, but says it supports
the Kashmiris right to self-determination.
   ``Instead of whipping up a war psychosis and indulging in
sabre-rattling, we hope <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will align its position to the
position of the international community, which stands for the
peaceful settlement of the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> dispute,'' the foreign ministry
spokesman said.
   As violence by Moslem militants escalated, both countries
reinforced their troops along the border and the contested <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
frontier. Each side has repeatedly said it does not want war but
has accused the other of fomenting a climate that could lead to
armed confrontation.
   <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> has repeatedly denied allegations of abuse and torture
by Indian troops in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought two wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, which is
divided by a cease-fire line monitored by the united nations.
   Kashmir was a princely state when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> were
partitioned along religious lines into separate nations. Most of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s residents were Moslems, but the ruler was a Hindu who
opted for union with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Pakistan moved into the northern third of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. The rest came
under Indian control as part of the state of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, the
only Moslem state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   ``<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> does not want another war and no saner elements _
either in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> _ will support war,'' <PERSON>Cheema</PERSON> told
reporters in <LOCATION>Rawalpindi</LOCATION>.
   ``The hot-line is still open between the senior military
commanders of the two countries and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is taking all steps to
reduce tension.''

   Hundreds of policemen waving rifles and
shouting ``Death to the Indian army'' refused to work <DATE>today</DATE>,
hampering government efforts to halt a violent Moslem separatist
movement in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   By mid-afternoon the strikers agreed to go back to work, a
police official and a strike leader said.
   At least 57 people, mostly Moslem militants, have been killed
since the government on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> launched a crackdown on militant
secessionists who want to become independent or merge with <LOCATION>Moslem
Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-dominated state in
predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>. About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the mountainous
northern state's 5 million people are Moslems.
   One death was reported today. A Moslem militant was killed when
paramilitary forces, fearing imminent attack, opened fire on a mob,
a senior police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The striking policemen, many in the brown uniforms of the state
constabulary, stopped police vehicles in the streets and urged
their colleagues to join the protest.
   Head Constable <PERSON>Mohammad Iqbal</PERSON>, one of the striking policemen,
said at least a third of the 40,000-man force had refused to report
for duty to protest the deployment of the Indian army to control
the agitation.
   ``This is the beginning of a new chapter in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,'' he said.
``We have been driven to the wall so we are reacting.''
   A total of about 1,000 policemen were seen in three separate
groups stopping cars driven by other policemen. One group of about
300 shouted: ``Death to the Indian army'' and ``Indians go back.''
   Hitendra <PERSON>Narain Saxena</PERSON>, the top police official in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>
state, said at mid-afternoon that the strikers had agreed to return
to work.
   One of the strike leaders, constable <PERSON>Mohammad Afzal</PERSON>, said the
strike had been postponed until <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Simmering tension between <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> police and federal troops
flared <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after a policeman was shot and killed by soldiers
enforcing an around-the-clock curfew in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. Officers in
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and a senior government spokesman in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> said the
killing was an accident.
   The striking policemen did not openly express support for the
escalating Moslem secessionist movement but one said: ``The
government calls us terrorists. If that is the case, why should we
fire at our own people ?''
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 300 protesting policeman marched to police headquarters.
   ``They (the government) call us Pakistani dogs. We are not ...
Let the Indian army and others know we will smash them if they
confront us,'' constable <PERSON>Mohammad Afzal</PERSON> told the crowd.
   Srinagar's police inspector general, <PERSON>Mohammad Azhar Nomani</PERSON>,
appealed to the men to return to duty and to come to him with any
grievances.
   Climbing atop his jeep, <PERSON>Nomani</PERSON> told the crowd: ``Don't get
agitated. Don't get provoked.''
   Afzal said the strikers had two demands: that the army and other
federal troops leave <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and the government re-instate a police
union dissolved in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   Authorities said federal troops were patrolling the city but, to
avoid confrontation, had been ordered not to leave their vehicles.
   An around-the-clock curfew confining people to their homes was
lifted temporarily <TIME>this morning</TIME>. It had been scheduled to be lifted
for four hours but was restored after just one hour because of the
police situation, a government official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> repeated charges that <LOCATION>Islamic Pakistan</LOCATION> was
fomenting trouble in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> again denied the charge.
   The two countries have a history of animosity and have fought
three wars, two of them over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, since they gained
independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>. The last war was in <DATE>1971</DATE>.
   A cease-fire line dividing <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> into Indian and Pakistani
sectors is monitored by <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> military observers.
   Nationwide, Moslems form <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million
peoeple and Hindus make up <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>.
   Srinagar, the largest city in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>, is the <DATE>summer</DATE>
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. The <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region is mostly
Moslem, while the southern <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> region is predominantly Hindu.

   The government lifted curfew in this
violence-torn <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> city for eight hours <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, giving
residents their longest taste of freedom in 10 days.
   At least one incident of violence was reported. Witnesses said
Moslem militants agitating for independence shot another Moslem,
claiming he was helping the Indian government in its crackdown on
the secessionist movement.
   The 23-year-old man, identified only as <PERSON>Kauser</PERSON>, was taken to a
hospital, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
His condition was not known.
   Other witnesses said about 5,000 people demonstrated during the
curfew relaxation to protest the alleged entry by paramilitary
policemen into a mosque. There was no violence, said the witnesses
who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, municipal workers removed hundreds of garbage cans
piled on streets and grocers sold fresh fruit for the first time
since the curfew was imposed in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> after clashes
between security forces and Moslem separatists.
   The Moslem militants demand either independence for <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> or
unity with <LOCATION>Moslem Pakistan</LOCATION>. Kashmir is a part of the state of
<LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, the only Indian state with a majority Moslem
population. Most Indians are Hindus.
   Srinagar, the state's summer capital and once a popular holiday
retreat, is the flashpoint of the Kashmiri movement.
   At least 72 people, mostly Moslem males, have been killed in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>. The state government said <DATE>Monday</DATE> there had
been no violence for the previous four days.
   The curfew was lifted for seven hours <DATE>Monday</DATE>, and that was
extended to eight hours <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> have fought two wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since they
were partitioned in <DATE>1947</DATE> upon gaining independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
The state is divided into Pakistani and Indian sectors by a
U.N.-monitored line of control.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> accuses neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of aiding the Kashmiri
militants, a charge that has been routinely denied. But <PERSON>Paskistan</PERSON>
says it supports the separatism, describing it as a movement for
self-determination.
   Pakistani Foreign Minister <PERSON>Sahabzada Yaqub Khan</PERSON> called <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to allow the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> dispute to be decided in a popular
vote.
   ``It is an outstanding issue which is to be resolved through a
plebiscite under the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> supervision,'' he said in a
nationally televised speech.
   ``The Indian government is trying to suppress the freedom
movement in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> through atrocities, resulting in deaths of
hundreds of Kashmiris and injuries to many more,'' <PERSON>Yaqub Khan</PERSON> said.
   The Indian crackdown began after Moslem militants stepped up
attacks on the government, burning state-owned buildings,
assassinating at least three intelligence agents and kidnapping the
daughter of a Cabinet minister in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   She was released after the government freed five jailed members
of the pro-independence <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>.

   Moslem militants on <DATE>Friday</DATE> kidnapped a
former member of the state legislature and Indian security forces
killed two Moslem demonstrators in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, news reports said.
   At least 269 people have been killed since a government
crackdown of Moslem separatists began in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE>. Most
of the victims were Moslem militants and their supporters who died
in clashes with the security forces or while defying curfew.
   Government troops intensified patrols after the former <ORGANIZATION>Congress
Party</ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, <PERSON>Amirullah Khan</PERSON>, was kidnapped by militants from his
home in <LOCATION>Shopian</LOCATION>, 37 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, a senior police
official said.
   Earlier this week, Moslem secessionists in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> abducted and
killed three hostages, including a prominent educator.
   The kidnappers were demanding the freedom of three of their
jailed comrades.
   Indian troops shot and killed two Moslem demonstrators at
<LOCATION>Bhaderwah</LOCATION>, 120 miles north of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, after they attempted to
lead a procession following Moslem <DATE>Friday</DATE> prayers, officials said.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, gunfire broke out along the tense frontier of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and one Indian soldier and five Pakistani troops were
killed, the New Delhi-based <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   In <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, a spokesman for <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s defense ministry said
he had no information of the shootout or any Pakistani casualties.
   ``There were no casualties on our side,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But he added: ``Firing along the cease-fire line is a normal
phenomena. It happens almost every day.''
   The unresolved fate of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> dates back to <DATE>1947</DATE> when Indian
and <LOCATION>Moslem Pakistan</LOCATION> were partitioned along religious lines. The old
princely state of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was predominantly Moslem, but its Hindu
ruler opted to join <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Today the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region is divided
between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> along a disputed frontier and has twice
been the cause of war between them.
   The Indian part of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> is the only state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> with
a Moslem majority. Nationwide, Hindus form <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
880 million people, while Moslems comprise <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of fomenting the secessionist
violence in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>.

   About 1,000 demonstrators tried to
surge across a cease-fire line into Indian-held <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
and state-run television said Indian forces opened fire, killing
six people.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> army patrols turned
back most of the protesters but that small groups slipped into
Indian-held territory. He said only three people were killed and
four wounded.
   The incident occurred near a small village of <LOCATION>Chaukoti</LOCATION>, about
100 miles north of <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>. It came as <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is cracking down on
Moslem militants conducting a violent secessionist campaign in
<LOCATION>Indian-held Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought two wars over the region. A
portion of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley is under Pakistani control, and an
840-mile cease-fire line monitored by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> separates
Pakistani and Indian troops.
   The <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region is predominantly Moslem, while <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is
mostly Hindu.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> again accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of aiding the Moslem
secessionist campaign centered in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, where a curfew
remained in effect <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> of ``ruthlessness'' in suppressing
the secessionists and of trying to divert international attention
by blaming <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> for what it has called an ``indiginous freedom
movement.''
   Pakistan television reported <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that Indian border guards
killed six people and arrested four. The television quoted the
prime minister of Pakistan-held <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sikander Hayat Khan</PERSON> in its
report.
   Press Trust of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> said Indian border guards fired in the air
first, then into the crowd when it continued to surge forward. The
Indian report, which quoted an unidentified Indian government
spokesman, did not mention casualties.
   The Pakistani ministry spokesman, who requested anonymity, said
his nation's soldiers repulsed all but a few small groups of the
demonstrators.
   ``We and the Indians are very clear that this is a local
trouble. It's very difficult to blame anyone, whether they fired in
self-defense or not,'' he said of the Indian border guards.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s High Commissioner to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>J.N. Dixit</PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> he had not heard of any disturbance along the
cease-fire line.
   ``This is news to me. I have no information,'' he said. ``I
would have heard at least one or two hours after it happened.''
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s state-run news agency said <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> asked <PERSON>Dixit</PERSON> ``to
convey a sense of shock to the Indian authorities in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and
also impress upon them the need to exercise utmost restraint in
dealing with armed civilians.''
   The demonstration at the border was one of many in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> marking the sixth anniversary of the death of <PERSON>Maqbool Butt</PERSON>,
a militant <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> leader. Butt was hanged for the <DATE>1965</DATE> murder of
an Indian intelligent agent in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Scores of people have been killed in a 2-month-old secessionist
uprising in <LOCATION>Indian-held Kashmir</LOCATION>. It has been led by Moslem
militants demanding separation from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and either independence
or union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Feb. 5</DATE>, Indian border guards killed a 12-year-old boy when
Pakistanis stormed the border near <LOCATION>Sialkot</LOCATION>, 125 miles southeast of
<LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>.

   Moslem militants defied curfews <DATE>Monday</DATE>
and fought soldiers for a second day in an outburst of secessionist
violence police say has killed 48 people and injured 400.
   Trouble began late <DATE>Saturday</DATE> when Moslems protested a police
crackdown. Moslem militants want to secede from predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu
India</LOCATION> and either make <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> independent or unite the northwestern
state with adjacent <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, an Islamic nation.
   Only a brief lull during heavy rain <DATE>Sunday</DATE> has interrupted the
violence. Police said militants and two policemen were killed
<DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and four protesters were shot to death in
neighboring <LOCATION>Anantnag</LOCATION>.
   ``The whole city is up in revolt,'' said <PERSON>Mohammad Nomani</PERSON>,
inspector-general of police in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. He estimated the number of
protesters at 1,500 and said they had at least 1,000 automatic
rifles and other weapons.
   A senior official in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> said privately the local
authorities had asked for more troops ``to back up the security
forces.'' Hundreds of soldiers have been sent to <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, a city
of 1 million that is the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of Jammu-Kashmir state on
the <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> border.
   At least 38 people, most of them protesters, were killed late
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Police said troopers opened fire on
curfew violators in at least six places <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION>Soora Medical Institute</ORGANIZATION> said at least 300 people
were wounded <DATE>Monday</DATE> when soldiers fired on a group of about 5,000.
``Most of them had injuries in the upper part of the body,'' one
doctor said, asking that his name not be used.
   Other doctors said all beds in the hospital were occupied and
the cafeteria was converted to provide more space. Thousands of
Moslems, defying the curfew, camped inside the hospital to donate
blood.
   Troops with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled streets in <LOCATION>Srinigar</LOCATION>.
The roa of army trucks and wailing of ambulance sirens could be
heard through the city.
   A near-mutiny of part of the state police force, which Moslems
dominate, occurred after a member was killed by gunfire from other
security forces.
   About 500 armed policemen stayed inside a police complex <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
refusing to join the crackdown, but an officer said they were
``pacified some hours later.''
   <PERSON>Mohammad Aslam</PERSON>, a state policeman, said the dead comrade was hit
by army fire and soldiers refused to deliver his body.
   The officer of state police, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the death and said the matter ``has apparently
been sorted out.''
   An around-the-clock curfew applies in <LOCATION>Srinigar</LOCATION>. Only soldiers
and military vehicles are permitted on the streets.
   Bands of 50 to 100 men formed throughout the day, however.
Teen-age boys shredded an Indian flag in front of soldiers while
people in a crowd screamed: ``You Indians go back!''
   Heavily armed soldiers guarded government buildings and bridges
over streams feeding <PERSON>Dal Lake</PERSON>, once a major tourist attraction.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Moslem followers of the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> have
attacked government buildings and patrols in their quest for
independence or union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Attacks increased after five jailed militants were freed last
month in exchange for the the kidnapped daughter of a Cabinet
minister.
   The old princely state of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was divided between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> when the subcontinent was partitioned in <DATE>1947</DATE> and became

fought three wars, the last in <DATE>1971</DATE>.
   Pakistan controls the western part of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and the eastern

   About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 5 million people are

   In <LOCATION>Muzaffarabad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON>Sikander Hyat Khan</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Pakistani Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> said he would launch a Moslem ``holy war'' unless
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> schedules a special session to address the
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> issue.
   Muzaffarabad is the capital of <LOCATION>Pakistani Kashmir</LOCATION> and near the
cease-fire that has divided the region between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
since <DATE>1947</DATE>, when the subcontinent became independent of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and
the two nations were created. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought four
wars, three of them specifically over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Most of the 5 million people in the <ORGANIZATION>Indian State of
Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> are Moslems. It is the only state with a Moslem
majority in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, a predominantly Hindu nation.
   ``If the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is not ready to play its role ... I will
tell them to go and fight,'' <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> warned of the people in <LOCATION>Pakistani
Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   He gave the world organization until <DATE>Feb. 17</DATE> to schedule a
special session. He said the deadline coincided with a scheduled
meeting all Pakistani political and religious parties in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Tariq Mahmood Butt</PERSON>, head of the student wing of the militant
<ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, said thousands of its members would
cross the frontier <DATE>Feb. 11</DATE> if the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> did not promise
action.
   Indian state television described the situation in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>
as ``by and large peaceful,'' but said at least nine people were
killed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when paramilitary troops fired on rioters in
<LOCATION>Handwara</LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   Troops in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> tightened restrictions under the 24-hour
curfew and prevented residents from opening windows, said witnesses
reached by telephone.
   From various vantage points in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, a city of 1 million,
only heavily armed troopers and an occasional government official
could be seen on the streets. Several people reached by telephone
from inside and outside <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> said they had not heard gunfire.
   Police sources in <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, winter capital of the state, said
militants hurled a gasoline bomb at soldiers during house searches
but no one was injured.
   The increased security coincided with the Moslem sabbath and
<ORGANIZATION>Republic Day</ORGANIZATION>, which major towns and cities in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> usually
celebrate with military parades.
   Moslem separatists in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, who want the state to be
either independent or joined to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, declared the national
holiday a ``black day.''
   Television showed <PERSON>Jameel Qureshi</PERSON>, adviser to the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>

   District magistrate <PERSON>Ghulam Abbas</PERSON> told about 20 journalists at
the Hotel Broadway: ``If you go out of the hotel, you can be shot,
and if we find out you have gone out, you can be imprisoned for six
months.''
   Soldiers with submachine guns were posted around the hotel,
which is about a mile from downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. The door leading to
the roof of the five-story building was locked and telephone
service was halted after the warning by <PERSON>Abbas</PERSON>.
   Seven journalists returned to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> on a commercial flight
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. They said police took them to the <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>
airport by a circuitous route one officer said was designed to
skirt trouble. Police at the airport confiscated dozens of rolls of
film, they said.
   The Moslem separatist campaign is as old as the two nations, but
has escalated in recent weeks.
   Srinagar and surrounding towns were put under 24-hour curfew

   Describing the clashes as ``a major border incident,'' <ORGANIZATION>United
News of India</ORGANIZATION> said that according to unconfirmed reports at least
10 Pakistani soldiers were killed and five wounded in the clashes.
   There was no official confirmation on casualties.
   ``It is very difficult to say if there were casualties. We are,
however, checking,'' said an Indian government spokesman, <ORGANIZATION>Ram Mohan
Rao</ORGANIZATION>.
   The clashes reportedly occurred in the <LOCATION>Kupwara</LOCATION> sector of the
disputed frontier, about 60 miles northeast of the <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the
capital of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Earlier, Pakistani troops fired heavy artillery with explosive
and incendiary shells at Indian border posts in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir
state</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> said.
   ``Exchange of small arms fire is a frequent occurrence on the
border, but use of heavy artillery and incendiary ammunition is
something new,'' <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Pakistani defense ministry</ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied the
reported incident.
   ``There is absolutely no truth in the report of Pakistanis
firing (at) Indian troops,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   But in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, an Indian defense ministry official,
requesting anonymity, said all troops were put on alert along the
border after the incident.
   Indian defense officials in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> called the incident
``serious.'' The officials, who also asked not to be identified,
said some of the Pakistani shells landed a half-mile inside Indian
territory.
   Rao said the Indian government was waiting to receive more
details about the border incident.
   ``Probably <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> wants to make a little more noise, but we
have taken appropriate defensive measures,'' <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> said. He refused
to elaborate on the measures.
   A week ago, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> accused Indian troops of using heavy
artillery, anti-tank guns and mortars in an attempt to capture a
border outpost in Pakistan-controlled <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. At the time, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
denied the claim.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought three wars since gaining
independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>. Two of the wars were fought over
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, a former principality claimed by both countries.
   The present border is a cease-fire line drawn in <DATE>1972</DATE> that
separates <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only Moslem-majority state, from
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s Azad (Free) <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region.
   In another sign of escalating tension, the prime minister of
Pakistan-held <PERSON>Azad Kashmir</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> ordered mandatory military
training for all males.
   ``<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> wants to attack. ... Responsibility for the whole of the
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> nation is on my shoulders,'' the prime minister, <PERSON>Mumtaz
Rathore</PERSON>, told about 3,000 cheering supporters in the <LOCATION>Azad Kashmir</LOCATION>
capital of Muzzaffarabad.
   ``From this day onward my mission will be the liberation of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,'' he said.
   A senior aide to <PERSON>Rathore</PERSON>, requesting anonymity, said military
training would also be given to Moslem militants spearheading the
secessionist uprising in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Jammu-Kashmir state.
   The aide said <PERSON>Rathore</PERSON> sought no prior approval from the national
governmet in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> before announcing the compulsory military
training.
   Pakistan-held <PERSON>Azad Kashmir</PERSON> is relatively autonomous, but the
federal government is responsible for the region's defense,
diplomacy and finances.
   Analysts say <PERSON>Rathore</PERSON>'s plans to provide military training for
Kashmiris could cause a confrontation with the new right-wing
government that succeeded ousted Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of providing arms and training to
Moslem militants in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, an Islamic state, has
denied the allegation, but says it supports the Kashmiri people's
right to self-determination.
   At least 1,034 people have been killed in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> since
<LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> launched a crackdown on the Moslem secessionist movement
on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>.
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, both countries massed their armies along the cease-fire
line in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> as war fears escalated.
   The crisis was averted largely due to diplomatic intervention by
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
   Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of
houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made
``cashmere,'' has become a war zone of separatism and religious
enmity.
   Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil
servants around <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> in these dangerous days, as soldiers and
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem
separatists in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>.
   Intelligence officer <PERSON>M.K. Kaul</PERSON> commands one of the jeeps. At the
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned
to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: ``Check
your weapons. Be ready to fire.''
   Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right
hand. ``These are bad days,'' he murmured. ``These die-hard
terrorists can attack from anywhere.
   To his men, he said: ``Shoot them if you see them.''
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME>
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in
sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main
intersections.
   A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> state government said the
situation was peaceful and ``absolutely normal'' in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the
state's largest city.
   At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began
<DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and
buildings. Most of the dead have been Moslem militants shot by
Indian troops.
   ``We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any
popular movement,'' said <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, the
only state in predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION> with a Moslem majority.
   ``We are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to
create a law and order problem,'' said <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, a Hindu with a
reputation for toughness.
   Other officials in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> say privately the situation is
critical, perhaps the most serious threat <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has faced in 42
years of independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   ``It looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist
with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become
independent,'' a state police officer said.
   Kashmir was a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> relinquished colonial rule on <DATE>Aug. 15, 1947</DATE>, and the
subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The Hindu king opted to join <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, not <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, and the
dispute over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> has exacerbated relations since.
   Pakistan took the western part of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> the eastern.
Each accused the other of forcible occupation.
   They have fought wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and the border question
remains unresolved. U.N. observers are stationed on the truce line
and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire.
   Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to
the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION> since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, but reports from various sources
indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have
been deployed.
   It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilts the
sectarian scale in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state.
   Of the state's nearly 6 million people, <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> are Moslems
and <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> area.
   Srinagar has 150 mosques. ``This is the best breeding ground for
Moslem fundamentalism,'' said a federal official who helps
coordinate the new security measures.
   Nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to
prayer _ and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their
faith and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   ``The residents are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermons
and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the
most sacred duty of every Moslem,'' the federal official said, on
condition of anonymity.
   Electricity was cut off in the city <DATE>Friday</DATE>, which was both the
Moslem sabbath and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s national <ORGANIZATION>Republic Day</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating
because militants connected them to car batteries.
   Intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage
because the separatists are not united.
   The most powerful group is the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>,
but there are several others, including the <ORGANIZATION>Allah Tigers</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. The Pakistanis deny it.
   Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is
economic development, not separatism.
   ``The people do not want violence or the so-called independent
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,'' he said. ``The need of the hour is development. Let more
tourists come. Let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come
up.''
   As he spoke, military officers waited in the next room to
discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist
brochures call <ORGANIZATION>Paradise</ORGANIZATION>.
   Right now, <ORGANIZATION>Paradise</ORGANIZATION> looks lost, at least temporarily.

<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people chanting
``Freedom! Freedom!'' trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
to campaign for the secession of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, witnesses and
pro-separatist activists said.
   At least three people died in two separate incidents on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign,
witnesses said.
   The deaths brought to 109 the number of people killed since <DATE>Jan.
20</DATE> in the latest round of the secessionist violence and the
government crackdown.
   Meanwhile, the president of the <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> state of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> said
in an interview <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling
arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for
independence from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   President <PERSON>Abdul Qayyum</PERSON>, speaking to a reporter who traveled to
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, said the people of his state also had been
sheltering insurgents since <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> launched the military crackdown
in its state of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> last month.
   In <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, the 600-year-old shrine of <PERSON>Shiekh Nuruddin
Wali</PERSON> at <PERSON>Charift Sharief</PERSON>, 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, became a
sea of humanity as Moslem men, women and children poured in from
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and nearby towns.
   Vehicles stopped 10 miles from the shrine as people thronged the
roads, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Supporters of the militants said they went to the shrine to seek
the saint's blessings to ``liberate'' Kashmir from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of Jammu-Kashmir state,
residents were told by Moslem militants to put their clocks back by
30 minutes to correspond with the <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> standard time.
   The militants, led by the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, are
demanding either independence for <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>, the only Indian
state dominated by Moslems.
   Groups of young Moslem men sat at street corners, stopping
passers-by and telling them to adjust their watches. At least six
fights broke out when people refused to comply, said witnesses who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the
<ORGANIZATION>United Nations Military Observers Group</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, demanding a
plebiscite in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, police said. Witnesses claimed that more
than 600,000 people took part.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> group is posted to maintain a cease-fire line drawn
between Indian- and Pakistani-held <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> after a 1948-49 war over
the region.
   Residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said security
forces fatally shot two men shouting anti-Indian slogans at <LOCATION>Khrew</LOCATION>,
15 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, suspected Moslem militants shot and killed <PERSON>Ashok
Kumar</PERSON>, a Hindu government employee, witnesses said, also speaking
on condition of anonymity. Kumar was suspected to be a police
informer.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> routinely accuses <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of arming, training and
supporting the militants. The government in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> denies the
charge but says the Kashmiri people have a right to
self-determination.
   An AP reporter who traveled to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> said
state-run banks in the region have begun collections to help the
uprising. Signs in dozens of banks called for donations for ``a
holy war against <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Naveed Hussain</PERSON>, a government spokesman in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,
said in an interview that <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> had been raised in a week and that
the money would be used to train Kashmiri militia groups in
territory held by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Kashmir was divided between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> after the two
countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial
rule in <DATE>1947</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Moslem militants ambushed a government
patrol in the heart of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> while curfew was lifted briefly
today, and one civilian was killed when the troops returned fire, a
senior officer said.
   The militants claimed they killed 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION>Border
Security Force</ORGANIZATION>, but a senior officer of the paramilitary force said
only two of his men were wounded and none were killed.
   The officer said the ambush in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> was one of the boldest
and best organized ever carried out in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> city, center of
the pro-independence movement by Moslems who want to secede from
predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attackers fired Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles from three directions,
using at least 100 rounds of ammunition.
   The attack occurred on the main shopping street in the heart of
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. The curfew, which had been in effect since <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>, was lifted for the first time for a few hours <DATE>early today</DATE>
to enable thousands of stranded villagers to return home.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying it was to avenge the killing of 49 Moslem
demonstrators by army and paramilitary troops last <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``We have killed 12 Indian soldiers. We carried out the
operation this morning to take revenge for the deaths of our Moslem
brothers who were killed by the army,'' a telephone caller told a
local journalist.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Border Security Force</ORGANIZATION> officer said one civilian was killed
and a suspected militant was seriously wounded when the ambushed
troops returned fire.
   About 150,000 people _ many of whom had participated in a
massive anti-India demonstration on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> _ were stranded by the
curfew, the intelligence officers said on condition of anonymity.
   An estimated one million people streamed through <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> to demand <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s independence from predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu
India</LOCATION>. It was the largest pro-independence demonstration ever
staged in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>.
   The government said its troops opened fire in self-defense.
Witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the
marchers had tried to grab the weapons of soldiers and paramilitary
police.
   The killings by government troops prompted rebukes from
neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, an Islamic nation, and appeals for restraint
from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Gov. <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, a federally appointed Hindu who is the top
administrator of Jammu-Kashmir state, met army and security
officials during the <DATE>weekend</DATE> and was to receive a delegation of
federal officials from <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> today, sources said.
   Jagmohan, who uses only one name, said in an interview <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
the government was prepared to call new state elections within six
months. But this seemed unlikely to appease the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> and other militant groups who say they will be
satisfied by nothing less than independence.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
The southern <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> region of the state is mostly Hindu, while the
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region that includes <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> is predominantly Moslem.
   Spurred in part by the Hindu ruler of the old princely state of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, the valley acceded to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> rather than join <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. The
two countries went to war in <DATE>1949</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE> over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, but the
region still remains divided by a cease-fire line separating Indian
and Pakistani troops.
   Kashmiri secessionists initially sought to join <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, but in
the past year the militants have been pressing for full
independence.
   Jammu-Kashmir's population of <MONEY>6 million</MONEY> is <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> Moslem and
<PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> Hindu with small minorities of Buddhists, Sikhs and
Christians. Nationwide, Hindus account for <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
880 million people, while Moslems comprise <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>.

<TEXT>
Two Britons, including the 16-year-old son of a former <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>
correspondent, have been kidnapped in <LOCATION>Indian-held Kashmir</LOCATION> by Moslem
militants demanding the release of three jailed guerrillas.
The gunmen set upon <PERSON>Mr David Housego</PERSON>, former <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> correspondent of the
<ORGANIZATION>FT</ORGANIZATION> and now a Delhi-based businessman, his wife <PERSON>Jenny</PERSON> and younger son Kim as
they were trekking on <DATE>Monday</DATE> with <PERSON>Mr David Mackie</PERSON>, a British video director.
<PERSON>Kim Housego</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Mackie</PERSON>, who is 36, were abducted. Mr and <PERSON>Mrs Housego</PERSON>
yesterday returned to <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of the Indian state of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, and contacted the authorities.
The Indian army was alerted and photographs of the captives distributed.
However, there was no indication of any contact between the Indian
authorities and the militants.
<PERSON>Mr Housego</PERSON> said the captors appeared to be mostly Pathans who spoke both
<LOCATION>Pashto</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Urdu</LOCATION>, suggesting that at least some of them were from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
He was given a note in <LOCATION>Urdu</LOCATION> demanding the release of three men who are known
to be members of the Harkatul Ansar militant group, including its leader, <PERSON>Mr
Mohammed Sajjad</PERSON>. All are in Indian custody.
Some Pathans, who live in north-western <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, have
joined Kashmiri Moslems in their rebellion against Indian rule in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,
where most of the population are Moslems. Thousands of people, including
many civilians, have died in fighting over the past four years.
The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION>, which was last night monitoring the situation, said the
<ORGANIZATION>British High Commission</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Delhi</LOCATION> was planning to send an official to
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Housego</PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION>FT</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> to establish a Delhi-based textile
manufacturing and export business.

  [Text] In the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>, efforts are on to secure 
safe release of militants near <LOCATION>Pahalgam</LOCATION> two days ago. Three 
other members of the trekking team have returned to <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. A 
number of organizations have appealed to the militants to 
release the innocent trekkers. 
  Two Pakistan-trained militants were killed in <LOCATION>Kupwara 
District</LOCATION> in an encounter with the security force. Four 
militants were arrested and a large quantity of arms and 
ammunition was recovered. 
  [<LOCATION>Hong Kong AFP</LOCATION> in English at <DATE>1307</DATE> GMT on <DATE>9 Jun 94</DATE> in a 
similar report adds the following: "Kashmiri separatist groups 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> demanded the immediate release of two British hikers 
kidnapped by Moslem militants while trekking in the <LOCATION>Himalayas</LOCATION>. 
  ["The Indian authorities, meanwhile, rejected the demand by 
the Moslem rebels who snatched the two British nationals that 
three of their imprisoned leaders be freed in exchange for the 
hostages. 
  ["<PERSON>David Mackie</PERSON>, 36, a video producer from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Kim 
Housego</PERSON>, 16, the son of the former <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> correspondent 
in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, were abducted in the Himalayan foothills southeast 
of here by three heavily-armed men claiming to be members of the 
militant outfit Harkat-ul-Ansar or <ORGANIZATION>Movement of Friends</ORGANIZATION>. 
  ["In a note left for <PERSON>Kim Housego</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>David</PERSON>, the 
kidnappers demanded the release of three of the group's leaders 
from Indian jails and warned foreign tourists to stay out of 
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. 
  ["`Their release is not possible,' a government official 
told 
<ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION>. 
  ["The latest kidnapping was forcefully condemned by the two 
most powerful Kashmiri Moslem militant groups, the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>) which seeks independence for 
<ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Pakistan <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION>. 
  ["`Such moves help <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> at the international level,' the 
<ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> said in an unconditional appeal for the release of the 
Britons. 
  ["The <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION>, or Party of Moslem Warriors, called 
on the kidnappers to immediately release the Britons in the 
interests of the Kashmiri separatist movement. 
  ["`We have offered our help to identify these people,' said 
<PERSON>Majid Jehangir</PERSON>, the second-ranking leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul 
Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION>, which helped rescue a Portuguese engineer who was 
kidnapped by a group opposed to a power project in the state two 
years ago. 
  ["Both the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> raised the 
possibility that the kidnapping may be the handiwork of Indian 
agents seeking to discredit the secessionist movement. 
  ["In a statement released here <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the 
Harkat-ul-Ansar 
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and said it was done 
to attract world attention to human rights abuses by Indian 
troops battling the insurgency. 
  ["The Jamiat-ul-Islami, the Hizb's political wing, denounced 
the abduction by the group and appealed for the release of the 
two `guests' without `delay or harm.' 
  ["`It is unwise to commit such a human rights violation and 
then suggest that it would help focus world attention on gross 
rights abuses by Indian security forces,' said Jamiat leader 
<PERSON>Ghulam Mohammed Bhat</PERSON>."]

militants seeking independence for <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>.
   Shah, 62, returned to Bijbiara a week ago because of his concern
for the well-being of a son who had stayed behind, according to the
neighbors who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sayeed's daughter, <PERSON>Rubaiya</PERSON>, was kidnapped by Moslem separatists
in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE> and held hostage for six days until the
government freed five members of the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for <ORGANIZATION>Shah</ORGANIZATION>'s slaying.
   Neighbors said he was killed by militants who came to his house
about <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. A similar account was given by a state police
spokesman in <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, the state's winter capital.
   A retired state tax officer, <PERSON>Shah</PERSON> was especially close to Sayeed,
one of the most prominent Moslems in Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON>'s
government.
   The kidnapping of Sayeed's daughter shortly after <PERSON>Singh</PERSON> took
office spurred new government tactics in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, culminating in a
harsh military crackdown on the escalating Moslem separatist
movement.
   At least 504 people have been killed in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since the
crackdown started <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>. The majority have been Moslem militants
and their supporters slain by Indian security forces.
   The crackdown has sparked tensions between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,
which has supported its fellow Moslems in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION> with
a Moslem majority. About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the 6 million inhabitants are
Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems make up only <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880
million people, while Hindus account for <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>.

  [Text] In the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley, efforts are on to secure 
safe release of [words missing] militants near <LOCATION>Pahalgam</LOCATION> two days 
ago. Three other members of the trekking team have returned to 
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. A number of organizations have appealed to the 
militants to release the innocent trekkers. 
  Two Pakistan-trained militants were killed in <LOCATION>Kupwara 
District</LOCATION> in an encounter with the security force. Four 
militants were arrested and a large quantity of arms and 
ammunition was recovered. 
  [<LOCATION>Hong Kong AFP</LOCATION> in English at <DATE>1307</DATE> GMT on <DATE>9 Jun 94</DATE> in a 
report 
adds the following: "Kashmiri separatist groups <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 
demanded the immediate release of two British hikers kidnapped 
by Moslem militants while trekking in the <LOCATION>Himalayas</LOCATION>. 
  'The Indian authorities, meanwhile, rejected the demand by 
the Moslem rebels who snatched the two British nationals that 
three of their imprisoned leaders be freed in exchange for the 
hostages. 
  '<PERSON>David Mackie</PERSON>, 36, a video producer from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Kim 
Housego</PERSON>, 16, the son of the former <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> correspondent 
in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, were abducted in the Himalayan foothills southeast 
of here by three heavily-armed men claiming to be members of the 
militant outfit Harkat-ul-Ansar or <ORGANIZATION>Movement of Friends</ORGANIZATION>. 
  'In a note left for <PERSON>Kim Housego</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>David</PERSON>, the 
kidnappers demanded the release of three of the group's leaders 
from Indian jails and warned foreign tourists to stay out of 
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. 
  "Their release is not possible," a government official told 
<ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION>. 
  The latest kidnapping was forcefully condemned by the two 
most powerful Kashmiri Moslem militant groups, the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>) which seeks independence for 
<ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Pakistan <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "Such moves help <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> at the international level," the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> 
said in an unconditional appeal for the release of the Britons. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION>, or Party of Moslem Warriors, called 
on 
the kidnappers to immediately release the Britons in the 
interests of the Kashmiri separatist movement. 
  "We have offered our help to identify these people," said 
<PERSON>Majid Jehangir</PERSON>, the second-ranking leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul 
Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION>, which helped rescue a Portuguese engineer who was 
kidnapped by a group opposed to a power project in the state two 
years ago. 
  Both the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> raised the 
possibility that the kidnapping may be the handiwork of Indian 
agents seeking to discredit the secessionist movement. 
  In a statement released here <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the Harkat-ul-Ansar 
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and said it was done 
to attract world attention to human rights abuses by Indian 
troops battling the insurgency. 
  The Jamiat-ul-Islami, the Hizb's political wing, denounced 
the abduction by the group and appealed for the release of the 
two "guests" without "delay or harm." 
  "It is unwise to commit such a human rights violation and 
then suggest that it would help focus world attention on gross 
rights abuses by Indian security forces," said Jamiat leader 
<PERSON>Ghulam Mohammed Bhat</PERSON>.']

   Troops arrested suspected Moslem
militants and searched houses today as they continued a weeklong
crackdown on secessionist violence in <LOCATION>Indian-held Kashmir</LOCATION> that has
killed more than 70 people.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard late <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, but there was no
word of new casualties.
   A senior police official said soldiers in the northern Indian
city of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> were still looking for ``die-hard terrorists'' who
slipped in despite a tough, 24-hour curfew.
   At least 72 people, mostly curfew-defying protesters, have been
killed since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and surrounding towns. The
separatists want to secede from predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION> and
establish an independent Kashmiri nation or join the neighboring
Islamic country of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   ``The situation is well under control,'' said <PERSON>Jitendra Narain
Saxena</PERSON>, the top police official in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state, by
telephone. ``We have enforced very strict curfew because we have
information that die-hard terrorists have infiltrated into
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.''
   As a result of search operations <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and early today
``some arrests'' have been made, <PERSON>Saxena</PERSON> said. He refused to give
any numbers.
   A virtual news blackout was imposed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when local
officials rescinded journalists' curfew passes and warned them that
they risked arrest or getting shot if they tried to leave their
hotel. Most communication with the hotel was cut off at the same
time.
   On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, while most of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> celebrated the 40th anniversary
of the constitution that marked the founding of the Indian
Republic, <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> resembled a ghost town with only military
patrols and a few officials allowed on the streets.
   A gasoline bomb was thrown at soldiers, but no one was injured,
according to police sources in <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, the winter capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Across the frontier, the leader of Pakistan-held <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
threatened <DATE>Friday</DATE> to launch a jihad, or Islamic holy war, unless
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> calls a special session on <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> before <DATE>Feb.
17</DATE>.
   Sikander <PERSON>Hyat Khan</PERSON> demanded the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> take action on
its <DATE>1948</DATE> resolution calling for Kashmiris to vote on whether they
want independence or union with either <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   The plebiscite was never held, and the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> question has
simmered for four decades. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have gone to war
twice over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since they became independent from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1947</DATE>.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> with a Moslem majority.
Moslems make up <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 5 million people, but
nationwide they form only <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the population of 880
million.

   Moslem militants fighting for an
independent nation burned Indian flags on the streets during a
two-hour break in a week-old curfew in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>,
witnesses said.
   Hundreds of soldiers and paramilitary policemen patrolled
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and adjoining towns.
   At least 72 people, mostly curfew violators, have been killed
since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, when troops and police officers fanned out in the
northern valley to counter militants demanding secession of
predominantly Moslem Kashmir from mostly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>.
   The government repeated charges that neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> was
fomenting the trouble and appealed to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and several
other countries to ensure the situation does not get out of hand.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has denied fueling the secessionist movement.
   Journalists were forbidden from going on the streets of
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, and a district
judge ordered the expulsion of five foreign correspondents, from
<ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Science Monitor</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United Press
International</ORGANIZATION>, and the French news agency <ORGANIZATION>Agence France-Presse</ORGANIZATION>.
   District Magistrate <PERSON>Ghulam Abbas</PERSON> said the presence of the
reporters and photographers ``was adjudged prejudicial to the
security of the state.''
   There were no sounds of gunfire in the city <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   An official spokesman in <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION>, the winter capital of the state,
said the situation there ``was under control.''
   Authorities relaxed the curfew in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> for <DATE>two hours
Saturday</DATE>, but few people went outside because it was raining.
Residents were not informed of the break until a radio announcement
about 45 minutes before the break was scheduled to end.
   Groups of young Moslem men gathered at two places in the city
and burned Indian flags, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The last break in the round-the-clock curfew was <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The
curfew was abruptly imposed again after police said Moslem
militants killed four air force officers on the outskirts of the
city.
   ``We have enforced a very strict curfew because we have
information that die-hard terrorists have infiltrated into
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jitendra Narain Saxena</PERSON>, the state's top police
official.
   <PERSON>Saxena</PERSON> said some arrests were made <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and early
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. He refused to give any numbers.
   The last known casualties in the region occurred <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when
paramilitary troops opened fire on rioting militants in <LOCATION>Handwara</LOCATION>,
40 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   An official spokesman said 11 people were killed and 14 injured.
   Kashmir has been a disputed area since <DATE>1947</DATE> when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> gained independence after the partition of British-ruled
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Some of the militants want <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> to unify with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The two countries have fought three wars, two of them over
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. The region is divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   The leaders of Pakistan-held <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> have threatened to stage an
Islamic holy war unless the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> calls a special session
on <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> before <DATE>Feb. 17</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Sikander Hyat Khan</PERSON>, prime minister of Pakistan-controlled
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, demanded the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> take action on its <DATE>1948</DATE>
resolution calling for Kashmiris to vote on whether they want
independence or union with either <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   The vote was never held.
   The Moslem separatist movement escalated in recent weeks and
culminated with the government crackdown last week. The crackdown
was accompanied by the withdrawal of curfew passes to journalists
and the snapping of many telephone and telex lines to <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   Jammu-Kashmir state, which consists of mostly Moslem Kashmir and
mostly <PERSON>Hindu Jammu</PERSON>, is the only state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> with a Moslem
majority. Moslems make up <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 5 million

   Indian border guards shot and killed two
Pakistani ``intruders'' <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after about 100 people crossed
into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Jammu-Kashmir state from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, government
officials said.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, a government spokesman told <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> the crossing
``can have tragic consequences.'' The spokesman, who cannot be
identified under briefing regulations, did not elaborate.
   Officials in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s main city and the center of a
Moslem separatist campaign, said 100 Pakistani civilians shouting
anti-Indian slogans headed into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
people were warned to turn back. When they ignored the warning and
came about 200 yards inside Indian territory, border guards opened
fire and killed two people, the officials said.
   The border incident was the fourth since Moslem militants
intensified their secessionist campaign in Indian-governed <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   The most serious incident occurred <DATE>Feb. 5</DATE> when about 4,000
Pakistani civilians attempted to cross the border to support their
Moslem brethren in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. Indian troops opened fire and killed at
least four people.
   At least 201 people have died in Moslem separatist violence in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since the secessionist campaign flared <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-dominated state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, which
is mostly Hindu.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> also claims the state because of its predominantly
Moslem population and has twice gone to war with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> over the
region. Pakistan now controls the western part of the state, while

   Moslem separatists freed the daughter of
a Cabinet minister <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after the government released five of
their jailed comrades, officials said.
   Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of Home Minister <PERSON>Mufti Mohammad Sayeed</PERSON>,
was taken to a friend's home in <TIME>this northern city two hours after</TIME>
the militants were freed downtown, police said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Sayeed</PERSON>, 22, was flown to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> later and met at the
airport by her father, mother, brother and sister. She hugged her
father, then buried her face on his shoulder and cried.
   Young Moslem men celebrated the militants' release by shooting
off firecrackers in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
northernmost state of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   About 3,000 people shouted anti-India slogans and waved the
national flag of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, which has fought three wars with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since both nations gained independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1947</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Sayeed</PERSON> was abducted at gunpoint <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> as she was going home
from her job at a <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> hospital.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, which demands secession from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
of the mainly Moslem state from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, claimed responsibility for
the abduction. Its chairman said the group might try other
kidnappings in its campaign against the Hindu-dominated government.
   The kidnappers had threatened to kill <PERSON>Ms. Sayeed</PERSON> if their
colleagues were not freed.
   Sayeed is the first Moslem to head the <ORGANIZATION>Home Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, which is
in charge of internal security. The appointment was seen as part of
Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON>'s efforts to appease Moslems, who bore
the brunt of Hindu-Moslem riots that claimed more than 300 lives
this <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   The kidnapping was the first crisis for Singh, a Hindu who took
office <DATE>Dec. 2</DATE>.
   Earlier <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Sayeed</LOCATION>, unshaven and wrapped in a brown
shawl, said solving the militant campaign in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> was the
government's ``No. 1 priority program.''
   ``There is a complete collapse of law and order in the state,''
he said.
   The freed militants include <PERSON>Abdul Hamid Sheikh</PERSON>, a top leader of
the <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>. Sheikh, who was wounded in a clash
with police last month and arrested, was taken by ambulance from a
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> hospital and handed over to his organization, the
officials said.
   The other four were identified as <PERSON>Noor Homammad Kalwal</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mohammad
Altaf Bhat</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sher Khan Azad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Javed Ahmed Zargar</PERSON>. All had been
arrested on suspicion of subversive activities during the past year
but no charges have been filed.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, formed in <DATE>1965</DATE>, wants
<LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only Moslem-majority state, to become
independent or part of predominantly Moslem <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The chairman of the group, <PERSON>Amanullah Khan</PERSON>, said in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> that
he hoped the Indian government would ``adopt a similar wise
attitude toward the future of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> ... instead of waiting until
it is shunted out and humiliated by Kashmiri freedom fighters.''
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> had denounced the kidnapping as contrary to Islamic
precepts, presumably referring to Islamic tradition, which imposes
rigid guidelines on the treatment of women.
   Khan dismissed the criticism, saying Indian paramilitary troops
``have killed 300 of our people in the <DATE>last one and a half years</DATE>,
including women.''
   Asked if his militant organization would try other kidnappings
as part of its secession campaign, Khan replied: ``It depends on
how the Indian government behaves.''
   Moslems make up <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 5 million peoeple but
only about <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the country's 880 million people. Hindus
account for about <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT>.
   Kashmir is claimed by both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining
independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>. A cease-fire line monitored by
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> separates the state into Indian and Pakistani
territory.

   Moslem separatists on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> blew up a
bus and hurled bombs at an Indian paramilitary patrol, a government
building and the home of a state lawmaker in a new series of
attacks in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s largest city.
   No one was killed in the attacks, the latest violence since
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> launched a crackdown <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> on the groups that want the
northern region bordering <LOCATION>Moslem Pakistan</LOCATION> to secede from
predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>. At least 76 people have died since then.
   Also <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, police said suspected Sikh militants killed nine
people over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> in attacks on two buses in the northern
state of <LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION>. Sikh extremists are fighting to make an
independent nation out of the rich farming state, which borders
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> farther south.
   Political leaders in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> demanded that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> end the
crackdown in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and declared <DATE>Monday</DATE> a national holiday to show
support for the Moslem militants.
   The attacks in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> came <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, after authorities
lifted a curfew for 12 hours.
   One woman was injured when a bomb exploded on an empty bus as
passengers were gathering to board, witnesses and a police said.
The bomb destroyed the vehicle and damaged three nearby shops.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said their group was responsible for the
attacks, which included bombs thrown at a paramiliary patrol, at a
government office, the home of a state legislator, and a school.
   There were no further reports of injuries.
   Shops on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> stayed shut, respecting a strike call by the
Islamic militant.
   Srinagar, a city of 1 million, is the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of
<LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state, which has been claimed by both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
Moslem <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> since the two nations were partitioned along
religious lines upon attaining independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   The two traditionally hostile neighbors went to war in <DATE>1948</DATE> and
<DATE>1965</DATE> over the territory.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has repeatedly charged <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> with fomenting the trouble
on its side of the cease-fire line, a charge routinely dismissed by
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   In the Pakistani capital of <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, the demand for an end to
the Indian crackdown came in a rare agreement between governing and
opposition parties.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s combined opposition of right-wing, centrist and
religious parties called for a nationwide strike on <DATE>Monday</DATE> in
support of the separatists.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON>'s government replied by declaring
<DATE>Monday</DATE> a holiday in a show of solidarity with them.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
It is composed of the predominantly Hindu southern <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> region and
the mostly Moslem northern <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> sector.
   A western section of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is controlled by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> along a
cease-fire line where Indian and Pakistani troops face each other,
sometimes at distances of only a few hundred yards.
   Nationally, Hindus comprise <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million
people, but they make up only <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>'s 5

   Both say they do not want war in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> are preparing their armies to turn
the lush, rugged region into a battleground for the third time
since <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   An estimated 240,000 Indian soldiers, supported by armor and
aircraft, are in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. A provocation or misunderstanding arising
from the Moslem insurgency in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s part of the region could send
them into action.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought over the mountains and valleys of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> carved the subcontinent into two nations,

independence 43 years ago.
   On the Indian side of the 41-year-old truce line, nearly 200
people have been killed since <DATE>late January</DATE> in battles between
Kashmiri Moslem secessionists and Indian troops.
   ``Militarily speaking, it is a near-war scenario; both sides are
ready,'' a retired Indian infantry officer in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The irony of the situation is
that both sides ... claim day after day that they do not want war.''
   In <LOCATION>Baramulla</LOCATION>, a major Indian army base and the last town before
the cease-fire line, convoys of army trucks and artillery roll
toward the frontier 25 miles away. Soldiers in battle fatigues
practice battle tactics, firing live rounds at mock targets.
   ``The military activity you see here is more or less normal,''
<PERSON>Chewang Phunsog</PERSON>, chief civilian administrator of the strategic
border districts <LOCATION>Baramulla</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kupwara</LOCATION>, said in an interview.
   ``I do not know if a war is on the cards, but if we are drawn
into it, the other side will not find us lacking,'' he said.
   In <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, a spokesman for <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said a
buildup of Indian paramilitary forces had occurred along the
frontier.
   ``We think it is primarily for internal security, but it can
always be used once it's there,'' said the spokesman, whose name
cannot be used under briefing rules.
   Indian military sources said the number of troops deployed in
<LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority, had
grown from 150,000 a few months ago to about 240,000.
   At least three border incidents have occurred since an Indian
crackdown on Kashmiri separatists began <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>.
   The most serious was <DATE>Feb. 5</DATE>, when about 4,000 Pakistani
civilians tried to cross the border to help their Moslem brethren.
Troopers opened fire, killing as many as 10, according to Indian
newspapers.
   ``Here was a classic case of provocation,'' said an Indian
officer in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, who also
would not let his name be used.
   ``We could have killed a thousand of them, but we did not,
because that could have escalated into a major confrontation,'' he
said. ``Today, political consideration comes first, but if we are
pushed and pushed, we may not have any option but to go flat out.''
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> fought their first war in <DATE>1948</DATE>. It officially
ended with the declaration of a U.N.-sponsored truce in <DATE>January
1949</DATE>, and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> has been divided since.
   In <DATE>1965</DATE>, they fought a second war over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. It lasted 16
days and ended with no real gains for either side.
   Their third war, in <DATE>1971</DATE>, did not concern the disputed region.
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> entered the civil war between <LOCATION>East Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Pakistan</LOCATION>
and helped transform <LOCATION>East Pakistan</LOCATION> into independent <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>.
   On paper, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has a great military advantage. It has 1.36
million men in the armed forces and 240,000 in reserve, compared
with 500,000 men under arms in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has 3,150 battle tanks to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s 1,600 and 714
warplanes to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s 338. The Indian aircraft include advanced
Soviet MiG-29s and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> F-16s.
   The 35-member <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> military observer group continues the task it
began four decades ago.
   ``Our job is to report any abnormal increase in military
activities on the border to our headquarters in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>,'' said
Capt. <PERSON>Idesbald van Biesebroeck</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>.
   The radio at the observer office in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> crackles all day.
So far, the words heard most often are ``normal'' and ``peaceful.''

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of
causing border tensions and said it was prepared militarily for any
threat from <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>.
   ``We urge upon <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> authorities to heed to our request and
scale down the propaganda level,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON>Aftab
Seth</PERSON> said.
   Indian border guards fired <DATE>Monday</DATE> on a mob of 4,000 Pakistani
protesters, some of whom crossed into Indian territory in the
northern state of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, where Moslem separatists are
demanding independence.
   Officials said no Pakistanis were killed but Indian newspapers
and Pakistani officials reported deaths.
   The Indian government began a crackdown on Moslem separatists in
the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, and at least
77 Indians have been killed in clashes between protesters and
security forces.
   Police sources said Moslem militants <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> bombed an empty bus
on the outskirts of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s largest town, and threw a
grenade at a paramilitary patrol, wounding three people.
   <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that Indian security forces
searched for survivors at the height of the protests last month in
order to kill them. The Lonon-based human rights group, quoting
witnesses, also said some protesters were shot from behind.
   It acknowledged that security forces faced a difficult situation
in maintaining order and also that police were killed in the
clashes.
   But it called for an investigation into the killings and urged
the governor of Jammu-Kashmir to order troops not to use lethal
force on demonstrators unless their own lives were at risk.
   Indian officials said about 10 people were wounded <DATE>Monday</DATE> during
the Pakistani border demonstration.
   Pakistani officials said one person was killed and 13 were shot
in the legs. Two Indian newspapers also reported fatalities. The
pro-government Times of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> said 10 people were killed, while The
Statesman, an independent paper, said three died.
   ``We do not want to sound alarmist (but) we regard all such
unprovoked incidents as serious,'' <PERSON>Seth</PERSON> said.
   ``We are fully prepared on (the) military level,'' <PERSON>Seth</PERSON> said. He
did not elaborate.
   <PERSON>Seth</PERSON> said three more anti-Indian demonstrations were held on the
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> side of the frontier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> but that the protesters did
not try to cross into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Both days the demonstrators shouted slogans in protest of
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s crackdown on the Moslem separatists.
   The Pakistan-based leader of Moslem militants who support the
separatist movement in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> promised <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to rein in his
emotionally charged followers.
   ``I have issued a sort of martial law order to our people today
to not storm across'' the border, said <PERSON>Amanullah Khan</PERSON>, chairman of
the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>.
   His decree generated threats of mutiny, particularly among
student in his organization, <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s
capital. But greater tension between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> would hurt
their cause, he said: ``If there is a war we'll be sandwiched in
between and made a scapegoat.''
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of aiding the militants in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, a
predominantly Moslem region claimed both by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
Pakistan routinely denies the charge but says it supports the
separatists' quest for self-determination.
   About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 5 million people are Moslem,
making it the only Moslem-majority state among predominantly Hindu
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 25 states.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moslem Pakistan</LOCATION> were formed largely along religious
lines when the Indian subcontinent gained independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   Jammu-Kashmir is part of a larger <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> that was divided into
Indian and Pakistani segments after the nations went to war in
<DATE>1948</DATE>. A <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> monitored cease-fire line separates the regions.
   The two countries went to war again over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in <DATE>1965</DATE>, but
the border question is still unresolved.

The Indian army shot and killed dozens of demonstrators in the embattled 
Himalayan state of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> after nearly 1 million 
protesters gathered in the state capital for the largest-ever rally for 
Kashmiri independence. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television and radio announced from the strategic border state that 
at least 29 people were killed and scores injured after demonstrators stoned an 
army convoy, attacked buses and tried to grab weapons from the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Partisan sources in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the state capital, described the day's carnage as 
a "massacre." They said women and children were taken off buses and shot in the 
head by soldiers. They put the death toll at 70 and charged that none of the 
secessionist protesters were armed. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian government expelled all foreign journalists from <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> 
after the Indian army was deployed to suppress a growing independence movement 
in the state, which borders <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s traditional foe. 
</P>
<P>
All requests by journalists to visit <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> have been denied in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, and 
the only news from the state has been from official government media or 
long-distance telephone conversations with <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> residents, most of whom 
appear to support the secessionist drive. 
</P>
<P>
One such source said by telephone <TIME>this morning</TIME> that the army "massacred" 16 
civilians, among them women and children, in a bus near the <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> airport 
and that an additional 48 demonstrators near the city's Zakura district were 
gunned down in cold blood. 
</P>
<P>
Several other sources reported that the day's death toll exceeded 60, although 
official radio and television asserted that the army had killed the 29 and 
injured 45 others in firing aimed at thwarting "a well-knit plan" by <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 
underground secessionists. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from "intelligence sources," the state-run media said the 
pro-secessionist <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> was trying to kidnap 
schoolchildren from the buses when the army opened fire near the airport, 
killing eight. 
</P>
<P>
The official account added that the army killed an additional 14 in Zakura 
after protesters stoned an Indian army convoy and "tried to snatch arms" from 
soldiers attempting to break up the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Kashmiris are Muslim, and they have enjoyed considerable 
autonomy from Hindu-dominated <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> since deciding to join the Indian nation in 
<DATE>1947</DATE>, when the subcontinent was divided along religious lines to create an 
independent <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the Islamic state of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of supporting the Kashmiri secessionists, who have 
gained far-reaching support since <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> reacted to months of growing street 
demonstrations by sending in thousands of Indian soldiers and barring outside 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> said that <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s huge demonstration included engineers, 
doctors, lawyers, educators and laborers, reflecting an expanding grass-roots 
support for the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Indian authorities, though, have labeled all of the secessionists "terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Jammu and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, which has long ranked among <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s most lucrative 
international tourist destinations, is also one of its most strategic states. 
Two of the three wars <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has fought with neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> stemmed from 
their dispute over the region, and the third involved fighting there. The 
<ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is still charged with policing the cease-fire line through it.

   Three years ago they threw stones at
Indian security men. At the first sign of retaliation, they would
run for cover and flee into the narrow lanes of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, waving
clenched fists as a gesture of defiance.
   But today, Moslem militants campaigning for <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s
independence have graduated to Kalashnikov rifles and firebombs in
battling an estimated 40,000 Indian soldiers in the strategic state.
   Intelligence reports say the militants, most of them in their
20s, have acquired rocket launchers and even U.S.-made Stinger
missiles.
   ``<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> now faces the risk of fighting a prolonged guerrilla war
in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,'' said a retired colonel of the Indian army. ``And like
most other guerrilla war situations, the odds are in favor of the
terrorists.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Over the years these terrorists have graduated into becoming
real fighters, not in the conventional sense, but as guerrillas,''
said <PERSON>Jitendra Narain Saxena</PERSON>, the director-general of the
<ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 40,000-member police force.
   ``Before the police could just scare them away. But today they
stand up and try to defy,'' <PERSON>Saxena</PERSON> said.
   Saxena would not discuss the reasons for the change of mood in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, where analysts say <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> faces the toughest challenge to
its unity in the country's 42 years of independence.
   More than 80 people have been killed in the wave of separatist
violence that began <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> with the arrests of more than 250
people.
   The killings and open defiance by the militants triggered a
panic in the adminstration. Curfew was imposed for days, the army
was called out and foreign journalists expelled from the state.
Curfew passes of local journalists were withdrawn and Indian
journalists working for foreign media were confined to their hotel.
   Jammu-Kashmir, home of 6 million people, is <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only
Moslem-majority state.
   Nationwide, Moslems account for about <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> of the
country's 880 million people. But in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley, the
stronghold of the militants, Moslems make up <PERCENT>94 percent</PERCENT> of the 3.5
million people.
   Kashmir became part of the Mogul empire when Akbar invaded the
area in <DATE>1586</DATE>. The Afghans annexed it in <DATE>1756</DATE>. The Sikhs came in
<DATE>1819</DATE>. A Hindu king took it over in <DATE>1846</DATE>.
   When <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> divided the subcontinent in <DATE>1947</DATE> into <LOCATION>Islamic
Pakistan</LOCATION> and Hindu-dominated <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was given the choice to
either remain independent or join either of the two nations. After
initial hesitation, the king joined <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and triggered a Pakistani
armed invasion.
   A brief war followed and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> claims that of the state's 88,894
square miles of territory, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is in ``illegal occupation'' of
31,572 square miles. New Delhi also alleges that <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> gave away
17,094 square miles of territory to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> when <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> signed a boundary agreement.
   Intelligence reports attribute the guerrillas' popularity to
fear. But many, including some junior government officials and some
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> police, admit privately that even if they do not support
the militants they do not oppose them either.
   ``In <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> today everyone, even a 10-year-old boy, is in favor
of independence,'' said <PERSON>Maulvi Mohammad Farooq</PERSON>, the chief Moslem
priest of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   ``If police actions are not stopped, I have to ask the people to
join the armed struggle,'' the 45-year-old <PERSON>Farooq</PERSON> said in an
interview at his fortified home in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   ``The entire population has risen as one man against Indian
occupation,'' said politician <PERSON>Abdul Ghani Lone</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>People's
Conference Party</ORGANIZATION>. ``It looks as if the Indian government wants to
create peace in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, but that peace will be the peace of the
graveyard.''
   Gov. <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON> ruled out any threat to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s sovereignty.
   ``The issue is very simple,'' he said in a interview at his home
guarded by Indian troops manning light machine gun positions behind
bunkers. ``There was lack of economic development, people are
frustrated.
   ``Once we set things right, <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> will again become `Jannat'
(heaven),'' said <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, who uses only one name.
   But the scene outside his home is different.
   Behind a graveyard in the old <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> district, 11-year-old
<PERSON>Riaz Sheikh</PERSON> holds his toy Kalashnikov rifle and waits for his
friends. Not to play, but to discuss how to become Moslem holy
worriors.
   ``Before we played cricket, but now we talk about how to
liberate <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>,'' said Riaz, whose brother, <PERSON>Hamid
Sheikh</PERSON>, a top militant leader, was shot and wounded by the police.
   ``Why you want to talk to us?'' he asked. ``Can you give me a
gun?''

   Indian troops shot and killed nine people
who tried to cross from the <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> side of the frontier to
Indian-governed <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, including five armed Moslem
militants, official sources said.
   The most serious clash occurred near the <LOCATION>Jhelum River</LOCATION> 45 miles
west of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the center of the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> secessionist movement,
the sources said.
   The Indian border force killed five armed Moslem militants and
captured three others in a clash about <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME>, according to the
sources. An Indian guard and a doctor serving with the border force
also were killed in the clash.
   In other encounters along the frontier on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, Indian
forces shot and killed four men who tried to enter Indian-governed
Kashmir at different places, according to the sources, who cannot
be identified under brefing regulations.
   They said one of the four was a militant, but the other three
were unarmed and they did not know if they also were militants.
   It was the second day in a row that Indian officials reported a
clash along the disputed frontier. Indian troops killed seven
Kashmiri militants on <DATE>Friday</DATE> in another sector of the confrontation
line between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The Islamic militants want predominantly <PERSON>Moslem Kashmir</PERSON> to
secede from mostly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,which is overwhelmingly Moslem, of
harboring and arming the separatists. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> says it supports
Kashmiri Moslems' right to self-determination but denies sheltering
or arming them.
   The two countries went to war over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in <DATE>1948</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE>.
Both sides say they do not want another war, but the current
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> crisis has heightened their traditional distrust and
animosity.
   At least 337 people have died in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> when
Indian launched its harshest crackdown to date on the increasingly
violent separatist movement. The majority were Moslem militants or
supporters shot by Indian troops while defying curfew or staging
anti-India demonstrations.
   Both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have claimed <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since the two
nations were partitioned along religious lines when they won their
independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>. The old princely state of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> had a Moslem majority, but its ruler was a Hindu and he
opted to join <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Kashmir became part of the Indian state of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, and
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> later abolished princely rule.
   Sixty-four percent of <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 6 million people are
Moslems, but nationwide they make up only <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the
population. Hindus comprise <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million
people.

<HEAD>India Imposes Direct Rule in Kashmir</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today imposed direct
federal rule in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, where Indian security forces are battling
to put down a rebellion by Moslem separatists.
   The action follows the killing <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> of at least 29 Moslem
militants by Indian security forces.
   In the Pakistani capital of <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, meanwhile, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> opened negotiations today aimed at repairing relations
threatened by the rebellion in the disputed northern region.
   Relations between <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> worsened in <DATE>January</DATE> when
Indian soldiers cracked down on Moslem militants in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> who are
seeking independence from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> or union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. At least
792 people have been killed in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since then. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has
accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of arming and training the militants, a charge
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has denied.
   Before direct federal rule was imposed today on Jammu-Kashmir
state, it was administered temporarily by a governor, a federal
representative, since <DATE>Jan. 18</DATE>. The announcement of federal rule
reflected the belief that Jammu-Kashmir state was too unstable to
be run by an elected local government.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, at least 29 militants were killed by Indian security
forces in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, the Moslem-dominated northern part of
Jammu-Kashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign.
   Officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said
21 militants were killed in a battle with the <ORGANIZATION>Border Security Force</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Poonch</LOCATION>, 400 miles northwest of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. Hours later in the
same area, troops killed eight militants who slipped across the
border from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, said the officials.
   The guards also arrested four militants and seized 14 automatic
rifles, two machine guns and two rocket launchers, the officials
said.
   Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly
cross over to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> through the border and return by the same
route after reciving arms training. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> denies it is training
or helping the militants, but calls the separatist struggle a fight
for self-determination.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought two previous wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>,
in <DATE>1948</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE>. Both were won by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   About <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 6 million people are
Moslems, making it <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only Moslem majority state. Nationwide,
Moslems make up <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million people. Hindus
make up <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of the population.
   Kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, an
Islamic country, but they have recently been fighting for total
independence and the status of a neutral country.

   The appeal came from loudpseakers strung
across mosques and by word of mouth: ``100,000 people have taken
shelter in mosques. They are hungry. We need food.''
   Within minutes, Moslem housewives collected their pots and pans.
Within an hour, huge dinners of rice and vegetable curry were ready.
   The food was passed from hand to hand across narrow alleys and
from rooftop to rooftop to avoid Indian patrols, until it reached
the mosques that dot this city of nearly 1 million people.
   ``The appeal was for food, and it came. If the appeal goes for
giving one's life, that will come too,'' said <PERSON>Mohammad Ramzan</PERSON>, a
74-year-old retired government employee.
   Moslems in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION> seem ready for a full-scale battle
for independence. The relay of food was <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the day
government troops shot and killed at least 49 Moslems during
marches by about a million Moslems demanding secession from
Hindu-dominated <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   It was the largest demonstration for secession ever in the
<LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>, a Moslem-dominated region where residents have
chafed and periodically broken into violence over Indian rule for
the last four decades.
   ``<DATE>Thursday</DATE> was the watershed in the Indian government's efforts
to keep the area under Indian control,'' said a local Moslem
policeman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Look at this,'' he said, pointing at his police uniform.
``Inside this uniform there is a Kashmiri first and a policeman
later. I am no more an Indian, and I will never pick up arms
against my brother Kashmiris.''
   Urged on by militants, Moslems are starting to reject everything
that is Indian.
   Billboards with the word ``<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'' have been vandalized. Indian
banks report low business. Many residents have set back their
watches half an hour to correspond with the time in neighboring _
and Islamic _ <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Many people have stopped wearing wristwatches, fearful of
offending either the militants or the government.
   ``Why take undue risk? I just don't wear a wristwatch anymore,''
a hotel doorman said.
   In the last few days a new directive went out to shopkeepers: Do
not accept Indian currency. Instead, use the Pakistani currency
that Indian sources say the militants are smuggling into <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   ``Yes, we have heard about the directive not to accept Indian
currency, but I don't think it has been put to practice,'' said an
employee at one of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>'s top hotels.
   ``Indian currency is still legal tender, but if the campaign
goes on the way it is going now, the day is not far off when we may
have to refuse Indian money,'' he said, asking that neither he nor
his hotel be identified.
   Under orders from the main Islamic militant group, the
<ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>'s liquor shops closed or
switched to selling other merchandise. Cinemas have closed, and one
theater owner said he was thinking of converting his theater to a
cold storage depot for potatoes.
   The refrain of independence reverberates throughout the city.
   ``Before, we _ the Kashmiris _ used to think that independence
was not possible. But now we think it is not only possible, but it
is only a matter of time,'' a Moslem high school teacher said on
condition of anonynity.
   ``It is sort of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> in the making,'' he said, comparing the
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> independence movement to the crumbling of the
long-entrenched <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> regimes in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.
   But Indian officials said fear, not genuine feelings, has driven
most people to join the demonstrations.
   ``These are stage-managed for the press,'' said <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, the
federally appointed governor of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state, where
escalating violence by separatist groups prompted a massive
government crackdown <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>. More than 160 people have died since
then, and most have been Moslem protesters shot by government
troops.
   ``The number of hard-core terrorists will be at best 300 to
400,'' said <PERSON>Jagmohan</PERSON>, a Hindu who uses only one name, as he spoke
in the heavily fortified governor's palace. ``The so-called
sympathy you see is just a show, and some are out of fear.''
   Events outside seemed to contradict this.
   ``I have never seen anything like that in my life,'' said <PERSON>Rahul
Kapoor</PERSON>, referring to <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s processions of pro-independence
demonstrators.
   ``My God, it was like a revolution,'' said <PERSON>Kapoor</PERSON>, a Hindu
businessman from <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.

   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> rushed hundreds of reinforcements
to the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION> after the largest-ever Moslem rally against
Indian rule, police and airport sources said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Police today killed a protester in the old downtown area of
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> when 20 to 30 people came out of their homes in defiance
of the curfew imposed <DATE>Friday</DATE>, witnesses said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Indian news agencies said the patrolling troops and paramilitary
police had orders to shoot curfew violators on sight.
   Nine planes carrying paramilitary police and border guards
landed at <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> airport <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and today and more were
expected in northern Jammu-Kashir state, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   In neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, a leader in the Pakistani-held section
of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> said Pakistani Kashmiris will march to the border
next <DATE>Friday</DATE> in protest and invade Jammu-Kashmir ``in a matter of
weeks.''
   Sultan Mahmood, president of <ORGANIZATION>Azad Moslem Conference</ORGANIZATION>, made his
comments at a news conference in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, the Pakistani capital.
   At least 49 people were fatally shot <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by army and
paramilitary troops as an estimated 1 million Moslem demonstrators
converged on <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> to press demands for independence from
predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>, police said.
   Today's shooting raised the death toll to at least 163 in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since the latest round of secessionist violence flared <DATE>Jan.
20</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> it had appealed
to the Indian government to prevent the use of excessive force
against the pro-independence demonstrators.
   ``We deplore the loss of life in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. We are disturbed at
the rising number of casualties,'' <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman
<PERSON>Margaret Tutwiler</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   An Indian government spokesman, speaking on the customary
condition of anonymity, said troops opened fire <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in
self-defense. Witnesses, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some of the marchers tried to seize weapons from the
government security forces.
   On <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, the government launched a crackdown on escalating
protests, bombings and attacks on government intelligence agents
and other officials.
   After the crackdown started, army and paramilitary troops were
beefed up in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> and surrounding towns in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION>
next to the Pakistani frontier.
   Some of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION>Central Reserve Police Force</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Border
Security Guards</ORGANIZATION> were withdrawn during legislative elections <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
in eight other Indian states. These troops were returning now, the
airport and police sources said.
   Each plane landing at <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> airport carried about 100 men,
they added.
   Heightened security also was in evidence in downtown <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>,
center of the militant movement. For a week preceding the
imposition of the curfew, processions ranging from about 20,000 to
1 million demonstrators had converged on the office of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>
military observer group that has been assigned to the
Indian-Pakistani frontier for the past 40 years because of the two
nations' dispute over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, an overwhelmingly Moslem nation, claimed <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and
twice went to war with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> over the question of the predominantly
Moslem valley's sovereignty.
   The <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION> is governed by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> as part of Jammu-Kashmir
state, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. The western
slice of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is under Pakistani control. Both countries claim
all of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Initially, Kashmiri separatists on the Indian side of the
disputed frontier had pressed for union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. But in the
past year their call for secession has been coupled with demands
for <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s independence as a buffer nation between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, the
region's military and political giant, and its long-time adversary,
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. The two nations were once ruled as one unit by colonial
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. But upon independence in <DATE>1947</DATE>, they were partitioned along
religious lines.
   The Kashmir section of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Jammu-Kashmir state is mostly
Moslem, while the southern <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> region is mostly Hindu. Overall,
Moslems make up <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 6 million people.
   But nationwide, Moslems form only <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880
million people, of whom <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> are Hindus.

  [Text] <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <DATE>May 22</DATE> (AFP) -- <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is ready to talk to 
Moslem militants to end the four-year-old separatist campaign in 
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, but <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> cannot be included in the negotiations, a 
federal minister said here on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> [23 May]. 
  Internal Security Minister <PERSON>Rajesh Pilot</PERSON> told the Press Trust 
of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> (PTI) news agency that <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> had "an open mind on 
holding talks with anybody if it helps to bring back normalcy in 
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>." 
  But Pilot rejected suggestions from a top Kashmiri militant 
leader, <PERSON>Yasin Malik</PERSON>, that <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> should start an 
unconditional dialogue with Kashmiris and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> if it wanted 
peace in the northern state. 
  "The talks should be among ourselves," Pilot said, referring 
to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and to Moslem militants in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> fighting for the 
secession of the state, the only one with a Moslem majority. 
Pilot ruled out the inclusion of "any third party." 
  It was the first Indian reaction to <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s offer by 
<PERSON>Malik</PERSON> 
of the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>) that separatist 
unrest could end in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> if <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> talked unconditionally to 
Kashmiris and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
  Indian newspapers on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> quoted <PERSON>Malik</PERSON> as saying in 
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, that his outlawed <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> 
would announce a unilateral truce if <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> agreed to the 
negotiations. 
  Indian leaders have said the guerrillas must renounce 
violence before talks can start. But <PERSON>Malik</PERSON>, 30, freed on <DATE>May 16</DATE> 
after nearly four years in prison, said: "You cannot talk of 
peace and then make any move toward it conditional." 
  Malik, who returned to <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> two days after his release, 
said the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>, the premier Moslem guerrilla group, stood for the 
"total independence" of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, now divided between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
  "The <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> issue is not merely a territorial dispute 
between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>," he declared. According to Indian 
newspapers he denied that the Kashmiri separatist campaign, in 
which nearly 10,000 have lost their lives, aimed to carve out an 
independent state exclusively for Moslems. 
  "We do not demand freedom for a particular community or a 
particular area. We strive for total independence of the 13 
million Kashmiris, irrespective of their caste, colour, race, 
region or faith. 
  "The independence of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> means the independence of the 
85,000 square miles (136,000 square kilometers) that constitute 
our homeland," he said, making clear he meant both the 
two-thirds of the state within <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the rest held by 
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought two of their three wars since 
<DATE>1947</DATE> over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> of arming the 
militant groups, which <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> denies. 
  All Moslem separatist groups except the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> want the 
Indian-held <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> to join <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
  Other Moslem groups want to make <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> an Islamic state, 
and have forced thousands of Hindus who have lived in the 
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley for generations to flee. <PERSON>Malik</PERSON> said he wanted the 
Hindus to return. 
  Malik, who helped launch the Kashmiri separatist campaign in 
<DATE>1989</DATE>, was arrested by Indian security forces in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>August 1990</DATE> and held in prison until last week.

   The start of daylight-saving time this
weekend has an effect so strange in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> that many residents
could use the extra hour to explain it to outsiders.
   While most <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> counties remain on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Standard Time</ORGANIZATION>,
residents of 16 counties move their clocks forward an hour.
   Eleven of those counties are in the Central time zone, and move
their clocks to be even with <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Central Daylight Time</ORGANIZATION> and
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>' EST.
   The five other counties are in the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> zone and move their
clocks up to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Daylight Time</ORGANIZATION> to keep pace with nearby
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>.
   The result is that some people in the same time zone have
different times on their clocks, while people in different zones
have the same time. This occurs among neighbors in a state less
than 150 miles wide.
   Indiana residents just call the two times ``fast'' and ``slow.''
   ``It creates confusion for us until <DATE>October</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>Barbara
Schuler</PERSON>, office manager at WSCH radio in <LOCATION>Lawrenceburg</LOCATION>. ``We make it
a point to tell listeners if an event is on fast or slow time.''
   She said the confusion hits hardest when family members are
operating on different clocks, such as when a parent working in
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> has a child in a school using standard time.
   ``It's an absolute mess,'' said <PERSON>Donna Benning</PERSON>, a bookkeeper at
an auto dealership in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>. ``The kids tell me to pick them up at
<TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> and I always show up an hour early.''
   Daylight-saving time was standardized by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1966</DATE>, but
in <DATE>1972</DATE>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> joined <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> in exercising an option
to exempt themselves.
   However, the <ORGANIZATION>Legislature</ORGANIZATION> left some border counties near <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> to go daylight-saving time.

   Moslem separatists today kidnapped a
leading industrialist and a university official and threatened to
kill them unless three jailed militants were freed, police and a
telephone caller said.
   Soldiers tightened security throughout the troubled <LOCATION>Kashmir
Valley</LOCATION> and blocked off roads in and out of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, where the
kidnappings took place.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said soldiers
killed six separatists who tried to cross into neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to seek training and weapons.
   The telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were
holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24
hours after a <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> deadline for the release of three
jailed militants.
   The telephone caller claimed to speak for the Students
Liberation Front, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>
fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state in mainly
<LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>.
   Both the caller and police sources said the vice chancellor of
<ORGANIZATION>Kashmir University</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mushir ul-Haq</PERSON>, and the general manager of
<ORGANIZATION>Hindustan Machine Tools Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>L.M. Khela</LOCATION>, had been abducted.
   The telephone caller, who didn't give his name, claimed <PERSON>Mushir</PERSON>'s
private secretary also was being held hostage, but that could not
be independently confirmed.
   Moslem separatists had warned officials in the Indian government
to leave Jammu-Kashmir state by the end of <DATE>March</DATE> or ``face the
consequences.''
   The border incident took place <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Kupwara</LOCATION> district,
where at least 20 separatists were trying to sneak into <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> to
receive military training and buy weapons, police said. No further
details were immediately available.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> claims <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> trains and arms the militants, but
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has denied the claim. The two countries have fought two
wars over the region since <DATE>1947</DATE> when both nations won independence
from British colonial rule.
   At least 255 people have died in <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>,
when the Indian government launched a crackdown on the separatist
movement. Most of the victims have been Moslem protesters defying
curfew or militants killed in gunbattles with security forces.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier demanded union with <LOCATION>Islamic
Pakistan</LOCATION> but now seek independence and the status of a neutral
country.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Jammu-Kashmir state, which includes the scenic <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
valley in the north and the plains of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> in the south, is
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s only state with a majority of Moslems.
   About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 6 million people are Moslems.
Nationwide, Moslems comprise <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of india's 880 million
people. Hindus account for <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>.

   Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
the Indian people should be ``psychologically prepared'' for an
armed conflict with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> over the disputed <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley.
   Singh made the comment in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> hours after Moslem
secessionists in the picturesque valley shot and killed a Hindu
industrialist they had held since <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Singh told the <LOCATION>Lok Sabha</LOCATION>, or house of the people, that <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>
was fomenting the insurgency in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir
and could ``make a limited intervention with or without uniforms to
achieve its territorial goal.''
   ``You (<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>) will not get away with it,'' the prime minister
warned the neighboring country. ``You will have to pay a very heavy
price, and we have the capability to inflict this cost.''
   ``People should be psychologically prepared for any
eventuality,'' he said. ``We cannot remain soft. A soft people and
a hard army are incongruous.''
   The comments were the most aggressive the Indian leader has made
since he took office in <DATE>December</DATE>. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought
three wars, including two over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, since both were born out of
the <DATE>1947</DATE> division of the British-ruled subcontinent.
   They have been exchanging sharp words since the beginning of the
year, when the Moslem movement for secession of Indian Kashmir
escalated. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> charges <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> with arming and training the
militants. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> denies it.
   State-owned television said <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> had raised its civil
defense to an advanced state of preparedness and made plans for
evacuation of civilians from near the border with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   It said Pakistani radar installations were moved closer to the
border and camouflage coverings placed over important buildings.
   In <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the largest city in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley, police said
they found the body of a Hindu industrialist who was kidnapped four
days ago along with two Moslems.
   The body of <ORGANIZATION>L.M. Khera</ORGANIZATION> was found near the city's fire brigade
headquarters with five bullet wounds, said <PERSON>Tataji Ganju</PERSON>, a police
superintendent.
   His death raises to 257 the number of people killed in the
valley since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>, when the government crackdown on the Moslem
secessionist movement began.
   The body was found about 1{ hours before the kidnappers' <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME>
deadline to release three of their colleagues.
   Ganju said he had no idea why <PERSON>Khera</PERSON> was killed before the
deadline expired. He said he did not know the fate of the other two
captives.
   At least one person was killed and 12 others injured <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
when government troops opened fire on curfew violators in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>,
witnesses said. The city has been under a continuous curfew since
the three hostages were kidnapped <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, bombs exploded at two police stations <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>,
injuring at least nine policemen, officials said. Responsibility
for the explosions was claimed in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> by a previously unknown
militant group called the ``<PERSON>Mujahedeen Kashmir</PERSON>,'' or warriors of
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Moslem-dominated <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is a former princely state whose Hindu
ruler opted for union with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> at the time of the <DATE>1947</DATE> division
of the subcontinent.
   Moslem resentment at the move was muted at the time, but the
discontent has flared into an active campaign for secession in
recent months.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> fought wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in <DATE>1948</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE>. A
U.N.-monitored cease-fire line separates the valley into Indian and
Pakistani sectors.
   The two countries also fought a war in <DATE>1971</DATE> that led to the
independence of <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION>.

   The Moslem campaign for an independent
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> spread to <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with a bomb attack that
wounded 34 people and brought Indian relations with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> to a
new peak of anger.
   <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION>, a news agency, said frontier guards shot
and killed seven Kashmiri militants who were trying to cross
illegally into <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, which borders the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley.
   Indian and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, which have in the past waged war over
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, traded bitter words over the latest violence. Pakistani
troops were put on high alert <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s leader talked
of war.
   The Indian news agency quoted unidentified officials as saying
the militants were killed while trying to escape a dragnet spread
across the valley by security forces.
   Authorities were cracking down in a search for killers of three
men abducted last week by Moslem separatists demanding the release
of three jailed colleagues. The bodies were found <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in the
far northern city of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the hub of the secession drive.
   Jammu-Kashmir state officials said 64 people were arrested
during the searches, but it was not known if they were connected
with the killing of the hostages.
   The bomb rocked the train near <LOCATION>Malad</LOCATION> station on the outskirts of
<LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, about 1,000 miles south of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s west coast.
Authorities said 34 people were wounded.
   A man purporting to speak for the ``Mujahedeen Kashmir,'' or
Islamic Holy Warriors of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, telephoned reporters in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>
and claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   The group was first heard of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> when it claimed
responsibility for bomb blasts that injured at least nine policemen
in two <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> police stations.
   The <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> bombings were the first time the Moslem
separatists claimed responsibility for attacks outside <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
since the government launched a crackdown on secessionists <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE>.
At least 260 people have been killed in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> during the
crackdown.
   The separatists in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state want to break
their Moslem-dominated region from the rest of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, which is
mainly Hindu.
   The old princely state of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was split between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
Moslem-dominated <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> when the two countries were partitioned
along religious lines after independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>. The
frontier is still disputed, and the two countries went to war over
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in <DATE>1948</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, army troops in camouflage battle dress
cordoned off the area where the bodies were found and began
house-to-house searches for the killers, witnesses said. A 24-hour
curfew was in effect for the sixth straight day.
   The killings of the hostages, who included a vice chancellor at
<ORGANIZATION>Kashmir University</ORGANIZATION>, were a departure from the militants' previous
practices. In the past, the militants only killed civilians accused
of being police informers.
   ``The dastardly murders ... are the grossest violations of human
rights where innocent persons are being made victims of senseless,
externally inspired and motivated violence,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman <PERSON>Aftab Seth</PERSON> told reporters <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
   He said the events in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> indicated ``a sinister pattern of
incitement to violence being orchestrated by so-called leaders of
Pakistan-occupied <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> and by elements within <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> itself.''
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has denied involvement in the Indian conflict.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON> said Indians should be
``psychologically prepared'' for another armed conflict with
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s military leader put his troops on high
alert.
   Gen. <PERSON>Mirza Aslam Beg</PERSON>, the military chief, told a meeting of
commanders in <LOCATION>Rawalpindi</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Singh</PERSON>'s ``threatening statements . .
. call for a high state of preparedness and vigilance to frustrate
the designs of the enemy.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Pakistani Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement expressing
``deep regret and disappointment at yet another threat of war by
the top leadership of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.''
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, dozens of supporters of a new Hindu militant
group, the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION>, marched to the <ORGANIZATION>Pakistan
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``We will crush <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>!'' they shouted.
   The group was formed last month to counter the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, the biggest of several Moslem secessionist groups
in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley.

   Indian security forces killed seven
suspected Moslem militants as they crossed from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
<DATE>today</DATE> in violence that left at least nine people dead in
<LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION> state, police and witnesses said.
   Indian news reports said 13 people died but the conflicting
numbers could not immediately be reconciled.
   Militants and security forces clashed throughout the day in
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the capital of the state, and at least 10 people were
wounded, witnesses said.
   The firefight occurred in the Ori sector, 93 miles north of
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, security sources said. Indian troops killed seven men on
the spot and wounded two others as they passed into <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Troops captured five AK-47 automatic weapons, one rocket
launcher, three anti-personnel mines and other weapons, they said.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of providing weapons and training to
Moslem separatists in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. Pakistan denies the charge and
accuses <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> of trying to crush a movement for self-determination.
   In <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, a shootout between Moslem militants and security
forces near a bazaar killed one police officer, <ORGANIZATION>Chief Constable Ali
Mohamed</ORGANIZATION>. News reports said security forces killed a suspected
militant during a village raid in the southern part of the state.
   The deaths brought to at least 326 the number of people killed
since <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> when the Indian government began the crackdown on the
separatist movement in the strategic state.
   Today's clashes in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> included several bomb blasts.
   The crisis over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> has heightened long-standing animosity
between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   Both countries claim the mountainous region, which is split
between them along a contested frontier where Indian and Pakistani
troops face each other. The dispute flared into war in <DATE>1948</DATE> and
<DATE>1965</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, a powerful right-wing Indian political party urged
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s army to attack the alleged bases in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> to ``clean out
the terrorists.''
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the state's 6 million people are Moslems.
Nationwide Moslems comprise only <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s population
of 880 million, while Hindus make up <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>.
   Meanwhile, 15 Sikh extremists impersonating government troops
lured six Hindu men out of their homes in an remote <LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION> village
and shot them to death, a senior police official said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The gunmen wore uniforms of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION>Border Security
Force</ORGANIZATION> when they arrived in <LOCATION>Kotli</LOCATION> Suratmallian. All 15 escaped,
authorities said.

   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- This may be one of the world's
sleepiest capitals. It is the principal city of
Pakistan-controlled Azad, or Free, Kashmir. The picturesque
Kashmir of tourist brochures is the one India controls across
the heavily guarded border.
   But Muzaffarabad is having a small boom because of the
tension between India and Pakistan. Tourists, scared by the
violence in India's Kashmir, are coming here. And foreign
reporters, thrown out of India's Kashmir in January, are
flocking to Pakistan's portion to meet Kashmiri militants and
refugees from the south.

<TEXT>
   Kashmir is a kind of looking-glass place: two areas
bearing similar names but controlled by two countries that
view things conversely and whose armies glare at each other
with identical postures of outrage. It is one of the world's
most dangerous flash points.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON>Vishwanath Pratap Singh</PERSON> has told
his people to be "psychologically prepared" for war.
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON> has threatened a war
of 1,000 years.
   It is a potential nightmare for the whole globe. A war on
the subcontinent could go nuclear: <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> exploded its first
nuclear device in <DATE>1974</DATE>; <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is believed to have nuclear
weapons, too. Even conventional conflict could be brutal as
the animosity between the two countries has been stoked to
boiling point by historical passions and thorny current
problems.
   "There has been a steady escalation in tension and
preparation on both sides," says a diplomat in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. "We
have a great worry that they're going to get into a war that
neither side wants." The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have made
it clear that the support they provided in the past -- the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s side, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s -- won't
be forthcoming this time.
   "<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is a motherhood issue," says a diplomat in
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. "War could happen tomorrow. It could happen next
month. It could never happen." Says <PERSON>Zain Noorani</PERSON>, former
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> foreign minister: "When you raise the war tempo to a
certain extent, anything can happen."
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought two wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, in
<DATE>1947</DATE> and <DATE>1965</DATE>. The territory remains split along the
cease-fire line of <DATE>1965</DATE> (with alterations made after the
India-Pakistan war of <DATE>1971</DATE>). A former princely state, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
was given a choice in <DATE>1947</DATE> to choose union with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, an
avowedly secular democracy, or <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, which was founded in
the name of Islam. The maharajah of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, a Hindu leader
of a Moslem-majority population, equivocated until
Pakistan-backed troops invaded. He acceded to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> considers this the supreme justification of the
secular state. So, along with its post-1947 terror of further
"mini-partitions," <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is determined to maintain <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   To <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s accession to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was a betrayal
of Moslems by the Hindu maharajah and a violation of the
terms of partition that created an independent <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> out of British <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s long-term pledge:
liberation of the six million Kashmiris in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s tack was to incorporate <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> state
into its democratic political system, with special
constitutional provisions of autonomy. Jammu is a
Hindu-majority territory adjacent to <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>. But politics
proved the undoing of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> policy.
   In <DATE>1984</DATE>, then-Prime Minister <PERSON>Indira Gandhi</PERSON> forced an
alliance between <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s main political force, the <ORGANIZATION>National
Conference</ORGANIZATION>, and her <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> (I) Party. Kashmiris considered
it a sellout by the <ORGANIZATION>National Conference</ORGANIZATION>. Corruption spread, a
state-assembly election in <DATE>1987</DATE> was rigged, and almost
overnight, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>'s biggest political force collapsed. The
power vacuum was quickly filled by militants pressing for
independence.
   Last <DATE>May</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>,
the largest of as many as 26 groups, shut down the state in a
strike. Demonstrations and kidnappings by militants led to an
army crackdown in <DATE>December</DATE> that continues today. A hard-line
governor was brought in from <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, and he dismissed the
elected state government in <DATE>February</DATE>. Foreign correspondents
were thrown out. Round-the-clock curfews made Kashmiris
prisoners in their homes for weeks.
   Indian journalists and foreign reporters who have made
surreptitious visits say <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is under military
siege. Tourism, the largest industry, is dead. Violent army
raids against militants are frequent. The number of
casualties is hard to determine. The anti-Indian Kashmiri
militants claim that several thousand of their number have
been killed and more than 8,000 arrested. Anti-India
sentiment is raging.
   "Morally, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has lost <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Shafiz Misgar</PERSON>, the
28-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION>'s political wing. <PERSON>Mr. Misgar</PERSON>
is now in <LOCATION>Free Kashmir</LOCATION>, which he calls the "base camp" for
the freedom movement. He talks of friends beaten and
terrorized, of Kashmiri martyrs shot down by the Indian army.
He and his friends say there will be no peace in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
until they are allowed to vote for independence.
   "This isn't a territorial dispute," insists <PERSON>Raja Muzaffar
Khan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Free Kashmir</LOCATION>. "The tension in this
region cannot be defused until we are given the right of
self-determination."
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> vehemently disagrees, and the world has accepted its
stand that <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> is an Indian problem, or at most a
bilateral one. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> applies the label Islamic fundamentalist
to the Kashmiri militants in the hope of alienating Western
countries from the militants' cause.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> also contends that <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> started the crisis by
training and arming Kashmiri militants on <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> soil.
Although these accusations come from Prime Minister <PERSON>Singh</PERSON>
himself, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has yet to prove them. In a recent interview,
Foreign Minister <PERSON>I.K. Gujral</PERSON> conceded that his government has
no hard evidence.
   In <LOCATION>Free Kashmir</LOCATION>, the rebels complain they get nothing but
moral support from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. But the rebels concede that
Kashmiris were brought to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in the mid-1980s for
training with the anti-Soviet mujahedeen, presumably by the
Pakistani military.
   On the big issues -- fundamentalism, independence,
alignment with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> -- Kashmiris on both sides seem
confused. At the very least, burgeoning hatred for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has
made many Kashmiris pro-Pakistan and has boosted Islamic
jingoism.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>JKLF</ORGANIZATION> spokesman leaves the room after stating that
the fight is for Kashmiris' right to self-determination, his
followers let slip some significant remarks. "We hate the
Indian secularism," says one. Another calls for a
"theo-democratic state." A slogan on the wall of a
<LOCATION>Muzaffarabad</LOCATION> house reads: "Pray five times daily because this
is the only way through which we can get success."
   The Indian government's emphasis on <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s alleged
training of militants and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> has helped boost pro-war sentiments in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> --
feelings never far below the surface in a country that has
defeated <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> in three wars in 43 years.
   In <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the people in a <DATE>February</DATE> poll said
they believed there was a strong chance of war, the highest
level in a tumultuous decade.
   Many military analysts believe that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> would defeat
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> in a conventional war of about two weeks. The Indian
military is convinced of its superiority, and there is a
rising feeling that another war could help finish off
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s military for good. But in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, local
politicians and journalists say, the military believes it has
gained strength from new equipment and that revenge for
previous defeats is long overdue.

   Moslem militants fighting for <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s
secession from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> opened fire today on air force officers,
killing at least four, police said.
   The killings raised to at least 61 the number of people killed
in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, when the lingering Moslem movement for
secession from Hindu-majority <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> flared.
   Most of the killings have occured in confrontations between
troops enforcing an around-the-clock curfew and mobs of militants
defying the curfew.
   ``The attack makes it clear that the terrorists want to make
targets of anyone who is associated with the Indian government,''
said a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The air force officers were waiting for a bus to take them to
the <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> airport when they were attacked by assailants who
drove up in a car, the police official said.
   Three of the officers were killed on the spot in repeated bursts
of fire from automatic rifles and at least four others were
wounded, two of them seriously, he said. One of the wounded died at
a hospital.
   A woman and a child walking by were also hurt, the official
said. Witnesses said they saw at least five bodies being carried
away after the shooting.
   Hundreds of troops and paramilitary police have been deployed to
halt the violence in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, famous for its lakes and tourist
resorts.
   Troops and the militants exchanged gunfire at four places in the
city during a four-hour curfew relaxation which began at <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME>
<DATE>today</DATE>, police said. No deaths were reported although one
para-military policeman was wounded, police said.
   Under the curfew imposed <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, people have been ordered to
stay indoors except for brief periods when the ban is lifted to
enable people to shop.
   Islamic militants are demanding either independence for
predominantly Moslem Kashmir or union with neighboring Islamic
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. Kashmir forms the northern part of Jammu-Kashmir state
and <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> is the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital.
   The <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> region, which lies south of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, is predominantly
Hindu.
   Claimed by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> was divided into Indian
and Pakistani sectors by a cease-fire line that is monitored by
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> military observers.
   The dispute over the territory, which has led to two wars, began
after <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> were partitioned on gaining independence
from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has often accused <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of aiding Kashmiri militants,
and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has routinely denied the charge.
   About <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir</ORGANIZATION>'s 5 million people are
Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems comprise <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880

   Indian security forces clashed repeatedly
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> with Moslem militants in the capital of the northern <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
region and made dozens of arrests.
   The clashes come at a time of escalating tension over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
between predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, a Moslem nation.
The two countries have accused each other of trying to provoke a
war.
   The leader of a powerful, fundamentalist Hindu party warned
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> that Moslem <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> would ``cease to exist'' if it began a
war with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>L.K. Advani</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Bharatiya Janata Party</ORGANIZATION>, a key member of
the governing left-right coalition, told a crowd in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> that
Pakistani interference in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> should be recognized as
``undeclared war by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION> news
agency reported.
   Advani urged the central government to send ``a strong signal''
to <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>.
   Indian police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
reported no casualties in at least five clashes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the
Kashmiri capital of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>.
   Witnesses, however, reported that security forces shot and
wounded a 12-year-old girl on a small ferry on <LOCATION>Lake Dul</LOCATION>, outside
<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>. The girl was hospitalized in serious condition, they said.
   Witnesses said the boat was apparently violating curfew
regulations by taking on passengers.
   Official police sources said 42 suspected militants were
detained during the clashes, but Indian news services reported as
many as 170 arrests. There was no way to reconcile the conflicting
reports.
   Among those arrested, police said, were seven ``area
commanders'' of the <ORGANIZATION>Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front</ORGANIZATION>, one of the
Moslem groups leading the movement to establish a separate nation
in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Security forces have been enforcing a round-the-clock curfew in
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since <DATE>April 7</DATE>, a day after Moslem militants kidnapped three
people. The government refused the separatists' demand to release
three jailed militants in exchange for the hostages. The
bullet-riddled bodies of the hostages were found early last week.
   The <ORGANIZATION>United News of India</ORGANIZATION> news agency, quoting official sources,
reported that security forces were close to arresting those
responsible for the kidnapping.
   Since <DATE>April 7</DATE>, security forces have detained about 1,000
Kashmiris, mostly young men and boys, in their manhunt for the
kidnappers.
   At least 270 people have died since <DATE>January</DATE> when the government
launched a crackdown on Moslem separatists in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley.
The situation has led to a deterioration in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s relations with
neighboring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>.
   The countries have fought two wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since gaining
their independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE>.
   Moslem separatists in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> say they want an independent
country, attached neither to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> nor <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, whose population
is <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> Hindu.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Jammu-Kashmir state is the only state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> with a
Moslem majority, with Moslems accounting for <PERCENT>64 percent</PERCENT> of the
state's 6 million people. Nationwide, Moslems comprise <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million people.

   Indian troops shot and killed 31
demonstrators on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as an estimated 1 million Moslems marched
through the streets of <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> chanting ``Independence,''
witnesses and hospital sources said.
   Hospital sources said at least 100 people were admitted to two
hospitals in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, with 25 or more in serious condition.
   Witnesses said troops fired on two separate processions of
separatists and sympathizers as they strode toward a prayer ground
to join comrades demanding the independence of Moslem-dominated
Kashmir from predominantly <LOCATION>Hindu India</LOCATION>.
   The sources and witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, a government spokesman confirmed 18 deaths in the
incidents.
   ``The situation is very bad, very tense. Our head count is 18,
but there is confusion,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under standing briefing regulations.
   Suspected Moslem separatists assassinated a senior Jammu-Kashmir
state government official on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in this center of the
separatist campaign, government officials in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They said <PERSON>Pushker Nath Handoo</PERSON>, assistant director of the state
information department, was shot as he was about to get into his
car outside his home. Handoo was a Hindu, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s religious
majority, but a minority in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.
   Witnesses said about 1 million people took part in a procession
to the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Military Observers</ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, chanting: ``What
do we want? Independence!'' and ``We want freedom!''
   It was the latest in daily demonstrations in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> this past
week to push the secessionist demand.
   The army fired on Moslem militants at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> in <LOCATION>Zakura Nishad</LOCATION>
crossing, six miles from <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the <DATE>summer</DATE> capital of
<LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>, killing 23 people, witnesses and doctors at a
hospital said.
   They said <DATE>three hours later</DATE>, soldiers fired on Moslems in <LOCATION>Bemina</LOCATION>
area, three miles from <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, and at least eight people were
killed.
   The deaths brought to 145 the number of people killed in the
latest round of secessionist violence that flared <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> following
a government crackdown on Moslem militants.
   <PERSON>Ghulam Rasool Mir</PERSON>, among those wounded by army gunfire, said at
<ORGANIZATION>Soora Medical Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> the trouble began when
soldiers, passing by the procession in three trucks, snatched a
flag held by march leaders and the crowd retaliated by hurling
stones.
   He said the soldiers first fired in the air, then at the crowd.
   Another victim, <PERSON>Abdul Gani Dar</PERSON>, said the procession had grouped
in neighboring towns and was marching to the Idgah, or main Moslem
prayer ground, in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> to merge with a larger procession.
   In <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, the government spokesman said the army fired after
a mob attacked a vehicle. ``The firing was more in self-defense,
because the mob had become violent,'' he said.
   The movement for an independent <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> has mostly been led by
the area's Moslems, who form about <PERCENT>65 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Jammu-Kashmir</LOCATION>
state's 6 million people.
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> after the two lands were partitioned following the end of
British colonial rule in <DATE>1947</DATE>. Srinagar and the surrounding areas
of the valley became part of Indian-held Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Moslems make up <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 880 million population and
Hindus comprise <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT>. Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists make up
the rest.
   Kashmiri militants earlier campaigned for union with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,
but now demand independence and the status of a neutral nation.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has fought two wars with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>.

   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will be prepared for ``any

nations escalate, Prime Minister <PERSON>V.P. Singh</PERSON> warned <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has deployed radars and armored regiments close to the

over the northern region of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> along their border.
   <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> had already ``sounded a red alert, which is the last
word'' on war preparations, <PERSON>Singh</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Pakistani Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official labeled
<PERSON>Singh</PERSON>'s allegations as a ``figment of (his) imagination.''
   Singh's statements proved that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was trying to provoke a
war, said the official, who by practice cannot be named.

<LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, 425 miles northeast of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. Khan is a member of
former Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   Khan was set free because of ``mounting pressure'' by security
forces, the news agency said without elaborating.

militants exploded near an army truck, wounding three soldiers,
police said.

last week. Moslem separatists had demanded the release of three
rebels in exchange for the men, but the government refused.
   In the past week, police have detained more than 1,000 people in
their search, security officials said.
   Kashmir is disputed by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, and two of their
three wars were focused on the region, now divided by a cease-fire
line monitored by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>.
   Moslem separatists in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> say they want an independent
country, attached neither to <LOCATION>Moslem Pakistan</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, whose
population is <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> Hindu.
   At least 270 people have been killed since the government
launched a crackdown on Moslem separatists in the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> valley in
<DATE>January</DATE>.
   Crowds filled the streets in villages in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>,
shouting anti-Indian slogans, and security forces were rushed in.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   Army vehicles went door-to-door in <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION>, the center of the
separatist campaign, offering food to residents who have been
forced to stay indoors since <DATE>April 7</DATE>, the day after the kidnappings
occurred. But residents in several sections of the city refused the
food, shouting anti-government slogans and calling for <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
independence.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> with a Moslem majority.
