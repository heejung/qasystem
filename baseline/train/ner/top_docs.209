<LEADPARA>  IN 1857, Elisha G. Otis invented the passenger elevator. Fifteen years later,
William LeBaron Jenny designed the first skyscraper, a 10-story structure.;   
Naturally, someone had to invent the elevator before someone could build a

<TEXT>     If these seemingly disparate historical tidbits attract you, then leaf
through "The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Public Library Desk Reference," a book full of
surprises. It is based on the more than 5 million questions the library and
its 82 branches answer each year.;    <PERSON>Vartan Gregorian</PERSON>, former president and
chief executive officer of the library, writes in his preface, ". . . unlike
annuals and almanacs that need revising and updating each year, the <ORGANIZATION>Desk
Reference</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Stonesong Press</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$34.95</MONEY>) holds a considerable amount of true
reference information, unchanging basic facts and background.;    "We also
hope that our book will be easy to read and fun to browse through.";    It
is.;    For instance, if you know <PERSON>Thomas Alva Edison</PERSON> invented the phonograph
in <DATE>1878</DATE>, you will be pleased to know <PERSON>L.O. Colvin</PERSON>  invented the milking machine
the same year, and <PERSON>James J. Ritty</PERSON>  invented the cash register the year after
that.;    These were heady times, a veritable cascade of brainstorms. But
every year was like that.;    For instance, last year was the 110th birthday
of the hearing aid, and the 120th for linoleum and the snap button. It also
was the 100th anniversary of motion pictures and the electric subway. It was
the 90th anniversary of the paper clip.;    This year is the 100th birthday of
the flashlight (by <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bristol Electric Lamp Co.</ORGANIZATION>), the aluminum boat (by
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Escher Wyss &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>) and the zipper (by <PERSON>Whitcombe L. Judson</PERSON>).;   
The Desk Reference has less esoteric fare. It tells you how to write your
member of congress and how to call toll-free for rental cars and hotels. There
are 15 pages of visa requirements to travel anywhere from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> to
Zimbabwe.;    There is an illustrated section on the human anatomy and one on
how to play board games from backgammon to Scrabble or cards  from blackjack
to solitaire.;    There is simply no way to list all of the tidy bits of
information from dietary tables to musical terms and symbols,  from extinct
animals to semaphore, from etiquette to legal forms, from animal first aid to
a directory of poison control centers.;    It's also a settler of arguments.
Take religion: The book says there are 648 million Hindus, 18 million Jews,
840 million Muslims, 158 million Orthodox Catholics, 307 million Buddhists and
5.6 million followers of Confucius.;    In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, there are 31
million Baptists, 2.7 million Episcopalians, 13.5 million Methodists, 2.8
million Mormons, 8 million Lutherans and 700,000 Jehovah's Witnesses. But
worldwide, there are 900 million Roman Catholics, the largest <ORGANIZATION>Christian Church</ORGANIZATION>
in the world. It takes 6 1/2 pages to list all the popes.;    One thing that
strikes the reader is how long ago some of the inventions sprang from the
human mind. And what in the world did mankind do before they came along?;   
We were blessed with the screwdriver and wrench about 1550 by unknown
gunsmiths.  </TEXT>

   A 22{-foot-tall paper clip was unveiled
outside a business college <DATE>Monday</DATE> to honor the Norwegian who
invented the office helper 90 years ago.
   The paper clip, weighing a desk-crushing 1,320 pounds, is a

<P>
Most days, mail call at our house is a ho-hum event. Only an occasional letter 
breaks the monotony of all those catalogues, credit-card applications, 
sweepstakes entries, and <LOCATION>Cape Cod</LOCATION> time-share lures that burden our mail carrier 
and quickly fill our wastebaskets. 
</P>
<P>
But several times a month an oversize envelope bearing a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> postmark and 
the familiar handwriting of one of my parents appears in the mailbox. Instantly 
my spirits rise: another batch of clippings! 
</P>
<P>
For more years than I can remember, my parents and I have been trading 
clippings the way boys trade baseball cards. In the beginning, we simply 
enclosed an article or two in the same envelope with a letter. But gradually, 
as we spent more time talking on the telephone and less time writing letters, 
the clippings assumed a life of their own. Now bulky <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> envelopes regularly 
wing their way between our respective ZIP codes, carrying everything from 
editorials, political cartoons and interviews to columns, book reviews, and 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
The best packets of clippings are, in fact, like a balanced meal, offering 
something nutritious -- a well-argued op-ed piece, perhaps -- topped off with 
something light and sweet such as a cartoon or comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with scissors and a ballpoint, veteran clippers approach each day's 
newspaper with enthusiasm. We read. We clip. We underline. We write relevant, 
and sometimes funny, comments in the margins. We also attach yellow Post-It 
notes explaining our choices or amplifying points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network Expands 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, my network of newsprint pen pals has expanded. In a typical 
week, I might save an article about a major auction for an aunt and uncle in 
<LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> who collect antiques. For my sister, a high school Spanish teacher in 
<LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, I may clip a travel story about museums in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>. A New 
Yorker cartoon about cats and a story on <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION>'s controversial new video will 
be tucked into the next letter to our daughter at college. And the latest 
position paper on the <ORGANIZATION>Great Books</ORGANIZATION> controversy will find its way into an 
envelope for a self-improvement enthusiast in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most dedicated clipper knows better than to think that borrowed words 
on folded newsprint can ever take the place of a real letter containing 
personal news and private opinions. But for those of us whose busy schedules 
allow little time for proper correspondence -- and who have the phone bills to 
prove it -- these patchwork collections, custom-tailored to the recipient, can 
serve as love notes on the run. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees, of course. There are those who disdain the smudgy 
practice, harrumphing all the way to the post office that only a handwritten 
letter in the 18th-Century manner constitutes a proper communication with 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
But as a veteran collector of mailable tidbits, I disagree. I like to think of 
a clipping as a compliment, a shorthand way of saying, "You're in my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, a collection of clippings forms a mosaic, creating a portrait of the 
sender. In our choice of articles and jokes and photos, we give ourselves away, 
revealing our senses of humor, our politics, our serious and not-so-serious 
interests. Indirectly we are saying, "This is who I am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coded Messages 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, as we choose subjects of interest to the recipient, we are 
saying, "This is who I think you are; send me a clipping if you think I'm 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
On sensitive subjects, clippings can serve as diplomatically coded messages. My 
mother, for instance, might send a page from a catalogue with the notation, "I 
think these curtains could look very nice in your family room." An article on 
overwork, passed along without comment, is her oblique way of expressing 
maternal concern. 
</P>
<P>
As a daughter, I love this particular form of conversation with my mother. So 
charmed am I by her mastery of the game that one Mother's Day I sent her a 
sterling silver paper clipper -- the perfect gift from one clipper to another.

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: At the sharp end of a supply chain - Dave Madden
explains how United Stationers has turned the distribution of its goods into
a fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distribution is one of the duller business ghettos - dusty warehouses,
broken pallets and diesel oil. But the image, and the reality, are beginning
to change.
As <ORGANIZATION>Fiat</ORGANIZATION> shows off its robot-controlled inventory stacks in glossy
advertisements and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> switches off the lights in its automated warehouse in
<LOCATION>Greenock</LOCATION>, it is clear that this <LOCATION>Cinderella</LOCATION> operation has a new set of
high-tech glad rags.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s high street retailer Marks and <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON> has long appreciated that
sophisticated distribution processes are an important part of supply chain
management. They influence customer loyalty, product differentiation and
profit margins. According to <PERSON>Lee Iacocca</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>: 'The company
with the best distribution systems and service level will win all the
marbles.'
In short, advanced logistics is no longer a luxury. One consequence of this
shift is the emergence of a new type of wholesale service company where
distribution is just as important as the product that is shipped.
Take paper clips. If you are an office products wholesaler, how do you get
retailers to buy such a simple, undifferentiated item from you, rather than
from any number of your competitors?
The answer, in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> at least, is 'value-added' distribution. <ORGANIZATION>United
Stationers</ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest office products distributor, can sell and
ship a single pencil or one box of paper clips and still make a profit.
The same is true on all 25,000 items in its catalogue, from pens to filing
cabinets. And if a customer places an order by 6.00 pm it will be delivered
by 9.00 am the next morning to any location in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
Not surprisingly, this demands an extensive physical operation. <ORGANIZATION>United
Stationers</ORGANIZATION>, based near <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, sells products from around 400 manufacturers
to some 10,000 retailers across the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, via 14 regional distribution
centres.
This physical network is entirely dependent on a complex computing and
telecommunications infrastructure: <ORGANIZATION>Amdahl</ORGANIZATION> 5995 and <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> 3090 mainframes
supported by robotic storage devices from <ORGANIZATION>Storage Technology</ORGANIZATION> as well as
telephone and satellite communications networks. In all an incremental
investment of some Dollars 200m (Pounds 115m).
United's customers obtain information on the company's inventory via a
computer network which connects their machines to <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s system of 1,400
PCs. This automates the ordering process and allows clients to see whether
<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> has a particular product in stock.
'Our customers enter upwards of 70 per cent of our orders for us,' says
<PERSON>Patrick Murray</PERSON>, IT vice president. 'We do it in lots of different ways. We
talk to everybody's computer. We do it in batch mode, we do it online -
however a customer requires it.'
Ultimately, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> expects <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s terminals to be on the desks of his
customers' customers too, and he intends to apply the same technology to
links with his own suppliers.
Ordering is only part of the value-added process. The sooner the retailer
knows that <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> has shipped goods, the sooner he can bill his customer and
collect his money, says <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>. Similarly <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> uses the system to get the
latest manufacturers' pricing information to these retailers, so that they
can manage their prices too.
Giving retailers such access to and control over the ordering and inventory
process, and the imperative to turn orders around in hours, has had serious
implications for <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s warehousing operation.
Items are not stored in pre-defined areas. Rather, they are put in the next
available bin, as dictated by <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s disparate product range: boxes of
pencils and desks do not take up the same shaped space. The warehouse map is
computer-controlled and the system tracks every individual batch of items.
Surprisingly, this random binning is not completely arbitrary. The system is
able to analyse the inventory and track 'hot' products - high moving items -
and guide them to where they are most accessible.
When a piece of inventory is manually put into store, staff use radio
frequency data entry terminals, complete with bar-coded reading guns, to
update the control system directly on line.
The logical extension of all this, says <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>, is to use similar tools and
the same bar code in the transportation and delivery process so that a
driver can verify that the right carton has been dropped at the right door,
and give proof of delivery. United hopes to introduce such an innovation
this year.
The same integrated technology feeds <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s sales and marketing effort.
Its primary marketing tool is a catalogue of products, and <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> publishes
and distributes some 4m copies a year.
But because the catalogue becomes out of date almost immediately after it is
issued (with products being added or dropped), <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> has to provide regular
updates. He is hoping in the near future, however, to produce an electronic
catalogue, with colour pictures, dimension data and moving price
information.
At the hub of <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION>'s operation is a central IT development and operations
staff. Typically this is pared to the bone - <DATE>40</DATE> people to manage data and
voice communications, systems operations and a help desk (there is no
computer expertise in the regional centres). In addition, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> has 100
staff in applications development and product introduction.
The effect of this technological commitment is two fold, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> says. First,
<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> has grown significantly - it is now a Dollars 1bn company, and one of
just four national office products distributors in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. Second, its
technology culture has enabled <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> to set pioneering service levels.
For example, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> explains: 'We are doing lots of small orders. About 80
per cent of what we sell is not in the same packaging that it came to us in.
We don't sell a whole carton of paper - we'll sell one ream. Now the service
we provide for our reseller says you go out to each of your customers and
you take the orders the way they want them.
'You send the orders to us and we'll package them in such a way that they
can be delivered directly to the end user and you don't have to add labour.
When we put the label on the box the label says it came from you not from
us. Our dealer doesn't have to handle the merchandise at all. The most
profitable dealer is the guy who never sees the merchandise, absolutely
never sees it at all.'
The downside is that higher expectations become institutionalised. Because
<ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> delivers anywhere in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> by the following day, and guarantees to
be in stock on all of its inventory, that has become the service norm.
Similarly United cannot afford to let up on its technical innovation. Murray
claims that the company currently has a lead of six to 12 months, but 'the
competition is pretty good at copying - so we better have the next thing
coming up to keep the gap open. To get the order we've got to be the easiest
company to do business with,' he says.

<HEAD>Ban On Jailhouse Smoking Has Inmates Fuming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after smoking was outlawed in
the <LOCATION>Josephine County Jail</LOCATION>, the inmates are fuming, but the jailers
are smiling.
   Jail Commander <PERSON>Mark Dickson</PERSON> said inmates are fighting less and
are much healthier since cigarettes _ jailhouse currency for
generations _ were taken away.
   ``In fact, I have had far more inmates come up to me since this
was issued and thank us for the policy, because it forced them to
quit smoking,'' <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Inmate <PERSON>Ron Wise</PERSON> wasn't one of them.
   ``It's unconstitutional deprivation, in my way of thinking,'' he
said. ``The sheriff has taken it upon himself to decide what's good
for us.''
   <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> said the jail was the first in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to outlaw tobacco,
but others have followed suit. He estimated <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of the
inmates smoked when they entered jail.
   Inmates found smuggling in tobacco aren't punished; the goods are
merely confiscated, <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> said.
   Blackened electrical outlets are evidence that some cigarettes
are getting in. Inmates who can find something to smoke but don't
have matches put a paper clip in the outlet, then draw a spark with
another paper clip, <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> said.
   One inmate was so desparate for a smoke he rolled herbal tea in
toilet paper and lit up, the commander said.
   With cigarettes out of the way, the jail is cutting back on
caffeine. Coffee with caffeine is no longer available at lunch and
will soon be gone from the dinner table.
   ``I think we have an obligation to maintain the healthiest
environment possible,'' <PERSON>Dickson</PERSON> said.

A jury of nine women and three men deliberated for 5 1/2 hours <DATE>Friday</DATE> without

</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Gerhard A. Gesell</PERSON> excused the jurors for the day and

Asks for <ORGANIZATION>Paper Clips

<P>
Jury</ORGANIZATION> foreman <PERSON>Denise Anderson</PERSON> sent <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> a note <DATE>Friday</DATE> asking for additional 
note pads, pencils and paper clips -- and requesting lunch at the same time 
each day -- indicating that deliberations on the 12 criminal counts against 
North in the Iran-Contra case may take several days. Jurors are being 
sequestered at night in a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson added that "everyone would like a copy of the instructions" that 
<PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> read to the jury <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> agreed to furnish duplicates of the 
approximately 40-page text. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an alternate juror who was present for all eight weeks of testimony 
said she would have voted to convict North on at least some of the charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Horasina McKie</PERSON>, one of five alternates dismissed when the case went to the 
regular jury on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, said that, in accordance with the judge's 
instructions, she had not discussed the evidence with other jurors.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: KEEPSAKES MUST BE KEPT SAFELY

Among the keepsakes of genealogists are photographs of ancestors and paper 
certificates, documents and newspaper clippings. However, if they are 
improperly stored, they will not last long enough to be a treasure of 
generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
Attics and basements are the worst places to store keepsakes. Valuable photos 
should be kept where temperature, humidity and light levels are low. Color 
prints are best stored below 75 degrees Fahrenheit and <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> humidity, and in the 
dark. Avoid using plastic storage containers that may contain polyvinyl 
chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Acid-neutral boxes and envelopes are available. If you use envelopes and 
sleeves to hold your photos and slides, be sure they are made of acid-neutral 
paper, or polyester, archival polyethylene, or triacetate plastic film. 
</P>
<P>
Use photo albums with acid-neutral pages and avoid waxed pages. Adhesive tape, 
white glue, rubber cement, paper clips and mothballs or crystals can damage 
your photos. To label photos on the backside before storing or displaying -- 
and all your photographs should be identified with names, dates and places -- 
use a soft No. 1 pencil and press lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Copy old photos first, then store the negatives in a dark place. 
Black-and-white negatives will last a long time if well cared for. However, 
color slides may last only 10 to 50 years, depending on care. 
</P>
<P>
Use acid-free materials when mounting newspaper clippings and other paper 
items. Pastes made from flour and water, wheat or rice are less acidic and less 
damaging than most other pastes. However, they are subject to mildew and 
household pest damage, and may bubble or ripple the item. Linen tape can be 
used for mounting. Find an art supply store for these supplies. Before using 
anything on a valuable item, test each product for any initial staining or 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Photocopies of clippings can be mounted in scrapbooks, but the originals should 
be placed in a dark storage container.

If you want to know specifically what your antiques, collectibles or keepsakes 
are worth and to document their value, you will need the services of a personal 
property appraiser. Appraisers of antique and collectible keepsakes should be 
specialists. Spend as much time finding a qualified appraiser as you would 
looking for a professional in any field. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have obtained an appraisal, it should be dated, signed by the 
appraiser, along with the purpose of the appraisal and the qualities and 
disinterest of the appraiser noted. Keep the appraisal in your safety deposit 
box.

   Boris Yeltsin, who first proposed a joint SDI program with
the U.S., is looking for a solution to another nuclear threat
on his -- and our -- hands. What to do with the Russian
nuclear engineers and scientists who reportedly are getting
lucrative offers to relocate to Third World capitals? Russian
academic Evygeny Belikov says that while top scientists
aren't hopping on planes just yet, the country's nuclear
brain trust of some 3,000 people has a network of unsavory
contacts. It was the Russians, for example, who worked on
fusion for Moammar Gadhafi. Russians can use the threat of
rogue scientists as a sales pitch for Western financial aid,
but we have a better idea: Operation Paper Clip. After the
Second World War, Britain and the U.S. cooperated in this
program to buy off, de-Nazify and relocate Hitler's
rocket-builders, including Wernher von Braun. Let's do it
again, for Russians. The cost could be low considering that
Moscow pays even its best nuclear scientists about $100 a
month at the ruble's current depressed rate. Ignoring the
opportunity could mean facing the results of Ivan Rocket
Scientist's work from Baghdad or Tripoli.

Blue Cross of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has the blues because it thinks that the press is 
ignoring it, but the health insurer isn't suffering in silence. In a recent 
letter to the editor of the trade paper <ORGANIZATION>Managed HealthCare</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Blue Cross</ORGANIZATION> Chief 
Executive <PERSON>Leonard D. Schaeffer</PERSON> complimented the editors for a recent article on 
the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Cross/Blue Shield</ORGANIZATION> system. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "as usual, the Chicago-based Blue Cross and <ORGANIZATION>Blue Shield 
Assn.</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Plan were interviewed for the article. We were not 
contacted, even though <ORGANIZATION>Blue Cross of California</ORGANIZATION> has more members in managed 
care than any other 'Blue' Plan." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, <ORGANIZATION>Blue Cross</ORGANIZATION>'s public relations agency has been sending letters to 
editors offering interviews with the chairman, who is described as "the 
architect of a stunning two-year turnaround of the once-failing health 
insurance giant."

<P>
A Royal Pain for Imperial 
</P>
<P>
Things are tough enough in the banking and thrift business without having 
people confuse you with a troubled operation. 
</P>
<P>
The woes at <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Savings &amp; Loan</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> are causing headaches for 
at least two unrelated <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> institutions, <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Thrift &amp; 
Loan</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Burbank</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, the bank, is making sure people know that it has no ties to Imperial, 
the savings and loan. Its ads now include a paragraph in large letters: 
"Imperial Bank is not -- nor has it ever been -- affiliated with <ORGANIZATION>Imperial 
Savings &amp; Loan</ORGANIZATION> or its parent, <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
And Trouble at <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Too 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Bancorp</ORGANIZATION> suffers from a similar problem. <PERSON>John J. Keating</PERSON>, 
chief executive of the <LOCATION>Encino</LOCATION> holding company for <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, says, 
"I've got the double whammy." Customers and others muddle his bank's name with 
that of <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan</ORGANIZATION>, and they confuse him with <PERSON>Charles H. 
Keating Jr.</PERSON>, the controversial chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>S&amp;L</ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. The 
two are not related. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Bancorp</ORGANIZATION>'s board wants to change the institution's name. There's an 
employee contest to rename the bank, but no one has yet won the prize, a 
Hawaiian vacation. Several suggestions were turned down. So was a consultant 
who offered to come up with a new name for <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Bear <PERSON>Stearns</PERSON>' Miserly Ways 
</P>
<P>
In the current severe slump of the securities industry, the Wall Street firm 
<ORGANIZATION>Bear Stearns Cos.</ORGANIZATION> is one of the relatively few prospering brokerages. This is 
in part because of the notorious penny-pinching ways of the firm's chairman and 
chief executive, <ORGANIZATION>Alan C.</ORGANIZATION> (Ace) <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON>. Staffers complain that paper clips, 
pencils and rubber bands are in short supply. Employees are told to save paper 
clips from incoming mail. Now <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON> has carried the campaign a step 
further: Employees recently received notification that they will have to turn 
their frequent-flyer miles from business trips back to the company to be used 
to pay for other business trips. But one staff member said it probably won't 
make much difference to most employees. "People never have time to even take 
vacations," the executive said.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elmer Booze strides onto the concert stage for
another virtuoso performance, but nobody applauds. He shares the
spotlight but never takes a bow. His name doesn't even appear in
the program.
   So what? The guy spends most of the evening staring at the sheet
music and wetting his thumb and forefinger. Big deal.
   Any pianist, though, will say that <PERSON>Elmer Booze</PERSON> really is a big
deal. He is a professional page turner, one of the most
indispensable _ and most anonymous _ figures in the musical world.
   Booze, 57, a small, soft-spoken man who wears gold-rimmed
glasses, has turned the pages of musical scores for <PERSON>Aaron Copland</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Rudolf Serkin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andre Watts</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leon Fleisher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bella Davidovich</PERSON> and
hundreds of other musicians for nearly a quarter-century.
   He turned pages for opera singer <ORGANIZATION>Leontyne Price</ORGANIZATION>'s accompanist at
a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> recital for President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>. He's been a consultant
and resident page turner for the annual summer <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>) Music
Festival for the past 14 years.
   He's a regular at concert series at the <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery of Art</ORGANIZATION>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Library of
Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. He has flown to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to sit
at the elbow of concert pianists who insisted that only Elmer Booze
would do.
   An accomplished pianist himself, with music degrees from two
universities, Booze is content to labor in the shadows of the
keyboard giants.
   A colleague at the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION>, where Booze works during
the day as a senior reference librarian in the music division,
proudly calls him ``a world-renowned page turner.'' Booze modestly
dismisses such extravagant praise.
   ``For me, it's a job that anybody can do,'' he said. ``But
apparently that's not entirely true. I've talked to pianists who
say they can't turn pages. It makes them very nervous.''
   By contrast, Booze sits on the edge of his chair with
unflappable ease as the pianist struggles through stormy
fortissimos and crashing arpeggios.
   ``Pianists want someone with them in their greatest moment of
need, when they've gotten to the last note on the page,'' he said.
   That's the moment when Booze shifts into a low crouch and, with
a lightning thrust of the arm, flips to the next page and returns
to his seat. His movements are so unobtrusive that one pianist
calls him ``the ghost.''
   A good page turner must be skilled in reading a musical score,
Booze says, and a rehearsal is helpful to become familiar with the
pianist's eccentricities.
   Does he memorize the score? (Chamber music is rarely played from
memory, Booze says.) Are the pianist's jerks and nods a signal to
turn the page, or is he simply getting carried away with the music?
Are the pages old and brittle? Do they stick together?
   Onstage, he says, a page turner should keep his eyes on the
music and maintain ``a certain decorum'' to put the pianist at ease.
   ``If there's panic in your eyes, you can believe the pianist
will panic, too,'' he said. ``The last thing he needs is a spastic
page turner.''
   Despite the page turner's best efforts, disasters do happen.
Booze recalls the nightmarish evening of the missing paper clip.
   His pianist had promised in the dressing room of the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Center Concert Hall</ORGANIZATION> to insert a paper clip in the score of a
devilishly complex work by <PERSON>Franz Liszt</PERSON> for two pianos. At the point
when Booze was supposed to turn back 20 pages for a repeat in the
second movement, the paper clip wasn't there.
   ``It was something to behold,'' he said. ``He was going like a
bat out of hell. His arms were in my way and mine were in his,
trying to find the exact page. Both pianists stopped playing, and
the whole thing came to a screeching halt. It was not a good show.''
   Booze has left his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned during concerts ever
since he rose from his chair to turn a page for <PERSON>Aaron Copland</PERSON> and a
button popped onto the keyboard while the composer was performing
at the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   Booze turned another anxious moment into a tour de force that
garnered the first and only ovation he has ever received from an
audience.
   When he and a pianist took their seats at the <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION> festival,
they discovered that the piano's music rack had been removed and
was nowhere to be found. So Booze became a human music rack,
holding up photocopies of each page of the score.
   When the piece was finished, the festival president leaped to
her feet. ``Let's all clap for Elmer,'' she shouted, and the page
turner shyly emerged from the shadows to accept his acclaim.

<HEAD>Artist Paints Tiny Portraits on Baseballs, Rice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Dave Stevens</PERSON> has an acute eye for art.
   He also has great acuity of vision _ <DATE>20-17</DATE> to be exact _ which
enables him to paint tiny portraits on grains of rice, watch faces
and the heads of pins.
   His miniature portrait of <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis Cardinal</ORGANIZATION> shortstop <PERSON>Ozzie
Smith</PERSON> on a grain of rice is enshrined in the <LOCATION>St. Louis Baseball
Hall</LOCATION> of Fame.
   Now his attention has turned to bigger things: portraits of
Cardinals manager <PERSON>Whitey Herzog</PERSON> on baseballs.
   ``<PERSON>Herzog</PERSON> has a banquet coming up at the end of <DATE>May</DATE>. I have to do
seven dozen portraits in seven weeks,'' he said, dipping a tiny
brush into a palette.
   The Alton artist painted 100 baseballs with <PERSON>Herzog</PERSON>'s likeness
for the manager last year. Herzog auctioned them off to benefit the
<ORGANIZATION>YMCA</ORGANIZATION>.
   A baseball card serves as <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON>' inspiration and he creates
his art on a TV tray in his living room. It takes <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> about one
hour to paint <PERSON>Herzog</PERSON>'s portrait on the back of a regulation
baseball.
   ``I do it over and over so they're not identical, but I want
them as close as possible,'' he says.
   Stevens collects <MONEY>$25</MONEY> per portrait, not including the cost of the
ball.
   He doesn't limit his subjects to baseball players or baseballs.
His favorite effort: a grinning <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> on the head of a
straight pin.
   ``I've done portraits on old lockets and inside pocket watch
covers,'' he said. ``Once I took the crystal out and painted a
player in the batting stance on the face of a watch. I made the bat
on the big hand and the ball with all the stitchings on the end of
the small hand,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Steven</PERSON>'s smallest painting is a skull and crossbones on the tip
of a paper clip for a motorcycle rider.
   ``I read the smallest painting in the world is on the head of a
pin, so I used the paper clip. The wire tip is as small as a shaft
of the pin,'' the artist said.
   Most of his ideas come from customers who want, for example, a
portrait of an anniversary couple on rice or a color drawing of a
favorite car encased on a belt buckle, <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> began creating miniature art six years ago out of
boredom.
   ``It was one of those weekends in <DATE>August</DATE> when nothing was on TV
and I had been asleep on the couch,'' he said. ``I painted a scene
on a stone the size of a quarter and it snowballed after that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
Where others see trash, <PERSON>Lucy Cordova</PERSON> sees a pair of earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Bicycle tires, old records, paper clips -- no common object is too lowly for 
her lobes. 
</P>
<P>
"I make earrings out of things you wouldn't normally think they're made of," 
says the 27-year-old woman. "People don't recognize the materials. They touch 
them and say, 'Oh, they're bicycle tires!' " 
</P>
<P>
Once she has finished applying paint, glitter, pearls and rhinestones to her 
designs, few people recognize the earrings for what they are: junk. Only on 
closer inspection does one see the tread of a tire, the grooves from an old 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"I just get things around the house," she says. "I broke a glass in the kitchen 
one day and when I saw the pieces I said, 'Hey, I can use these as earrings!' " 
</P>
<P>
Her glitzy, gaudy designs are strictly for fun. One pair features three roving 
eyeballs, the plastic kind found on small stuffed toys. She sells her earrings 
on torn pieces of cardboard under the name Junque for <MONEY>$5</MONEY> to <MONEY>$10</MONEY> a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean it to be trashy," she says. That's why she gave "junk" a faux 
French spelling. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova's fetish for earrings led her to create the Junque line. 
</P>
<P>
"I love earrings. I have 80 pairs, and I didn't get my ears pierced until I was 
19," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, she bought a pair of earrings made from warped record fragments 
in a department store. She lost one of the earrings and couldn't find a pair to 
replace them. That's when she decided to make the earrings herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a couple pairs and wore them to work at a nightclub," she says. "My 
co-workers saw them and said, 'Make some for us.' I started selling them that 
way." Since then, she has expanded her line to include all kinds of everyday 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
Her method for transforming records into earrings is not terribly 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
She holds a disposable lighter underneath the record to soften the vinyl, then 
cuts it with a scissors into the shape she wants. Then she melts the piece 
again to create funky waves and folds. Often, one can still see the grooves in 
the vinyl on the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to see they are records, so the lines show," <PERSON>Cordova</PERSON> explains. 
</P>
<P>
Old records have proven the perfect medium for her big earrings, which can 
measure several inches in length and diameter. Not only is the vinyl material 
malleable, it's light enough not to weight down one's lobes. 
</P>
<P>
She buys the record albums for about <MONEY>50 cents</MONEY> each at swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know who these people are," she says. "But I think I melted 
<PERSON>Rickie Lee Jones</PERSON> once." 
</P>
<P>
After she has worked the vinyl into the desired shape, she decorates it with 
paint, rhinestones, sequins, glitter, and even small screws and bolts. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova adorned one pair with white lace and seed pearls. Only the black vinyl 
kept them from looking like something out of a bridal magazine. 
</P>
<P>
She has painted some with old fingernail polish and coated others with 
"webbing," a spray paint that gives a lacy effect. 
</P>
<P>
Once she found an old chain in her father's garage, cut it up and attached the 
links to her earrings. She wraps geometric-shaped pieces of vinyl with scraps 
of suede donated by a friend, then sprinkles rhinestones and beads onto the 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
As a finishing touch, she often substitutes a paper clip for the conventional 
earring hook. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova cuts up bicycle tires and decorates them in similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I buy the tires new," she says. "I couldn't use old ones -- they'd be flat and 
dirty." 
</P>
<P>
While shopping at a home supply store, she bought a vinyl floor tile and turned 
it into earrings too. 
</P>
<P>
She also makes earrings out of paper. She moistens heavy, watercolor paper, 
bends it into wavy abstract shapes and lets it dry. Then she paints the 
hardened paper and douses it with glitter. One pair of pink and purple squares 
has a raised cross and iridescent sparkles. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at things and think, 'Gosh, what can I do with this?' " she says, 
holding up a plastic bottle that she has cut up for future earrings. 
</P>
<P>
All of <ORGANIZATION>Cordova</ORGANIZATION>'s designs are big, gaudy and fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I like big earrings." 
</P>
<P>
One pair features fragments of an old 33 rpm folded and painted with silver 
webbing. A triangle-shaped pair comes in teal-colored suede littered with a 
small rhinestone, beads and a narrow strip of iridescent film. 
</P>
<P>
"The earrings are good conversation pieces," <PERSON>Cordova</PERSON> says. "A girl looked at me 
the other day and said, 'You put a paper clip through your ear?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I like them." 
</P>
<P>
She's also started making bolo ties out of records. The vinyl's warped shapes 
suit bolos perfectly and appeal to men who want a different look when they're 
trolling the nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
Junque sells at <ORGANIZATION>Total Effect 'n' Fashion</ORGANIZATION> at <DATE>1142</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>N. Brookhurst St.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova concedes that her disposable earrings are not for everyone. They're for 
people who, like her, prefer clothes and costume jewelry that are "trendy and 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a certain kind of person," she notes.

<DESCRIPT>  FAMILY; EDUCATION; SCIENCE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  LAST WEEK I mentioned that no one, no scientist or teacher, knows precisely
why the Earth behaves like a giant magnet. But we have learned a lot about
magnets in general, ever since our ancestors thousands of years ago unearthed
some strange black rocks that seemed to hold an invisible and mysterious power
over any particles or pieces of iron.;   The Greek philosopher Thales
(THAY-leez) was one of the first to study the properties of this mineral, and
since he obtained his samples from an area called Magnesia, he called the
mineral "magnes," from which we get our word "magnet" as well as the modern
name for this iron oxide, "magnetite."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  East Extra  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DRAW CURIOSITY TO MAGNETS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Also ran in EX1/3, EX4/4, WL4; Education; Family Learning  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In more recent centuries this material was known as "lodestone," which
meant a "leading stone," because when it was allowed to move freely, it would
point in a northerly direction, and so could "lead" ships on their proper
course.;   Having a compass and a bar magnet or two around the house is a
great way to tap your children's innate curiosity about the physical world,
and to encourage them to investigate and experiment with "hands-on" science as
well. It also provides parents a way to practice a set of behaviors that will
encourage children to learn for themselves.;   Amazing phenomenon the first
time;   The first time that children see a magnet pick up a thumbtack off a
table from an inch or two away, they will be amazed, but they will not have an
uncontrollable need to know the scientific explanation for this phenomenon.;  
Parents who launch right into a discussion of "lines of force" and "magnetic
poles" will miss the opportunity to have their children experience for
themselves the effect that this magnet has on a variety of materials. But if,
instead, you try the magnet on objects -- a wooden match, a paper clip,
various coins, some staples, toothpicks, safety pins, stamps, whatever is at
hand -- and preface each trial with a question like "What do you think will
happen if we try . . . ?" then your children will get a feeling for what
magnetism is. And, you will get a feeling for asking encouraging, open-ended
questions.;   We all have to make a conscious effort at developing this
questioning skill, precisely because it is so easy to lean in the other
direction and "tell" rather than "ask." Sometimes we phrase our questions so
that we are really "telling" instead of "asking" at all: "Isn't it true that .
. . ?" "Don't you think that . . . ?" or "Wouldn't it be better if . . . ?";  
Ask questions that lead to thinking;   These questions don't lead the child to
do any thinking at all, but questions that call for a prediction, and
questions like "What do you think is happening here?" certainly do. Let your
children feel the tug between two bar magnets, then turn one magnet around and
have them experience for themselves what the words "repel" and "repulsion"
feel like and mean. (How about repulsive?);   Hang a chain of paper clips or
tacks from the ends of your magnet. Can you make the same length chain closer
to the middle? How many will hang from the exact middle? "What do you think
will happen if . . . ?";   Have them see whether the magnet's power to move
tacks or clips will extend through various substances such as glass, plastic,
water and wood. "What materials do you think might block the magnet's power?";
  There are many books in the 538 section of the juvenile collection of your
library that will describe other experiments you and your children can do with
magnets and with a compass. There are no books, however, that will tell you
what questions to ask in each instance, but with a little practice, you won't
need them, either.  </TEXT>

   Taking a rare active role in an ongoing
federal investigation, President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> told top law enforcement
officials <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to move ``as rapidly as possible'' to get the
facts in a burgeoning <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> two years ago that he did not want
lawmakers ``scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet'' in the
defense budget, was described by spokesman <PERSON>Marlim Fitzwater</PERSON> as
``very concerned'' about allegations of bribe-paying and kickbacks.
   ``I think we're all aware of the wide scope of this
investigation,'' <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said, ``and it certainly poses an
internal security problem and an abuse problem of dimensions that
have to be dealt with forthrightly.''
   ``I'm just not at liberty to expand on any of the details,'' he
said when asked to elaborate.
   Federal investigators armed with evidence from two years' worth
of wiretaps and this week's coast-to-coast raids are preparing to
approach witnesses who now may be forced to cooperate in the probe.
   The investigation has turned up ``rampant bribery in the
government'' and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of
cars and payments of bills for government employees, <PERSON>Sen. John
Warner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, the ranking Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION>Armed
Services Committee</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> believes this is a matter ``that deserves
his attention, and that everyone involved should know of his
feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds
of crimes that have been committed here.''
   Government sources familiar with the probe said searches of
offices of 15 defense contractors on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> stemmed from wiretaps
on the offices of two top <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> officials. The bugs have been in
place for much of the two-year investigation.
   Reagan in <DATE>1985</DATE> created a commission to study ways to streamline
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> operations. The panel, headed by industrialist and former
<ORGANIZATION>Deputy Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>David Packard</PERSON>, recommended a stronger hand
for the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION> and a new civilian
office to oversee <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> purchasing.
   The commission also recommended that there be less
``micromanagement'' of the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> _ and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said
he agreed with that.
   ``Instead of scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet,
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should give more thought to our overall defense needs and
strategy,'' he said.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> met with Attorney General <PERSON>Edwin Meese III</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>William Sessions</PERSON> and top <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>
prosecutors. He had met <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Frank C.
Carlucci</PERSON>.
   Reagan seldom has involved himself directly in investigations of
alleged wrongdoing, although he was interviewed by a commission
that probed the Iran-Contra affair.
   <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said the president had not been told about the
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> investigation at its outset, but was not disturbed by that.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> starts hundreds of investigations that are carried out
over a long period of time. The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> is not aware of most,
if not all of, those investigations,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said ``there always comes a time when any
investigation, when it's presented to the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> for
criminal action or whether it's presented to a grand jury for
possible indictment, it becomes known to the civilian authority,
whether it's the president or the head of the agency or the bureau
or whatever.
   ``I'm sure that in this case, it was simply their judgment that
this was the right time to make it known to the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said the president was ``satisfied that the bureau has
acted with the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Investigative Service</ORGANIZATION> quickly and effectively
and pursued this investigation.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: FBI Seized Bomb Materials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REX, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents seized items that could be used to
make a pipe bomb such as those that killed a federal judge and
civil rights lawyer during a search of property owned by a man
convicted 18 years ago of possessing a similar bomb, a newspaper
reported.
   The <LOCATION>Atlanta Constitution</LOCATION> quoted federal sources it did not
identify in today's editions as saying laboratory tests are pending
to establish whether the items found on the property of <PERSON>Walter
Leroy Moody Jr.</PERSON> match the two bombs that exploded in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   Moody denied any connection with the bombs, his lawyer said.
   The bombs sent through the mail killed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Circuit Court <PERSON>Judge
Robert Vance</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and lawyer <PERSON>Robert Robinson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Savannah</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION>.
Two other bombs were safely intercepted.
   Investigators confiscated 2{-inch pipe, six-penny nails, rubber
bands, alarm wire, flashlight bulbs, bolts, paper clips,
gunpowder-packed bullets and welding machinery _ all similar to
items used to make the mail bombs, the newspaper said.
   Also seized were adhesives, brown paper, labels, tape and
``old'' string, the paper reported. Similar materials _
particularly a unique string that has not been manufactured for
about seven years _ were used on the packages in which the four
bombs were mailed.
   The Constitution, in a story also copyrighted by <ORGANIZATION>The Atlanta
Journal</ORGANIZATION>, reported that agents seized the following:
   _Seventeen 25-cent ``flag over Yosemite'' postage stamps in the
pocketbook of <PERSON>Susan McBride</PERSON>, who lives with <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>. That stamp was
used on all four package bombs.
   _A desktop copier. Photocopied, typewritten letters from a
purported group calling itself ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System'' were sent after the bombings.
   _Highlighted newspaper clippings about the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>'s investigation
of <PERSON>Robert Wayne O'Ferrell</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Enterprise</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, junk-store owner
whose home and business were searched <DATE>last month</DATE> and who has been
questioned repeatedly. O'Ferrell denies any knowledge of the bomb
attacks.
   _Two typewriters that were examined on the scene and determined
not to match the ones used by ``Americans for a <ORGANIZATION>Competent Federal
Judicial System</ORGANIZATION>.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>, reached at his <LOCATION>Clayton County</LOCATION> home, referred inquiries to
his attorney, <PERSON>Michael C. Ford</PERSON>.
   ``I don't see anything there that I see as significant,'' <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>
said of the seized items. ``They found brown paper. Well, I hope
they don't search my office. I probably have some of that, too.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said two motions were filed in federal court <DATE>Monday</DATE> seeking
the return of <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>'s property and attacking the searches as
faulty. He said <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION> has no connection to the bomb attacks.
   <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION>, 55, a self-employed literary consultant, was convicted in
<DATE>1972</DATE> of possessing a pipe bomb that the newspaper's sources said is
very similar to the <DATE>December</DATE> package bombs. He was acquitted on a
charge of building the bomb, which injured his then-wife, <PERSON>Hazel</PERSON>, in
their <LOCATION>Macon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, home.
   In his appeals in that case, court records show <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION> was
extremely critical of the attorney, judges and government agents
associated with his case.
   During an interview <DATE>Friday</DATE> with WSB-TV, <ORGANIZATION>Moody</ORGANIZATION> said,
``Criticizing the court is not an unhealthy practice, I don't
think. I think it's unhealthy when you say, `If you don't rule my
way, then I'm going to send you a bomb.' That's ridiculous.''
   Moody served nearly three years in the <LOCATION>Atlanta Federal
Penitentiary</LOCATION> on the bomb possession conviction but maintains his
innocence. He is representing himself in asking the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> to throw out his conviction after an 11th <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> panel denied his third appeal in <DATE>June</DATE>. <PERSON>Vance</PERSON> was not on
that panel.

A MEDICAL system which could enable doctors to test for illnesses in their
surgery - without sending blood or urine samples off to the laboratory - won
a team of scientists at the <PERSON>Wolfson</PERSON> research laboratories at <ORGANIZATION>Birmingham
University</ORGANIZATION> the top prize in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> year of invention competition.
The printed liquidic circuit system - resembling a large electronic circuit
 -uses standard chemistry tests, but carries them out automatically in a
single device - unlike previous more complicated methods.
The device consists of a single layer of filter paper on to which a pattern
of wax tracks is printed, defining the channels through which the body fluid
flows. The device contains a layer of antibodies to which the antigens in
the blood or urine, if present, bind. At the end of the test a colourmetric
device shows whether antigens are present.
A FIFTEEN-year-old schoolboy won the schools category of the awards with an
energy-saving device which could cut the electricity bills of schools and
factories.
After noticing that the lights at a local school were often left switched on
at <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Richard Mead</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Cheltenham College</ORGANIZATION>, set about designing a series
of clips which can be attached over the lighting circuits in the fuse boxes.
Attached on top of the wiring insulation the clips detect the magnetic field
when power passes through the wiring. The clips in turn are wired to a
central electronic box with a series of red lights on the top. When the
lights are left on, corresponding ones on the box light up too.
A HAND-HELD instrument which helps owners of oil rigs or power stations to
cut their repair bills won two divers the individual award category.
The device, sold by <ORGANIZATION>Instrument and Inspection Services</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, is used
by repair workers carrying out remedial grinding on huge metal joints - a
process in which the sharp edges of the cracked surface are smoothed away to
help prevent further deterioration. The gauge accurately calculates the
thickness of the metal left by subtracting the depth of the grinding from
the metal remaining.
THE small business category of the <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba</ORGANIZATION> awards was won by <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
architect <PERSON>Brian Perry</PERSON> for developing a fire escape system using
non-incandescent light. Intended for use in public places, the continuous
luminescent beams can be used to identify escape routes and can be activated
automatically by fire or smoke detectors.
The non-incandescent light becomes highly visible when the minute particles
present in smoke and dust from the fire act as a diffuser.

<HEAD>Southwest Airlines Report Features Punch-Out Fun</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In addition to the facts and figures formally
found in a firm's annual report, <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Airlines Co.</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>1988</DATE>
features fun, in the form of a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the
most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said <PERSON>Tim
McClure</PERSON>, executive creative director of <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> advertising agency
<ORGANIZATION>GSD&amp;M</ORGANIZATION>, which designed the report.
   The booklet, besides reporting on <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>'s record <MONEY>$57.95
million</MONEY> in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from
the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble
<ORGANIZATION>Shamu One</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>'s ``flying whale'' jet rolled out <DATE>last year</DATE>
during the airline's promotion of <ORGANIZATION>Sea World</ORGANIZATION> theme parks in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> will
want one?'' asked <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION>Charlotte Goddard</ORGANIZATION>. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman <PERSON>Herb Kelleher</PERSON> throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of <ORGANIZATION>Shamu One</ORGANIZATION>.
   On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusually
painted plane, with assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint:''
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(<ORGANIZATION>Shamu One</ORGANIZATION>'s, not his).''
   Even though <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> previously has taken a light approach to
its reports, <PERSON>McClure</PERSON> said it was a little difficult this year to
sell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, ``once someone
punches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.''
   He said he persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> that the unusual idea would
become enticing. ``Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call up
for one.''
   ``I think it's a delightful brochure and something that really
shows the personality that <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> is,'' <PERSON>McClure</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION>, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people,
is based at <LOCATION>Love Field</LOCATION> near downtown <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and operates a
distinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.

<TEXT>
   One of just two known sets of the records
of one of the last chapters of World War II is slowly falling apart.
   The brittle, yellowing records include copies of the briefs filed
by attorneys in the <ORGANIZATION>International Military Tribunal</ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>
_ a panel of judges from 11 countries who tried <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s military and
civilian leaders for war crimes.
   Printed on inexpensive paper and bound by string or paper clips,
they sit in two file cabinets in the rare book room of <ORGANIZATION>Gonzaga
University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Crosby Library</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The quality of the paper and the printing is such that they
will decay over time,'' said <PERSON>Bob Burr</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Gonzaga</ORGANIZATION>'s library director.
   Burr, convinced the documents have great historical value, said
he is seeking grants to help preserve them. The documents include
the indictments and verdicts against 28 Japanese leaders and a
129-page list of atrocities committed against prisoners.
   They were apparently reproduced on a type of mimeograph machine,
using whatever paper was available in war-torn <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> between <DATE>1946</DATE>
and <DATE>1948</DATE>.
   The only other known copy of the tribunal records is in the
<ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION>, unindexed and reproduced on the same cheap paper.
   The documents were donated to the university last year by <PERSON>Daniel
Mahoney</PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION> attorney whose late father, <PERSON>Willis
Mahoney</PERSON>, was acting chief prosecutor at the trials' conclusion.
   The tribunal was the Japanese counterpart of the Nuremburg trials
of the <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> high command. It convicted 25 Japanese leaders,
including War Minister <PERSON>Hideki Tojo</PERSON>, who was ordered executed along
with six others.
   Others were sentenced to prison for life or given long sentences.
   Although complete records of the <DATE>1946</DATE> Nuremburg trials have been
published, the records of the Far East tribunal have not, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.
   ``It's an asset that's priceless,'' <PERSON>Mahoney</PERSON> said. ``I don't want
anything to happen to it.''
   His father, a lawyer, went to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1946</DATE> to assist chief
prosecutor <PERSON>Joseph Keenan</PERSON>, and became acting chief prosecutor when
<PERSON>Keenan</PERSON> fell ill.
   When the trials concluded, the elder <PERSON>Mahoney</PERSON> sent one set of
records to the <ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION> and brought another set home to
<LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>. He later gave the set to his son, with instructions
they eventually be donated to <LOCATION>Gonzaga</LOCATION>, where both Mahoneys attended
law school.
   ``I've read very little, but the little I've read is
fascinating,'' <PERSON>Mahoney</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he may seek grants to place the documents on microfilm,
a project that is tentatively estimated to cost as much as <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>.

<TEXT>     Corporations such as <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> are helping employees move their offices to
attics, basements or spare bedrooms. Some people are even forsaking their tax
deduction (the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> requires a separate room for a legal deduction) and are
setting up offices in portions of living and dining rooms, master bedrooms and
master baths.;   <DATE>Just five years ago</DATE>, if you needed furniture to set up shop
at home, your choices were greatly limited. The focus was more on the
utilitarian -- a no-frills clerical look rather than executive.;   <DATE>Today</DATE>,
you'll find a range of pieces designed for home-office spaces. There are
drop-leaf, wall-mounted desks that can be installed in a kitchen corner and
can moonlight as mini-bars, as well as basic black laminate office systems
tucked into converted bedrooms. There are lateral file cabinets in a rainbow
of colors, even in marbleized and granite-look finishes. You'll also see
elegant mahogany desks and nail-studded leather chairs.;   You can create an
instant office by shopping in department stores; specialty stores, such as
<ORGANIZATION>Crate &amp; Barrel</ORGANIZATION>; or even in catalogs. Spiegel's fall and winter catalog
features 12 pages of office furnishings. <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION> has a 16-page pullout.
And the 5-year-old Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Reliable Home Office</ORGANIZATION>, whose catalog reaches
10 million consumers, mixes standard commodities such as fax machines and
electronic Rolodexes with arts and crafts-inspired desks that double as dining
tables, glass-topped desks with Greco-Roman stonelike pedestal bases, chairs,
lamps, and snazzy supplies such as marbleized file folders, lavender legal
pads, neon orange paper clips and hot-pink staplers.;   Whatever space you've
designated as your home office demands the same design courtesy as any other
room -- especially if it's in a high-traffic, high-visibility spot.;   Of
course, the electronic age has brought challenges. Hiding the computer,
peripheral equipment and cables has become as much of a design challenge as
stashing away the television set.;   Much of the furniture designed specially
for computers has been, until recently, largely uninspired. Most of it fell in
the category of ready-to-assemble.;   "Some of these are so chintzy-looking
and badly designed that people wouldn't even put them in their basements,"
said one furniture executive. "They're looking for the same detailing and
hand-worked finishes they have in their other furnishings.";   However, things
are looking up. The down-sizing of computers and components is prompting
manufacturers to modify proportions and deliver more style.;   With its <DATE>spring</DATE>
catalog, <ORGANIZATION>J.C. Penney</ORGANIZATION> discovered that consumers are hungry for style -- desks,
chairs and cabinets whose design, finish and details wouldn't seem awkward or
inferior. A group of traditional executive-style furniture in cherry finish
with brass-finished hardwood was featured at <MONEY>$499.</MONEY>;   "The response surprised
us," said <PERSON>Patricia Treiber Shaw</PERSON>, home-furnishings consultant for the catalog.
"The group has done very, very well. There obviously is a need for people who
are working at home. They don't want to have ugly stuff sitting in a corner.
They want their furnishings to go with the rest of the home.";   Even the
styling of the basic desk chair has gone beyond the swivel. A recent model by
<ORGANIZATION>Girsberger Industries</ORGANIZATION>, for example, has a rounded silhouette and vivid red
upholstery. But it has more than streamlined form: A triple-jointed mechanism
allows the chair to move freely (it also can be locked into position), and it
has pneumatically adjustable height (a gas cylinder makes the adjustment at
the touch of a lever), all designed in an elastic material with a thinner
profile. It retails for <MONEY>$800</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,300</MONEY>, depending on materials and whether the
chair has arms.;   Still, some consumers say furniture designed for the office
is too hard-edged for the home and that residential furniture can't quite get
down to business, so they opt to customize their home offices.;   The results
can be smashing. <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> interior designer Vassa started with an old-fashioned
banker's desk in an office she planned for a family in a contemporary suburban
home. But she gave it an non-traditional look with modern materials -- a
metallic laminate that matches the bookshelves that line two walls; the top is
inlaid with leather.;   Actually, a fabric was the starting point for the
design.;   "The geometric-pattern, with its metallic gray, bronze and zippy
blue, gave us an Old World flavor as well as a contemporary feeling," said
<PERSON>Vassa</PERSON>, who coined the term "hoffice" to describe this kind of space that she's
designed for eight years.;   <ORGANIZATION>Vassa</ORGANIZATION> makes sure there is adequate lighting,
always on dimmers. Both residential and contract office furnishings
manufacturers sell lighting. Task lighting in the form of a desk lamp is
essential.;   Halogens (those tiny low-voltage lights that are popular not
only for their sexy looks but because people like their white light), come in
a variety of architectural or sculptural styles with high-tech looks. Some
offer dimmers. There are classic banker's lamps, in brass or black, some
updated for halogens.;   Stylish home offices demand equally fashionable
accessories. That means everything from desk blotters to tape dispensers to
paper-clip holders, even the phone itself.;   "We've taken the approach of the
humanized home office," said <PERSON>Bette Frank Rosenberg</PERSON>, home fashion director for
<ORGANIZATION>Spiegel Inc.</ORGANIZATION> "It's important to bring a little personality into the home
office. Nobody likes to work in a sterile environment. Pretty picture frames,
fun executive toys (electronics, gadgets), small-screen TVs and, yes, even art
-- are very important. We want to offer a functional environment that's
organized, uncluttered and convenient, yet expresses someone's personality."; 
 So if you shop wisely, you'll soon be sitting pretty in your home office,
probably thinking, "There's no place like hoffice."  </TEXT>

The children chose bold names for their airplanes: Supersonic Spyplane, 391 
Speedbird and Jetski III. Although these planes were made of flimsy white 
paper, their young pilots took them as seriously as the shuttles they hope to 
ride into outer space someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be an astronaut," said <PERSON>Jesus Sanchez</PERSON>, 8. "I want to explore." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and about 14 other members of the Young Astronaut Program flew the 
paper planes in a contest <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in the yard of the <ORGANIZATION>E.P. Foster Elementary 
School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide program for elementary and junior high school students promotes 
science, mathematics and space-related subjects. The effort is intended to help 
reverse the low proficiency levels of American students in these subjects, 
compared with children in other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The students' creations were judged by the school's principal and two reading 
specialists on the planes' distance, speed and fancy acrobatics. Using scissors 
and thin white paper, the students designed the planes, adding ridges and folds 
that enabled the aircraft to dip and glide in strange patterns. Paper clips 
mounted to the folds increased the planes' speed. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's F-14 Tomcat, an intricately folded plane, earned him the title of 
overall winner and first place in the distance category and second place in 
acrobatics. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's peers also expressed an avid interest in aviation. <PERSON>Mario Pena</PERSON>, who 
placed third in distance, said he too wanted to go into space. "I'd like to see 
the planets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winning planes flew 20 to 30 feet, and some remained in the air for more than 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher <PERSON>Catharine Byl</PERSON> began a chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>Young Astronauts Program</ORGANIZATION> at the 
school in <DATE>February</DATE> and has helped about 20 second- and third-grade students 
build model space shuttles, understand gravity and weightlessness and 
experiment with team-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real need for kids today to improve in those areas," she said, 
adding that aerospace and aviation will be among the major fields in the future 
as the technological revolution continues. 
</P>
<P>
Byl has been active in the <ORGANIZATION>Eagle</ORGANIZATION> Flight Program, an organization that trains 
classroom teachers to instruct other teachers on methods to teach aerospace in 
the classroom.

Foster Principal <PERSON>Greg Kampf</PERSON> said he has never disciplined a student for flying 
paper airplanes in the classroom. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

FT  30 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Getting the green light -
A look at three companies which have become environmentally aware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HESTER THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coming from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to manage <PERSON>Berger Aus Berg</PERSON>, manufacturers of metal
drum closures in <LOCATION>Peterlee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Co Durham</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Richard Swart</PERSON> arrived with fresh eyes.
He was immediately aware of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s different seasons and dark winter
afternoons, plus the toll they take on energy consumption - not least of all
in his factory.
At the same time, <PERSON>Swart</PERSON> discovered that while environmental issues are not
as high on the South African agenda, in the UK his company was operating in
the packaging industry - which is acutely environmentally conscious. Linking
the need to tackle <PERSON>Berger Aus Berg</PERSON>'s energy consumption with a need to learn
more about environmental issues, he decided it was time to review the
company's environmental practices.
Increasingly, companies are paying more attention to their environmental
performance. While many do it to ensure they are meeting UK and <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> legal
requirements, others are interested in quantifying their environmental
impact and using the information to maintain good relations with their local
community, customers, suppliers or even investors. Companies which have
their sights set on achieving BS <DATE>7750</DATE> - a recently published British
standard for <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Management Systems</ORGANIZATION> - or other similar schemes,
know they must first set their house in order.
Ironically, when <ORGANIZATION>Hedda Bird formed Conservation Papers</ORGANIZATION> in Reading in <DATE>1988</DATE>
the last thing she thought about was 'making the company greener than
green'. This was despite the fact that it was operating in an
environmentally conscious area, marketing recycled paper to the business
community. Yet within six months her attitude changed. 'Everyone - including
us - rapidly became much more sophisticated and knowledgeable about
environmental issues,' she recalls.
Three years later, <PERSON>Dorothy Mackenzie</PERSON> formed the London-based marketing
consultancy <ORGANIZATION>Dragon International</ORGANIZATION>, which is run on environmentally friendly
lines. 'We provide environmental consultancy,' explains <PERSON>Mackenzie</PERSON>, 'and to
have credibility with clients we needed to practice what we preached.'
Although all three companies have analysed their environmental practices,
only <PERSON>Berger Aus Berg</PERSON> has paid for an independent environmental review. Last
<DATE>summer</DATE> it commissioned <ORGANIZATION>Groundwork Foundation's Environmental Review Service</ORGANIZATION>
to see what environmental improvements could be made. The review took three
days with <PERSON>Groundwork</PERSON> - which is supported by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Environment</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Countryside Commission</ORGANIZATION> - looking at energy use, waste management,
legal compliance, recycling and potential cost savings.
<PERSON>Swart</PERSON> has already implemented several of Groundwork's recommendations. For
example, it advised the company to reduce its energy consumption by altering
the factory's lighting. The factory had previously had to have all its
lights on when only half were needed. Swart expects future electricity bills
for lighting to be 50 per cent less and will recoup his investment within
eight months.
Groundwork also advised the company to take pallets and bags it receives
from suppliers and re-use them when sending products to its customers. This
it has done with impressive results. In the past, most transport packaging
costs were passed on to customers. By re-using packaging the costs have been
significantly reduced. Customers have been informed about this reduction in
charges.
At <ORGANIZATION>Conservation Papers</ORGANIZATION>, staff had been running the company along
environmental lines to the best of their abilities. However, in <DATE>1992</DATE> they
adopted a more formal approach and joined an <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Business
Challenge</ORGANIZATION>, launched by <ORGANIZATION>Reading Borough Council</ORGANIZATION>, to help companies develop
and implement an environmental policy. 'It gave us a structure to work
with,' says Bird, 'and most of the changes we've made have been as a result
of it.' In an attempt to reduce its energy consumption by up to 15 per cent,
<ORGANIZATION>Conservation Papers</ORGANIZATION> has taken some simple steps, turning down thermostats
and switching off heating at weekends.
'At <ORGANIZATION>Dragon International</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mackenzie</PERSON> and her colleagues assessed the
environmental impact of all they did from the first day. Setting the company
up, they purchased second-hand 'recycled' furniture - furniture which does
not contain tropical hardwoods, bought a photocopier for double-sided copies
and decided against supplying company cars. Staff are encouraged to use
bicycles or public transport.
The company buys recycled non-chlorine bleached paper, re-uses scrap paper,
re-cycles its paper and laser printer toner cartridges, fits long-life light
bulbs, uses environmentally sensitive cleaning equipment and supplies china
rather than disposable cups.
Being environmentally sensitive brings costs with it. <PERSON>Berger Aus Berg</PERSON> has
spent Pounds 600 on an electrician's bill and Pounds 150 on <ORGANIZATION>Groundwork</ORGANIZATION>'s
fees. Conservation Papers spent Pounds 70 on automatic door closures. <ORGANIZATION>Dragon
International</ORGANIZATION>'s main expenditure will be on better insulation and a more
efficient boiler for its offices costing several hundred pounds.
Although all the companies have spent several hours discussing environmental
practices with staff, none has found the process disruptive. 'Everyone
starts thinking along the same lines,' explains <PERSON>Mackenzie</PERSON>. <PERSON>Swart</PERSON> has seen
his employees change their attitudes. 'At first they were curious about the
review,' he says. 'Now they tell me what we can do to make further
environmental improvements.'
There are other benefits too. All the companies have reduced their overheads
by implementing energy saving measures and all expect to recoup the
investment within two years in lower energy bills.
Perhaps what is surprising is how many benefits have been gained through
relatively few changes. To a large extent these companies have simply made
sure their housekeeping is in good order - albeit under an environmental
umbrella.
Although none has gone out of its way to promote the changes, all the
companies expect that one day they will have to justify their environmental
practices. To that end they are continuing their environmental programmes.
EASY STEPS TO IMPROVING A COMPANY'S ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES
Review energy efficiency. Reduce consumption by turning down the thermostats
and turn off un-needed lights and equipment.
Encourage employees to re-use as much equipment as possible - paper-clips,
scrap paper, elastic bands, bull-dog clips etc.
See whether there are ways to reduce waste or generate a further income by
selling your waste as scrap.
Reduce vehicle use. Encourage staff to use public transport or walk. If
employees live locally, set up a company bike scheme.
Review purchasing policy. For example could you save money or improve your
public image by consider purchasing recycled paper. Only buy ozone-friendly
products and cleaning materials which are free of phosphates and are readily
biodegradable.
Reduce paper usage. Encourage staff to write on both sides of any paper and
use double-sided photocopies when sending long memos.
Recycle paper, glass, plastics and cans.

   Heard on the Street:
   Investors Go on a Shopping Spree for Stocks
   Of No-Frills Retailers, but Caveat Emptor

SPECIALTY RETAILERS (OTS)

<LP>
   Warehouse clubs are a hot concept, but even they have
winners and losers. Remember all the look-alike hamburger
joints in the 1970s? Most have disappeared.
   Investors looking for winners in no-frills retailing now
have to pick and choose carefully among companies such as
Price Co., Staples Inc., Home Depot and their many imitators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With so many shoppers feeling poorer these days, the
no-frills specialty retailers are in big favor with
investors. Warehouse stores and home-improvement and
office-supply discounters offer people and small businesses
more value for a dollar. Some discounters with a profitable
niche have kept growing in recent years even in such
depressed places as <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, so they're stars in the
mostly dismal retail picture.
   "Good concepts gain market share in recession," says the
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> money manager <PERSON>Michael Esposito</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>BEM Management</ORGANIZATION>, a
big fan of <ORGANIZATION>Price Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Waban</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Office Depot</ORGANIZATION> and other specialty
discounters.
   Recently, <ORGANIZATION>Tiger Management</ORGANIZATION> boosted an already big stake in
<LOCATION>Staples</LOCATION>. Several <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity Investments</ORGANIZATION> funds have been buying
many popular specialty discounters for some time. "These guys
have built a better mousetrap; recession will impact most
retailers, but them less than most," says <PERSON>Michael Gordon</PERSON>, an
analyst at <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>.
   But what price should investors pay to play the no-frills
retailing fashion? Home Depot and <ORGANIZATION>Costco Wholesale</ORGANIZATION>, among the
fastest-growing specialty discounters, sell at around 20
times estimated profit for calendar <DATE>1991</DATE>. In this market,
many unpopular stocks sell at less than 10 times earnings.
   Of course, many cheap stocks aren't going anywhere. "If a
company is growing three times faster than average, I say
it's a bargain" even if its stock costs twice as much, based
on earnings, as the average stock, contends BEM's <PERSON>Mr.
Esposito</PERSON>. But promises of growth don't always pan out.
   Earlier this week, shares of office suppliers <ORGANIZATION>Bizmart Inc.</ORGANIZATION>
and Staples got clipped after analysts cut their profit
estimates for those companies. (Both are buying stores from
<ORGANIZATION>HQ Office Supplies Warehouse</ORGANIZATION>, a weak competitor, and
<ORGANIZATION>Bizmart</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>December</DATE> sales were disappointing.) And the
do-it-yourself home-improvement play, except for <ORGANIZATION>Home Depot</ORGANIZATION>,
has been a minefield for investors, with <ORGANIZATION>Hechinger</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lowe's
Cos.</ORGANIZATION> tumbling far from their <DATE>1990</DATE> peaks.
   The golden rule, says the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> money manager <PERSON>Jim
Mair</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> Growth Fund: Stick with leading companies
such as <ORGANIZATION>Price Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Home Depot</ORGANIZATION>. And beware of hot concepts
such as office-supply discounting, which so far is
"unproven," he says.
   <ORGANIZATION>Price Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which pioneered warehouse clubs, is many
people's favorite. Its stock already has soared in recent
months, but the company seems to promise fast growth. It has
started opening a lot of new stores and its profit could grow
in coming years at <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> annually, says <ORGANIZATION>Fidelity</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr.
Gordon</PERSON>. He thinks <ORGANIZATION>Price Co.</ORGANIZATION>, at 38 1/4 yesterday, could earn
<MONEY>$3</MONEY> a share in calendar <DATE>1991</DATE>, and the stock could be worth 15
to 20 times that number, he says.
   <ORGANIZATION>Costco</ORGANIZATION> shares are hitting the ceiling that even
growth-hungry fund managers will pay, and in recent months
the venture capitalists who helped to bankroll <ORGANIZATION>Costco</ORGANIZATION> have
trimmed their stakes. As yet, few bears are bold enough to
bet against the warehouse dynamo. But its lightning growth
could slow if competitors make a grab for some of its
markets, some money managers say.
   Shares of <ORGANIZATION>Waban</ORGANIZATION>, with its <ORGANIZATION>BJ</ORGANIZATION>'s wholesale clubs, are deemed
bargains. The company hasn't been thriving; its warehouse
clubs and home centers both are facing tough competition. But
some fans say <ORGANIZATION>Waban</ORGANIZATION> is on the right track now; others think
the company eventually will be taken over. Retailing giants
such as <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart Stores</ORGANIZATION> and K mart have been adding to their
warehouse clubs, of course, though recently, <ORGANIZATION>Great Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Tea</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to buy half of shaky <ORGANIZATION>Warehouse Club</ORGANIZATION> fell
through.
   In theory, more shoppers in a recession will flock to all
kinds of specialty discounters. Fans of office suppliers say
they're good bets if they're well-run and financially sound.
Staples, for instance, intends to pay cash for nine new
stores in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   But already some analysts see signs that small-business
customers are spending less at each trip to an office
supplier. (Sales at established stores are the trend to
watch; investors buy and sell retail stocks based on that.)
In tough times, bears say, many small businesses skimp on
paper and paper clips; others go out of business entirely.
   In home centers, the leader is Home Depot, a Wall Street
darling. But <PERSON>Michael Murphy</PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION>Overpriced
Stock Service</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, has sold short Home Depot
stock, which was at 37 3/8 yesterday; he hopes to buy it back
eventually at as low as 20. Though Home Depot offers good
value and service, it has been expanding too fast in rocky
real estate markets, he thinks. People who are losing their
jobs or taking paper losses on their houses tend to delay
remodeling their homes, he says.
   <PERSON>Mr. Murphy</PERSON> expresses many investors' misgivings when he
says that people who own high-priced shares such as Home
Depot and <ORGANIZATION>Costco</ORGANIZATION> have sky-high expectations: "When they get a
disappointment in sales, the stocks could get smashed."

SILHOUETTING: THE KINDEST CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: AN OLD FORM OF DRAWING, IT MAY EXTEND TO BACK TO THE FIRST SHADOW 
TRACINGS. YET ONLY A FEW CAN MAKE THEIR LIVING AT CLIPPING THE FACIAL OUTLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BENNETT, Bennett is a Southland free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In about 30 seconds, <PERSON>Harry Bryce</PERSON>, the main silhouette artist at <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> for 
the past 21 years, can snip the likeness of any man, woman or child out of 
black paper. 
</P>
<P>
The paper portraits of more than 1 million people have been captured by <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> 
throughout his silhouetting career, and in his Main Street studio at 
<LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, the famous profiles of <ORGANIZATION>Red Skelton</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldie Hawn</ORGANIZATION> and Cher all have 
been trimmed to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But for <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>, the unknown or obscure face is the one that often leaves the 
most indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
"A widow came in asking if I could do a silhouette of her husband," <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Sure, where's the photograph?' And she said, 'I don't have one, but 
maybe I can describe him to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bryce went to work with paper and scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I made the silhouette as large as I could. I gave him a full head of 
hair and made his lips and nose a little larger than I thought they should be. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I showed it to her and she said, 'Now could you trim this and trim that,' 
and I kept working it down and working it down, until she said, 'You know, 
that's pretty doggone close.' " 
</P>
<P>
But another time, rendering the silhouette of a young man sitting directly in 
front of him didn't prove any less trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd call him a dwarf or a midget, but the guy had had some kind of 
accident or some natural impairment on his upper lip; it was literally missing. 
He had nothing but teeth and gums up to the nose area." 
</P>
<P>
Bryce cut out exactly what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off the chair and he shook my hand and said, 'I really thank you. I'm 
so sick and tired of people trying to give me something I don't have. This is 
the first time anybody's ever done me exactly as I look -- and I know what I 
look like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Silhouetting, an old art, has remained popular with the public for several 
reasons. For <PERSON>Jim Griffin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Duarte</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$3</MONEY> sitting fee fits handsomely into 
his family budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to <PERSON>Olan Mills</PERSON> (portrait studio) for a fraction of the cost," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the <MONEY>$3</MONEY> buys two silhouettes. By folding the 5-by-8-inch paper in 
half, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> produces a duplicate silhouette facing the opposite direction. An 
oval frame is an additional <MONEY>$4.75</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Beth Barton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>, whose 8-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Kelli</PERSON>, recently sat for 
<PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>, said she values the silhouette for what she's not getting. "You look at 
it, and you fill in what you can't see. That's the beauty of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bryce: "Silhouette cutting is to photography what radio is to TV; 
frankly, some things are better left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland may be the only place in the <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> to have your silhouette cut, 
said <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>, who estimates that about 25 silhouettists nationwide try to make a 
living at it. But <PERSON>Bonnie Elliott</PERSON>, who began as an apprentice silhouette artist 
at <ORGANIZATION>Old Towne Mall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Torrance</LOCATION> 17 years ago and now works part time as a 
silhouette cutter at <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>, thinks the number may be closer to 250. Both 
artists know of no other operating silhouette studio in the greater <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
area. 
</P>
<P>
That <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> has one of the few surviving silhouette studios attests to the 
vision of founder <PERSON>Walt Disney</PERSON>, who frequently referred to "shadow drawing" as 
the origin of all art forms, said <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"He imagined -- and it's only a guess -- that prehistoric (people) probably 
drew their first pictures by tracing their shadows on the wall," said <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>. 
That is basically "what we're doing now, except we don't use the shadow, we 
just use the (facial) outline." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Peggy Hickman</PERSON>, in her book "Silhouettes" (<ORGANIZATION>Walker and Co.</ORGANIZATION>), cites examples of 
black profiles on Etruscan pottery and Egyptian murals as evidence that humans 
have made shadow portraits since the dawn of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The word silhouette to describe a shadow portrait, she writes, is comparatively 
modern, coined in the <DATE>19th Century</DATE> from the name of <ORGANIZATION>Etienne de Silhouette</ORGANIZATION> 
(1709-67), a frugal French controller-general whose favorite pastime was the 
cutting of profiles from black paper. De Silhouette did not invent the art, 
<PERSON>Hickman</PERSON> writes, but his name was applied to it derisively by those who 
considered profiles in miniature a cheap imitation of art. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the public, however, silhouettes were inexpensive mementos to be 
exchanged as freely as snapshots are today. 
</P>
<P>
Giving further impetus to shadow portraits was the publication between <DATE>1775</DATE> and 
<DATE>1778</DATE> of <PERSON>Johann Casper Lavater</PERSON>'s "Essay on Physiognomy Calculated to Extend the 
Knowledge and Love of <LOCATION>Mankind</LOCATION>." In the 34-pound leather-bound tome, <PERSON>Lavater</PERSON> 
argued that plain black profiles were the most penetrating guide to character 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Although weighty reading, the book was illustrated with several silhouettes 
and, consequently, people rushed to have their profiles drawn in hope of 
deciphering their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Hickman</PERSON>, Lavater -- with the assistance of the German poet Goethe, 
himself an amateur profilist -- invented a special silhouette chair designed to 
keep the subject's head rigid. 
</P>
<P>
But not all silhouettes were rapid impressions cut from paper. Just as often, 
silhouettes were painted on ovals of chalk-like plaster, on the reverse sides 
of convex glass and on cards. Portrait silhouettes also decorated fine china 
and expensive jewelry, including rings, brooches, bracelets, lockets, tie-pins, 
card cases and snuff boxes. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, traveling profilists usually painted on cards or cut with scissors, 
because transporting breakable plaster and glass by horse was too risky, 
<PERSON>Hickman</PERSON> writes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these limitations, one of the first visiting silhouette artists to 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, English Maj. <PERSON>John Andre</PERSON> (1751-81), cut profiles of <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> 
and <LOCATION>George Washington</LOCATION>. (<LOCATION>Andre</LOCATION> later became embroiled in the treacheries of 
<PERSON>Benedict Arnold</PERSON> and was executed after his capture by American forces.) 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of photography in the <DATE>1850s</DATE>, the demand for silhouettes 
declined. Similarly, the introduction of gas and electricity contributed to the 
disappearance of silhouette making as a hobby because, <PERSON>Hickman</PERSON> notes, "modern 
overhead lighting banished the deep shadows which amateur profilists had found 
so invitingly thrown on walls by lamp and candlelight." 
</P>
<P>
Today, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> and other practitioners of the art of silhouette rely on 
both the artistic and entertainment values of their craft to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a nickel for every time people used the word 'amazing' to describe 
what I do, I'd be a wealthy person," <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce has cut as many as 503 impressions in a single day; <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> once did 472. 
As artists on commission, they receive a percentage of each one. When his work 
schedule at <ORGANIZATION>Disneyland</ORGANIZATION> permits, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> cuts silhouettes at birthdays, bar 
mitzvahs, weddings, graduations and proms, charging <MONEY>$85</MONEY> an hour with a two-hour 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said he also would like to teach a class on silhouetting at a community 
college because "the art of silhouette cutting is dying out and there's 
virtually no one around to teach it." 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors to their <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> studio are surprised to learn that <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> use only paper and scissors and not special effects to produce 
silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to see a big light projecting a shadow on a wall or screen," said 
<PERSON>Lisa Casco</PERSON>, a 21-year-old college student from <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, who recently 
visited <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION>. "I thought they would trace my outline and fill it in with 
chalk or charcoal -- you know, the way we did it in elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON>, who is an art school graduate, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> is self-taught and 
maintains he can teach the art of silhouette cutting to anyone in eight to 10 
weeks. In fact, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>, who trained the two silhouettists now employed at the 
<LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, said he prefers teaching students who can't draw. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find someone who draws, they want to put perspective and give it a 
three-dimensional quality," <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said. "They want to add tones and lights and 
darks, but you need none of that in silhouette." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Elliott</PERSON>, who has cut silhouettes in as little as 17 seconds, compares 
silhouette cutting to riding a bicycle: "You have to develop a certain speed 
and balance; otherwise, you fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott cuts quickly from the bottom up, moving from the base of the neck, to 
the middle of the chin, to underneath the nose, to the eyelashes and finally to 
the top of the head. While bulbous noses, sagging chins and protruding 
foreheads all make the final cut, wrinkles, scars and gray hair vanish with the 
flick of the scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the trick is to keep it all in proportion," <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the speed in cutting is to prevent the artist from 
"noodling" -- the temptation to trim or cut more than what the artist sees. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way we're like haircutters," <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> added. "Once you cut it off, you 
can't put it back." 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elliott</PERSON> may succeed in getting subjects into the studio, 
getting them to take a seat is an art form all in itself. For example, there 
are profile-conscious adults who refuse to be positioned with their "bad side" 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to explain that a silhouette is just one line around the outside of 
their face, identical for either side, but some people refuse to believe it," 
<PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Some silhouette subjects feel compelled to brush their hair or apply a fresh 
coat of makeup before posing. "Of course, it doesn't make any difference how 
much rouge or lipstick they put on," <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said, "but you can't tell 'em that." 
</P>
<P>
When a man and woman appear in the same silhouette, the man's head usually goes 
in front. "This way I can give more detail to the back of a woman's head, which 
is more interesting than a man's," <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Also placed in front in a double silhouette is <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>'s most 
requested Disney character. "He wouldn't fit anywhere else," said <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON>, who 
also can cut <PERSON>Minnie Mouse</PERSON>, <PERSON>Donald Duck</PERSON>, Goofy and the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> cast 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizable film stars, who rarely take a back seat to anyone, present a 
challenge to the silhouette artist. "Celebrities are very hard to do because 
you know their other expressions," <PERSON>Bryce</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce's wife is another subject who avoids easy depiction: "I know her every 
perfection or imperfection -- however you want to take it -- so I'm never 
completely satisfied. I'll rework it, then overwork it and start over again. 
It's just very frustrating. It's much easier to do a complete stranger." 
</P>
<P>
And about himself: Was he able to capture his own likeness? 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it," he said.

<TEXT>
   There has been much argument over the past two
decades about the exact merits of ``Sesame Street,'' but none over
the crucial role <PERSON>Jim Henson</PERSON>'s Muppets played in the television
program's phenomenal popularity.
   It was unclear <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> what affect <PERSON>Henson</PERSON>'s death would have
on the program, which is produced by the <ORGANIZATION>Children's Television
Workshop</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There's no way of telling,'' said <PERSON>Mary Sue Holland</PERSON>, a
spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>CTW</ORGANIZATION>. ``We honestly don't know.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 foreign nations. It has been estimated that about
half of all American children between 3 and 5 watch the show.
   <PERSON>Bob McGrath</PERSON>, an actor on the program, returned a telephone call
to <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> but said he and other cast members had been
asked by <PERSON>Henson</PERSON>'s family not to speak with the news media. He
referred questions to <ORGANIZATION>CTW</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``In the beginning (<PERSON>Henson</PERSON>) certainly was the key figure in
developing characters and their style, but over 20 years they've
grown and matured, so there's a team there now,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Milton
Chin</PERSON>, director of instructional television for <ORGANIZATION>KQED</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> and a former researcher for <ORGANIZATION>CTW</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There's a lot of talent all around (at <ORGANIZATION>Henson Productions</ORGANIZATION>),
but they'll be missing the creator,'' he added.
   The Muppets first regular, widespread exposure came when
``Sesame Street'' went on the air in <DATE>1969</DATE>. The characters indulge
in slapstick, introduce video clips and live performances and
participate in skits. They have sung with <PERSON>Ray Charles</PERSON> and played
tennis with <LOCATION>Martina Navratilova</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Kathleen Turner</PERSON> has read them
bedtime stories, and <PERSON>Tracy Ullman</PERSON> has told them jokes.
   The show's Muppets have been created, assembled and dressed in
<LOCATION>Henson</LOCATION>'s office-factory in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. He once denied that they were
created with any human personality in mind: ``With Big Bird we knew
we wanted to do a large, a great big character. He should represent
a child, so he can make the kinds of mistakes that kids make, and
talk about it and be out front about that. So we wanted this large,
kooky creature.''
   Henson's contributions to the show twice won him Emmys and made
stars of these characters:
   _Big Bird, the yellow 6-footer who still manages to see and
enjoy life like a small fry.
   _Oscar the <LOCATION>Grouch</LOCATION>, a beast of indeterminate species who lives in
a garbage can and complains about the (high) quality of life on
Sesame Street.
   _<PERSON>Bert and Ernie</PERSON>, humanoid companions who are attached,
respectively, to a paper clip collection and a yellow rubber duckie.
   _The <ORGANIZATION>Cookie Monster</ORGANIZATION>, a shaggy blue beast who was named for his
chief weakness.
   _Kermit the <ORGANIZATION>Frog</ORGANIZATION>, who appears as a live, if bumbling, television
correspondent at the scene of the such fairy tales as The Princess
and the Pea and <LOCATION>Cinderella</LOCATION>.
   _<PERSON>Guy Smiley</PERSON>, ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s favorite game show host.''
   _The Count, an Eastern European of noble birth who is obsessed
with numbers.
   <PERSON>Henson</PERSON> was the voice and puppeteer for <PERSON>Kermit</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ernie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Guy
Smiley</PERSON>, and it was hard to see how, at least in this capacity, he
could be replaced.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Management: Cleaning up your act at work - A more effective
way to shuffle her papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you get to the office in the <TIME>morning</TIME>, do you make yourself a cup of
coffee and start sorting through a pile of papers? 'I must ring X about that
and I'll sort that one out later.' There are papers on your desk and more on
the floor.
In your drawer, along with an umbrella and a tin of shoe polish there are
more papers, but the important fax you were sent yesterday seems to have
disappeared.
It sounds like you do not know how to work. You are in good company.
Inefficiency is rife at all levels.
According to the <ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION>, productivity of white collar workers barely changed
in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> despite the introduction of computers, while that of factory
workers rose by 75 per cent.
People are trained to do every other aspect of their jobs, but when it comes
to organising themselves they are usually left to their own devices.
Changing bad habits is not easy, but it is possible, according to <PERSON>Jay
Hurwitz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Business Technology</ORGANIZATION>. His training company
claims to have made 40,000 office workers more productive using what is
grandly described as a '<ORGANIZATION>Personal Efficiency Programme</ORGANIZATION>.'
Its ideas are so simple it is hard to believe that people pay good money for
them.
DO IT NOW
The PEP golden rule and a principle that even the most inefficient person
knows to be a good one.
However, simply saying those three words is one thing, living by them is
another. PEP graduates have impressed on them that if they Do It Now they
will
Handle things only once and so save time
Have fewer distractions and concentrate better
Catch problems while they are small
Not have to worry about not doing things or waste time explaining to others
why you have not done so
Once this has really sunk home, you can move to the next principle
GET RID OF CLUTTER
Clear out all your drawers and files. With each piece of paper ask yourself:
have I ever used it and do I reasonably expect to use it? If I throw it
away, and unexpectedly need it, will I be able to get another copy?
Create a 'reference' filing system for papers that pass this test, and
another 'archive' for things that you do not need, but have to keep for
statutory reasons.
Set up tree trays on your desk: In, Out and Pending. The last is not for
things that have been put off, but those that cannot yet be completed.
Use the middle drawer in your desk - or somewhere else close at hand - for
all current work. Divide the work into different projects, each in its own
folder.
Make sure that you have all the other things you need - from telephone
directories to paper clips - to hand.
PLAN YOUR DAY
Don't let yourself be a slave to the in-tray. According to some recent US
studies, managers receive five times as much information as they actually
need. Managers waste too much time reading unnecessary material and clog up
their filing systems with the rest.
Set up a new filing system for every day of the coming month. It should
contain all the relevant papers for that day's meetings and details of
delegated work that is due to be finished on that day. That way you do not
have to clog up your mind with things to remember.
Make yourself a realistic plan for the day-week of priorities for work, and
mark yourself off against them.
Delegate more. According to <PERSON>Hurwitz</PERSON>, most bosses spend 20 per cent of their
valuable time doing things that could be equally well done by their
secretaries.
Do not agree to meetings that are not likely to be useful to you, or that
will make it harder for you to meet your own targets for the week.
It is all easily said. But it seems habits can only be changed under duress.
The PEP team stand over each employee, breathing down their necks, to make
sure they really are throwing away the contents of their drawers.
One man had 20 cardboard boxes in his office containing the papers from
previous jobs. Persuading him to throw them out 'took three days and was a
very painful experience for that individual', says <PERSON>Hurwitz</PERSON>.
The trainers go back after a few weeks and then after a few months to keep
the pressure on. Each time they draw up a written contract against which to
mark the employee. But does it last? 'There is some slippage, but they do
not ever go back to where they started from,' says <PERSON>Hurwitz</PERSON>.
As for me, I was planning to clear out my desk drawers after my conversation
with <PERSON>Hurwitz</PERSON>, but I have not got round to it yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Bernie Rooney</PERSON> is the ultimate organization man. 
</P>
<P>
His shoes shine. His suit, tie and shirt look crisp. His personal calendar and 
office calendar, which always are at his fingertips, are penciled in perfectly 
and don't have messy scraps of paper and business cards falling out of them. 
</P>
<P>
He is on time. When he gives a seminar, he hands out neat yellow name cards. 
His reference materials are lined up tidily in front of him. A small, 
unobtrusive clock that he sets before him keeps him on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He is enough to drive the average white-collar worker, who is a disorganized 
mess, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is with the paper police. As chief financial officer and a trainer for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Business Technology</ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm that promises to 
increase white-collar productivity by getting people to organize themselves and 
their work, he has forced hundreds of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area office workers, managers 
and executives to do the unthinkable: Throw out their paper, reports, 
loose-leaf notebooks, memos, yellow stickums, ancient phone messages, useless 
magazines and dusty old issues of the company's revised employee handbook. 
</P>
<P>
He has gotten them to stop ignoring their voice mail and return phone messages 
immediately. They have stopped putting off big projects and now use the "salami 
technique," taking a small bite out of them every day. Their desks have three 
trays on them: "In," "Out" and "Pending." The "In" tray is not overflowing with 
mail from three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
They now have a file system that separates work into three categories: working 
files, research files and archives, which are removed from the office. The 
super-organized set up what <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> calls "tickler" files to remind themselves 
of what they have to do that day. They set up "action plans" to persuade 
themselves that they will live by <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>'s rules of neatness and cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
And, those who become true disciples of <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION>'s personal efficiency program, or 
PEP, learn to scour their desks clean to the point where they have only one 
thing in front of them to work on. Their mantra is "Do It Now." Instead of 
putting off things that they hate to do, they "Do the Worst First." 
</P>
<P>
"Reorganization isn't the purpose of the program," said <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>. "We come in to 
get you focused on your job. But you can't do it if you are disorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Improving the productivity of office workers is one of the truly important but 
difficult challenges confronting business. Although productivity -- hourly 
output per worker -- has declined throughout the business sector since the 
early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, the slump in the service sector has been worse than in 
manufacturing. Boosting the efficiency and productivity of "knowledge" workers 
in an information-age office is a lot harder than for assembly workers in a 
production plant. 
</P>
<P>
To attack this problem, <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION> charges <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> to put seven people through its PEP 
program, which includes a seminar, an office cleaning and follow-up visits to 
make sure what has been learned is applied. Then <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION> comes back for surprise 
visits that span a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole goal of the program is to get you to be more efficient with the 
least amount of effort," <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing the <ORGANIZATION>Personal Efficiency Program</ORGANIZATION> has been relatively simple. <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION>, 
which was founded in <DATE>1983</DATE> in <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> by marketing consultant <PERSON>Kerry Gleeson</PERSON>, 
plays on guilt and workplace truisms such as "Are you always short of time?" or 
"Do you work extra hours to catch up on what you don't do during normal hours?" 
and "Do you have too much to do?" 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION> promises that once a hanging-file system and a decent desk calendar become 
part of its employees' work lives, companies can achieve bigger objectives such 
as improving quality, offering better customer service, reducing costs or 
weathering a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to get people to produce, not teach time management," said <PERSON>Gleeson</PERSON>, 
who thinks his technique will do for white-collar workers what assembly lines 
have done for the blue-collar world. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION>, which has <MONEY>$3.25 million</MONEY> in sales and has put 200,000 people through the 
program in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>two years ago</DATE>. Gleeson hopes to 
franchise his idea beyond the offices he has already opened in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of managers and middle managers haven't the foggiest idea 
about how to work," said <PERSON>Gleeson</PERSON>, confiding that the secret to his success has 
been getting others to work. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, despite the federal Paperwork Reduction Act, looked like a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a definite need in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>," said <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>. "It's a 
work-driven environment. Everybody is crisis-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
This morning at <TIME>8:30</TIME> sharp, <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> has seven victims from <ORGANIZATION>Contel ASC</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Rockville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, a provider of data communication networks, sequestered in a 
sunny conference room for the kickoff two-hour seminar and video. 
</P>
<P>
He lets them in on a few secrets, like <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> of your work is in <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of your 
files. He promises that file drawers that now are stuffed too full to open will 
be half empty by the time he gets through with them by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
PEP participants are relieved of their regular duties for the day, and are 
advised not to take or make phone calls. Their bosses have been told not to 
bother them. Management has been advised to stock the supply room with plenty 
of trash cans and hanging file folders. 
</P>
<P>
They don't know what is about to happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Does anyone know what they are in for today?" Rooney asks with a smile. "We're 
known as desk busters. You're going to do it and I assist. Or if you don't do 
it, I do it for you." 
</P>
<P>
It's the ultimate in the invasion of workplace privacy. This is not like other 
time-management or executive-organization seminars where someone politely 
suggests that the key to being more productive at work is to make lists and 
delegate. 
</P>
<P>
This is <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> doing hands-on housecleaning of desk drawers, files and offices. 
This is Rooney checking back not once, but several times, to make sure you have 
straightened out your work space, that you plan ahead and that you set goals. 
</P>
<P>
He acts like your friend, but he really is your mom. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 a.m. he gets down to business in the small, somewhat claustrophobic 
office of financial analyst <PERSON>Vicki Hatfield</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, one of 72 <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> employees who have gone through PEP training, was 
voted as having the messiest office. She came prepared in blue jeans to fight 
overflowing files and the messes left by her predecessor in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield already uses three trays. She has a calendar, a Rolodex and a stapler. 
Not much is stuck up on the bulletin board. Then <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> pulls out her top left 
drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"What are all these?" he asks quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"All the materials from my quality training," <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> says, looking guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney pulls a Spiegel catalogue out of the drawer. "Don't keep anything 
horizontal in a small drawer," he says, dropping the catalogue in the trash 
can. 
</P>
<P>
He turns to the top drawer of her desk. "That's not bad. Everything is 
contained," he mumbles, automatically disentangling binder clips, paper clips 
and rubber bands that are jumbled together. 
</P>
<P>
He starts pulling out files. "The point is to get everything out," he says, 
creating a mountain of manila folders on <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON>'s desk that begins to fall 
over and spill out paper. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield looks pained. "I'm normally a very organized person," she says. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:30, it's over, at least until after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't dump your file cabinets until I get back," <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> instructs on his way 
out to another mess down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney keeps asking each employee, "How do you feel so far?" as if he is 
guarding against nervous breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He warns them not to go to extremes on their first day because in his fight 
against procrastination and paper overload, <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> has seen it all. One 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> executive had <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION> in for a marketing presentation. His office was 
spotless. Not a thing out of place on his desk. Rooney and <LOCATION>Ira Chaleff</LOCATION>, 
managing partner for the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> office, wondered why someone with such a 
neat office needed them. 
</P>
<P>
Then the executive took them down the hall to his real office, revealing that 
he was a closet slob. 
</P>
<P>
The key to <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION>'s success, says founder <PERSON>Gleeson</PERSON>, is that people are not left to 
face their messes alone. They get someone like <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> to spend time with them, 
trying to figure out why they put reading material in their briefcases and then 
never read it. Or why they keep dozens of interoffice envelopes stuffed into 
bottom drawers. Or why they can't ever part with anything. 
</P>
<P>
"If I clean my office out it won't look like I do anything," said <ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> 
treasury assistant <PERSON>Michele Brice</PERSON>, coming up with one of the classic excuses. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>, who considers himself a sort of personal trainer in efficiency, has 
observed that if people are left to their own devices, no more than <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> 
"initiate action when I tell them to get in there (and clean it up)." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rooney</PERSON> said about <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of the people who go through the program get some 
benefit. The most basic pay-back is saving time: You save eight full days over 
a year if you pick up just 15 minutes a day at work that you wasted in 
meaningless actions such as picking up the same piece of paper 10 times before 
you act on it -- which is the average. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought some organization to the madness," said <PERSON>Thomas Veystrk</PERSON>, vice 
president of human resources for <ORGANIZATION>Jos. A. Bank Clothiers</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, which put 
10 of its top managers, including the company's president, through the PEP 
program recently. 
</P>
<P>
The hope was that managers would use their time more effectively and be able to 
juggle a number of projects at one time without losing control. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> brought in <ORGANIZATION>IBT</ORGANIZATION> to help with a reorganization in its finance department 
and to complement an in-house program that stresses improving quality. 
</P>
<P>
"People are better able to plan and set priorities," said <PERSON>Margaret Brady</PERSON>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Contel</ORGANIZATION> vice president of finance. "As we bring new people into the company, we 
get them trained. It's only effective if everyone talks the same language." 
</P>
<P>
And the language is fairly simple. It boils down to three little words that can 
transform you from a person who has piles of files on your desk to one who has 
working files, research files and archives. 
</P>
<P>
"Do It Now," said <PERSON>Rooney</PERSON>.

<HL> Tracking the Economy: April Trade Deficit Likely Widened </HL>
<AUTHOR> Pamela Sebastian (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> ECO MON </IN>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists and traders are bracing for a period of adjustment as the government returns to seasonally adjusting the monthly merchandise trade data. 

   But seasonal factors or not, the consensus view holds that the <DATE>April</DATE> trade deficit due out tomorrow widened, backtracking a bit on recent progress. 
The average estimate of 10 economists in a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report poll called for a seasonally adjusted <MONEY>$12.20 billion</MONEY> gap, up from an adjusted <MONEY>$11.95 billion</MONEY> gap in <DATE>March</DATE>. 
Another survey, conducted by <LOCATION>Redwood City</LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION>MMS International</ORGANIZATION>, puts the median view at <MONEY>$12.3 billion</MONEY>, seasonally adjusted. 

   "I think <DATE>April</DATE> will be a significantly higher trade deficit than <DATE>March</DATE> any way it's measured. 
But I don't think it will be a disaster," said <PERSON>Allen Sinai</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Boston Co</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Economists believe the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is making progress on easing the trade imbalance but some are tempering their optimism on the time frame, based on the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>'s recent release of seasonally adjusted trade numbers going back nine months. 

   The government issued the historical data last week in preparation for returning to seasonal adjustments it stopped in <DATE>December 1985</DATE> because of time lags in gathering data. 
The new system's later deadlines permit more figures to be gathered. 

   The seasonally adjusted historical data shows "less and later" improvement in the trade gap, notes <PERSON>Mr. Sinai</PERSON>. 
He and others point out that without the retroactive adjustments, trade started to improve in the <DATE>third quarter of last year</DATE>. 
With the seasonal adjustments, the narrowing in the gap begins this year and is somewhat smaller. 

   For instance, the <DATE>March</DATE> deficit originally slid to <MONEY>$9.75 billion</MONEY> from <MONEY>$13.8 billion</MONEY> the previous month -- a drop that cheered stock, bond and currency markets. 
But under the new seasonally adjusted figures, <DATE>March</DATE>'s deficit slipped only to <MONEY>$11.95 billion</MONEY> from <MONEY>$14.41 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>February</DATE>. 

   Even if the return to seasonals helps smooth month-to-month carry-overs from numbers that slipped through the cracks or were in error, there are still plenty of other items to complicate the trade series. 

   Consider <DATE>March</DATE>. 
Part of the reason the deficit is expected to grow in <DATE>April</DATE> is because of the absence of big gold shipments to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>. 
In a masterful accounting gimmick, cash-rich <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> bought huge amounts of gold in <DATE>March</DATE>, in an effort to cut its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade surplus before sitting down to trade talks. 
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION>, which normally imports less than <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> gold a month, is believed to have purchased over <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY> in <DATE>March</DATE>. 
By booking the gold as a commodity -- instead of a cash substitute -- <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> was able to artificially improve its trade balance. 
At the same time, it "helped" total <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> export accounts. 

   Despite the often-murky mix of numbers that go into calculating the trade deficit, economists do believe the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is making headway in shrinking the gap. 
A recent survey of business economists showed they expect the trade deficit to decline to <MONEY>$150 billion</MONEY> this year and <MONEY>$125 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
The deficit was a record <MONEY>$170.3 billion</MONEY> last year. 

   There is considerably less agreement on the course of inflation. 

   Stock and bond markets rallied <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> on a downturn in commodity prices. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Commodity Research Bureau Index</ORGANIZATION> dropped along with the barometer, as the promise of rain eased inflation fears in the grain belt, or at least in the grain trading pits. 

   But while agricultural commodities were falling, industrial commodities were rising. 
The Journal of <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Industrial Price Index</ORGANIZATION>, which tracks spot prices for 18 sensitive materials, broke above 100 <DATE>last Tuesday</DATE> for the first time since <DATE>last September</DATE>. 
A reading above 100 means average industrial input prices are exceeding levels for <DATE>1980</DATE>, the index base year. 

   "We have some really bizarre differences here," says <PERSON>Robert S. Gay</PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
But he's sticking with the industrial price trend, noting those "prices are far more fundamental." 

   Demand for industrial materials is likely to continue steady for a while. 
The <DATE>May</DATE> industrial production report due out <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> is expected to show an increase again, although at a slower rate than the previous month's jump. 
Industrial output rose a robust <PERCENT>0.7%</PERCENT> in <DATE>April</DATE>, helping push the capacity utilization rate up to <PERCENT>82.7%</PERCENT> that month. 
Economists say the <DATE>May</DATE> operating rate is likely to hold around that level if, as expected, output rises a bit. 

   The <DATE>May</DATE> report on retail sales is expected to look somewhat stronger than the previous month, which suffered from an early Easter. 
In <DATE>April</DATE>, retail sales slipped <PERCENT>0.6%</PERCENT> to <MONEY>$131.58 billion</MONEY>, largely because the important Easter buying season came unusually early this year. 

   ---
   SAVE THOSE PAPER CLIPS: Office product prices are likely to rise about <PERCENT>3.8%</PERCENT> over the next six months, marking the biggest jump since <DATE>1982</DATE>, according to a survey by <ORGANIZATION>Quill Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, an office products distributor in <LOCATION>Lincolnshire</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. 
At an annualized rate, that means costs could rise <PERCENT>7.6%</PERCENT> for the rest of the year. 
Last year, prices rose <PERCENT>2.4%</PERCENT>. 
Rising paper and steel costs are the main culprits as those industries operate at high capacity to meet high demand. 
"Paper is constantly going wild," says <PERSON>Jack Miller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Quill</PERSON> president.

<DESCRIPT>  EDITORIAL; CALIFORNIA; DEFENSE; CONTRACT; COMPANY; SALE; TAX  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  CALIFORNIA defense contractors are enjoying the largest sales tax rebate in
state history: $810 million and growing. Their enjoyment is short-lived,
however, since they have to hand the money over to the federal government.;   
Last year a state appeals court ruled that contractors don't have to pay sales
tax on certain purchases they bill directly to the feds. The court reasoned
that when contractors buy paper clips, toilet paper, equipment and other
supplies, those items become government property at the moment of purchase.
And since the federal government is tax-exempt, the state can't charge sales
tax on them.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A USEFUL TAX
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ACT QUICKLY TO RECOUP SALES
TAXES LOST TO WASHINGTON  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Of course, contractors have been paying sales tax for years and tacking it
on to the cost of government contracts. In effect, the feds have been
subsidizing local governments by allowing them to collect the tax.;    But no
more. The court ordered the state to stop collecting the tax and refund taxes
paid in prior years. The contractors will then readjust their contracts and
send a check to the feds.;    For <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> cities, which are increasingly
dependent on sales tax revenue, this ruling is costly. The city of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>
expects to pay at least <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> in rebates. Sunnyvale says the ruling will
mean at least <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in rebates and <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> each year from now on.;   
There may be a way to get the money back. <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and other states
levy a "use tax" on contractors. The way it works, the state taxes the use of
the materials, regardless of who owns them. These taxes have been upheld by
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court.</ORGANIZATION>;    Why didn't <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> pass a use tax years ago?
Because state officials thought they would win the appeals court case, and
besides, no one realized how much the state had to lose. Now as estimates of
the tax refunds owed by the state continue to mount, officials are kicking
themselves. More important, they are writing legislation to enact a state use
tax.;    We urge them to act swiftly. The money the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government receives
from this tax exemption won't even scratch the federal budget deficit. But it
will mean major surgery for local governments.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MOUNTAIN-VIEW; SCHOOL; BUDGET; INVESTMENT; PROGRAM  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  This is not exactly the golden age of learning in California. Overwhelmed by
cutbacks, schools are resorting to all kinds of measures to bolster meager
coffers.;    In Mountain View, school officials are thinking like corporate
officers. The school district is asking folks to buy symbolic "shares of
stock" in the schools' programs. Call it Mountain View Elementary, Inc.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here's how it works: If you like a particular program, you can "buy" some
shares of that program. The <MONEY>$5</MONEY> shares won't bring you any monetary gains. The
dividend, in this case, is a thank-you note, and the knowledge that you've
supported the schools. It's a twist of the old "adopt a pet or a tree"
fund-raiser.;    The district needs money to sustain programs in music, fine
arts, technology, physical education and the libraries.;    As education
budgets shrink, schools are relying more and more on parents for financial
support. In <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the residents don't have kids
in school, money is hard to come by. "We can only sell so many cupcakes to
parents," said Mountain View Assistant Superintendent <PERSON>Trish Bubenik.</PERSON>;    The
district is looking to trim <MONEY>$1.46 million</MONEY> off its <MONEY>$12 million</MONEY> budget for the
<DATE>1991</DATE>-'92 school year. And things that generations of students took for granted
are now in short supply. Among the items the schools are soliciting from the
community are: pencils, paper clips, binders, correction fluid, outdated
stationery and letterheads. "It's just a shame," said school board member <PERSON>Judy
Yates</PERSON>. "A ream of paper for the copier is becoming a big deal.";    It seems
education is no longer a right, but more a privilege.;    If you'd like to
help, please ring Bubenik at (415) 968-6945.;  POSTCARD CAMPAIGN: It's an
exercise of grass-roots campaigning, with a mix of environmental zeal.;   
Gov. <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> wants to set up a <ORGANIZATION>California Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>. But
a public-interest research group, called <ORGANIZATION>CalPIRG</ORGANIZATION>, said the governor's plan
doesn't include a pollution prevention program. So volunteers are going door
to door to seek support for the inclusion of a pollution prevention program in
a proposed state agency.;    <ORGANIZATION>CalPIRG</ORGANIZATION> would like to give structure to the
proposed agency, said <ORGANIZATION>CalPIRG</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Julie Duncan</PERSON>. The campaign's goal is to make
prevention a priority. The Legislature is entertaining three bills that would
strengthen environmental protection in the state.;    AB <DATE>1519</DATE>, by
<PERSON>Assemblywoman Barbara Lee</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Oakland</LOCATION>, would require companies to report their
total use and production of chemicals.;    AB 251, by <PERSON>Sen. David Roberti</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Los Angeles</LOCATION>, would require companies to provide data of their chemical uses
and production to the public and would coordinate and enforce pollution
prevention efforts.;    AB 46, by <PERSON>Sen. Art Torres</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Los Angeles</LOCATION>, would
classify 189 chemicals as toxic air contaminants and would seek to reduce
their release into the air. Currently, only five chemicals are identified as
such.;    <ORGANIZATION>CalPIRG</ORGANIZATION> volunteers and staffers are asking residents to send
postcards to the governor and to their representatives. The goal is to talk to
40,000 residents in the <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> area this <DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> said. For more

<HEAD>Reynolds Introducing Colored Plastic Wrap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   That green stuff you see the next time you
open the refrigerator might not be last week's meatloaf.
   <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds Metals Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the people who brought you <ORGANIZATION>Reynolds Wrap</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Reynolds Plastic Wrap</ORGANIZATION>, has introduced colored plastic wrap.
   The clear, clingy stuff will now be available in red, blue,
yellow and yes, green.
   The company's advertising says the new wrap, which costs the same
as its clear counterpart, ``makes the mundane task of wrapping
leftovers fun.''
   ``The addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic
wrap, which in its clear form is considered purely a functional
product,'' said <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON> brand manager <PERSON>Jane D. Nims</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Marabel Morgan</ORGANIZATION>, author of ``The Total Woman,'' who has advocated
that women add excitement their marriages by greeting their husbands
at the door wearing only in plastic wrap, says the colored wrap ``is
a great idea. It would really add a lot of zip,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   Crystal Color Plastic Wrap generated lots of enthusiasm in focus
groups and simulated test markets, said <PERSON>Anne F. Waring</PERSON>, a
spokeswoman for <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON>' consumer products division.
   ``Adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product exciting,''
she said, noting that the same thing has been done to paper clips
and rubber bands.
   The company will promote use of the colored wrap in crafts as
well as food storage, <PERSON>Ms. Waring</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>, and will have several
special promotions around the holidays.
   <PERSON>Ms. Waring</PERSON> declined to speculate on the impact the colored wrap
might have on sales or how much the new product, which has been in
the works three to fours years, cost to develop.
   The consumer products division accounts for <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of
<PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON>' sales, she said.
   In <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Reynolds</PERSON> reported a record net income of <MONEY>$482 million</MONEY>,
or <MONEY>$8.35</MONEY> per share, on revenues of <MONEY>$5.6 billion</MONEY>.

   Doctors removed nearly a half-pound of
razor blades, paper clips and metal bedsprings from the stomach of
a prison inmate who swallowed the metal in a suicide attempt.
   Surgeons operated on <PERSON>Carl Rhoades</PERSON>, 32, on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a prison
official said. Rhoades swallowed the metal on <DATE>March 13</DATE>.
   The 7{ ounces of metal was thought to have caused a gastric
ulcer but no other damage, said <PERSON>Les Harmon</PERSON>, associate director of
the <ORGANIZATION>Kansas State Industrial Reformatory</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Hutchinson</PERSON>.
   Rhoades initially refused surgery so prison officials got a
court order allowing them to authorize it. He eventually signed the
consent form.
   The prisoner was recovering at a Hutchinson hospital. The
nursing supervisor at the hospital said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> she could release no
information about his condition.
   <PERSON>Rhoades</PERSON> was convicted of aggravated battery last year for
shooting a motorist during an argument. He was sentenced to 10 to
20 years in prison.

<P>
Starter against starter, the Bulls led by 30 in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>, originally 
at 63-33, by which time the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> backcourt of <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Paxson</PERSON> 
had 29 on their own. 
</P>
<P>
How this one slipped into the itinerary is anyone's guess. The Clippers, who 
opened what still has to be considered a wildly successful eight-game trip with 
a 5-2 record, took the two losses by four points to <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> and one to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the one that was anything but symbolic of recent Clipper fortune that 
they will return home with today. 
</P>
<P>
"We jumped on them and made them work," said <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, who finished with 28 
points and 10 assists. "We let them think about home. We let them think about 
going back to <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>, especially when it's so cold here." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers took advantage of a similar situation <DATE>Dec. 26</DATE>, trouncing <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, 
120-96, at the Sports Arena in the Bulls' final stop of a seven-game Western 
swing. Carbon-copy result, just a different winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the rematch, with the Bulls shooting <PERCENT>69.8%</PERCENT> in the first two quarters and the 
Clippers looking like a textbook case of road weary, the hosts were ahead at 
halftime, 68-41. <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> had a 37-point <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, the best start against 
the Clippers this season. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get much better in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> for the Clippers, who pulled 
only as close as 21, 94-73. The starters were out, and no one seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said <PERSON>Ron Harper</PERSON>, who scored 10 points, his lowest output since the <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> 
loss at <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>. "I was happy. I was three steps slow and had no legs." 
</P>
<P>
So Coach <PERSON>Don Casey</PERSON> looked down the bench and found fresh bodies, which wasn't 
hard to do now that the Clippers have settled into an eight-man rotation on the 
trip. He left it to <PERSON>Michael Young</PERSON>, <PERSON>David Rivers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jeff Martin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe Wolf</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Benoit Benjamin</PERSON> to make it look good on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised how poised they were," <PERSON>Casey</PERSON> said. "It wasn't a relaxing 
situation for us. We were fighting for respectability on the scoreboard. We've 
had days of 25- and 30-point losses and didn't want that. We didn't think 
single digits, though." 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what they got. The same five played the entire <DATE>fourth 
quarter</DATE> and rallied the Clippers within 13, 111-98, when <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> hit a six-foot 
hook with 4:03 remaining. Casey had <PERSON>Harper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danny Manning</PERSON>, scorers 
all, on the bench, but stayed with the same lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking about it," the coach said. "<PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was stretching. But the 
first thing we said was, 'If they put their starters back in, we'll stick with 
you because you got us back in it.' We didn't want mass substitution." 
</P>
<P>
That's why <PERSON>Joe Wolf</PERSON> got 32 minutes and <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> went 25. Why <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, growing in 
stature with each game, had 24 minutes and <PERSON>Harper</PERSON> played 27. Why Young went 16 
minutes compared to <PERSON>Manning</PERSON>'s 21. 
</P>
<P>
They took advantage of the opportunity, too. Wolf had 17 points, tying <PERSON>Gary 
Grant</PERSON> for tops among Clippers, and 11 rebounds, equaling <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Scottie 
Pippen</PERSON> for game-high honors. Young hit six of nine shots for 15 points. Rivers 
ran the team to <PERCENT>58%</PERCENT> accuracy in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
And as for Benjamin being the lone starter kept in and playing 41 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
Just call it exercise class. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just going to work him until he dropped," <PERSON>Casey</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that dropped was the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> lead, far enough that Coach <PERSON>Phil 
Jackson</PERSON> was prompted to put <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Cartwright</PERSON> back in. The Clippers 
got as close as 117-111 on <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION>'s layup with 16.3 seconds left, but there 
would be no miracles. The Clippers already had used their ration of 
improbability in the previous days. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's not the healthiest bunch returning today. <PERSON>Charles Smith</PERSON> is still bothered 
by a sore big right toe that sometimes forces him to run awkwardly. <PERSON>Tom 
Garrick</PERSON>, who missed the fourth game of the season with a sprained right knee, 
now has a badly bruised left knee, the condition of which worsened from <DATE>Friday</DATE> 
to <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Indications are, however, that <PERSON>Ken Norman</PERSON> will return <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 
against <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> after missing seven games of the trip, although no decision 
will be made until at least today and possibly even just before game time. The 
Clippers want him to sit out as long as necessary to heal a strained groin 
rather than having it nag for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Clippers</ORGANIZATION> have never won four road games in a row. 
No records were immediately available from their days as the <LOCATION>Buffalo Braves</LOCATION>. . 
. . The Bulls set a club record with their 13th consecutive home win. . . . The 
Clippers had another solid <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> defensive effort to get close, 
holding <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to 18 points in the final 12 minutes.

   Westinghouse Hanford Co. said it suspended four employees
indefinitely without pay in connection with an intentional
silencing of an alarm panel at a nuclear facility.
   The company, a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp., said
last week an engineer found a paper clip wedged in the alarm
panel, preventing six alarms from sounding. The alarm was at
an evaporator, used to reduce the volume of nuclear waste
stored in underground tanks. The facility has been shut down
since the mid-1980s, but still houses equipment used to
monitor some underground nuclear waste storage tanks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>Westinghouse</ORGANIZATION> said it was the third such incident at
Hanford in less than six months. Investigations of the other
incidents didn't determine who was responsible or why the
tampering happened. The company, which manages facilities for
the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Energy</ORGANIZATION>, is continuing its investigation.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology: Hoping for a clean sweep - Alice Rawsthorn meets
a man who has devoted himself to building a better vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is slightly strange to watch an apparently sane man brandishing a vacuum
cleaner and waxing lyrical about it. But if anyone has a reason to enthuse
about vacuum cleaners, it is <PERSON>James Dyson</PERSON>, who has spent the past decade
designing them. <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON>, 45, is one of that rare breed: successful British
inventors and industrial designers. The G-Force, his first vacuum cleaner
launched in <DATE>1986</DATE>, sells in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for Pounds 1,200 and pops up on white
plinths in design museums.
His latest model is the <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON> Dual Cyclone, which is destined for the
British mass market rather than <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> trendies. It goes on sale this month
in several UK retailers - <PERSON>John Lewis</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Rumbelows</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Littlewoods</ORGANIZATION> - and
electricity showrooms with a price-tag of Pounds 199.
Dyson is more interested in how his products work than how they look. He
trained in product design at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal College of Art</ORGANIZATION>, but sees himself as
an inventor, rather than a designer. 'It's the technology that interests
me,' he said. 'I'm not turned on by the idea of designing a case for a
machine that someone else has developed. My thrill is coming up with
something new and embodying it in an exciting way.'
He worked for an engineering group for a few years after leaving the RCA,
but then set up on his own to develop and produce the <LOCATION>Ballbarrow</LOCATION>, a
wheelbarrow with a pneumatic ball instead of a wheel. The idea for his first
vacuum cleaner came while he was making a machine for the Ballbarrow
factory.
'One of our cleaning machines kept clogging up with dirt,' he said. 'We
needed a cyclone system but didn't have Pounds 70,000 to buy it, so I
decided to make my own. I realised that I could use a miniaturised version
in a vacuum cleaner.' He sold the rights to the Ballbarrow in order to
finance the development of the vacuum cleaner. The result was the G-Force.
Conventional vacuum cleaners work by sucking in dirt and air, then
separating them through a filter. The air escapes and the dirt collects in a
paper bag. The problem is that the filter gets blocked, making the machine
progressively less efficient. Dyson's cyclone system performs the same
function as a filter by whizzing the dirt and air around at high speed, but
does not clog. The dirt collects in a plastic container which can be clipped
off and emptied.
He designed the G-Force so that its handle operated as a hose. At the time,
most upright vacuum cleaners had clip-on hoses which were not part of the
machine. Although the mainstream manufacturers rejected <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON>'s design when
he showed it to them in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, an integral hose has since become a
standard feature on upright vacuum cleaners.
He chose to make the G-Force look different from the sober-coloured machines
then on sale. It has a jaunty pink plastic case and a clip-off container in
transparent plastic that reveals the guts of the machine. 'I wanted the
design to underline the fact that the G-Force was different from other
models,' said <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON>. 'I also liked the idea of a vacuum cleaner being fun to
look at.'
The G-Force design was licensed to a Japanese manufacturer. <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON> has used
the income (30,000 models are still sold each year) to set up a
product-development unit near his country home in <LOCATION>Bath</LOCATION> with a team of 15
designers. They have since developed vacuum cleaners for the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, including
an industrial model for <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Wax</ORGANIZATION>. But the biggest project is the Dual
Cyclone. <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON> has invested Pounds 1.75m to develop the design, register the
patents and to tool up a <LOCATION>Wrexham</LOCATION> sub-contractor to manufacture the machine.
This time, he has installed two cyclones. One operates at 200mph to process
bigger bits of dirt and the other at 800mph to treat tiny dust particles.
The Dual Cyclone has the same playful quality to its design as the G-Force,
although the shape is less exaggerated and <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON> has chosen the more subdued
shades of grey and yellow. 'I wanted it to look more functional,' says
<PERSON>Dyson</PERSON>. 'Pink would be a bit roue today.'
He hopes to introduce the Dual Cyclone to other countries once it is
established in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, and to plough the profits into a new vacuum cleaner,
just as he did with the G-Force. 'Sometimes I'm tempted to try other
products, but if you want to do something really well you have to find a
small area and work at it,' he says. 'We've still got lots of new ideas for
vacuum cleaners.'

JUST A DAY AT THE CLIPPER CIRCUS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: BO KIMBLE SIGNS HIS CONTRACT AND THEN THE FUN BEGINS AS BOTH 
SIDES ARGUE OVER STATEMENTS MADE EARLIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the surface, <PERSON>Bo Kimble</PERSON>'s one-day holdout ended in expected fashion <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 
when Clipper uniform No. 30 was displayed. Coach <PERSON>Mike Schuler</PERSON> talked of how his 
newest player will contribute, and <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> laughed and smiled for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are past, and what is important now is that <PERSON>Bo</PERSON> is a member of 
the Clipper family, and we're all going to be going out this season watching 
him shoot the lights out," team attorney <PERSON>Bob Steele</PERSON> said. "That's what this is 
about. It is not about two or three months ago. That's old news. It's dead and 
buried." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Problems were still very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
Considering <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> had already signed the paper work, what happened in a small 
banquet room at a <ORGANIZATION>City of Industry</ORGANIZATION> hotel was theater of the bizarre. After the 
news conference started 90 minutes late, <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON>'s agent <PERSON>Leonard Armato</PERSON> said his 
client would hold out until the Clippers released a statement apologizing for 
harsh comments during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Steele then entered the room and had pointed exchanges with <PERSON>Armato</PERSON> in front of 
several members of the media. <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION> had nothing to apologize 
for but, after <PERSON>Armato</PERSON> talked some more about holding out, the team released the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> says he will be in camp today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last thing I thought would happen when I got here," <PERSON>Armato</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a new page of Clipper lore. What could top representatives for the two 
sides be sniping about hours after signing a five-year, <MONEY>$7.25-million</MONEY> contract? 
</P>
<P>
The statement that irritated <PERSON>Armato</PERSON> quoted <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> as saying: "If <PERSON>Leonard Armato</PERSON> 
had proposed at the start a deal at <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY> a year and no strange 
provisions, this agreement would have been concluded in 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Armato</PERSON> said <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> was upset when he read that and wasn't going to come to the 
news conference. "He was very upset. Only after we talked to <PERSON>Bob Steele</PERSON> and he 
agreed to make a statement apologizing did Bo agree to come." 
</P>
<P>
And during the news conference, one couldn't tell that there were problems. 
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said all the right things. He said he was happy to be a Clipper, the 
team he truly hoped would draft him. He looked forward to competing for a 
starting shooting guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't be happier Bo is a Clipper," owner <PERSON>Donald T. Sterling</PERSON> said. "When 
all is said and done, the agreement we reached was fair for everyone and 
everyone can be very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
It was only afterward that <PERSON>Armato</PERSON> spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning Bo picked up the paper and was really disturbed regarding the 
comments made about the negotiations. <PERSON>Bob Steele</PERSON> and the Clipper organization 
promised that if Bo shows up, the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION> will recant many of the things said 
and tell what really transpired (<DATE>Friday</DATE>) and the real tenor of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I will advise Bo not to report until everything is resolved in writing. I 
don't trust that organization anymore. Beyond that, I'm very disappointed. He 
has a contract, yes, but at the same time there were representations made to 
him that have not held true." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers had originally decided against a statement in writing so as to not 
raise the issue. <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> said they did not want to "detract from the moment." 
</P>
<P>
There were also other minor points about tickets for charity. Kimble wanted to 
start a foundation that would allow charity organizations free tickets to 
Clipper games. Armato wanted it in writing, but the <ORGANIZATION>Clippers</ORGANIZATION> said it wasn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in an impromptu post-news conference, <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> said: "We don't find any 
fault in Bo's representatives making advanced proposals in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
Armato, sitting a few feet away, countered: "Bob, you've said that 16 times. 
Are we getting the press release or not?" 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>4:45 p.m.</TIME>, the circus left town. <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON>, his adviser, <PERSON>David Spencer</PERSON>, and 
<PERSON>Armato</PERSON> got the release. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to clarify for the record that the Clippers at all times considered the 
proposals from <PERSON>Bo</PERSON>'s representatives to be advanced in good faith and reasonable 
in <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> negotiations for players of Bo's stature," the statement read in part. 
"We regret if any statements made during negotiations would imply otherwise, 
for we could not be more delighted and excited about <PERSON>Bo</PERSON>'s future with the 
Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
Apology accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Armato was particularly upset that the Clippers had characterized some of his 
demands as ludicrous. Specifically, clauses that <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> would become a 
restricted free agent -- not unrestricted, as team officials had been saying -- 
if he made the all-star team two years in a row and others calling for <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> 
for making appearances, a <MONEY>$1-million</MONEY> signing bonus and a <MONEY>$1-million</MONEY> loan. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever denied those requests were made. <PERSON>Armato</PERSON> said he did not cave in to 
get the deal done <DATE>Friday</DATE> and signed <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. "You should have seen them (the 
Clippers) groveling <TIME>this morning</TIME>," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steele scoffed, but decided not to press the issue. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON>, Aramto and <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON>, at long last, approved the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's official," <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said. "Time to go to work."

<HEAD>Jurors Recess For Weekend Without Reaching Verdict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury weighed the guilt or innocence
of <PERSON>Oliver L. North</PERSON> for part of a second day <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, then took the
rest of the weekend off as the former presidential aide awaited his
fate on 12 felony counts stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The nine women and three men, guided in their deliberations by a
95-page set of instructions from District <PERSON>Judge Gerhard A. Gesell</PERSON>,
arrived bright and <DATE>early Saturday</DATE> to resume work in an 18-by-12
room on the sealed second floor of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Courthouse</ORGANIZATION>.
   But there were no clues as to their progress by the time they
quit at <TIME>12:10 p.m.</TIME> to return to their downtown hotel to relax,
under constant supervision of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> marshals, until resuming work
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The jurors, who were asked by the judge to begin by <TIME>9:30 each
morning</TIME>, were driven in a van to the courthouse at <TIME>8:20 a.m.</TIME> and
started their work at <TIME>8:45</TIME>.
   The jury had deliberated for six hours on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   So far, only requests for copies of <ORGANIZATION>Gesell</ORGANIZATION>'s instructions _ one
for each juror _ and for pencils, paper, and paper clips have
emanated from the jury room, along with the question <DATE>Friday</DATE>, ``Is
lunch at 12?''
   They got the materials, and the early lunch.
   Writing supplies remained a concern <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. An unsigned note
which covered the jury's return of some documents to the court for
safekeeping had this ``P.S.: Please sharpen pencils. And we need
more pencils, and highlighters.''
   The jurors will be allowed family visits, under marshals'
supervision, at their hotel on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The jurors are forbidden to
talk about the case, even among themselves, when they are not in
the jury room.
   North's trial, nearly three months long, is the first stemming
from the <DATE>late 1985-early 1986</DATE> sale of arms to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> _ at a <PERCENT>270
percent</PERCENT> markup in price _ and the siphoning off of some of the
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Three other men, former <ORGANIZATION>National Security</ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON>John
Poindexter</PERSON>, businessman <PERSON>Albert Hakim</PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Maj.
Gen. <PERSON>Richard Secord</PERSON> are awaiting separate trials. Another former
national security adviser, <PERSON>Robert C. McFarlane</PERSON>, has pleaded guilty
and received two years' probation and a <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> fine for
withholding information from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> about the episode.
   North, a former <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel who served as deputy
to both <PERSON>McFarlane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Poindexter</PERSON>, is charged with 12 felony counts,
including withholding information from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, lying to Attorney
General <PERSON>Edwin Meese III</PERSON> about his activities, destroying and
altering documents, misusing money entrusted to him and accepting
an illegal gratuity _ a <MONEY>$13,800</MONEY> security system at his home.
   North, a decorated <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War veteran, testified he was a mere
``pawn in a chess game played by giants'' and was following orders
throughout, even as he was the action officer in both major
elements of the Iran-Contra scheme. ``I was not stepping in,'' he
said. ``I was brought in ... basically it was a handoff _ `you've
got the ball, now run with it.'''
   But independent prosecutor <PERSON>John W. Keker</PERSON> told the jury ``You
have heard a lot about courage at this trial. There's another kind
of courage: courage, to admit when you are wrong; courage to admit
personal responsibility, courage to admit guilt where appropriate.
He has not admitted any of those things; it's time for you do to it
for him.''
   In his instructions, <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> set specific guidelines for the
jury's consideration of each specific count.
   For example, on the count that North obstructed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> by
making false or misleading statements to two <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committees,
<PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> said, ``A false or misleading answer to a question may be
taken by you as an obstruction if it was made corruptly, with the
specific intent to impede the investigation ... it must be
established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted for
the specific purposes of obstructing or impeding.''
   Similarly, on four counts that North made false statements to
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON>Meese</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> said the jury could convict only if it is
convinced that ``when the defendant made or caused to be made the
false statement or representation, he was acting willfully, that
is, deliberately or on purpose and not because of mistake,
inadvertence or accident.''
   As for the document destruction charge, the judge said the jury
could convict only if it believes North altered or destroyed the
materials ``with knowledge of the illegality of his conduct.'' But
``the defendant did not have to know the exact terms of the law, if
he knew that he was prohibited, by departmental or agency rule or
regulation, from destroying official records.''
   To convict North for accepting an illegal gratuity _ the
security system _ <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> said the jury must first be satisfied that
North ``specifically intended to receive the security system for a
past or future official act or acts, and not for reasons wholly
unrelated to his official employment.''
   Most of the charges carry penalties of five years in prison and
<MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> fines upon conviction. One charge is punishable by a
maximum of 10 years, one of three years and one of two years _ with
the total possible punishment being 60 years and fines of <MONEY>$3
million</MONEY>.

<DESCRIPT>  WEST; SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; WASTE; REPORT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  We are what we eat, buy and use and, in the eyes of four West Valley cities,
what we throw away.;   The four cities -- Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Campbell
and Saratoga -- are the subject of a recently-released study examining
residents' garbage habits, right down to the rotten food, smelly pet cans, old
love letters and x-rated magazines they throw away.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  West Extra  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  YARD CLIPPINGS, PAPER FILL TRASH CANS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The study was done in the interest of developing future programs for
reusing waste to reduce the strain on the environment.;   What it bore out was
hardly a surprise to waste program officials: one-third to one-half of what
the tree-studded cities toss out is yard waste. And between one-quarter and
one-third of what they toss is paper -- from newspaper and computer paper to
magazines.;   "I was not surprised at all by that," said <PERSON>Vera Dahle</PERSON>, who is
coordinating the solid waste study for the four cities. "It did underscore the
importance of beginning now to evaluate yard waste collection services for at
least the residential sector," she said.;   One of the cities -- <LOCATION>Saratoga</LOCATION> --
already is scheduled to begin collecting grass clippings and other yard waste
at residential curbs next <DATE>April</DATE>. The three other cities are considering
similar programs but have not approved them, partly because they were awaiting
results of the study.;   The third most popular castaway noted in the study
was the entire category called "organics." Food, tires and rubber waste, wood,
agricultural residue, manure, textiles and leather were included as organics.;
  The study also looked at what the commercial and industrial sectors throw
out, revealing that commercial businesses toss out a large quantity of paper
products, which include corrugated cardboard, computer paper and other paper.
Between 40 and <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of what they toss is paper.;   About one-quarter of
what they toss is food products and other organic material, which also was not
a surprise to officials because of the large number of restaurants in the <LOCATION>West
Valley</LOCATION> cities.;   Among the cities, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> residents showed they toss out
more yard waste than <PERSON>Monte Sereno</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>. Saratoga officials declined
to provide any figures.;   Nearly <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> of what <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> residents dump
is yard waste. Forty percent of <ORGANIZATION>Monte Sereno</ORGANIZATION>'s garbage is yard waste and
nearly <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>' refuse is tree and grass clippings.;   In <LOCATION>Los
Gatos</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> of trash is paper products; in <PERSON>Monte Sereno</PERSON>, <PERCENT>29 percent</PERCENT>
thrown out is paper, and in <LOCATION>Campbell</LOCATION>, one-quarter of what residents toss is
paper.;   Research for the garbage study involved workers poring through
dozens of refuse bins -- piece by piece -- at the <LOCATION>Guadalupe Landfill</LOCATION>. Workers
sorted through soiled diapers, gooey rags, slimy wrappers, rotten food and
maggot-ridden dog food cans.;   The study by solid waste consulting company
<ORGANIZATION>Cal Recovery Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of Hercules was conducted during 10 days in July.;   All the
cities have curbside recycling programs for newspaper, glass, aluminum and
corrugated cardboard. But, <PERSON>Dahle</PERSON> said, the new study hopes to illustrate the
need for the cities to develop more recycling services.;   <PERSON>Dahle</PERSON> said the
garbage profile and other information she is gathering on waste reduction will
be combined into a larger report that will go to the cities early next year.
After that, it's up to the cities to act on new programs.;   <LOCATION>All California</LOCATION>
cities are under a state mandate to analyze their waste stream and propose a
plan for future disposal or recycling by the end of this year.;   The state's
solid waste law, passed in <DATE>1989</DATE>, says all cities must come up with plans to
reduce the amount of garbage sent to landfills by <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> by <DATE>1995</DATE> and <PERCENT>50
percent</PERCENT> by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>. The penalty for not meeting the goal: <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> a
day.; Garbage cans; Here is what a consultant's study shows <LOCATION>West Valley</LOCATION>
residents throw away.; (box)<LOCATION>Campbell</LOCATION>: Nearly <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> of what residents dump
is yard waste; <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> paper products; <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> organics such as food,
tires and rubber waste, wood, agricultural residue, manure, textiles and
leather.; (box)<LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>: <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> yard waste; <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> paper; <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT>

CALTECH DESIGN CONTEST SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth annual <ORGANIZATION>Caltech Engineering Design Contest</ORGANIZATION> will take place next 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. <PERSON>Erik Antonsson</PERSON>'s mechanical engineering class will compete in a 
double-elimination tournament in which students are given "a bag of junk" to be 
used as raw materials in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
About 24 students, mostly juniors, receive identical sets of materials to build 
machines. They must fashion assorted pieces of plexiglass, aluminum, tubing, 
springs, rubber bands, paper clips, two small electric motors and other 
materials into a Ping-Pong ball-collecting machine. They can use only the 
materials supplied to build their machines. 
</P>
<P>
In the contest -- which ends the two-month-long design and construction process 
-- two machines face off on a table with an irregular surface and a trough of 
Ping-Pong balls in the center. Students and machines then vie to collect as 
many Ping-Pong balls from the trough in a 30-second period. 
</P>
<P>
Students have been working on their projects since the beginning of class <DATE>Oct</DATE>. 
1. Eighty percent of the students' class grade depends on the design and 
performance of their machines in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
About half of their grade on the project is based on performance in the 
contest. The other half is based on imagination and the demonstration of 
engineering principles.

<DESCRIPT>  HOUSING; CLEANUP  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  YOU would think the shower area, which gets daily doses of warm water, soap
and shampoo, would stay naturally clean. Not so.;    Mold, mildew, soap film
and other stains mar surfaces, and mineral deposits clog shower heads.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Spring Real Estate Special
Household Hints  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Here are some tips to help keep shower stalls or tub showers clean and
clog-free.;    (check) What's the best time to clean your shower? Right after
using it, when steam has loosened the dirt. Just wipe off the damp surfaces
with a paper towel.;    (check) Remove mildew from the grout between ceramic
tiles by wetting the surfaces with water and then spraying them with a
solution of 1 cup bleach to 1 quart water. Scrub the grout with an old
toothbrush.;    If the grout is grungy-looking, clean it with full-strength
vinegar instead. Caution: Make sure the room is well ventilated while you do
the job and that towels and fabric shower curtains are out of range of the
spray.;    (check) Wipe away soap spots or film from tile with a solution of
water and water conditioner, or a solution of one part vinegar to four parts
water. Rinse, then dry with a soft cloth.;    (check) Stained tub or tile
surfaces come clean with a paste made of cream of tartar and hydrogen
peroxide. Spread the paste over the stain and scrub lightly with a brush. Let
the paste dry and then wipe or rinse it off.;    (check) If you're tired of
cleaning around non-skid decals in your porcelain tub or shower, scrape them
off with a single-edge razor blade (in a holder) dipped in soapy water. Remove
adhesive residue with acetone or nail-polish remover.;    (check) Unless the
care label indicates a shower curtain is machine washable, wash it in the
bathtub with warm water and detergent. Hang the curtain on its hooks to dry.
If the curtain can be machine washed, put in two or three large towels to
balance the load. To remove soap film, add a half cup baking soda to the wash
water. To keep the curtain supple, add a half cup vinegar or a few drops of
mineral oil to the wash water.;    You can remove mildew from a bleachable
shower curtain by sponging it with a solution of one part chlorine bleach to
eight parts water. If the fabric cannot be bleached, spread on a paste of
baking soda and gently rub the curtain before washing.;    (check) To unclog a
shower head, remove it from the wall pipe by using a pair of pipe wrenches
with jaws wrapped with tape to avoid marring the chrome. Use one wrench to
hold the pipe steady while you turn the collar of the shower head with the
other. Disassemble the shower head and soak the parts overnight in full
strength vinegar to soften mineral deposits. Then scrub the parts clean with a
stiff brush. Use a toothpick or an unbent paper clip to poke debris and
mineral deposits from the shower holes.;    (check) If your shower head has
seen better days, it might be better to replace it. Consider one that has a
non-clogging plastic face plate or install a water-conserving head or one that
delivers a pulsating flow or has a hand-shower attachment. To install a new
head, simply remove the old head. Wrap pipe-sealing tape (available at
hardware stores) around the pipe threads. Then screw the new shower head into
place.  </TEXT>

   Everything Looks in Place
   For Sellers of Neatness Aids

RETAILING (RET)
</IN>
<LP>
   You've shopped till you dropped. But where do you put it
all when you get it home?
   The solution is to shop a little more, according to a
growing group of retailers who specialize in so-called
organization materials, items designed to tidy every inch of
the home and office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Organizing stores are sprouting in upscale shopping areas
in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, and some retailers
have expanded nationwide via direct-mail catalogs. Most
target affluent consumers by emphasizing efficiency and time
management, as well as home and hearth.
   The businesses feed off demographic and cultural shifts
that are likely to shape the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. Women who cleaned up
after the family a generation ago are out working. The number
of households is increasing as average household size
shrinks, meaning more but smaller residences. And as a
society, Americans are probably the most acquisitive people
in history.
   "We're in an accumulation mode that knows no bounds," says
<PERSON>Stephanie Culp</PERSON>, an organizing consultant and a founding
member of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Professional
Organizers</ORGANIZATION>. "So people find themselves in a terrible space
crunch."
   Hold Everything, a retail and catalog seller of organizing
goods, plans an ambitious national expansion this year. <PERSON>Kent
C. Larson</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Williams-Sonoma Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> kitchenware merchant that owns the business,
attributes the boom in part to soaring real estate prices and
a tendency for people to entertain and relax at home. Hold
Everything, which started as a small catalog in <DATE>1982</DATE>, plans
to open stores in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
cities to complement its expanding chain in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>.
   The nascent organizing business is also taking advantage
of a retailing shift. Much of what they stock is designed to
complement personal computers, electronic entertainment
components and other modern inventions. But other goods are
low-tech housekeeping staples from the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and <DATE>1950s</DATE>, such
as coated wire cupboard shelves and sweater drying racks --
items once found in department store notions sections, dry
goods stores and five-and-dime stores, which have virtually
died out in many areas of the country.
   <PERSON>Maynard Hale Lyndon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lu Wendel Lyndon</PERSON>, architectural
design specialists, say much has changed since they founded
the Placewares chain in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>. Consumers are more
interested in recycling and efficient use of resources, <PERSON>Mr.
Lyndon</PERSON> says, and American manufacturers are finally producing
quality products once exclusively designed in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Placewares, which just opened it seventh <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> store,
also sells via catalog and is planning further growth.
   <ORGANIZATION>Lillian Vernon Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the specialty catalog concern,
reports that some of its longtime storage and organization
items such as newspaper racks and recycling aids have
suddenly surged in popularity.
   Although the organizing business doesn't have any firm
statistics of its own, the <ORGANIZATION>National Housewares Manufacturers
Association</ORGANIZATION> says the general categories of bath, laundry,
closet and storage wares in <DATE>1988</DATE> accounted for about <PERCENT>4.6%</PERCENT> of
the <MONEY>$35.2 billion</MONEY> of housewares sales, or a total of about
<MONEY>$1.62 billion</MONEY>.
   An organizing store's inventory generally includes
kitchen, utility room, bathroom, garage and home office
items, and occasionally furniture and tableware as well. But
some, such as <ORGANIZATION>Organizer</ORGANIZATION>'s Paradise in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, take an
even broader approach, pitching their stores as stylish
outlets where shoppers can buy anything from modular cupboard
organizers to a <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> electric blue ultrasuede swing settee.
"There was a real void in the market for upscale products,"
says <PERSON>Sandy Chism</PERSON>, who along with her daughter, <LOCATION>Christi</LOCATION>, runs
three stores in the fashionable Westwood, <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> and
West Hollywood areas.
   Merchants who haven't organized their own business plans
in the new field may find a closet full of problems --
pricing being a big one. Many organization stores offer such
sticker-shock inducers as <MONEY>$25</MONEY> plastic sock storage boxes and
<MONEY>$8</MONEY> assortments of decorative paper clips.
   Home-improvement stores, hardware stores and discount
stores are beginning to stock more organizing items, often at
prices that specialty stores can't match. The specialty
stores figure they can overcome the price gap by offering
higher quality and better selection and focusing on smaller
organizing niches.
   As with any new retailing concept, experts note, targeting
the right customers can be crucial to success.
   "A retailer is going to have higher sales and faster
{merchandise turnover} if the focus is on one area," says
<PERSON>Marcia Aaron</PERSON>, a specialty retail analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery
Securities</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. By moving too far into other
areas such as furniture or other housewares, retailers can
dilute their customer base.
   <PERSON>Ms. Aaron</PERSON> says the organizing and storage market has been
underserved up to now. "But there are a lot of people trying
to get in," she says. "And eventually, some will have to pull
out because it's just too competitive."
   Retailers say it can be a challenge to make people see a
need for organization wares. "Most people just don't go
around thinking, `I really need a laundry-room organizer,'"
says a sales clerk at a Los Angeles-area store. "But once you
get them in here, you can't get them out."
   Many shoppers agree. "You get caught up," says <PERSON>Mara
Slutsky</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, a customer at Placewares. She bought a
shower organizer and colored hooks for the bathroom, and says
she had to restrain herself from buying "everything
imaginable."
   <PERSON>Ms. Slutsky</PERSON>'s only criticism of the merchandise is a
common one among several firms' customers: "After a while,
everything looks alike," she says of the sleek,
modern-looking wares. Nonetheless, she says, she plans
another shopping spree when she moves to a new apartment.
   <PERSON>Lori Lavin</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>West Los Angeles</LOCATION> resident, gushes over the
merchandise in a new 13,000-square-foot Organizer's Paradise
store as she wheels a wire shopping cart piled with
contemporary black desktop items and colorful kitchen
gadgets. In two visits, she says, she's plunked down more
than <MONEY>$130</MONEY> to update her closets, kitchen and desk. "I don't
have the time to dig through a lot of junk," she says of her
cleanup efforts.
   That, retailers say, is an important selling point. "Most
people who are space-conscious are time-sensitive as well,"
says <PERSON>Carol Fraser</PERSON>, director of the Hold Everything catalog.
The stores tap into the same mentality that has made
enormous, multisectioned diary planners such a hit.
   Some say that the merchandise appeals to customers because
it allows them to attribute their sloppiness to a technical,
rather than a personal, flaw. "You're not buying a crutch for
your character," says <PERSON>Dr. Jerald Jellison</PERSON>, a psychology
professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION>. "You just
don't have the right equipment" to be neat.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The San Francisco Chronicle has lost a
fight with the Internal Revenue Service over the newspaper's
claim to a $2.9 million tax deduction for donating its
clipping files to charity.
   The U.S. Tax Court, in a decision filed Tuesday, agreed
with the IRS that the 7.8 million clippings dating back to
1906 were not property which, if sold, would have created
capital gains.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The finding that the clippings qualified as ordinary
income property limited the deduction to the newspaper's
basis, or cost, of producing the files. Although the files
cost more than <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to create, the <ORGANIZATION>Chronicle</ORGANIZATION>'s basis
in the property was zero, because the cost had been written
off as an ordinary business expense.
   The ruling apparently left the newspaper and its parent,
<ORGANIZATION>Chronicle Publishing Co.</ORGANIZATION>, liable for back taxes totaling <MONEY>$1.3
million</MONEY> for the years <DATE>1983 through 1985</DATE>. The court also
rejected the <ORGANIZATION>Chronicle</ORGANIZATION>'s argument that the deduction
limitation applied only to individuals, not to corporations.
   In deciding against the newspaper, <PERSON>Judge Theodore
Tannenwald Jr.</PERSON> said it may well be that similar clippings
should be considered a capital asset when contributed to
charity. But that issue, he added, is a policy question in
the jurisdiction of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Chronicle had reproduced its clippings on microfiche
before giving them to the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Historical Society.
