<LEADPARA>  IN 1857, Elisha G. Otis invented the passenger elevator. Fifteen years later,
William LeBaron Jenny designed the first skyscraper, a 10-story structure.;   
Naturally, someone had to invent the elevator before someone could build a
skyscraper, but the same year that gave us the skyscraper gave us the
commercial electric fan. Cool.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If these seemingly disparate historical tidbits attract you, then leaf
through "The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Public Library Desk Reference," a book full of
surprises. It is based on the more than 5 million questions the library and
its 82 branches answer each year.;    <PERSON>Vartan Gregorian</PERSON>, former president and
chief executive officer of the library, writes in his preface, ". . . unlike
annuals and almanacs that need revising and updating each year, the <ORGANIZATION>Desk
Reference</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Stonesong Press</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$34.95</MONEY>) holds a considerable amount of true
reference information, unchanging basic facts and background.;    "We also
hope that our book will be easy to read and fun to browse through.";    It
is.;    For instance, if you know <PERSON>Thomas Alva Edison</PERSON> invented the phonograph
in <DATE>1878</DATE>, you will be pleased to know <PERSON>L.O. Colvin</PERSON>  invented the milking machine
the same year, and <PERSON>James J. Ritty</PERSON>  invented the cash register the year after
that.;    These were heady times, a veritable cascade of brainstorms. But
every year was like that.;    For instance, last year was the 110th birthday
of the hearing aid, and the 120th for linoleum and the snap button. It also
was the 100th anniversary of motion pictures and the electric subway. It was
the 90th anniversary of the paper clip.;    This year is the 100th birthday of
the flashlight (by <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Bristol Electric Lamp Co.</ORGANIZATION>), the aluminum boat (by
<LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Escher Wyss &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>) and the zipper (by <PERSON>Whitcombe L. Judson</PERSON>).;   
The Desk Reference has less esoteric fare. It tells you how to write your
member of congress and how to call toll-free for rental cars and hotels. There
are 15 pages of visa requirements to travel anywhere from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> to
Zimbabwe.;    There is an illustrated section on the human anatomy and one on
how to play board games from backgammon to Scrabble or cards  from blackjack
to solitaire.;    There is simply no way to list all of the tidy bits of
information from dietary tables to musical terms and symbols,  from extinct
animals to semaphore, from etiquette to legal forms, from animal first aid to
a directory of poison control centers.;    It's also a settler of arguments.
Take religion: The book says there are 648 million Hindus, 18 million Jews,
840 million Muslims, 158 million Orthodox Catholics, 307 million Buddhists and
5.6 million followers of Confucius.;    In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, there are 31
million Baptists, 2.7 million Episcopalians, 13.5 million Methodists, 2.8
million Mormons, 8 million Lutherans and 700,000 Jehovah's Witnesses. But
worldwide, there are 900 million Roman Catholics, the largest <ORGANIZATION>Christian Church</ORGANIZATION>
in the world. It takes 6 1/2 pages to list all the popes.;    One thing that
strikes the reader is how long ago some of the inventions sprang from the
human mind. And what in the world did mankind do before they came along?;   
We were blessed with the screwdriver and wrench about 1550 by unknown
gunsmiths.  </TEXT>

   An avid football fan is hoping to score with a
book designed to help people tell the difference between the
end-around and the end zone.

football, author <PERSON>Donna Foehr</PERSON> said. It also contains information
about college, high school, pee-wee and Canadian football, she
added.
   ``Football is not for everyone, but there are a lot of people
who want to learn more about the game,'' she said.
   Foehr, 57, of suburban <LOCATION>Bloomfield Hills</LOCATION>, said she has gone to
football games for as long as she can remember and is a
season-ticket holder for <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> Lions games.
   Almost all topics of the game are defined in the <MONEY>$9.95</MONEY> book
published by <ORGANIZATION>National Press</ORGANIZATION>, from the dimensions of the field to
little-used plays like the drop kick.
   ``It took me about five months to write the book but once that
was done, I spent about 500 hours re-editing it,'' she said. ``It
seemed that every time the publisher sent me changes in the
manuscript, I would change them back again and that went on several

<HEAD>No Strings Pulled to Stay Out of Vietnam, Quayle Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> aide said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Dan
Quayle</PERSON> was asked, before being selected as running mate, whether
strings were pulled to get him into the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> and avoid
service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said none were, the aide recounted.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION>. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' <PERSON>Robert Teeter</PERSON> told
reporters.
   ``He, at some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone
else','' said <PERSON>Teeter</PERSON>, who oversaw <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s vice presidential
selection process.
   Quayle himself, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, said he was ``almost
certain'' that the governor or lieutenant governor of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> were
not asked to help him get in the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1969</DATE>.
   ``Many of us got in,'' he said, adding that he was speaking on
the basis of recollections that are 20 years old.
   At the time, men <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s age were being drafted into the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
and many were sent to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   In an interview with <ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said he chose the <ORGANIZATION>National
Guard</ORGANIZATION> _ rather than risking the draft _ because that course allowed
him to fulfill his military obligation and still attend law school.
   But if his <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> unit had been called up _ none were
during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War _ he said he ``would have gone and served
very proudly.''
   And he told CNN: ``I was willing and ready to serve my country.
I chose to serve my country in the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> like millions of
other people.''
   The question arose as every aspect of <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s life came under
intense scrutiny following his surprise selection by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   An NBC-owned <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> television station, WRC-TV, said
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> ``may have received help from then <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Edgar
Whitcomb</PERSON>.'' Citing Republican sources it did not name, the station
said <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> was working as an administrative assistant in the
governor's office in <DATE>1969</DATE> and <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON> moved <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> to the top of a
``lengthy'' waiting list for enrollment in the guard.
   However, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s biography showed that he had not started
working for <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON> until <DATE>1971</DATE>, two years after he joined the
<ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Jeff Nesbit</PERSON>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> press secretary, told of the television
station's report, said: ``I can say nothing more than what he
(<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>) said. Basically some of the other folks he went to college
with wanted to get in and most of them got in. What he said has to
stand at this time.''

   <PERSON>JoBeth Williams</PERSON> will portray surrogate mother <PERSON>Mary Beth

   The two-part movie, to air at an undetermined date this <DATE>spring</DATE>,
will also feature <PERSON>John Shea</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dabney Coleman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bruce Weitz</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Laurel Whitcomb</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The goal of the movie ``is to tell the story without adopting
any one point of view,'' <PERSON>Ms. Whitcomb</PERSON> said in a telephone interview
from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   The movie will include an update at the end because the case is
still unfolding, <PERSON>Ms. Whitcomb</PERSON> said.
   The latest developments involve legal proceedings to determine
the visitation schedule for <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON>, whose parental
rights to the 22-month old child were restored in a <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey
Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision earlier this month.
   The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision that
upheld a <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> contract under which <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON> was
artificially inseminated with <PERSON>William Stern</PERSON>'s sperm and bore the
child for him and his wife, <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>.
   In addition to stripping <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON> of her parental
rights, the lower court last <DATE>March 31</DATE> awarded custody to the <LOCATION>Sterns</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> maintained custody for the Sterns but voided
the contract and ruled that <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON> was entitled to a
hearing on visiting the child.
   Attorneys for <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Sterns</PERSON> have agreed to
try to reach an out-of-court settlement on visitation rights.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Harold Cassidy</PERSON>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
that his client would be seeking more visitation time than the
current two hours a week.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Whitehead-Gould</PERSON>, who originally called the child <PERSON>Sara</PERSON>,
``has agreed to call the child <PERSON>Melissa</PERSON> and do whatever it takes to
achieve harmony,'' the attorney said.
   Williams starred in ``The Big Chill,'' ``Poltergeist'' and
``<PERSON>Kramer vs. Kramer</PERSON>,'' and received an Emmy nomination for her part
in the TV movie ``Adam.''
   Shea, who starred in ``Witness'' and ``Windy City,'' will

Story'' will star as <PERSON>Gary Skoloff</PERSON>, the attorney representing the
<PERSON>Sterns</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   A pocket-sized spray version of cayenne pepper is
being used by growing numbers of police agencies to temporarily
disable drunks, drug addicts and snarling dogs, the device's
manufacturer says.
   <PERSON>Gardner Whitcomb</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Cap-Stun Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said his company's
sales have quadrupled this year to more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>.
   More than 1,000 police agencies have switched from mace to
Cap-Stun since the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> decided to switch to the pepper spray last
<DATE>fall</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>The Denver Post</ORGANIZATION> reported today.
   Women concerned about a <PERCENT>57 percent</PERCENT> surge in rapes in the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>
area over the past year also are turning to Cap-Stun. But some
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> police officials have doubts about its effectiveness.
   ``Unless it hits you right in the open eyes, it takes too long to
incapacitate you,'' said Sgt. <PERSON>Dave Abrams</PERSON>, supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION>Denver
Police Department</ORGANIZATION>'s SWAT team. ``I've seen it take more than a
minute.''
   <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> police spray at too close a range to allow
formation of a mist that can be inhaled.
   A <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> chemist developed the spray 20 years ago when his
wife, summoned to court to testify about a holdup she witnessed,
wanted nonlethal protection against thugs who threatened her life.
   Cap-Stun is supposed to stop dogs and intoxicated or drugged
criminals, who often are unaffected or angered by mace. The pepper
attacks membranes inside the nose.
   The spray does not have lasting effects, promising reduced
brutality charges against police.

   They Could Be Like the French

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Attorney Richard Such says he could
have "spent my whole life wishing vaguely to have more
vacation." But instead, he decided to work on changing
things.
   Mr. Such is launching a drive to amend the California
Constitution to grant workers six weeks off every year.
Noting that "there has been little progress in American
vacation policy since the Depression," he says the amendment
would bring "California vacation policy up to the European
standard."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the proposal became law, families would be able to
spend time "more meaningfully than in the classic American
frantic effort to squeeze a visit to grandma, a glimpse of
the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Canyon</ORGANIZATION> and a stop at <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> into two or three
weeks," <PERSON>Mr. Such</PERSON> says. More leisure time would also cure
worker burnout, he claims, as employees "return rested,
invigorated . . . with new perspectives and new ideas, ready
to do better work."
   In order to make the plan palatable to employers, workers
would have to meet certain conditions to qualify for six
weeks off, including having a high-school education, not
smoking on the job and not having convictions for drug or
alcohol abuse. Employees could skip one of the conditions by
taking public transport, car pooling or cycling to work.
   "If this gets on the ballot, it will pass overwhelmingly,"
predicts <PERSON>Mr. Such</PERSON>.
   But <PERSON>Fred Main</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>California Chamber of
Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, says it would have a "horrible economic impact." He
calls the initiative a "silly proposal with little, if any,
chance of qualifying" because it has no organized support.
   Under <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> law, any registered voter who pays <MONEY>$200</MONEY>
can submit an initiative. To qualify for the <DATE>June 1992</DATE>
ballot, a sponsor must gather 615,957 signatures.
   In the past two years, citizens have submitted 69
initiatives, including ones that would allow prayer in
school, legalize marijuana, prohibit aliens from owning land
and let juries decide whether certain laws should be on the
books. (Of those, 18 qualified for the ballot and six became
law.)
   "All {proposals} are treated equally, and given the same
scrutiny, even if some people think they're wacko," says <PERSON>Mary
Whitcomb</PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION>'s government-law
section, which is required to review proposals. Whatever
happens, <PERSON>Ms. Whitcomb</PERSON> won't get extra time off. The six-week
vacation initiative doesn't include any government workers.

   The crime report in Cobb County, Ga., looks a bit strange
these days. To the list of assaults, break-ins and armed
robberies, add: picking flowers and not returning movie
rentals.
   In a pair of cases that have local attorneys shaking their
heads, police appear to be cracking down on some fairly mild
misdeeds. Rebecca Anding, 29 years old, spent six hours in
jail on Easter Sunday after she was caught picking tulips
from an office park in Marietta, Ga. And Linda Judson, 28,
spent four hours in jail after she was arrested at her home
in late May. The charge: She hadn't returned two rentals to
her local video store after having them for a couple of
months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I feel like I'm negligent, irresponsible and stupid, but
I don't feel like I stole," says <PERSON>Ms. Judson</PERSON>. "If I wanted a
stupid movie, I'd buy it."
   County officials defend the arrests, saying even minor
crimes can't be ignored. But lawyers are astounded the county
is wasting its time. "It probably fits within the four
corners of the statute, but that doesn't mean it's right,"
says <PERSON>Don Samuel</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> criminal-defense attorney. "Let's
really deter people from these heinous crimes," he adds. "Why
not just use the death penalty?"
   <PERSON>Ms. Anding</PERSON> says she was cutting flowers for her
grandmother's grave when she was handcuffed and booked for
misdemeanor theft. "I was shook up," she says. But <PERSON>Patrick
Head</PERSON>, county solicitor, raises the specter of a barren
landscape: "Think what the complex would look like if
everybody could pick flowers."
   <PERSON>Ms. Judson</PERSON> contends that she put the two movies in her car
and completely forgot about them when she left the state on a
series of business trips. She says she received no written or
telephone reminder to return the films. And they weren't
charged to her credit card, the usual policy for long-overdue
videos, she says.
   <PERSON>Mark Michael</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>West Coast Video of Smyrna</ORGANIZATION>, says
he doesn't have a credit-card number for <PERSON>Ms. Judson</PERSON> and adds
that he did call her. "We perceive it as theft," he says.
   Both women are going to court in <DATE>August</DATE> rather than plead
no contest, pay hefty fines and get a criminal record. The
maximum penalties, which <PERSON>Mr. Head</PERSON> says are absolutely out of
the question, are a year in jail and a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> fine.
   <PERSON>Ms. Anding</PERSON> says the incident has made her cautious about
flowers, even when buying them. "I save the receipts."

<HEAD>Announcements This Week Should Fuel Laptop Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Klaus K. Obermeier</PERSON> used to compute only in his
office. Now that he has a laptop computer, he computes in the back
seat of the car, on the plane, beside the pool and even, he admits,
in bed.
   <PERSON>Obermeier</PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION>Battelle Memorial Institute</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, is the kind of person who is making laptop models
into one of the hottest segments of the computer business.
   Until recently, laptop computers tended to be underpowered and
overpriced, with small, poorly lit screens and batteries that ran
out at inconvenient times.
   Those problems have not been conquered completely, but enough
progress has been made to release a flood of pent-up demand among
business people, students, writers and others.
   Sales of laptop computers will surpass <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> this year and are growing at a rate of <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> annually,
according to <ORGANIZATION>Dataquest Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a market researcher.
   This fall, in some ways, marks the coming of age of laptop
computers.
   This week, on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Toshiba Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NEC
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> are expected to unveil new models for the laptop market, an
industry segment where they have enjoyed some of their greatest
success in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Compaq Computer Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which disdained the market until now, is
expected to introduce its first laptop model at an <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> press
conference in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. The Houston-based company says only that it
will announce a ``new dimension'' in personal computing.
   Finally, analysts say <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> will
come out soon with a successor to its 2-year-old PC Convertible, a
relatively slow machine that has been criticized by computer buffs.
<ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Scott Brooks</PERSON> confirmed that a new laptop is planned
but would not say when it would be available.
   As a sign of the market's importance, <ORGANIZATION>Zenith Electronics Corp.</ORGANIZATION>,
which dominates the government market for laptops, has even managed
to make the machines the linchpin of its entire data systems
business.
   ``The laptop market is one that is coming into its own after
many years of really being a niche market,'' said <PERSON>Margaret
Rodenberg</PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION>Entre Computer Centers
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a retail chain.
   Laptop computers have always gotten good press, perhaps because
journalists were some of their earliest users. <ORGANIZATION>Tandy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Radio
Shack TRS 80 Model 100 even earned an affectionate nickname on the
campaign trail _ the ``Trash 80.''
   But people who needed more computing power shied away from them.
<PERSON>John Vanden Brink</PERSON>, a consultant in <LOCATION>Des Plaines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, said he once
destroyed an entire database when he tried to transfer something
out of his <ORGANIZATION>Radio Shack</ORGANIZATION> and exceeded the memory limit.
   The newest models, in contrast, are loaded with power. Toshiba
and <ORGANIZATION>NEC</ORGANIZATION> are both announcing models this week that use <ORGANIZATION>Intel Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s
top-of-the-line 80386 microprocessor, PC Week newspaper says.
   The problem with speedy computers is they are ravenous for
electricity and drain batteries quickly. Seizing an opportunity,
<ORGANIZATION>Chips and Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, recently
introduced a set of chips that will double or triple the length of
time that many laptops can run on batteries.
   Prices for laptops are relatively high _ <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> _
because of the expense of the batteries, energy-saving CMOS memory
chips and the complex technology of flat screens.
   The flat screens of laptops flip up like the top of a clamshell
and usually display 25 lines at a time, in comparison to the 40
lines of a regular personal computer. Brightness and contrast,
although much improved, still don't match those of full-sized PCs.
   Once on the road, laptop owners have abundant headaches: No
place to recharge batteries, no modular phone jacks, hotel phone
switches that can't handle data transmissions, 3{-inch disks that
aren't compatible with other people's 5\-inch disks.
   Still, something keeps laptop users tapping away.
   Laptops, like cellular phones, allow people to keep working
while others are stuck in traffic or thumbing through the in-flight
magazine. They also encourage spontaneity by letting people record
or try out ideas while they are fresh.
   ``I would say there's like a 150 to <PERCENT>200 percent</PERCENT> improvement in
my productivity. I can't even think with a paper and pencil
anymore,'' said <PERSON>Jeffrey Greene</PERSON>, a laptop enthusiast who works in
the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Hay Group Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based
personnel consulting firm.
   Of course, working through the night on a laptop on a long
flight can be bad for one's public image, said <PERSON>Jerry Whitcomb</PERSON>, a
consultant at <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta-based Management Science America Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``People think you're a workaholic,'' <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON>, nonetheless, is a confirmed laptop user. He even uses
it in the office: ``It does everything a regular PC does so I don't
need to have both,'' he said.

<P>
<PERSON>Myron Selznick</PERSON> married Daw, <PERSON>Joan</PERSON>'s mother, but they were divorced in <DATE>1942</DATE>, 2 
years before he was to die in his mid-40s of an internal hemorrhage. Joan was 
14 at the time and living in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Changes 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Joan</PERSON> had changed her name several times, however. The name listed on the death 
certificate is <PERSON>Frances Whitcomb</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Geoffrey Selznick</PERSON>, a cousin of <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> and a 
film producer in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Geoffrey Selznick</PERSON> said <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> had been married and divorced twice and that "for 
reasons we don't know" took the name of <PERSON>Frances Whitcomb</PERSON>. She had no children. 
She had been living in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> for at least 20 years, he said, as a "very, 
very private person." 
</P>
<P>
"She loved it in <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Geoffrey Selznick</PERSON> said, "but she was a recluse, 
and the neighbors report that she had not been out of the house in the <DATE>last 10</DATE> 
to 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Joan Selznick</PERSON> inherited some prime real estate from her father, including the

early moguls. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that her father brought <PERSON>Vivien Leigh</PERSON> to <PERSON>David Selznick</PERSON> during the 
filming of the burning of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> and told him, 'Here's your Scarlett."' 
</P>
<P>
At the time, <PERSON>David Selznick</PERSON> had tested other actresses but had not made a final

</P>
<P>
The county public administrator/guardian's office has opened an investigation

<TEXT>
   Innovations expected to propel the manufacturing
industry into the future, including video headsets and floating
concrete, are on display at the <ORGANIZATION>National Design Engineering Show</ORGANIZATION>
and Conference.
   About 25,000 engineers are expected to converge on <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s
lakefront <ORGANIZATION>McCormick Place</ORGANIZATION> through <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to see new designs from
companies such as <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Co.</ORGANIZATION> _ even <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many of the products and materials on display represent minor
advances _ a fiber that resists fading just a bit longer, for
example. Nevertheless, consumers will feel the effect of the new
technology.
   ``You and I, ultimately, in some way will be related or involved
with every single product in this show, whether it's paint on an
automobile or the <DATE>spring</DATE> in the seat or the knobs to turn on your
hi-fi,'' said <PERSON>Robert Rosaler</PERSON>, director of an engineering conference
sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>American Society of Mechanical Engineers</ORGANIZATION> in
conjunction with the show.
   Some new products debuting at the show take a broader step into
the future.
   For example, a <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> company is showing a miniature
video display monitor slightly larger than a lipstick. Through the
use of a magnifying lens, the one-inch display window produces an
image that looks as though it is on a 12-inch screen.
   ``This is basically the walkman of the future. It's a
videoman,'' said <PERSON>Raymond Hoffer</PERSON>, a representative of Reflection
Technology of <LOCATION>Waltham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   By <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, the mini video monitor is due to appear in stores
as a component in a 5-by-2 inch paperless pocket fax machine, said
<PERSON>Neil Golden</PERSON>, director of sales for <ORGANIZATION>Reflection Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   The 2-ounce terminal can display 25 lines of 80 characters each
on a red-and-black screen. It can attach to a headband that
positions the video screen a few inches in front of the eyes,
allowing a person to look up information while leaving the hands
free to work.
   At least eight other companies plan to use Reflection
Technology's monitor in products including a 5-by-3 portable
computer and a patient monitor that doctors can wear in the
operating room, Golden said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is at the show ``to make the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> engineering and
scientific community aware that there is <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> technology available
that they may use,'' said <PERSON>Walter Heiland</PERSON>, manager of the agency's
<ORGANIZATION>Technology Utilization Office</ORGANIZATION>.
   The space agency has a history of spinning off its technological
advances.
   For example, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s need in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> for a tool that Apollo
astronauts could use to scoop up moon rocks, resulted in hand-held
cordless vacuum cleaners that eventually reached consumers. More
recently, a version of a pump developed for the Viking Mars lander
has been implanted in people to deliver medicine such as insulin.
   3M is showcasing a lightweight concrete subsitute called
Macrolite that weighs about a third as much as the real thing.
   To illustrate, 3M representatives filled a tub with water and
put in two ``concrete'' logs. One sinks. The other, made of the
substitute, floats.
   Developed by 3M in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the lightweight concrete can be used
for building in earthquake-prone areas.
   ``You can build the same high-rise buildings, only much lighter,
so when they sway they don't topple over,'' said <PERSON>William Whitcomb</PERSON>,
a company representative.
   3M says the ceramic substance, pumped with air, is a better
insulator than concrete. An 8-inch wall of Macrolite provides the
insulating power of 65 inches of concrete, <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON> said.
   Dow Plastics, a division of <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, Mich.-based Dow, is on hand
with a product it has no intention of producing _ a plastic,
elliptical lawnmower that cuts a swath about a foot wider than
traditional push mowers.
   Plastic allows a bigger machine that is no tougher to push than
steel and aluminum models, said mower designer <PERSON>Robert Cleereman</PERSON>.
   The idea is to show commercial engineers that plastics _
particularly Dow plastics _ can be used in place of metals and
woods, said <PERSON>Cleereman</PERSON>, who also is director of <ORGANIZATION>Dow</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Materials
Engineering Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Here's an example where plastics not only do it as well, they
do it better,'' he said.

<LEADPARA>  If ever you doubted that civilization is going straight into the tank, wonder

FAN BALKS AT PITCH FOR PHONES IN THE STANDS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     No doubt you've read, or more likely somebody has called to tell you, that
the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and A's now offer at-your-seat telephone service during weekday
baseball games.;    "It's sort of a far-out idea still for some people," says
<PERSON>Lorreta Whitcomb</PERSON>, who speaks for Cellular One, a key instigator in the
scheme.;    For others, it's sort of a pain in the butt.;    <ORGANIZATION>Like Giants</ORGANIZATION>
fanatic <PERSON>Ellen Chandler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, who arrived at Candlestick Park
recently with her headset radio, binoculars, score card, hat decorated with
<ORGANIZATION>Croix de Candlestick</ORGANIZATION> pins and the full expectation of reveling in the ecstasy
of day baseball on a day when ordinarily she would be at work.;    Uh-uh. In
the bottom of the second, with <PERSON>Matt Williams</PERSON> at bat, Cellular One came calling
for <PERSON>Ellen Chandler</PERSON>. She had a call from <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. As she was trying to figure
out what was going on and how to work her way from her seat in the middle of
the row to the aisle and the cellular telephone, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> lofted one over the
left field fence. Home run.;    Did she see it?;    "Yeah," she lied. "Well, I
didn't see where the ball landed.";    Seems a friend -- or by now a former
friend -- knew where <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> was sitting and had set up a three-way
conference call among old chums. In short, the technology had fallen into the
wrong hands.;     "He's <PERSON>Mr. Telephone</PERSON>," <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> said. "He's always calling
from his car.";    Face it, telephones do not belong in cars, on planes or on
trains. You should not carry them in your pocket, and anyone who brings one to
the golf course should be shot.;    They certainly do not belong in the
bathroom, where they are turning up with disturbing regularity. What call
could be important enough to interrupt <ORGANIZATION>Nature</ORGANIZATION>'s own, with the possible
exception of an emergency ring for toilet paper. Even then, whom are you going
to call and what exactly are you going to say?;    For years we survived quite
nicely with a phone at home, one at work and a pay phone here and there. But
now, that's just not good enough.;    "It's EASY &amp; FREE," the publicity pieces
sent to baseball fans trumpet. "You can return calls FREE from your seat with
mobile phones brought to you by CELLULAR ONE.";    First the wave, then dot
racing, now this.;     If you're just too important to break away -- or even
if you just think you are -- here's how this deal works. First, give your
boss, partners, clients, bookie or probation officer the special number that
will put them through to helpful cellular people at Candlestick or the
<ORGANIZATION>Coliseum</ORGANIZATION>. Then give the same helpful celluloids your seat number.;    When
that vital call comes, a Cellular Oner will rush over with the message and a
space-age phone that will let you call the all-important person back.;   
"It's the greatest thing in the world," insists <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON>, "to be interrupted
at the game to hear that you just saved <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> or you just made <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY>.";   
Good news to be sure, but can't it wait? What are you going to do? Run up and
buy 8,000 bags of peanuts and 3,000 or so beers with your new-found wealth?;  
 Of course not. You could never carry all that.;    The simple solution: Don't
conduct business at the ballpark. Just don't. Anyone caught doing so should be
tossed immediately. Give those seats to someone who wants to watch batting
practice, debate the infield fly rule, chomp on peanuts or quaff a beer.;   
Go to the ballpark to get away from business. Sneak out of work. Get sick. Go
see a mysterious client in <LOCATION>The City</LOCATION>. At most, slide over to the pay phone
before the first pitch, beer firmly in hand. Tell your boss you've run into a
couple of "bottlenecks" that will keep you out the rest of the day.;    It's
an old one, but a good one. Now, excuse me, I've got a call to make.  </TEXT>

FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: Lucinda Childs - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> dance experiment was centred on <ORGANIZATION>Judson
Church</ORGANIZATION>. There the earnest and the eager set about forging a new dance -
post-modern, post-Cunningham - which sought a radical re-shaping of
everything that 'dance' had meant up to then.
It was, I suppose, symptomatic of its time, and marked by a Puritanism that
accorded well with current theatrical and musical austerities. One of
<PERSON>Judson</PERSON>'s formative figures was <PERSON>Yvonne Rainer</PERSON>, who declared 'No to spectacle;
No to virtuosity; No to transformations and magic and make-believe . . .' (I
saw a <ORGANIZATION>Rainer</ORGANIZATION> performance, which was crucifyingly boring, and offered no
substitute for anything at all - least of all dance). An ideal had been
stated for many who followed in her unlovely footsteps.
This year <PERSON>Lucinda Childs</PERSON>, one of the most acclaimed <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> graduates, is
making a first British visit with her company. Sophie Constanti reported
here on her <ORGANIZATION>Edinburgh Festival</ORGANIZATION> debut; on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, as the <ORGANIZATION>Dance
Umbrella</ORGANIZATION> season got under way, <PERSON>Miss Childs</PERSON> and her troupe came to the <ORGANIZATION>South
Bank</ORGANIZATION> - a glum and not inapt location. The <PERSON>Childs</PERSON> manner offers small cells
of activity which repeat and repeat, re-align and slowly mutate - it is no
accident that she uses minimalist scores as accompaniment - so that the
viewer is made aware of a cumulative structure.
This building-blocks approach to dance would be more fascinating - as the
Shades entry in <LOCATION>Bayadere</LOCATION> is fascinating in its repetitions and augmentation
 -were the blocks themselves of interest. But to pile up banalities, to
shift their direction, to pass them among a cast like so many tiny
austerities, is not so much architecture as parsimony.
The major piece in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s programme was Available Light, almost an hour
of routines set below and on a bridge-structure. First made as a museum
installation in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> <DATE>a decade ago</DATE>, it has a score by <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> which
is vastly more enterprising in the working out of its patterns than <PERSON>Childs</PERSON>'
movement sequences. Ten dancers (looking like sci-fi laboratory assistants
in overalls that reveal pallid inner legs and arms) tread and re-tread their
well-worn paths. Virtuosity is Rainer-ishly denied - the cast look
unstretched - and the development of these ideas is simple-minded. ('Those
two have just turned and run. That means that the other two in black, and
then the four in red, will do the same' - and they do). Miss <PERSON>Childs</PERSON>
manifests herself twice, Cunningham-fashion, but even in these unambitious
technical surroundings, her performance has a constrained air.
The second piece, Concerto, dates from last year and uses <PERSON>Gorecki</PERSON>'s
harpsichord concerto. It lasts nine minutes, and its dancers, in smart black
shirts and trousers, nip along pre-destined tracks with something like
vivacity. (The trams are moving faster). Here <PERSON>Childs</PERSON>' style matches the
motor energy of the score in recurring patterns of action, if not in
emotional density. The piece is short enough for the message to seem
intriguing without turning into an acreage of tape-loop repeats. Brevity is
not the soul of post-modernism - but it is a tremendous bonus here.
<PERSON>Lucinda Childs</PERSON> is at the <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth Hall</PERSON> until <DATE>October 20</DATE>.

   NEW YORK -- A small human services agency that pairs
disabled foster children with welfare families was the first
group to receive a new award for Nonprofit Innovation from
Peter F. Drucker, one of America's most prominent management
gurus.
   Judson Center, Royal Oak, Mich., won the $25,000 prize for
boosting the independence and self-sufficiency of
participants in its "Living in Family Environments" program.
Judson moves developmentally disabled foster children out of
hospitals and other institutions; families receive salaries
and training to care for the children, trading their public
support for earned income.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This group has a very clear focus and the results are
startling," <PERSON>Mr. Drucker</PERSON> said.
   Some 809 nonprofit groups applied for the award,
administered by a nonprofit foundation and research center
that <PERSON>Mr. Drucker</PERSON> started last year. He said he established
the annual award because many nonprofit organizations,
particularly small ones, "aren't recognized and encouraged"
enough for their social contributions and management
strategies.
   Four nonprofit organizations received honorable mentions
in the contest: <ORGANIZATION>Gleaners Community Food Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>;
<ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Association for Human Services</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>;
<ORGANIZATION>Intercultural Development Research Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>,

PREPS: INEVITABLE DELAYED, BUT SINGBANDITH WINS TRIPLE JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phouphet Singbandith of <ORGANIZATION>Magnolia High School</ORGANIZATION> arrived at <ORGANIZATION>Mt. San Antonio College</ORGANIZATION> 
at <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> expecting to begin triple-jumping as scheduled at noon. 
</P>
<P>
But the <ORGANIZATION>Turner Broadcasting System</ORGANIZATION>, the cable TV network that was televising 
the Mt. SAC Relays, had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The network asked for, and got, a late scheduling change, which pushed back the 
start of the boys' invitational triple jump to about <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
So while the fans watched <PERSON>Larry Myricks</PERSON> win the open long jump, held at noon, 
in a wind-aided 28-feet 5-inches, Singbandith found himself with time on his 
hands. And, to make matters worse, <PERSON>Singbandith</PERSON> had injured his left knee 
slightly in a dual meet <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and wore a brace for support. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly the best of circumstances for Singbandith, who was intent on 
breaking the <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> record of 50-3 1/2, set by <PERSON>Ken Williams</PERSON> of Troy in 
<DATE>1982</DATE>. He came into the meet with a best of 50-3, the second-best jump by a 
county athlete ever. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Singbandith is as unflappable as he is good at hopping, 
skipping and jumping. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get the record, but he won the event by jumping 49-10 1/2. <ORGANIZATION>Lenny 
McGill of Orange Glen</ORGANIZATION> was second with a mark of 49-2 1/2. <ORGANIZATION>Russell White of 
Crespi</ORGANIZATION>, the all-time state career rushing leader, was third with a 47-7 1/2 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith said neither the time delay nor the sore knee bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting was probably better for me," he said "I got a chance to rest my knee." 
</P>
<P>
And even if he did break <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>' record, the wind would have been over the 
allowable 2.0 meters per second. It was 2.47 meters per second on his winning 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith said he was just happy to win. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION> athlete to win an event in the two-day high 
school portion of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Others came close, but none closer than <PERSON>Eddie Lavelle</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
With 500 meters left in the boys' invitational 1,500 meters, <PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON> began 
moving toward the front of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders had gone through the 400 in a swift 61.1 seconds and the 800 in 
2:06.4 and <PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON>, who had been running not-so-comfortably in the pack, 
figured it was time to head into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
He was passed shortly thereafter by <PERSON>Louie Quintena</PERSON> of <PERSON>Arroyo Grande</PERSON>, but got 
back into the lead and looked strong going into the final 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Francis O'Neill</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Pasqual</LOCATION>, who had led for the first half of the race, 
rocketed past in the final 60 meters for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill's winning time of 3:53.78 is the best in the nation this season. 
<PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON>, who finished second, ran 3:54.27, the No. 2 time in the country this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to hold on as long as I could," <PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON> said. "<PERSON>O'Neill</PERSON> had a good kick 
today." 
</P>
<P>
It was a personal best for <PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON>, who rebounded from a seventh-place finish 
in the 3,000 <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run too well <TIME>last night</TIME>," he said. "I'm more happy with how I reacted 
to the competition today." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't include dodging other runners in the close pack early in the race, 
however. Lavelle had two spike wounds, one on each shin, to show for his time 
spent in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"War wounds," he called them. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Doug Nichols</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION> found the going equally as difficult in the boys' 
invitational 800. 
</P>
<P>
He ran most of the first lap, covered in 54.96 by <PERSON>Mike McLean</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, out in the third lane. 
</P>
<P>
He settled into position on the second lap and finished third behind <PERSON>McLean</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Arturo Espejel</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
McLean ran 1:52.34 and <PERSON>Espejel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> were each timed in 1:52.54. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nichols</PERSON>' time is the best in the state this season. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a guy who ran just his fourth 800 on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Nichols had been a 
400 runner until moving up in distance this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noon of <LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION> won the shotput with a throw of 66-feet-3 1/2 inches. 
Among those Noon -- the national leader this season with a throw of 68-1 3/4 --

<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Edison High School</ORGANIZATION> freshman <PERSON>Shelley Taylor</PERSON> learned a quick lesson about the 
quality of competition found at the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> track and field championships <DATE>Friday</DATE> 
<TIME>night</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>Cerritos College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Her teacher? <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Buena Vista</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Kira Jorgensen</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Running in a preliminary heat of the girls' 1,600 meters, <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON>, the 
two-time defending State champion at 1,600 meters and a two-time national 
champion in cross-country, cruised to an easy victory in 4 minutes 55.44 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes who won their heat, plus the next five fastest overall, qualified for 
tonight's finals, beginning at <ORGANIZATION>Cerritos College</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor</TIME>, who despite being in her first year of competitive running had not lost 
a 1,600-meter race since mid-April, could only watch as <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> loped away at 
the start for a commanding lead. Taylor started out in mid-pack and eventually 
made her way to second, where she finished in 4:58.77, a half-second personal 
improvement and good enough to qualify for tonight's final. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's improvement, her fourth in as many races, didn't seem to satisfy her, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel great in the race," she said. "I guess I put a lot of pressure 
on myself (to win). I think I expect too much out of myself sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> wasn't impressed with her finish, <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> certainly was. Said 
<PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON>: "She's not depressed is she? She should be proud of herself, 
especially making it this far as a freshman. I never made it to <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> finals as 
a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' 1,600, <ORGANIZATION>Mater Dei</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mike Nielsen</PERSON> advanced with a third-place finish 
in his heat in 4:15.05, the fifth-fastest time overall. <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON>, who last year 
did not advance past the Southern Section preliminaries, started out in 
mid-pack, then gradually worked his way into fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With 200 meters to go, <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON>, trying to maintain his crisp, efficient stride, 
charged to third and then tried to catch <LOCATION>Burbank</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Todd Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arroyo 
Grande</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Louie Quintana</PERSON> but could not. <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> won in 4:12.66, and <LOCATION>Quintana</LOCATION> was 
second in 4:13.00. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," <PERSON>Nielsen</PERSON> said. "I think I have a lot left. They went by me 
and beat me fair and square." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's <PERSON>Eddie Lavelle</PERSON> finished a surprising and disappointing eighth 
in his 1,600 heat and did not advance. <PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON>, who has a best time -- and 
county-leading time -- of 4:11.95, came through the first 300 meters fourth 
from last but worked his way into what appeared to be a comfortable third. 
</P>
<P>
But with 200 meters to go, <PERSON>Lavelle</PERSON> faded and, without a kick, dropped to 
eighth. After the race, he walked off the track with a noticeable limp, his 
left shin bleeding from spike marks. 
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing finish in the long jump, <ORGANIZATION>Canyon</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Allison Franke</PERSON> 
qualified in her specialty, the discus, with a toss of 151-feet-10, fourth best 
overall. <PERSON>Franke</PERSON>, who fouled twice in the long jump before leaping 17-7, made up 
for the disappointment with an discus series of 151-5, 151-10 and 150-8. 
<LOCATION>Bakersfield</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Melisa Weis</PERSON> leads the field at 163-9, her first and only throw of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' shotput, <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Bev Oden</PERSON> advanced with a mark of 40-9, 
eighth-best overall. Edison's <PERSON>Leslee Briggs</PERSON>, the county's season leader at 
41-11 1/2, fouled on two of her three attempts. Her only legal mark was 39-8, 
which tied her for tenth. Only 2 3/4 inches separated <PERSON>Briggs</PERSON> from advancing to 
tonight's final. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' high jump, <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Lori Svoboda</PERSON> advanced with a leap of 5-6. 
That mark tied her for first with defending state champion <ORGANIZATION>Crissy Mills of 
North Hollywood Campbell Hall</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Svoboda</PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON>Mills</PERSON> last <DATE>Friday</DATE> to win 
the <ORGANIZATION>Masters</ORGANIZATION> title, passed on the first three heights, cleared 5-4 on her first 
attempt, passed at 5-5 and cleared 5-6 again on her first try. Mills duplicated 
<PERSON>Svoboda</PERSON>'s series exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Other county athletes who advanced to tonight's finals were <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Doug 
Nichols</PERSON> (sixth-best 800 at 1:54.11); <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Laurinda Mulhaupt</PERSON> 
(fifth-best 800 at 2:15.38); <ORGANIZATION>Magnolia</ORGANIZATION>'s Phouphet Singbandith (fourth-best 
triple jump at 49-7 3/4); <ORGANIZATION>Westminster</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Shelly Tochluk</PERSON> (the final 400 qualifier 
at 56.34); <ORGANIZATION>Valencia</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Eric Whitcomb</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Sean Rogan</PERSON> (both 14-4 in the 
pole vault); <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Greg Thurston</PERSON> (56-3 3/4 shotput) and <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s boys' 
1,600-meter relay team (3:19.84).

DISSIDENTS' WIN AT MAZDA PLANT STUNS UAW, FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dissident workers opposed to Japanese-style management techniques swept to 
victory <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in the first local union elections at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> auto 
assembly plant in suburban <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The dissident victory stunned both <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> and the national leadership of the 
<ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION>, which represents the <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> workers, and raised new 
questions about how well Japanese management policies can be integrated into 
the American workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We're upset about it, and I'm sure <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> is upset also," said one <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> 
official. 
</P>
<P>
For the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>, in fact, the timing of the rebellion at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> couldn't be worse. 
The union, which now represents workers at three of the new Japanese-managed 
assembly plants in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, is on the verge of calling for an 
organizing election at <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> complex. Any sign of labor trouble at 
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> could be used by <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> management in a campaign to oppose the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>'s 
organizing drive. 
</P>
<P>
While <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leaders and <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> officials tried to downplay the significance of the 
vote, the election seemed to reveal a deep-seated sense of frustration among 
the workers over <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s labor policies, which are similar to those used by 
other Japanese companies now opening factories all over the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents, who ran on a platform opposing union cooperation with <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s 
policy of kaizen, or continuous improvement, took the top two posts in the 
first election of officers at the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>'s newly created Local 3000, which 
represents the 2,700 hourly workers at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s Flat Rock, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>, plant. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Philip Keeling</PERSON>, a line worker at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> and kaizen foe, was elected president of 
the local by a margin of nearly two to one over <PERSON>Bill Judson</PERSON>, the incumbent 
appointed to the post by the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>'s leadership when the local was first created. 
</P>
<P>
According to results released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Greg Drudi</PERSON>, who ran on <PERSON>Keeling</PERSON>'s 
dissident slate, also defeated incumbent <PERSON>Ben Hemmingway</PERSON> for the powerful post 
of shop chairman. In <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> locals, the shop chairman handles union affairs on the 
factory floor, while the president administers the local. 
</P>
<P>
Keeling and <PERSON>Drudi</PERSON> are allied to a larger dissident movement, called "New 
Directions," that has been contesting local and regional elections throughout 
the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>. The New Directions group has attacked the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leadership's willingness 
to cooperate on joint labor-management programs in the domestic auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Donny Douglas</PERSON>, president of a <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> local at <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> and the leader of the 
New Directions movement, spoke to a meeting of <PERSON>Keeling</PERSON>'s supporters just before 
the <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> election. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leaders were still trying to sort out the 
impact of the dissident victory. The American personnel director at the plant 
found that he had to give <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s Japanese executives a quick lesson in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
labor politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese executives here are concerned, from the standpoint that they 
didn't expect this," said <PERSON>C. Robert Leadbetter</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of 
personnel. "They don't know the culture in this area, they don't know about 
union politics," he added. "This is something new to them." 
</P>
<P>
Keeling could not be reached for comment <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, but <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> said he believes 
that the workers felt <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> had not lived up to rosy promises of Japanese-style 
employee involvement that were given workers when they were hired. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't feel they have had the input in decision-making that they were 
told they would have," said <PERSON>Judson</PERSON>. "Management thinks that employee 
involvement means that managers listen to what the workers say, and then go 
ahead and make the decisions themselves. The people were told in orientation 
that it meant they would be involved in the actual decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look for Improvement 
</P>
<P>
Such worker disillusionment seems to be at the heart of the dissidents' 
opposition to kaizen, which is the basis of <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s labor relations philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Kaizen, defined by management as the search for continuous improvement, 
essentially calls on all workers to constantly look for ways to improve 
productivity and quality, even if those improvements make their jobs obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the workers are given job security; they thus have an incentive to 
make their jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
However, workers at a number of Japanese plants in this country have complained 
that such policies often lead to heavier work loads and production line 
speed-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> blame the American supervisors on the shop floor for 
manipulating the Japanese labor policies to increase output. 
</P>
<P>
"Kaizen is set up to benefit both sides, but it is something you have to 
police," said <PERSON>Judson</PERSON>. "You do have supervisors who will use it strictly as a 
productivity tool." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dissident victory, <PERSON>Leadbetter</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> remains committed to 
kaizen -- and to working with the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had good relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>, and we expect to continue to have 
a good relationship," he said. "We just need to establish a relationship with 
<PERSON>Keeling</PERSON>."

DEFENSE FIRMS PROTEST L.A. OFFICE'S TARDY BILL PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An administrative crisis at the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s main business office in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
has prompted an unusual protest this week in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> by aerospace 
contractors, who say they are not being paid for their defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Many smaller companies say they are being driven to virtual insolvency by the 
crisis. Larger prime contractors have had to increase their borrowing by 
<MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> to offset the unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are occurring at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> regional headquarters of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Defense Contract Administration Service</ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION> agency that is 
responsible for paying contractors in nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
A delegation of industry officials, including representatives from <ORGANIZATION>Hughes 
Aircraft</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northrop</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RAND</ORGANIZATION>, met in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> this week with <ORGANIZATION>Defense 
Department</ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats to raise objections about the serious delays in 
payments. Senior <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> officials pledged <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to consider 
hiring a Big Eight accounting firm to resolve the snafus at the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
DCAS office, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A DCAS spokesman said the problems are <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> resolved and that many of the 
contractors are "all wet" in their allegations. But executives of major firms 
and sole proprietors of small businesses say that there has been little if any 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
RAND, a think tank in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> that depends heavily on <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> contracts, 
has had to double its line of credit to cover unpaid bills by the <ORGANIZATION>Defense 
Department</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs us <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> per month in additional interest, and that is not 
reimbursable by the government," said <PERSON>Robert Judson</PERSON>, RAND's director of 
contracts, who attended the meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "We are a nonprofit 
corporation." 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a payment situation as bad as we have ever been in," <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> said. 
"Things are getting worse. One of the big issues is the disconnect of reality 
between what is actually going on and what is being reported to headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is far worse for small companies that lack the financial resources 
to weather the crisis or to fly to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to protest. <ORGANIZATION>International Marine 
Engineering</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, for example, may have to close up shop because of 
past due invoices, according to the company's owner, <PERSON>Marvin Chappel</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Glo-Ed Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> computer supplier, has been waiting 
months for a <MONEY>$225,000</MONEY> check from DCAS, according to the company's <PERSON>Jerry Edgar</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a call from the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> saying they were in dire need of data 
cartridges for their spy planes and to please ship them without a contract," 
<PERSON>Edgar</PERSON> said. "We did that -- but now we can't get paid." 
</P>
<P>
The DCAS office in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> is run by <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Brig. Gen. <PERSON>John Serur</PERSON>, who 
has declined repeated requests by The Times for an interview during the past 
year. Serur has also refused to meet with contractors who are pleading to get 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
"He will not talk to a contractor," <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> said. "He is either in a meeting or 
on the telephone. We have hand-carried documents there, and Gen. <PERSON>Serur</PERSON> would 
not give us 15 minutes of his time. Our situation is desperate." 
</P>
<P>
RAND is not alone in saying that DCAS officials are often indifferent to their 
payment problems. <PERSON>Donna Winter</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>Technical Research Associates</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, has been trying to collect bills from DCAS. She said she has often 
been disconnected when she has telephoned the agency. DCAS has a special 
customer assistance line, but disconnects and long waits are not unusual, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To help resolve the problems, <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> officials pledged at a meeting 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to conduct a hearing in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to look into the nonpayment 
problem. They also agreed to consider hiring a Big Eight accounting firm to 
assist the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office in resolving the problems. 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting, industry officials were less than certain that enough 
would be done because, they said, they doubt that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> officials know 
enough about what is going on in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. <PERSON>William Cassell</PERSON>, comptroller of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Logistics Agency</ORGANIZATION>, DCAS' parent organization, characterized the 
meeting as friendly, according to an agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, <PERSON>Cassell</PERSON> also cited statistics that indicated an <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> 
reduction in late payments by DCAS in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.

One device that DCAS has apparently used to cut its backlog of unpaid invoices 
is to reject or lose paper work and demand that contractors resubmit their 
requests. That resets the clock to zero and makes it look as though DCAS has 
cleared up its backlog of unpaid bills, even though the invoices are still 
unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
For example, <ORGANIZATION>RAND</ORGANIZATION> has submitted the same documents as many as three or four 
times and has made more than 100 total resubmissions of documents in only the 
past 2 1/2 months, <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bordering on administrative gridlock," he said. "It is pretty grim." 
</P>
<P>
RAND has written 13 letters to Serur and has not received a response, <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> 
said. "That is outrageous in the protocol of government," the RAND official 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> hopes to resolve the entire DCAS problem within two months by 
creating a new payment center in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, that was announced last month. 
It will take over first from the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office but later also from other 
DCAS regional offices around the country. 
</P>
<P>
However, industry officials are worried that such a large, centralized 
bureaucracy will be even less responsive to local problems. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the transfer of payment responsibilities to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> on <DATE>May 1</DATE> is 
expected to create additional confusion. DCAS has reportedly hired only 150 
people for about 2,600 jobs at the <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> payment center. 
</P>
<P>
A treasurer of a major <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> aerospace firm also said he is worried about 
a DCAS plan to send all of its payment records to <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> by truck. "How many 
days will that take?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Forrest Flewellen</PERSON>, a public affairs officer for the new <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> payment 
center, said concerns about the facility, which will occupy a former aircraft 
plant, are unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not out in some hangar," he said. "We are using office complexes. They 
have magnificent entryways and hallways. We are taking pictures of the offices 
and will send them out" to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.

   A retired executive of the <PERSON>Pulliam</PERSON> family
newspaper company said <DATE>today</DATE> that he made phone calls to ease the
way of Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> into the
<ORGANIZATION>Indiana National Guard</ORGANIZATION> during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.
   Senior aides to <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> were ``continuing to explore'' the
controversy even as <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s nomination approached. Campaign
spokeswoman <PERSON>Alixe Glenn</PERSON> said, ``Not a single thought is being
given'' to dropping <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> from the ticket.
   In <DATE>1969</DATE>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> was 22, no longer deferred from the draft and
vulnerable to being conscripted and sent to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. National Guard
units were rarely activated for <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> duty, and many men joined
the guard as a way to avoid the draft and likely <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> duty.
   Quayle is a member of the <PERSON>Pulliam</PERSON> family which controls a number
of newspapers including the <LOCATION>Indianapolis News</LOCATION>. The question of how
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> joined the guard arose as every aspect of <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s life came
under intense scrutiny on the day he is to be nominated as <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
running mate at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION>.
   Retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Wendell C. Phillippi</PERSON> _ who was managing editor
of The News and worked for <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON>Eugene C. Pulliam</PERSON>
_ said he contacted guard acquaintances on behalf of <LOCATION>Quayle</LOCATION>.
   Phillippi, according to <ORGANIZATION>The News</ORGANIZATION>, said he called on his
``multitude'' of friends within the guard when <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> applied in
<DATE>1969</DATE>.
   ``I was asked about <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>'s abilities and capabilities, and
I recommended him very highly ... as I did with many other men,''
<PERSON>Phillippi</PERSON> told the News in a telephone interview from his home in
<LOCATION>Brown County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Marilyn Quayle</PERSON> said her husband ``wasn't a draft dodger.''
   Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard
duty so he could attend law school. A <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> aide said the matter was
discussed with <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> during the process that led to his selection
for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ticket, and <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> had denied that he used influence
to gain admittance to the Guard.
   Rep. <PERSON>Bob Dornan</PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
said, ``it requires a Checkers-like speech (of contrition), and he
must do it _ must do it _ quickly, before this gets out of hand.''
   Well after <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE>, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> inner circle met to discuss
<PERSON>Sen. Quayle</PERSON>'s performance on the first day of his vice presidential
candidacy _ a day dominated by questions about the Indianan's
qualifications to be a heartbeat from the presidency, and about his
military record.
   Quayle's press aide, <PERSON>Jeff Nesbit</PERSON> sought this morning to describe
the sequence of events in <DATE>1969</DATE>.
   On the issue of whether telephone calls were made to try and get
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> in the Guard, <PERSON>Nesbit</PERSON> said the ``collective recollection'' of
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> and his father ``was that phone calls may have been made on
his behalf.'' He did not elaborate.
   <PERSON>Nesbit</PERSON> said the reason that <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> stumbled at questions about
his military record was that ``his recollection of what happened
back then is a little fuzzy.''
   <PERSON>Robert Teeter</PERSON>, who oversaw the vice presidential selection
process which resulted in <LOCATION>Quayle</LOCATION>'s selection on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, had said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that his military service had been raised during the
interview process.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION>. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' said <PERSON>Teeter</PERSON>. ``He, at
some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone else.''' said
<PERSON>Teeter</PERSON>.
   If there were calls made on <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s behalf, it may not have
been necessary. <PERSON>John Owens</PERSON>, adjutant general of the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana
National Guard</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>January 1969</DATE> until <DATE>August 1972</DATE>, said the
<LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> ``had vacancies galore'' in its guard units during his
years.
   However, <PERSON>John S. Anderson</PERSON>, adjutant general immediately before
<PERSON>Owens</PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION>Indianapolis News</ORGANIZATION> there was a waiting list for
Guard service.
   Quayle told <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> that in <DATE>1969</DATE> he had ``let a number of people
know I wanted to get into the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION>,'' and added, ``If
phone calls were made, I can't answer, I don't know the specifics
of that.....''
   ``No one should be ashamed of guard service,'' <PERSON>Phillippi</PERSON> said.
``And he (<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>) should not be called a draft dodger because he is
subject to call at any time of the day or night during his entire
enlistment.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON>James Baker III</PERSON>, appeared on ABC-TV
<DATE>today</DATE> and said <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> had ``basically said, `Look, I really wanted
to serve in the guard. I was anxious to do that. ... I wanted to go
to law school, I was anxious to do that, and if some people helped
me, they helped me.''
   Added <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>: ``I think, frankly, he's talking about help from
his family, which really wasn't particularly unusual, given the
circumstances of the time, given the attitude, if you will, of many
baby boomers at the time.''
   Baker promised there would be ``full disclosure'' of the issue.
``We are continuing to explore it with him,'' he said. <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> led
the meeting of key <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> strategists who critiqued <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> performance and discussed _ among other things _ how to
defuse the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> controversy.
   <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s eldest son, told reporters today that
``the thing that's important is he didn't go to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. ...
Remember, in <DATE>1968</DATE>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> was an option. He didn't go. Let's keep
it in generational perspective.''
   The <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> senator was not a nationally known figure at the
time <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> tapped him.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> called the questioning of his decision to
join the guard ``a cheap shot. I have a deep affection for those
men and women who sacrificed their lives in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.'' More than
58,000 Americans were killed in the war.
   And he told CNN: ``I was willing and ready to serve my country.
I chose to serve my country in the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> like millions of
other people.''
   Former Gov. <PERSON>Edgar Whitcomb</PERSON>, a Republican, denied a report that
he had intervened for <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>.
   ``No, I never heard of it,'' he said of <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>'s interest in
joining the guard. He said <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> _ who later was a junior aide in
his office _ was not known to him at the time he was seeking a
Guard appointment.
   ``I would say for sure no one contacted me about it and I had no
letter from someone trying to get him into the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION>,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Whitcomb</PERSON> said the guard was ``certainly no refuge for draft
dodgers; we had units called and they served active duty in
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.'' Quayle's was not among them.

@  Great Expectations: Time's Plan
@  To Personalize Ads in Magazines

<DATELINE> Time Warner's latest advertising twist  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   personalized advertising in its weekly magazines -- is expected to pull in an extra <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in ad revenue in its first year alone, says <PERSON>Donald M. Elliman Jr.</PERSON>, the magazine group's executive vice president of marketing. 

   The figure is surprisingly large for a start-up program, and shows just how important the new plan will be in generating ad revenue for the magazine group in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine group</ORGANIZATION> officials are already planning to expand the program, which premieres in <DATE>January</DATE>, to include more magazines and types of ads. 
The plan, known as Target Select, initially includes <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>, People and Sports Illustrated, as well as Money and Entertainment Weekly on a more limited basis. 

   Target Select uses a computerized process known as selective binding to place different ads in different subscribers' magazine copies. 
The process can also personalize ads, greeting subscribers by name or listing a local store address. 
In effect, it allows <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s national magazines to compete head-to-head with local newspapers and with direct mail. 
"Subscribers can receive Time publications whose ads have information geared specifically towards them," says <PERSON>Bruce Judson</PERSON>, the magazine group's director of marketing, who spearheaded the program under <PERSON>Mr. Elliman</PERSON>. 
"The possibilities are tremendous." 

   Target Select won't be announced officially until <DATE>Friday</DATE>, but it's already jolting other publishers into action, and could well transform the magazine ad business. 
While selective binding has been around for about 15 years, it had been used only by a handful of smaller magazines like Farm Journal. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>'s titles account for about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> magazine ad revenue, and any splash <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> makes tends to turn into a tidal wave. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Diamandis Communications</ORGANIZATION> are among the magazine publishers now exploring selective binding. 
<ORGANIZATION>Ziff-Davis</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>PC Magazine</ORGANIZATION> is testing the process. 
And industry executives say <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> is scrambling to be able to offer its own program early next year to compete with <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION>. 
No other magazine companies, though, have the reach of Time; its three weeklies alone have combined circulation of almost 10.5 million and had ad revenue of <MONEY>$942 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 

   Still, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> is making an expensive gamble. 
It has invested millions in a new technology that could well turn out to be a very expensive gimmick. 
Time declines to quantify its investment, but says the program will be profitable in its first year. 
Other magazine publishers are watching carefully: "Selective binding has been around for 15 years, and no one has really been able to make it work right," says <PERSON>Claeys Bahrenburg</PERSON>, group publishing director at <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> magazines, publisher of Cosmopolitan and Redbook. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bahrenburg</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>Hearst</ORGANIZATION> has created a task force to look into selective binding, and says it is considering using the technology not just for advertisers, but to tailor articles to subscribers. 
Sports Afield, for example, could give fishing buffs a heavier dose of angling articles. 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Bahrenburg</PERSON> adds that magazines using selective binding to personalize ads may risk undermining their national ad base and hurting their overall cachet. 
"This raises some major issues on how we sell our product: You're selling demographic slices" rather than a national magazine, he says. 
<PERSON>Mr. Judson</PERSON>, however, counters that Target Select "enhances the franchise of Time magazines." 

   In any case, Target Select is expensive enough that it doesn't seem likely to spark an immediate stampede away from national ads. 
The plan, in part, will allow marketers to advertise specifically to three groups of subscribers: catalog shoppers, people who have recently moved and affluent readers over 50 years old. 
A furniture company, for example, could advertise only in magazine copies going to subscribers who just moved. 

   But that kind of pinpointing, derived largely from reader surveys, doesn't come cheap. 
Time magazine currently charges about <MONEY>$28</MONEY> to reach each 1,000 subscribers. 
But advertisers who want to target high income older people -- and <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> promises to reach 700,000 of them via the three weeklies and Money -- will pay more than double that rate, or about <MONEY>$68</MONEY> for each 1,000, according to the <DATE>1990</DATE> rate card. 
Reaching recent movers will cost <MONEY>$51</MONEY> for each 1,000. 

   Target Select also will use a process called ink-jet printing to allow national advertisers to personalize their ads. 
An auto maker's ad could list the nearest dealership, or even offer a discount to selected subscribers. 
Depending on complexity, industry executives say ink-jet printing can add <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> to the cost of an ad, and could even double the price. 
Even more costly, <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> is offering customized programs for advertisers. 
<ORGANIZATION>American Express</ORGANIZATION>, for example, could place personalized ads only in magazine copies going to gold-card-carrying subscribers. 

   "The day is here when magazine advertisers can be as personalized as direct mail," <PERSON>Mr. Judson</PERSON> says. 
Indeed, the ink-jet capability is sure to make a lot of direct marketers angry, and it's certain to scare newspapers, which are already facing a bleak retail ad market. 
It swipes especially hard at cooperative ads, in which a retail outlet and a brand share a single ad; the ink-jetting program can tailor a national ad right down to the zip-code level, listing the nearest retail outlet where a nationally advertised brand is sold. 
"It's better targeting than anything available in local newspapers," <PERSON>Mr. Judson</PERSON> says.

HIGHLAND PARK ESTATE DECLARED HISTORIC-CULTURAL MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Los Angeles City Council</LOCATION> has voted to declare the 94-year old <PERSON>Albert H. 
Judson</PERSON> estate in <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION> a historic-cultural monument, curtailing 
demolition efforts by its owner, a wealthy real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
The historic monument designation prevents owner <PERSON>Donna Harnsberger</PERSON> from 
demolishing or altering the 15-room mansion for a year. After that, <PERSON>Harnsberger</PERSON> 
can apply for a demolition permit, but the permit would have to be issued by 
the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was seen as a victory by preservationists. They lobbied hard for 
monument status after Harnsberger surprised them by announcing at a Christmas 
party last year that she intended to tear down the house to build three 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger's decision was seen as ironic by the preservationists. They watched 
in helpless dismay as the longtime <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION> resident, who has been active 
in battles to save several historic homes in the area, removed molding from 
around doors and windows and uprooted two old palm trees on the estate's 
extensive, overgrown grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The estate, at <ORGANIZATION>4911 Pasadena Avenue Terrace</ORGANIZATION>, was once the home of <PERSON>Judson</PERSON>, an 
attorney who in the <DATE>1880s</DATE> subdivided and named <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION>. The home was 
designed in <DATE>1895</DATE> by <PERSON>George Wyman</PERSON>, the architect who designed the historic 
<PERSON>Bradbury</PERSON> building in downtown <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger has vowed to do everything in her power to tear down the house. She 
says that she doesn't believe that the house is historic and that she did weeks 
of research and compiled hundreds of documents to prove it. But when she 
brought her work to a <ORGANIZATION>Cultural Affairs Commission</ORGANIZATION> meeting earlier this month, 
commissioners said her research only bolstered the preservationists' case. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger has not returned repeated phone calls since the council vote. It is 
unclear whether she will seek a permit to demolish the house or eventually seek 
to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like her to restore the house," said <PERSON>Charles Fisher</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Highland 
Park Heritage Trust</ORGANIZATION>. "She lived there for years, and she has said she loved it. 
If she doesn't want to restore it, we want her to sell it to someone who will."

FT  06 JAN 92 / Even the bad times are good for somebody: Tim Lawrence
reports on how industrial auction houses have benefited from the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, the prime minister, was saying last week that the
economy was showing the first signs of recovery, industrial auctioneers were
praying quietly that the bad times were here to stay.
<PERSON>Mr Brian Grainger</PERSON>, a professional services consultant at the <ORGANIZATION>Incorporated
Society of Valuers</ORGANIZATION> and Auctioneers, says: 'The recession has given auction
houses a new lease of life.'
According to <ORGANIZATION>Cork Gully</ORGANIZATION>, the insolvency arm of <ORGANIZATION>Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte</ORGANIZATION>,
the accountancy firm, the number of companies which went into receivership
last year is expected to exceed 6,000  - more than four times the <DATE>1989</DATE>
total. That means boom-time for auction houses called in to sell off assets.
Auctioneers are moving into bigger premises, profits are up and staff are
being recruited.
<PERSON>Henry Butcher</PERSON>, the plant and machinery specialist, is a typical beneficiary.
In <DATE>1989</DATE> the company held 57 sale days. There were 92 in <DATE>1990</DATE> and more than
190 sale days last year.
According to <PERSON>Mr John Judson</PERSON>, principal auctioneer at <PERSON>Henry Butcher</PERSON>, the mid
<DATE>1980s</DATE> were a buoyant time, with healthy prices and about 60 sale days a
year. But there is nothing like a downturn to boost income for auctioneers.
'The past year has been even better than <DATE>1982</DATE>, with more sales at a higher
value. Items are not fetching as good a price as in the late 80s, but the
increased number of sales has added significantly to our income,' <PERSON>Mr Judson</PERSON>
says.
Profits are also up at the auction department at <LOCATION>Weatherall</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Green &amp; Smith</ORGANIZATION>,
the plant and machinery auctioneer. <ORGANIZATION>Stickley &amp; Kent</ORGANIZATION>, which handles property
repossessions, has tripled its auction staff, and the department is moving
to larger offices in central <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. The auction department at <PERSON>Edward
Rushton</PERSON>, the international valuers and surveyors, says it has never been
busier.
Different sales attract different people, but they share one trait: the
desire to buy cheap. Specialist plant and machinery auctions appeal almost
exclusively to dealers and industrialists. Other sales, such as a recent
<PERSON>Henry Butcher</PERSON> auction for <ORGANIZATION>Prudential</ORGANIZATION> at which 1,600 <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> computers were sold
for about Pounds 400 each, are more likely to attract the general public.
The auctions are often heady affairs. More than 1,000 people attend the big
sales and takings can easily exceed Pounds 1m  - from which the auction
houses usually take a 10 per cent cut.
Auctioneers can also profit from the inexperience of bidders and the
excitement of the occasion, which can lead bidders to pay more for a lot
than its market price. At a recent <PERSON>Henry Butcher</PERSON> auction for a large
property developer, the managing director's <PERSON>Bentley</PERSON> sold for Pounds 33,000,
Pounds 6,000 more than its trade value.
<PERSON>Mr Judson</PERSON> stops the bidding when it gets ridiculous. 'People often get
carried away, especially when a couple of them have got it in for one
another, but if they overbid it makes it difficult to collect any payment,'
he says.
While industrial salerooms thrive during recessions, they are keen to shed
their image of being industrial vultures.
Auctioneers claim they are contributing to the preservation of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s
manufacturing base by helping businesses which are strapped for cash to buy
quality products at a bargain price.
The auctions, they say, are an effective way for receivers to realise
capital when assets have to be sold.
Environmental arguments are also put forward by the auctioneers, who argue
that the sales provide an effective method of recycling equipment, machinery
and premises.
But the recession has not brought unmitigated prosperity for the sales
houses, with the severity of the downturn posing a few problems. In some
areas, for example, the market has been flooded  - there are several
night-clubs for sale in <LOCATION>Oxfordshire</LOCATION> at the moment  - which makes it
difficult to raise a realistic price.
<PERSON>Mr John Liddiment</PERSON>, head of the auction department at <ORGANIZATION>Weatherall, Green &amp;
Smith</ORGANIZATION>, says that customers are less bid-happy than they were in the late
<DATE>1980s</DATE>. In <DATE>1988</DATE> lots were being bid for at an average of 120 per hour at
auctions. Last year it was down to 90.
<PERSON>Mr Edwin Kirker</PERSON>, head of insolvency at accountants <PERSON>Pannell Kerr Forster</PERSON>,
says: 'People are not flocking to auctions with money and it is difficult to
make money because there is so much stuff on the market. A buyer can usually
turn to at least two or three receivers to get what he wants.'
Some auction houses are struggling. Property auctioneers are selling more
houses than ever before, but prices have plummeted. At <ORGANIZATION>Barnard Marcus</ORGANIZATION>, the
estate agent and property auctioneer, houses are selling for Pounds 30,000
to Pounds 100,000 rather than up to Pounds 500,000. Overheads have gone up
as well as turnover, and overall takings are down by 50 per cent.
The art auctions are also struggling. The three big money-spinners  -
Impressionist, Modern and American contemporary works  - have all fallen
flat. Sotheby's and <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION>'s have experienced a sharp fall in turnover and
profits.
<PERSON>Henry Butcher</PERSON> might not like it, but in some quarters at least, a recovery
would be good news.

   ``We're paid for our anonymity,'' said <PERSON>Landon Parvis</PERSON>, one of the
busiest ghostwriters around. ``It's almost like a doctor-patient
relationship.''
   Never was that confidentiality more strictly obeyed than in the
presidential demise of <PERSON>Sen. Joseph Biden</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>. His writers
said nothing. Asking them was like asking a team of surgeons which
one killed the patient.
   ``I made some mistakes,'' <PERSON>Biden</PERSON> said without further explanation
of the mysterious osmosis by which the same words, images and
family memories traveled incognito from <PERSON>Neil Kinnock</PERSON>, who wanted to
be prime minister of <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, to <PERSON>Joe Biden</PERSON>, who wanted to be
president of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Safire, now a <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> columnist and reigning scholar on
speechmanship, thinks <PERSON>Biden</PERSON> may have suffered self-hynosis in the
wearying blur of the campaign and began to believe that <PERSON>Kinnock</PERSON>'s
thoughts were his thoughts.
   Safire points out that he and other presidential writers over
the years have borrowed speech patterns and rhythms from each other
without attribution. He does concede that <PERSON>Biden</PERSON>'s loan was a case
of ``heavy lifting.''
   <PERSON>Sen. William Proxmire</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> asked what difference does it
make, anyway? Most candidates and many politicians use speech
writers. Is it more moral to buy a speech and claim it as your own
than to steal it?
   In the flurry of charge and counter-charge, only <PERSON>Al Haig</PERSON>
appeared safely immune among the candidates. Who would think to
accuse him of literary theft, this square-jawed warrior who fires
his crossbow at the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> for ``Cheshire-catting,'' who
rises fearlessly against ``bureaucratic amoking'' and is ready to
``caveat that'' or ``context this''?
   Abe Lincoln, the president who delivered the greatest speeches,
wrote his own. Of the two best orators of their time, <PERSON>Franklin
Roosevelt</PERSON> used a phalanx of ghosts and envied <ORGANIZATION>Winston Churchill</ORGANIZATION> for
being able to write his own.
   George <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s three helpers went on to become presidents
themselves. No presidential writer since has done quite as well,
although <PERSON>Judson Welliver</PERSON> now enjoys something of a revival more
than 60 years after his time. There is now a <ORGANIZATION>Judson Welliver
Society of former White House</ORGANIZATION> writers.
   Who, you may well ask, was <PERSON>Judson Welliver</PERSON>? He's the fellow who
went to work for <ORGANIZATION>Warren Harding</ORGANIZATION> as a ``literary clerk'' and became
the first full-time presidential ghost in history. He also wrote
for <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON>. To no avail. <PERSON>Alice Longworth</PERSON> still thought of
<PERSON>Coolidge</PERSON> as someone ``weaned on a pickle.''
   Speech writers are torn by a conflict of code and ego. They
readily tell you that as a result of getting to know their man, his
ideas, tastes and speech patterns, the text they finally give him
is basically ``his.''
   This is their answer to <PERSON>Lippman</PERSON>. The words may be theirs; the
thinking is the client's. Also, says <PERSON>Robert Shrum</PERSON>, who writes for
Rep. <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, the American people would scarcely approve
of their busy president consuming three days to write a speech.
   But the hired hands also yearn for a statute of limitations on
the law of silence so that students of history will know who wrote
what. A writer and his words are not soon parted. At <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s first
inaugural, <PERSON>Safire</PERSON> found himself wandering around the edge of the
crowd silently mouthing his lines as the president spoke them.
Embarrassed, he moved on and there was <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON> mouthing his lines.
   All agree it would be difficult to write for someone they
disliked. In this respect, the busiest is the most ecumenical;
<PERSON>Landon Parvin</PERSON> writes for <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON>, corporate
heads, other Republicans AND some Democrats who suit his ideology
but wouldn't care to have that public.
   Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Parvin</ORGANIZATION>'s work for <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> ran the gamut from the
solemnity of major speeches on Iran-Contra and AIDS to scores of
one-liners on the order of: ``It's true hard work never killed
anybody, but I figure why take the chance.''
   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is a city that consumes humor almost as fast as
taxes. Candidates, officeholders, lobbyists and rising bureaucrats
hunger for it. The Kennedys have been known to call a comic off the
floor of a <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> nightclub for a quick fix for the Gridiron and
other local festivals.
   <PERSON>Mark Shields</PERSON>, columnist and occasional supplier, notes changes
in the humor market:
   ``We're not nearly as ethnic. There are no Pedro, <PERSON>Pat</PERSON> or Manny
stories being told. The one group you can make fun of is the WASPS.
You can do `Quiche is their idea of soul food' or `They tailgated
during the war of <DATE>1812</DATE>.' There is no Episcopalian Anti-Defamation
League.''
   There is a legend among speech writers which they doubt is true
but they tell it with a relish that suggests their own <PERSON>Walter Mitty</PERSON>
dreams.
   It concerns an intense president who could be sweetly benign or
thunderously abusive. After two years of that, one writer snapped.
And so:
   The president was rushing out to the Rose Garden for a routine
appearance. He scooped up the speech cards handed him by the writer
and without reading them first the Leader of the Western World
sallied forth:
   ``There are those who say we can't fulfill the Great Society
program and fight the war in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> at the same time. They're
wrong and I'm going to tell you why. There are those who say we
can't feed the hungry at home and also lift living standards around
the world. They are wrong and I'm going to tell you why.''
   Two more such refrains and <PERSON>Lyndon Baines Johnson</PERSON> was now ready
to tell them why. Then, he turned to the last card and found only
this: ``Now you're on your own.''

TALMI TAKES COMMAND AT CONCERT OF NOTE

<P>
Sporting his new title and a broad smile notably absent from his sober 
publicity photos, music director designate <PERSON>Yoav Talmi</PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION>San Diego 
Symphony</LOCATION> over the weekend. On <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the Israeli conductor exuded an 
extra measure of confidence, although in five previous visits he surely has 
never appeared obsequious. The orchestra's recently announced choice of <LOCATION>Talmi</LOCATION>, 
after a two-year search for a music director, has clearly bolstered his morale 
and his command of the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The program was a <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> and Mahler combination plate, evidently one of <PERSON>Talmi</PERSON>'s 
favorite recipes, since he will open the orchestra's 1989-90 season with the 
same pair of composers. His affinity for and appreciation of <ORGANIZATION>Mahler's First 
Symphony</ORGANIZATION> ("Titan") was evident at every turn. He allowed the episodic work to 
unfold generously, never forcing the pace but carefully shaping each movement. 
Only in the middle of the finale did he momentarily lose the tension and focus 
that underlies <ORGANIZATION>Mahler</ORGANIZATION>'s exotic tonal tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
In the second movement, he demanded a Landler defined by unrelenting 
sharp-edged rhythms, and the orchestra responded with rhythmic precision and 
the appropriate piquant colors that made the entire section sparkle. In both of 
the middle movements, <PERSON>Talmi</PERSON> kept the melodies shimmering above finely tuned 
accompaniments. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi wisely saved the major decibels for the thunderous climax of the last 
movement, which displayed the orchestra's more resonant forte of the season. 
Although the horns, expanded to eight for this symphony given to stentorian 
outbursts, acquitted their tasks honorably, the trumpets under the brilliant 
leadership of principal <ORGANIZATION>Calvin Price</ORGANIZATION> proved to be the thoroughbreds of the 
Mahler brass. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi's <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON> was less successful than his <PERSON>Mahler</PERSON>, but it was not all his 
fault. Mozart's C Major Oboe Concerto, K. 271k is routine in the extreme, 
especially compared to the composer's deservedly better-known Clarinet 
Concerto, K. 622. And, although <PERSON>Allan Vogel</PERSON> is one of the most elegant oboe 
virtuosos in captivity, he played below his own high standards <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
Dropping a few notes along the way is no crime, but he seemed hemmed in by the 
opening movement's busy coloratura nonsense, and his usual rich timbre sounded 
on the anemic side. Fortunately his characteristic sonority returned in the 
freedom of the cadenzas and in the concluding rondo. Talmi had reduced the 
orchestra to a mere 35 players for this modest concerto, but even that was a 
bit heavy for the delicate sound of the oboe. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Mozart</PERSON>'s Overture to "The Abduction From the Seraglio" is one of the 
composer's more foolproof overtures, <PERSON>Talmi</PERSON> and the orchestra gave this program 
opener compelling energy and a sprightly sheen. The overture followed the 
symphony's announcement of a gift of <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> from <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rachel Grosvenor</PERSON> 
to underwrite <PERSON>Talmi</PERSON>'s next four years with the <LOCATION>San Diego Symphony</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Judson 
Grosvenor</PERSON> is a member of the symphony's board of directors and serves on its 
executive committee. Now that <PERSON>Talmi</PERSON> and the orchestra are starting their 
honeymoon, it is no doubt reassuring for the orchestra to boast a modest dowry 
in addition to its sizable debt.

<TEXT>
   Fourteen mothers who were once on
welfare have found jobs doing what they know best _ being moms.
   The women have been taken off government assistance and receive
<MONEY>$21,000</MONEY> annual salaries for being foster mothers to disabled
children under a state program called LIFE, or Living in Family
Environments.
   ``These women are capable of doing something, but for the most
part they're best at being moms, and they're happy being moms,''
said state Rep. <PERSON>Shirley Johnson</PERSON>, who helped win funding for the
program.
   ``I was scared to death at the beginning _ how would you match
the right mom with the right child? But it has worked beautifully.''
   The 3-year-old program, which operates primarily on a <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>
grant from the state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Mental Health</ORGANIZATION>, was the idea of
<PERSON>Mounir Sharobeem</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Judson Center</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Royal Oak</ORGANIZATION>, a
<LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> suburb. The center helps abused and neglected children and
disabled adults.
   ``Instead of stereotyping welfare recipients as lazy, let's
train the families, let them select a developmentally disabled
child and use their time and energy more effectively,'' <PERSON>Sharobeem</PERSON>
said.
   ``People said we would be endangering handicapped children by
putting them with welfare families. But these families have been
doing a great job with them, and it's not easy.''
   Sharobeem said one disabled child in an institution costs the
<ORGANIZATION>Mental Health Department</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> a year. A welfare family of four
costs the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Social Services</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$16,000</MONEY> a year.
   The children are also given more personal care inside a home,
even though most of the mothers are single parents, <PERSON>Sharobeem</PERSON> said.
   The mothers are screened and licensed by the <ORGANIZATION>Judson Center</ORGANIZATION> and
receive training in caring for disabled children, said <PERSON>Diane
Devine-Abdullah</PERSON>, LIFE director.
   ``They go through a seven-day, 28-hour training, then 20 hours
home training in a current foster home,'' Devine-Abdullah said.
``We have four more families ready and waiting for placement.''
   The mothers are then matched with children from <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>
institutions. The average age of most of the children is between 15
and 16, Devine-Abdullah said.
   DSS Director <PERSON>C. Patrick Babcock</PERSON> said the state is looking to
expand the program. But <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said budget constraints won't allow
a full-scale program.
   One mother, <PERSON>Darlene Gisel</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Warren</LOCATION>, cares for 11-month-old
<PERSON>William</PERSON>, who was born with tuberculosis of the brain. The condition
was stabilized but could result in a learning disability or
retardation.
   ``He was in the hospital six months before I took him,'' <PERSON>Gisel</PERSON>
said. ``He didn't respond at all. He's gotten farther than they
ever thought he would.
   ``There's a lot of joy in watching them grow. These are kids who
probably wouldn't have had a chance in life.''
   <PERSON>Gisel</PERSON> said her mother also was a foster mom and worked with
handicapped children.
   ``I knew I wanted to deal with handicapped kids,'' she said.
``They need a little more of a chance. I think we can show that
they can learn and they can live a normal life with a disability.''
   Mothers in the LIFE program also find that the salary allows
them to provide more for their own children.
   <PERSON>Bertha Crawford</PERSON> is foster mother to <PERSON>Dorothy</PERSON>, 17, who can't dress
herself and can't talk. Crawford also has two high-school-age
children of her own.
   ``I feel good about helping someone else,'' <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> said. ``It
also gave me the chance to send my daughter on her senior trip. I
couldn't have afforded it without the program.''

Fourteen women who were once on welfare have found jobs doing what they know 
best -- being moms. 
</P>
<P>
They have been taken off government assistance and are earning <MONEY>$21,000</MONEY> a year 
as foster mothers to disabled youngsters under a state program called LIFE 
(Living in Family Environments). 
</P>
<P>
"These women are capable of doing something, but for the most part, they're 
best at being moms and they're happy being moms," said state Rep. <PERSON>Shirley 
Johnson</PERSON>, who helped to get funds allocated for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death at the beginning. How would you match the right mom with 
the right child? But it has worked beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old program, which operates primarily on a <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> grant from the 
state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Mental Health</ORGANIZATION>, was the idea of <PERSON>Mounir Sharobeem</PERSON>, president 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Judson Center</ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> suburb. The center helps abused and 
neglected children and disabled adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of stereotyping welfare recipients as lazy, let's train the families, 
let them select a developmentally disabled child and use their time and energy 
more effectively," <PERSON>Sharobeem</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"People said we would be endangering handicapped children by putting them with 
welfare families, but these families have been doing a great job with them, and 
it's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Sharobeem said that keeping one child in an institution costs the state mental 
health agency <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> a year, and keeping a family of four on welfare costs the 
state <MONEY>$16,000</MONEY> a year. 
</P>
<P>
The children also get more personal attention in a private home than in an 
institution, even though there is no father in most of the foster homes, 
<PERSON>Sharobeem</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The foster mothers are screened and licensed by the <ORGANIZATION>Judson Center</ORGANIZATION> and receive 
training in the care of disabled children, said <PERSON>Diane Devine-Abdullah</PERSON>, program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"They go through a seven-day, 28-hour training, then 20 hours of home training 
in a current foster home," she said. "We have four more families ready and 
waiting for placement." 
</P>
<P>
The trained women are matched with children living in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> institutions. 
The average age of the youngsters is between 15 and 16, Devine-Abdullah said. 
</P>
<P>
C. <PERSON>Patrick Babcock</PERSON>, state social services director, said that officials want to 
expand the program, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said that budget constraints won't allow a 
full-scale program. 
</P>
<P>

   America needs a new social priority: to triple the
productivity of the nonprofits and to double the share of
gross personal income -- now just below 3% -- they collect as
donations. Otherwise the country faces, only a few years out,
social polarization.
   Federal, state and local governments will have to retrench
sharply, no matter who is in office. Moreover, government has
proved incompetent at solving social problems. Virtually
every success we have scored has been achieved by nonprofits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The great advances in health and longevity have been
sponsored, directed and in large part financed by such
nonprofits as the <ORGANIZATION>American Heart Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>American
Mental Health Association</ORGANIZATION>. Whatever results there are in the
rehabilitation of addicts we owe to such nonprofits as
Alcoholics Anonymous, the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> and the Samaritans.
The schools in which inner-city minority children learn the
most are parochial schools and those sponsored by some <ORGANIZATION>Urban
League</ORGANIZATION> chapters. The first group to provide food and shelter
to the Kurds fleeing from <LOCATION>Saddam</LOCATION> <DATE>last spring</DATE> was an American
nonprofit, the <ORGANIZATION>International Rescue Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   Many of the most heartening successes are being scored by
small, local organizations. One example: The tiny <ORGANIZATION>Judson
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Royal Oak</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION> -- an industrial suburb of <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>
-- gets black women and their families off welfare while
simultaneously getting severely handicapped children out of
institutions and back into society.
   Judson trains carefully picked welfare mothers to raise in
their homes, for a modest salary, two or three crippled or
emotionally disturbed kids. The rehabilitation rate for the
welfare mothers is close to <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT>, with many of them in five
years or so moving into employment as rehabilitation workers.
The rehabilitation rate for the children, who otherwise would
be condemned to lifetime institutional confinement, is about
<PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>; and every one of these kids had been given up as
hopeless.
   The nonprofits spend far less for results than governments
spend for failures. The cost per pupil in the <LOCATION>New York
Archdiocese</LOCATION>'s parochial schools -- <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of whose students stay
in school, stay off the streets and graduate with high
literacy and salable skills -- is about half that in <LOCATION>New York
City</LOCATION>'s failing public schools.
   Two-thirds of the first-offenders paroled in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> into
the custody of the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION> are "permanently"
rehabilitated -- they are not indicted for another crime for
at least six years. Were they to go to prison, two-thirds
would become habitual criminals. Yet a prisoner costs at
least twice as much per year as a parollee in the custody of
the <ORGANIZATION>Salvation Army</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Judson Center</ORGANIZATION> saves the state of Michigan <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> a
year for each welfare mother and her charges -- one-third in
welfare costs and two-thirds in the costs of keeping the
children in institutions.
   Though the majority of the students in private colleges
and universities get some sort of financial aid, their
parents still pay more than do the parents of students in
state universities and colleges. But the state-university
student's education actually costs a good deal more than (in
some states twice as much as) that of the student in a
private nonprofit institution -- with the difference paid by
the taxpayer.
   The nonprofits have the potential to become <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
social sector -- equal in importance to the public sector of
government and the private sector of business. The delivery
system is already in place: There are now some 900,000
nonprofits, the great majority close to the problems of their
communities. And about 30,000 of them came into being in <DATE>1990</DATE>
(the latest year for which figures are available) --
practically all dedicated to local action on one problem:
tutoring minority children; furnishing ombudsmen for patients
in the local hospital; helping immigrants through government
red tape.
   Where 20 years ago the American middle class thought it
had done its social duty by writing a check, it increasingly
commits itself to active doing as well. According to the best
available statistics, there are now some 90 million Americans
-- one out of every two adults -- working as "volunteers" in
nonprofits for three hours a week on average; the nonprofits
have become <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s largest "employer."
   Increasingly these volunteers do not look upon their work
as charity; they see it as a parallel career to their paid
jobs and insist on being trained, on being held accountable
for results and performance, and on career opportunities for
advancement to professional and managerial -- though still
unpaid -- positions in the nonprofit. Above all, they see in
volunteer work access to achievement, to effectiveness, to
self-fulfillment, indeed to meaningful citizenship. And for
this reason there is more demand for well-structured
volunteer jobs than there are positions to fill.
   Some observers (such as <PERSON>Brian O'Connell</PERSON>, head of
Independent Sector, the national association of the large
nonprofits) believe that, within 10 years, two-thirds of
American adults -- <MONEY>120 million</MONEY> -- will want to work as
nonprofit volunteers for five hours a week each, which would
mean a doubling of the man- and woman-power available for
nonprofit work.
   And the nonprofits are becoming highly innovative. When
some friends and I founded the <PERSON>Peter F. Drucker</PERSON> Foundation
for Non Profit Management a year ago, we planned as our first
public event a <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> award for the best innovation that
would "create a significant new dimension of non profit
performance." We hoped to receive 40 applications. We
received 809 -- and most were deserving of a prize.
   The actual award went to the <ORGANIZATION>Judson Center</ORGANIZATION>, but the big
nonprofits are as innovative as the small fry in many cases.
With <MONEY>several billion dollars</MONEY> in revenue, <ORGANIZATION>Family Service</ORGANIZATION>
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> -- headquartered in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> -- has become bigger
than a good many Fortune 500 companies; it now is probably
the biggest American nonprofit next to the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. It has
achieved its phenomenal growth in part through contracting
with large employers such as <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> to help employee
families with such problems as addiction or the emotional
disorders of adolescent children.
   For the nonprofits' potential to become reality, three
things are needed. First, the average nonprofit must manage
itself as well as the best-managed ones do. The majority
still believe that good intentions and a pure heart are all
that are needed. They do not yet see themselves as
accountable for performance and results. And far too many
splinter their efforts or waste them on non-problems and on
activities that would be done better -- and more cheaply --
by a business.
   Second, nonprofits have to learn how to raise money. The
American public has not become less generous -- there is
little evidence of the "compassion fatigue" nonprofit people
talk about. In fact, giving has been going up quite sharply
these past few years -- from <PERCENT>2.5%</PERCENT> of personal income to <PERCENT>2.9%</PERCENT>.
Unfortunately, a great many nonprofits still believe that the
way to get money is to hawk needs. But the American public
gives for results. It no longer gives to "charity"; it "buys
in." Of the charitable appeals most of us get in the mail
every week, usually just one talks of results -- the one that
gets our check.
   The nonprofits will have to get the additional money they
need primarily from individuals -- as they always have. Even
if there is government money -- mainly via vouchers, I expect
-- and money from companies, they can supply only a fraction
of what is needed.
   Finally, we need a change in the attitude of government
and government bureaucracies. President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has spoken
glowingly of the importance of the nonprofits as the
"thousand points of light." If he really believes this, he
should propose allowing taxpayers to deduct <MONEY>$1.10</MONEY> for each
dollar they give to nonprofits as a cash donation. This would
solve the nonprofits' money problems at once. It also could
cut government deficits in the not-so-very-long run -- for a
well-managed nonprofit gets at least twice the bang out of
each buck that a government agency does. Some of the voucher
programs already enacted cut public school budgets, since
some of the district's per-pupil spending moves with the
child into the private sector.
   Instead of such a policy, however, we have the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> making
one move after the other to penalize and to curtail donations
to nonprofits -- and the tax collectors of the big states are
all doing the same. Each of these moves is presented as
"closing a tax loophole"; in fact, none has yielded a penny
of additional revenue and none is likely to do so.
   The real motivation for such actions is the bureaucracy's
hostility to the nonprofits -- not too different from the
bureaucracy's hostility to markets and private enterprise in
the former Communist countries. The success of the nonprofits
undermines the bureaucracy's power and denies its ideology.
Worse, the bureaucracy cannot admit that the nonprofits
succeed where governments fail. What is needed, therefore, is
a public policy that establishes the nonprofits as the
country's first line of attack on its social problems.
   In my <DATE>1969</DATE> book "The Age of Discontinuity" I first
proposed "privatization," only to have every reviewer tell me
that it would never happen. Now, of course, privatization is
widely seen as the cure for modern economies mismanaged by
socialist bureaucracies. We now need to learn that
"nonprofitization" may for modern societies be the way out of
mismanagement by welfare bureaucracies.

<TEXT>
   Avant-garde artists armed with video cameras
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art
designed to draw the viewer into the picture.
   ``People are captivated by this art form,'' said video artist
<PERSON>Mary Lucier</PERSON>. ``It screens out distractions. It draws you into a
completely new and different world. In that sense, it's kind of
like going to the movies.''
   A new exhibit, ``American Landscape Video: The Electronic
Grove,'' features work done in the past decade by seven leading
video artists, including <PERSON>Lucier</PERSON>.
   The show, on display through <DATE>July 10</DATE> at <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie
Museum of Art</ORGANIZATION>, features bright moving images that appear on video
monitors illuminating darkened rooms.
   The videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds
call, a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging
amid crackles and pops. Eerie music plays as the camera peers up
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water.
   The artists placed rocks, trees and other objects around the
video monitors, which have screens up to 25 inches wide. In one
work, viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own
images in the still water of a reflecting pool. In another, a coil
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream.
   ``Each space creates its own environment,'' <PERSON>Lucier</PERSON> says. ``The
impact, I think, is greater than sculpture. There is the sound as
well as moving images and three dimensional objects.''
   Many people resist the concept of video art, assuming viewing it
would be like watching television, but they usually like the works
once they see them, said <PERSON>Bill Judson</PERSON>, film curator at the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``People come in and they see this and they say, `My God, I love
that,''' he said. ``They're astonished in themselves.''
   Video art began in the mid-1960s, when advances in technology
made black and white film equipment more affordable. In the early
'70s, museums began showing elaborate video displays, and some
artists used color computer-generated images in their work.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the <ORGANIZATION>Whitney
Museum of American Art</ORGANIZATION> have displayed video works, but many smaller
museums can't afford the high cost of building the exhibits, <PERSON>Judson</PERSON>
said.
   ``There's a lot of great work being done, but it's just not
getting exposure,'' he said.

   Avant-garde artists armed with video cameras
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art
designed to draw the viewer into the picture.
   ``People are captivated by this art form,'' said video artist
<PERSON>Mary Lucier</PERSON>. ``It screens out distractions. It draws you into a
completely new and different world. In that sense, it's kind of
like going to the movies.''
   A new exhibit, ``American Landscape Video: The Electronic
Grove,'' features work done in the past decade by seven leading
video artists, including <PERSON>Lucier</PERSON>.
   The show, on display through <DATE>July 10</DATE> at <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie
Museum of Art</ORGANIZATION>, features bright moving images that appear on video
monitors illuminating darkened rooms.
   The videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds
call, a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging
amid crackles and pops. Eerie music plays as the camera peers up
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water.
   The artists placed rocks, trees and other objects around the
video monitors, which have screens up to 25 inches wide. In one
work, viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own
images in the still water of a reflecting pool. In another, a coil
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream.
   ``Each space creates its own environment,'' <PERSON>Lucier</PERSON> says. ``The
impact, I think, is greater than sculpture. There is the sound as
well as moving images and three dimensional objects.''
   Many people resist the concept of video art, assuming viewing it
would be like watching television, but they usually like the works
once they see them, said <PERSON>Bill Judson</PERSON>, film curator at the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``People come in and they see this and they say, `My God, I love
that,''' he said. ``They're astonished in themselves.''
   Video art began in the mid-1960s, when advances in technology
made black and white film equipment more affordable. In the early
'70s, museums began showing elaborate video displays, and some
artists used color computer-generated images in their work.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the <ORGANIZATION>Whitney
Museum of American Art</ORGANIZATION> have displayed video works, but many smaller
museums can't afford the high cost of building the exhibits, <PERSON>Judson</PERSON>
said.
   ``There's a lot of great work being done, but it's just not
getting exposure,'' he said.
   In <PERSON>Lucier</PERSON>'s ``Wilderness,'' three videotapes are shown
simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals. She
filmed the same sites depicted by <DATE>19th century</DATE> American landscape

SPECIAL SCREENING: LEWIS KLAHR'S VINTAGE GRAPHICS TELL 'FUTURE'

<TEXT>
<P>
For his highly evocative "Tales of the Forgotten Future," which Filmforum 
screens tonight at 8 at LACE, filmmaker <PERSON>Lewis Klahr</PERSON> digs into a treasure-trove 
of vintage graphics to bring the past alive with a powerful emotional effect. 
</P>
<P>
A master of decoupage, <PERSON>Klahr</PERSON> cuts out figures from old magazines, comic books, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
-- the list of his source materials is endless -- and animates them against 
backgrounds of photographs, engravings and so on. 
</P>
<P>
However, for all its reprocessing and layering, his work is fundamentally a 
rigorous example of achieving maximum impact through minimal means. 
</P>
<P>
What he achieves is two-fold: to evoke the American experience through popular 
culture, especially of the <DATE>'40s</DATE> and <DATE>'50s</DATE>, and to tell us little stories, often 
merely narrative fragments, to create the effect of eavesdropping on life. 
</P>
<P>
He takes us into the idealized, homogenous world of advertising and 
commercials, in which everyone is WASP-y, well-dressed and well-fed, only to 
reveal beneath impeccable surfaces a whole range of emotions -- fear, 
loneliness, sexual craving. 
</P>
<P>
Most poignant is the endless parade of pert, smiling <PERSON>Jon Whitcomb/Barbie</PERSON> 
doll-like creatures, calling attention to an image that straitjacketed a 
generation (or two) of young American women.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co., in a major executive
change, brought in its top financial manager to run the
company's all-important theme park division, which lately has
been hurt by recession and declines in attendance.
   Disney reached into corporate ranks and put its
39-year-old chief financial officer, Judson C. Green, in
charge of day-to-day operations at Walt Disney Attractions.
He succeeds Richard A. Nunis, 59, who was named to the new
position of chairman of the unit. Mr. Green, who has headed a
division much-praised on Wall Street for its innovative
financing strategies, takes the title of president.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Disney didn't announce <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s successor as chief
financial officer, but individuals familiar with the
situation say the job will go to <PERSON>Richard Nanula</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s
31-year-old treasurer.
   <PERSON>Mr. Nunis</PERSON> is a legendary figure at <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>. He joined the
company in <DATE>1955</DATE> -- a few months before <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> first
opened -- and has led the theme park division for 20 years,
the past 11 as president. When the management team of <PERSON>Michael
Eisner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frank Wells</PERSON> joined the company in late <DATE>1984</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s entertainment division was overhauled, but the
executive ranks of the theme parks unit -- which produces <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>
to <PERCENT>65%</PERCENT> of the company's operating income -- was relatively
untouched.
   <PERSON>Mr. Nunis</PERSON> was largely in charge of the building of the
<ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney World</ORGANIZATION> resort in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. In some ways, company
management viewed <PERSON>Mr. Nunis</PERSON> as the custodian of the sacred
tablets handed down by company founder <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney</ORGANIZATION>.
   "He's the general," says one executive, referring to the
near-military precision and discipline of <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s theme park
operations. "He makes the monorails run on time," adds a
former executive.
   The company said <PERSON>Mr. Nunis</PERSON> will "assume an expanded,
strategic-oriented role" in the division, and <PERSON>Mr. Eisner</PERSON>,
chairman and chief executive officer, praised his
"immeasurable" contributions to <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s theme parks. <PERSON>Mr.
Nunis</PERSON> continues to serve on the board of directors and the
five-member executive committee.
   <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and became chief financial
officer in <DATE>1989</DATE>. He has had several posts connected with the
theme parks, including vice president of finance and planning
for <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney World</ORGANIZATION> and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION>Euro
Disneyland SCA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion dollar resort outside
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> that opens in <DATE>April</DATE>.
   The fact that <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> is leaving the financial ranks to
gain operational responsibility led some Disney watchers to
speculate that he is being groomed to move up to higher
management, perhaps eventually replacing <PERSON>Mr. Wells</PERSON>, 59,
president and chief operating officer, who has four years
remaining on a five-year contract.
   "This sounds like a natural progression, given the age and
experience of the parties involved," said <PERSON>Harold Vogel</PERSON>, chief
entertainment industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION>. "This is a
good way to broaden <PERSON>Judson</PERSON>'s base of experience."
   But executives cautioned that this view might be
premature. <PERSON>Mr. Wells</PERSON> shows no immediate signs of
restlessness, they say. "Also, <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> {<PERSON>Katzenberg</PERSON>} might
have something to say about that scenario," one <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>
executive said. <PERSON>Mr. Katzenberg</PERSON>, the 40-year-old chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Studios</ORGANIZATION>, might also be a logical candidate to
become company president.
   <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> will continue to work in <LOCATION>Burbank</LOCATION>, though he'll
spend half his time in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, while <PERSON>Mr. Nunis</PERSON>
remains in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. The theme park unit will gain a major new
operational division when Euro Disney opens. And <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON>'s
close relationship with the company's entertainment unit is
expected to make it easier for film and TV executives to
contribute to the parks.
   The past year has been difficult for <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> as the
recession, higher air fares and a stronger dollar have all
conspired to lower tourism and hurt attendance at the parks
-- just as thousands of new hotel rooms have opened at <ORGANIZATION>Disney
World</ORGANIZATION>.
   Moreover, while <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> has promised a decade of expansion
at all its parks, it has had precious few new attractions in
the past two years. The arrival last year of <ORGANIZATION>MCA Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s
<LOCATION>Universal Studios Florida</LOCATION> put <ORGANIZATION>Disney World</ORGANIZATION> in the position of
having to compete, with all the attendant marketing and
promotional expenses. Some individuals familiar with the
situation say <PERSON>Mr. Eisner</PERSON> has been dissatisfied with the
performance of the attractions division, which employs 43,000
people and had revenue in <DATE>fiscal 1990</DATE> of more than <MONEY>$3
billion</MONEY>.
   Some Disney watchers observed that theme park executives
more conventionally are drawn from the ranks of operations or
marketing. "When I see a financial guy go into the parks,
that tells me they're worrying about costs," said <PERSON>Raymond
Katz</PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Shearson Lehman Hutton</ORGANIZATION>.
   But in an interview, <PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> pointed to the operational
experience in his background. "Though the economic downturn
is lasting longer than anyone expected -- and it's going to
take awhile to pull out of it -- we take the long-term view,"
<PERSON>Mr. Green</PERSON> said. "There's huge growth potential in this area
for us."

<HL> Is Contact Tracing an Answer to AIDS? </HL>
<AUTHOR> Phyllis Gapen </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, a controversial ballot measure that is ahead in the polls would, among other things, mandate tracing of all partners of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. 
A group of 800 doctors and two county medical societies are in favor of Proposition 102; the <ORGANIZATION>California Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> and the director of the state health department are opposed. 

   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, 1,800 surgeons and obstetricians are suing colleagues at the state health department. 
They want health officials to declare AIDS a sexually transmitted communicable disease and locate and counsel people testing positive for HIV and their sexual and IV-drug partners. 

   Such battles in the nation's two largest states attest to how tracing the contacts of those with the AIDS-associated virus has become a cutting issue in public policy related to the disease. 
Such tracing already is under way in some areas of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, and the record is mixed. 

   Nowhere in the country is there mandatory listing of sexual or IV-drug partners. 
Both <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> currently require the reporting to health authorities only of full-blown AIDS cases, not the often-symptom-free infection with the HIV virus. 
A growing number of states, however, require the names of people with HIV infections to be reported to health officers, a precursor to contact tracing. 

   Formulating a uniform method of tracing those exposed to the virus would be no easy task, concedes <PERSON>Franklyn Judson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado Department of Health</ORGANIZATION>, one of the architects of that state's successful voluntary HIV testing, counseling and tracing program. 
The incidence of infection varies from state to state, as does the pattern of spread among high-risk groups. 

   The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> surgeons and obstetricians argue that the lives of innocent people could be spared with intensive voluntary contact tracing, by alerting possible carriers not to spread it further, but health department officials are skeptical. 

   Of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s more than 16,000 reported full-blown AIDS cases, <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> are concentrated among IV drug users, who often don't know the names of their contacts and do not behave in the most responsible way. 
Male homosexuals (with <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s AIDS cases) also often are unable to supply the names of their contacts. 

   When the names of partners are volunteered, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> health officers place highest priority on tracing exposed women who could become pregnant. 

   To date, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, where nearly 5,500 people have come down with the full-blown disease, has formally attempted, with the infected person's permission, to reach the partners of 210 people who were exposed to the virus. 
All these contacts were heterosexuals. 
The goal of this effort is to prevent HIV infection among the unborn -- a priority shared by health officers in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 

   Last month, the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Health Services</ORGANIZATION> for the first time issued guidelines for assisting HIV-infected people who ask for help in tracing persons they exposed to the virus. 
<PERSON>Mark Hughes</PERSON>, of the state's AIDS office, said one of the primary reasons for the new rules was to assist people who wish to be treated with AZT. 
"With wider acceptance of the drug, the philosophy of testing is changing; more people are being tested so they can avail themselves of the drug." 

   Beginning in <DATE>January</DATE>, even without Proposition 102, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> doctors will be allowed to inform other medical personnel, as well as sexual and needle-sharing partners, about HIV exposure, without revealing the source of that exposure. 

   Proposition 102 goes further. 
It requires doctors to report to health authorities the names of all people infected, or reasonably suspected of being infected, with HIV; mandates that those infected provide lists of their sexual and IV-drug partners, and requires health officers to locate and counsel those partners; permits employers or insurers to use HIV tests; and lets doctors test a patient's blood without his consent. 

   In <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, currently only 34 people a month are testing positive for HIV. There, according to early results published in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, this <DATE>June</DATE>, state officials were able to track down more than <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the contacts named by the 12 men who by last fall had tested positive for the virus. 
The <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> program continues. 

   As early as <DATE>1985</DATE>, public-health officials in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> began tracing the contacts of people named as HIV-infected, a voluntary process referred to as "partner notification." 
In <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, says state health director <PERSON>Thomas Vernon</PERSON>, medical sleuths soon discovered the virus was being spread in a "core group" of some 350 homosexual men and IV drug abusers. 

   At a cost of <MONEY>$200</MONEY> to find the contacts of each infected person, health experts located 500 sexual and IV drug partners. 
About one in 20 contacts tested positive for HIV. 
In the absence of a cure, counseling HIV-positive people to abstain from sexual relations or the sharing of needles could reduce the spread of the disease, and expenditures for notification could translate into savings. 
For every new case of AIDS averted, Coloradans could expect to avoid at least <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY> in medical costs. 

   <PERSON>Dr. Vernon</PERSON> says he got the names of the contacts by allowing some men at HIV test sites to use pseudonyms for themselves if they also gave a correct address or telephone number. 
Health officials also have promised not to reveal the name of the infected person who triggered the notification process, and legislation protects the information obtained from HIV patients from court disclosure, according to <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> health lawyer <PERSON>Ed Richards</PERSON>. 

   Because many contacts cannot be found, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> health officers concluded over time that it was not reasonable to attempt to notify over 20,000 people exposed to HIV by 4,000 residents. 
<PERSON>Dr. Vernon</PERSON> has narrowed his search for contacts. 

   "A partner notification program must set priorities according to a number of criteria," <PERSON>Dr. Vernon</PERSON> said, including how recently a person contracted the virus and the risks an infected person presents to those who don't know about the infection. 
"An individual with a series of bathhouse experiences three years ago is a low priority," he explained, because it is doubtful his contacts can now be found. 
"We can't afford to have field workers finding" these people, because "the benefit-to-cost ratio is very unfavorable." 

   Most of the male partners of gay men, adds his colleague <PERSON>Dr. Judson</PERSON>, shouldn't have to be notified, because they know the risk and should seek HIV tests. 
The female sex partners of infected men -- usually the wives of bisexuals -- are the first that health officers notify. 

   The president's AIDS commission last <DATE>summer</DATE> also recommended targeted tracing for groups at high risk of unwittingly contracting the disease. 

   "Absurd" is the word <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Dr. Vernon</PERSON> used to describe <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s proposed identification program for every infected person in the state. 

   <PERSON>Laurens P. White</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> internist who speaks for more than half the practicing physicians in his state in his capacity as president of the <ORGANIZATION>California Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, says: "It always seems like I'm a gay apologist who says you can't take a chance on the gay person losing privacy or insurance. 
I'd lose it like a shot if you could control the disease" through contact tracing. 
"If you could toss the civil liberties {of patients} out the window and control the disease with contact tracing, I'd toss them out the window. 
But not only is AIDS not controlled {by the process}, a lot of people can be injured by it." 

   But <PERSON>Warren Bostick</PERSON>, who formerly was a medical school dean and president of the <ORGANIZATION>California Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, thinks his physician colleagues put undue emphasis on the rights of people with HIV. According to the pathologist, who helped draft Proposition 102, the way society now ensures confidentiality for an HIV infected person is tantamount to putting a "gun in his hands." 
We are "obliged to insist upon certain restrictions of individual rights," he asserts. 
<PERSON>Dr. Bostick</PERSON> says he intends for public health officers to use their own discretion in choosing the HIV carriers to trace. 
"If that's what they meant, that's what their law should have said," <PERSON>Dr. White</PERSON> contends. 

   Experience in public health clinics suggests there are both benefits and risks to reporting to health officials the names of those with the virus. 

   In <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, doctors at the state health department concede that testing among homosexual males dropped nearly <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> at an urban clinic in the first few months after physicians and clinics were required to report the names of people testing HIV positive. 
But they add that demand for tests rose again quickly. 

   More than twice the number of male homosexuals took HIV tests when <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> eased its requirement for reporting the names of those with HIV, allowing patients the option of being tested anonymously by public health clinics. (Shortly thereafter, the state began voluntary contact tracing. 
A few dozen people have had their contacts traced so far.) 

   Oregon's experience, argue gay activists in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, suggests that naming HIV carriers will drive people underground and thwart efforts to halt the spread of the disease. 
But <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s voluntary HIV reporting and contact-tracing experiences seemingly stand as a challenge to such charges. 
The record shows that homosexuals at high risk of contracting HIV continued to seek tests and cooperate with efforts to find those they had exposed to the virus when AIDS was declared a sexually transmitted disease. 

   But both <PERSON>Benjamin Schatz</PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION>National Gay Rights Advocates</ORGANIZATION>, and Dr. White maintain that in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, Proposition 102's contact tracing proposal will be "a waste of up to <MONEY>$1.75 billion</MONEY> in resources." 
Education about "safe sex" has brought the rate of new HIV infection in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to almost zero, they assert. 

   According to <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Dr. Judson</PERSON>, however, "It's still possible most of the determinants of 'safe sex' behavior in gay men have nothing to do with counseling. 
We have to be cautious in assuming any one thing we do is serving as the major stimulus for change." 

   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s success in contact tracing may have more to do with its laws than with its health policy. 
Unlike such states as <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> has no anti-sodomy laws. 
<PERSON>Dr. Judson</PERSON> says gay men have no fear that if their names end up on a state list of HIV carriers, they will be jailed for illegal sex acts. 

   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s experience may simply be an example of the intersection of law and medicine, but there isn't a doctor in the country who can tell you for sure.

A dissident movement inside the <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> union, seeking to curb

<P>
But the dissidents charge that the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leadership has engaged in widespread

officials say <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON>, who won the seat in a court-ordered election <DATE>last fall</DATE>, 
has been unseated by a candidate backed by union President <PERSON>Owen Bieber</PERSON>, but 
<PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> has not yet conceded. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>, a longtime dissident who has frequently opposed contract concessions 
in the auto industry, campaigned against a wide array of joint labor-management 
programs that have been accepted by the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>'s leadership. He charged that those 
"team-oriented" programs have done little more than give management extra 
leverage over workers, and have eroded the union's power on the shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Victories 
</P>
<P>
At first, his assaults against the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leadership's willingness to work more 
closely with management galvanized many rank-and-file workers at <ORGANIZATION>General 
Motors</ORGANIZATION>, and they flocked to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He swept to early landslide victories in locals at <ORGANIZATION>GM</ORGANIZATION> plants in the eastside 
<LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> region. His success stunned <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leaders, and they fought back hard. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> staffers were asked to contribute <MONEY>$500</MONEY> apiece to finance a campaign to stop 
<PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Bieber</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leaders visited plants throughout 
the two regions with contested elections. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> failed to gain enough votes in the many <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> plants in 
the east <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> region, and lost to incumbent <PERSON>Bob Lent</PERSON>, who was originally 
from a <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> local. At the same time, <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> was trailing <PERSON>Roy Wyse</PERSON>, a former 
assistant regional director who was backed by <PERSON>Bieber</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Another test for the dissident movement came <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, when workers at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s 
new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assembly plant outside <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, now represented by the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>, voted for 
local union officers for the first time. <PERSON>Phillip Keeling</PERSON>, a dissident running 
under <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>' "New Directions" banner, was challenging a UAW-backed candidate, 
<PERSON>Bill Judson</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Keeling was running in opposition to the union's acceptance of <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Japanese-style workplace policies, most notably kaizen, a Japanese term defined 
as the search for continuous improvement. The dissidents at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> claim kaizen 
is just a Japanese word for a speed-up, and insist that the union should not 
work so closely with <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> to achieve kaizen. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Judson</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leadership, meanwhile, argue that the union should work with 
<ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> to modify kaizen, without rejecting it completely. 
</P>
<P>
A dissident victory in the union fight at <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION>, one of three Japanese-managed 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assembly plants where workers now have <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> representation, could represent 
a fundamental challenge to Japanese efforts to import their management 
techniques to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Results from the <ORGANIZATION>Mazda</ORGANIZATION> election were not available late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their losses in the regional elections, leaders of the dissident group 
vowed to continue their fight at the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION> where delegates 
selected in the local elections will then actually choose regional directors 
and other union officers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leadership now seems assured of a majority of delegates for 
its regional candidates, <PERSON>Pete Kelly</PERSON>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> dissident and <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>' 
campaign manager, vowed to challenge their credentials. He charges fraud in 
many of the local elections where pro-Bieber delegates were swept in. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly also vowed to take the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>'s leadership to court on charges of election 
fraud if <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> loses at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges of Fraud 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> alleges that the <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> leadership illegally used union 
and management resources to campaign for Administration-backed candidates. At 
one <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> plant in suburban <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, for example, the company agreed to shut 
down production for 45 minutes to allow <PERSON>Bieber</PERSON> to speak to workers just before 
the local election there. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker also charges fraud, and has already protested 11 local elections in his 
region. "They are systematically stealing the thing," <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> said. "The 
position of the <PERSON>Bieber</PERSON> people is to win at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> officials deny they have used improper tactics to win. "It's not surprising 
they would make those charges and use exaggerated rhetoric," said <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> spokesman 
<PERSON>Peter Laarman</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some officials privately acknowledge that the strength of the dissident 
movement caught the leadership off guard, and may force the union to rethink 
some of its joint programs with management.

<P>
Meinard Kooiker, 66, decided it was time to go back to school after learning 
six months ago that her daughter is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, <PERSON>Kooiker</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>, joined 22 other people from around the 
country for a <ORGANIZATION>Pitzer College</ORGANIZATION> study session on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
The session is part of <ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION>, an inexpensive educational and travel 
program for people 60 and over. Most of the older students at <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> were 
parents of gay and lesbian children. Others were gay or lesbian themselves; 
some just came for the knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Kooiker, whose daughter is 26 years old, came to be with other parents of gays 
and lesbians. "When I saw this course in the (<ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION>) catalogue, I knew I 
had to come," the retired social worker said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to learn as much as I can. . . . Sitting in these classes, I'm 
beginning to understand the hell society has put them (gays and lesbians) 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> program isn't new, this is <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON>'s first 
session of courses ranging from homosexuality in <LOCATION>Ancient Greece</LOCATION> to child 
custody battles of lesbian mothers today, said <PERSON>Jiggs Gallagher</PERSON>, director of 
<ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is watching <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> to see what happens," said <PERSON>Selia Sacks</PERSON>, program 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern California Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> program in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Elderhostel began in <DATE>1975</DATE> with five colleges. Today, it includes 1,600 colleges 
and universities, private schools, national parks and a variety of other 
educational institutions across the country and around the world. Even though 
there is a wide variety of choices available, most courses dwell on pursuits 
such as country music, art, photography, folk dancing, literature, poetry and 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$250</MONEY> charge covers accommodation in college dorms, three meals a day at 
school dining halls, five days of classes (three courses a day), and a variety 
of extracurricular activities, including field trips, movies and dances. 
Courses are not for credit and there are no exams or homework. 
</P>
<P>
"The founding philosophy behind <ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> is that learning is a lifelong 
process and it can enrich your life," said <PERSON>Cady Goldfield</PERSON>, representative of 
<ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. "The course at <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> falls into this realm. It might be 
a little more controversial than other courses, but it's typical of the 
challenging topics available. . . . We are always interested in keeping up with 
current issues." 
</P>
<P>
All nonprofit institutions that participate in <ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> choose their own 
courses; the only restriction is that the classes cannot deal with geriatrics. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON>'s program is very innovative, and it's expanding the <ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> 
program to a new audience, an audience whose needs has not really been met," 
<PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who began the gay and lesbian program at <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> say this small, private 
liberal arts college was ideal for this set of courses. "When it comes to gay 
and lesbian issues, <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> is taking the leadership within the <LOCATION>Claremont</LOCATION> 
community," said <PERSON>Dr. Lourdes Arguelles</PERSON>, associate professor of Women's Studies, 
who taught the course on "Issues in Lesbian Studies." 
</P>
<P>
Pitzer is the only one among the six <ORGANIZATION>Claremont Colleges</ORGANIZATION> to offer a course in 
lesbian studies during regular school sessions. It hosted an international gay 
and lesbian conference in <DATE>April</DATE>, and <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> students recently voted to ban ROTC 
on campus because of the military's discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to start a gay and lesbian studies here and we thought the 
<ORGANIZATION>Elderhostel</ORGANIZATION> program would be a great way to test some ideas," said <PERSON>Pieter 
Judson</PERSON>, a history professor at <PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> who taught the Sexuality Through the Ages 
course. "We weren't really sure what to expect. But we were all very curious." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's session was broken into three classes a day. The first, "Issues in 
Lesbian Studies," dealt with the "coming out" process of acknowledging 
homosexuality, as well as other problems facing lesbians, such as child custody 
battles with previous husbands. 
</P>
<P>
The second class, "Sexuality Through the Ages," covered lesbian and gay culture 
from <LOCATION>Ancient Greece</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>19th Century United States</ORGANIZATION> and the significance of 
same-sex relationships in history. The last class, "Contemporary Topics in Gay 
Studies," dealt with gay political and social movements in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The students also took a field trip to <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION> to tour the Gay and 
<ORGANIZATION>Lesbian Community Service Center</ORGANIZATION>, the oldest and largest social services agency 
for gays and lesbians in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is to educate as many people as we can on the complexity and 
diversity of gay and lesbian issues," said <PERSON>Peter Nardi</PERSON>, sociology professor at 
<PERSON>Pitzer</PERSON> who taught the third class. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles said that, for most of the older students, this was the first formal 
instruction they have had on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might be very active in gay and lesbian community centers and 
organizations, but they have never really studied the many issues involved," 
<PERSON>Arguelles</PERSON> said. "There are many issues of concern to gay and lesbian seniors 
that are similar to heterosexuals, but they also have very different concerns, 
such as inheritance laws, which ignore homosexual couples." 
</P>
<P>
Some participants said the program gave them a chance to break stereotypes that 
people have of the elderly. "This is a week not to be old," said <PERSON>Joan Miller</PERSON>, 
66, of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. "A week not to be ignored and treated like you don't 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Young lesbians don't like old lesbians; there is a lot of prejudice," she 
said. "I came here to meet women and have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Nardi agreed: "We live in a very youth-oriented society. Older people's needs 
are usually ignored, whether they're homosexual or heterosexual." 
</P>
<P>
Then there were those, like 85-year-old <PERSON>Linnea Ross</PERSON>, who had never known anyone 
who is gay or lesbian, but wanted to come for the "intellectual stimulation." 
</P>
<P>
"I live alone in a mobile home park and the biggest excitement is bingo," said 
<PERSON>Ross</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION>. "The only thing I knew about gays was what I saw in gay parade 
. . . I just wanted to learn more."

<TEXT>
   Mixed in with the ads for trusses and
carousel music in the 199th Old Farmer's Almanac are predictions
for a cold, snowy winter and advice on helping a baby grow: Put
manure in the infant's shoes.
   The 224-page, 199th edition hits newsstands and supermarkets
this week with its traditional weather predictions, planting and
tide tables, anecdotes and folklor.
   It claims <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> accuracy in its weather forecasts, but
editor and part-owner <PERSON>Judson Hale</PERSON> says that figure is not cast in
stone.
   ``I can't in seriousness say <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT>,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> office. He missed the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>
drought in <DATE>1988</DATE>.
   Nevertheless, the almanac is predicting a ``real old-fashioned
winter'' east of the Rockies with below-normal temperatures over
much of the country except <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, sections of the <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and lower
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> valleys and the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, it predicts, will have warmer than normal weather in
<DATE>February</DATE> and <DATE>March</DATE>.
   The almanac also forecasts a generally warmer <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE>
than normal, but a cool and wet <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   The almanac says its forecasts are based on a combination of a
secret formula devised by its founder and the ``most modern
scientific calculation based on solar activity.''
   Hale also strays into earthquake forecasts, noting that the moon
will be 221,545 miles from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on New Year's Eve, closer than
its average of 251,000 miles.
   ``Some people would believe it would have an influence on an
earthquake if an earthquake was thinking about happening,'' he
said. Believers argue that when the moon is closer and its
gravitational pull is stronger, there is greater stress on rock
layers that might rupture and cause a quake.
   The almanac even offers folklore advice on babies. On
conception, the almanac offers this folk wisdom: If a woman lays
her hat or coat on a strange bed, she will have a child.
   To have a boy, she should hold a nickel in her mouth at the time
of conception. To make the baby grow tall, folksters suggest
putting manure in the child's shoes.
   The yellow-covered Old Farmer's Almanac has changed little since
it was first published in <DATE>1792</DATE>.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a
hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience,
its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.
   ``It does indicate it is, in a sense, a calendar,'' <PERSON>Hale</PERSON> says.
   Hale spent the <DATE>summer</DATE> scouring previous issues for lore to
include in an expanded 200th anniversary edition next year.
   ``I'm up to <DATE>1931</DATE>,'' he said. ``I have 65 pages of notes.''
   Almanac readers will get a chance to contribute. The essay topic
for the 200th edition: How the Old Farmer's Almanac Has Influenced
My Life.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After watching his half-acre of grass wither
and dry this <DATE>spring</DATE>, <PERSON>Witham Smith</PERSON> wrote a letter to the ``Old
Farmer's Almanac.''
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the
196-year-old publication's forecasters, having missed the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>'s
drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end.
   He received a pretty dry answer from <PERSON>Judson D. Hale Sr.</PERSON>, editor
of the almanac.
   ``We didn't predict that it was coming and we can't predict when
it will end,'' <PERSON>Hale</PERSON> wrote <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, who lives in suburban Terrace Park.
   The almanac claims to be <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> accurate, but <PERSON>Hale</PERSON>
acknowledged that it doesn't predict weather for <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE>
too well.
   This year, it predicted that it would be warmer and wetter than
normal in the <LOCATION>Greater Ohio Valley</LOCATION>. Heavy rain was predicted for
<DATE>June 14</DATE> to 17.
   The almanac usually gathers statistics for its predictions six
to 18 months in advance. The predictions are based on such
information as changes in sun spots, the size of polar ice caps,
and the location of warm water currents.
   ``Our <DATE>1989</DATE> edition will be published in <DATE>November</DATE>. It is really
hard to nail down the weather for <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE> that far in
advance because so many things happen,'' <PERSON>Hale</PERSON> said.
   ``They have been a little off before, but never this far,''
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. ``They said we would be about half an inch off, but not
a drought like this.''

   BOUNTY-HUNTER AUDITS of property tax are shot down in two
Southeast states.
   In both, counties hired contractors to audit businesses'
non-realty "personal" property, such as machinery -- in
return for 35% of any added revenue. In February, on a plea
by Sears Roebuck, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the use of
contractors but unanimously outlawed contingency-fee deals as
a threat to fairness. Now North Carolina's Property Tax
Commission, noting the Georgia opinion, has voted 3-2 to void
Cabarrus County's addition of $548 million to the value of
Philip Morris's property.

representing <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON>. Cabarrus County plans to appeal
to the state courts, says its lawyer, <PERSON>Charles C. Meeker</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>; but it is considering switching to hourly fee
contracts -- as are other counties -- and plans to reaudit
the company.
   The contingency fees in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> were
based on assessments of penalties as well as taxes.
                                                                                                       

   SELF-EMPLOYERS who get Social Security may have
misreported <DATE>1990</DATE> income. Social Security benefits are limited
for people under 70 who also earn pay above certain sums;
recipients must report wages and net self-employment earnings
on Social Security Form SSA-777-BK. But the <DATE>1990</DATE> form didn't
specify which self-employment figure to take from Schedule SE
of the <DATE>1990</DATE> tax return, notes tax adviser <PERSON>Robert E. Judson</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Chatsworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>; many filers may have used the wrong one,
from SE Line 3, not the right smaller one from Line 4.
   A filer who reported too much self-employment earnings to
Social Security may be asked to pay back benefits he actually
is entitled to, <PERSON>Judson</PERSON> says. Social Security printed its form
before the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> revised the <DATE>1990</DATE> Schedule SE to use Line 4 to
reflect a new deduction. People who reported a wrong figure
may file a corrected form, Social Security says. Or they may
call 800-234-5772 and make the correction by phone.
                                                                                                       

   A BIG TAX BILL EVOLVES for the originator of the specious
foreign trust. A popular tax scam of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> was created by
<PERSON>Karl L. Dahlstrom</PERSON>; he told clients to hide assets and income
under tiers of foreign trusts and got up to <MONEY>$12,000</MONEY> for such
advice. His conviction on charges of aiding the preparation
of false returns was reversed in <DATE>1983</DATE> because the legality of
the scheme was "unsettled" in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. But courts in many
subsequent civil tax cases found the trusts to be shams and
imposed civil fraud penalties on the taxpayers.
   Yet <PERSON>Dahlstrom</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>College Station</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, persisted in
pressing appeals for his own family trusts in two Tax Court
cases covering <DATE>1977</DATE> through <DATE>1983</DATE>. Now <PERSON>Judge Scott</PERSON> and Special
<PERSON>Judge Pajak</PERSON> have found <PERSON>Dahlstrom</PERSON>'s trusts to be no more fit
for survival than his clients' and have upheld <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> claims for
<MONEY>$2.4 million</MONEY> in back taxes.
   The judges also upheld <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> civil-fraud penalties and other
penalties, in addition to interest.
                                                                                                       

   A BIRTHDAY SUIT didn't cover this: <PERSON>Lloyd S. Rohlig</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Marietta</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, accountant, claimed certain unreported income
must be birthday gifts because he deposited it in the bank on
his birthday. The <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> found the argument novel, but
unbelievable, in rejecting his suit for relief from taxes and
civil fraud penalties.
                                                                                                       

   CORPORATE GROUPS that want to stop consolidating units'
returns needn't seek <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> approval by <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, says Revenue
Procedure 91-39; it delays that initial deadline until after
final rules appear. Many companies want to deconsolidate to
escape temporary <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> rules that deny deductions of losses
from selling consolidated units.
                                                                                                       

   DELINQUENTS' TAX DEBTS, including interest and penalties,
grew nearly <PERCENT>11%</PERCENT> in fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE> to <MONEY>$96.3 billion</MONEY>, <PERSON>Paul Posner</PERSON>
of the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> hearing. But
the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> expects <MONEY>$24 billion</MONEY> to be abated because of errors
and <MONEY>$46 billion</MONEY> to be written off after 10 years as unabated,
uncollected, or uncollectible.
                                                                                                       

   FOREIGN-CONTROLLED companies face complex new accounting
chores. Two sets of <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> rules are to carry out <DATE>1989</DATE> law meant
to keep the units from fudging on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> taxes. Final rules on
reporting dealings with foreign affiliates and supplying
their records have been liberalized a bit. Smaller units are
absolved of records-keeping; large ones may negotiate records
deals with the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, notes <PERSON>Robert Cole</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lawyer.
But the basic requirement to provide detailed foreign records
or pay "Draconian" penalties remains, says <PERSON>Eli Fink</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Deloitte &amp; Touche</ORGANIZATION>, CPAs.
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> also proposed rules limiting corporate deductions
of interest paid to foreign affiliates, a move to bar
disguised transfers of untaxed profits. The rules would give
foreign parents, especially those with several <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> units,
many calculation headaches, says <PERSON>Marianne Burge</PERSON> of Price
Waterhouse, CPAs. And the rules leave many open issues, such
as the definition of debt and the treatment of a parent's
guarantee of a third-party loan. Burge questions "whether
these rules are workable."
   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> seeks comments on the rules and plans a hearing on
them <DATE>Sept. 25</DATE>.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: A bill proposed by Rep. <PERSON>Grandy</PERSON> (R., <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>) would
offer businesses a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> credit for gifts to apprenticeship
programs . . . . A private eye posing as a client's employee
appears on the client's payroll to protect his cover story
but doesn't keep that pay. <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> private ruling 9118002 says he
needn't report the pay on his return.
