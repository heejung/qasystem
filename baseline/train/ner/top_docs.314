<LEADPARA>  THERE'S an invasion coming. It's big, it's bad, it's noisy, it packs some

tank.;    No. It isn't Desert Storm, The Sequel.  </LEADPARA>

(box) Alice Cooper: still shocking, Page 22  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's <ORGANIZATION>Operation Rock &amp; Roll</ORGANIZATION>. And in its way, it's just as scary.;    Think
of it. Five head-banging acts -- <PERSON>Judas Priest</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Motorhead</ORGANIZATION>,
Dangerous Toys and <ORGANIZATION>Metal Church</ORGANIZATION> -- all on the same stage going leather-bent
for hell in a heavy-metal basket, all at <ORGANIZATION>Shoreline Amphitheater</ORGANIZATION>, all on
Sunday.;    Awwwwwwright! Rocknnnnnnnrollllll! Getdowwwwwwn! Boooooogie!;   
There.;    Now that we've gotten that off our chest, we can get on with the
business at hand. Which is, oddly enough, the business of rock 'n' roll, which
is the basis of <ORGANIZATION>Operation Rock &amp; Roll.</ORGANIZATION>;    You thought this was an inspired
match made in metal heaven? Think again.;    <ORGANIZATION>Operation Rock &amp; Roll</ORGANIZATION> might be a
fan's delight -- six hours of metal madness. But it is also a part of the new
trend to market tours  like a <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg's Variety Pack</ORGANIZATION>. No more of those one-act
"An Evening With . . ." numbers. It's safety -- and ticket sales -- in
numbers, with groups being loaded onto tours to draw as many fans as
possible.;    In the case of the other tours such as the recent Gathering of
the Tribes and the upcoming <LOCATION>Lollapalooza</LOCATION> and Gang of Four/Public Enemy/Sisters
of Mercy/Warrior Soul slugfest, there has been an attempt to contribute to a
new openness in the music scene with an eclectic assortment of acts.;    But
not with <ORGANIZATION>Operation Rock &amp; Roll</ORGANIZATION>. It is strictly business. Pocket-calculator
time.;    All of the acts on this tour are allied in their affiliation with
the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and Epic records labels (which are part of <ORGANIZATION>Sony Music</ORGANIZATION>). They
don't hang out at the local bar, swigging brewskies and clanging chords. Their
people got together with the <ORGANIZATION>Sony</ORGANIZATION> people and all of them decided that it was
time to cash in. (Ticket sales to the event are sluggish, tour sources say.); 
  And how will they cash in? Let us count the ways.;    For starters, there's
the "promotion-only" Operation Rock &amp; Roll audio cassette which comes with
songs by the five participating groups. A quarter-million of these have been
printed up for the tour to be used as giveaways in conjunction with local
shows. The first few thousand fans who get to each venue will also get free
copies. Nice, eh? Yes, but the cassette also comes with songs by other
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and Epic acts, including <LOCATION>Fishbone</LOCATION>, War Babies and Cycle Sluts From
Hell, all the better to promote their records.;    Then there is the <ORGANIZATION>Operation
Rock &amp; Roll</ORGANIZATION> edition of <ORGANIZATION>MJI Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION>'s syndicated "Metalshop" program,
which was aired <DATE>July 4</DATE>. It came with interviews with the tour's groups and
selections of their music.;    Then there is the new "Operation Rock &amp; Roll"
video (<ORGANIZATION>Sony Music</ORGANIZATION>) that was released <DATE>July 2</DATE>, just in time for start of the
tour <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>. It comes with videos by the groups of the
tour, for <MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>.;    Have we forgotten anything?;  Yes, there is music
involved in all of this. And -- given its metal base -- some of it might be
quite good. With its legal problems of <DATE>1990</DATE> resolved -- remember the <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION> case
in which the group was exonerated of charges that its lyrics prompted a
suicide? -- Judas Priest seems to be alive and kicking.;    The same could be
said of the lovely and talented <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>, to you, baffled critics and
fans and common sense by going platinum with his <DATE>1989</DATE> album, "Trash." It was a
real comeback -- professionally and musically -- with a Gothic rock sound that
was the equal of his classics. He should pull out all the props for this
tour.;    <ORGANIZATION>Motorhead</ORGANIZATION> is Motorhead. If I have to explain that to you, you
probably wouldn't understand anyway. For a decade and much more, this band has
made metal that is an unalloyed pleasure, untarnished by such trivial matters
as good taste and listenability.;    Mixing business and pleasure;  <ORGANIZATION>Metal
Church</ORGANIZATION> and Dangerous Toys haven't got the Big Names -- or the fanciful names
-- of their tour counterparts, but they might be interesting opening acts.;   
All of which makes the business side of this tour all the more annoying.
Operation <ORGANIZATION>Rock &amp; Roll</ORGANIZATION> could be fun and a real deal for the fans. But all the
marketing and promotional tie-ins prove that metal has become as much a
business as a pleasure.;     <ORGANIZATION>Operation Rock &amp; Roll</ORGANIZATION>; When: <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>;
Where: Shoreline Amphitheater, One Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View;
Tickets: <MONEY>$22.50</MONEY>/<MONEY>$18.50</MONEY>, (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  LET'S get to the most important question first: Is there a snake in Alice
Cooper's new act?;    "We do have a new snake for this tour," says Alice,
laughing. "We call him Salt Lake Sidney. He's a Mormon snake. He doesn't drink
coffee and he doesn't work on Sundays."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SCHOOL'S OUT, AND HERE COMES ALICE COOPER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  MUSIC  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Cooper, 43, is calling from <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION>, where Operation Rock &amp; Roll
played this week (the show touches down here at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Shoreline
Amphitheater</ORGANIZATION>). That explains the snake's name, he says.;    Fans will walk out
changed;    <PERSON>Sidney</PERSON>, it seems, is part of what the all-time master of
theatrical rock describes as "a real <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON> show. We've got a set of our
own, very high-tech, with loads of real oooooo-ahhhh effects. At one point in
the act, we take fans from the crowd and put them on a <LOCATION>Frankenstein</LOCATION> table and
we lift it to the ceiling and when they come out, they're (pause) different.";
   In what way, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>?;    "I really don't want to give anything away," he
says with another laugh. For such a gothic kind of guy, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is downright
upbeat.;    Keep in mind, we are talking about <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON>, he of the
guillotine and black eye makeup and coiling snakes; the man who, in the '70s,
put the shock into rock. Along the way, he recorded a rock classic or two --
"I'm 18," "School's Out" -- and had a comeback platinum record, <DATE>1989</DATE>'s
"Trash.";    What sort of rock fans come to see <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON>, these days?
Young, old or what?;    "I think the older ones come but they mostly sit in
the back. When I look at the crowd from the stage, the ones in the front are
usually about 15. You know, the ones with tattoos and no teeth.";    He's
laughing again.;    It's all about hits;    How has he been able to do it lo
these many years? Alice lowers his voice and gets down to business:;    "It's
about hits. 'I'm 18' is one of those songs that anyone can relate to. The
angst lives on. Theatrics without hits is novelty and that would get boring
after a while. But if you have the theatrics and the hits, that makes a show
with meaning. When we get the effects going and play the hits, we get 10,000
people going 'Oh, wow!' ";    To <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON>, that's no laughing matter.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  LIKE her namesake in Wonderland, Woody Allen's Alice finds things becoming
curiouser and curiouser as she tumbles through her own mixed-up life. Unlike
Lewis Carroll's wanderer, Allen's heroine, played by Mia Farrow in the
souffle-airy "Alice," is fully grown and all too willing to play the
proverbial babe in the woods.;    Indeed, her friends refer to her (behind her
back) as "Miss Mouse . . . so trusting."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s heroine eventually sorts things out -- learns who's
dependable, who's not; what's up, what's down -- is more the result of luck,
coincidence and old-hat legerdemain than any real resourcefulness on her
part.;    <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is, for all intents and purposes, a surrogate for <ORGANIZATION>Allen</ORGANIZATION>'s
classic schlemiel. She even has that oh-so-; For page 7E;    Woody habit of
whining when no one's listening.;    <ORGANIZATION>Farrow</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, however, is in a
marvelous state of grace, where much befalls her but nothing does any real
harm. Alice is <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'sFilm Review; dream-child or cockeyed optimist, someone
who can take the worst that life has to shell out without becoming jaded,
cynical.;    And life does throw <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> a few unexpected curves, including a
smug, philandering husband (<PERSON>William Hurt</PERSON>) and a pack of rich, devious
girlfriends (played by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Judy Davis</PERSON>, among others).;    "I'm one of
those women who shop all day and have pedicures. I want to do more with my
life," <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> sort of complains.;    <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION>'s salvation comes during one of her
regular visits to the beauty salon/health spa. That's where she learns about a
<LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION> acupuncturist/magician named <PERSON>Dr. Yang</PERSON> (the late <PERSON>Keye Luke</PERSON> of
"Gremlins"). Yang pronounces <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s chronic backache psychosomatic. He
prescribes hypnotism and an assortment of "special herbs." The hypnotism takes
her back to the start of her problems; the herbs have a more extreme effect,
causing her to become completely uninhibited and then -- shades of <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON>!
-- invisible.;    The joke is that the timid-to-transparent <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is at her
most vital and decisive as the Invisible Woman.;    It's while under another
of <ORGANIZATION>Yang</ORGANIZATION>'s spells that <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> approaches <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, a jazz musician whose daughter
attends the same kindergarten as <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION>'s daughter. In this uptown fairy tale's
funniest bit, the usually skittish <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> seduces Joe with every conceivable
saxophone double-entendre. Joe, played by <PERSON>Joe Mantegna</PERSON> of "Godfather III," is
understandably amazed.;    So how are we to take all this? <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> tips us off
with his music, which ranges from <ORGANIZATION>Dixieland</ORGANIZATION> jazz to deliriously romantic
standards (such as "Moonlight Becomes You") to canned studio music. This is
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> doing a schizoid Noel Coward/naughty satyr routine. Little wonder the
results run the gamut from silly to sardonic.;    Enchanting and almost
frivolous, "Alice" has the feel of <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> on sabbatical from the angst-ridden
types of "<DATE>September</DATE>," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Another Woman" and, indeed,
the much-overrated "Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors." In tone, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s latest most
closely matches "A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Night</ORGANIZATION>'s Sex Comedy" and the director's
contribution to "New York Stories." Like those works, this one is loosely
structured to the point of being haphazard, distracted. In spots, it feels
like <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> taking <PERSON>Dr. Yang</PERSON>'s advice to Alice -- doing whatever feels right at
the moment.;    <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s casting is certainly strange. Trading on his status as
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most individualistic film maker -- the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> <PERSON>Ingmar Bergman</PERSON>, if
you will -- <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> has filled minor roles with such notables as <PERSON>Alec Baldwin</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Cybill Shepherd</PERSON>, <PERSON>Blythe Danner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gwen Verdon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernadette Peters</PERSON>. Baldwin
appears as the ghost of an old beau; <ORGANIZATION>Shepherd</ORGANIZATION> is a suddenly disdainful friend
with a real career; <PERSON>Peters</PERSON> is <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s amusingly bossy muse.;    Talking of
muses, in some respects this is <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> forsaking his inner voice for the voices
of others -- among them, <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>, <PERSON>Preston Sturges</PERSON> and, for a Peter
Pan-inspired joyride over <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>J.M. Barrie.</LOCATION>;    The latter adventure is
the perfect metaphor for this lighter-than-air concoction, which attempts to
sneak up on serious matters about self-worth. The strategy doesn't always
work, as <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> scores his biggest laughs with his most obvious bits (about
bored homemakers and jaded <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> cabbies), but it does make for a pleasant
enough diversion, like a promenade along Fifth Avenue in the fall.;    More,
it gives <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON> her best screen role since "The Purple Rose of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>." <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON>,
who has never looked lovelier, really comes into her own with this one. Here
finally is the opportunity to show her true range as a comedian, a range that
encompasses screwball antics and a waif-like girlishness.;    <PERSON>Like Alice</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Farrow</PERSON> has been at a crossroads for some time. With her 11th feature with
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>, the actress commits to a definite path and demonstrates a playful
sexuality that's darn-near irresistible.; <LOCATION>Alice</LOCATION>; (star)(star) 1/2; Rated:
PG-13 (slight profanity); Cast: <PERSON>Mia Farrow</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Hurt</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe Mantegna</PERSON>;

<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- Last summer my mother-in-law, "Alice," was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease. If this dear lady had died, the entire community would
have grieved with us, but as it is, well-meaning friends, who know nothing
about Alzheimer's and happen to visit Alice on one of her good days, think we
are terrible people.;    We get calls asking why we haven't been to visit
Alice in several weeks when, in fact, we go to see her every day. She gets on
the phone and tells people she is in terrible pain and that we refuse to spend
money on a doctor to find out what is wrong. The truth is we have spent $8,000
on diagnostic tests and the results show that she is in excellent health. The
nursing home we have placed her in costs $3,100 a month.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IGNORANCE INTENSIFIES PAIN OF ALZHEIMER'S  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Yesterday a friend of <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION>'s phoned to plead that we take her "out of
there." She said, "The poor dear is so lonely and hates being in an
institution." I tried to explain that we cannot keep her at home because she
needs around-the-clock care. I didn't want to mention her urinating on the
floor, the need to change her bed linens four or five times a day, or the
times she has wandered outside totally unclothed.;    With the grief of
<PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s illness and dealing daily with her problems, the added stress of these
"friends" is more than we can take. Do you have solutions for handling these
people?;    -- <LOCATION>C.H.</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION>;    DEAR <LOCATION>SPOKANE</LOCATION> -- It is difficult for those
who haven't had experience with Alzheimer's to understand the heartbreak. It
kills twice. First, the mind, then the body.;    You can get guidance on how
to deal with well-meaning but ignorant friends from the <ORGANIZATION>Alzheimer's
Association</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 5675-AL, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION> 60680-5675. You need a support
group and they will help you find it. Good luck.;    DEAR ANN -- My girlfriend
and I have a problem and I admit it's my fault. Molly (not her real name) has

<LEADPARA>  WHAT if they gave a rock show and nobody came?;    Operation Rock &amp; Roll
invaded Shoreline Amphitheater on Sunday. But it was no Desert Storm. In fact,
if one added up all the musicians of Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Motorhead,
Metal Church and Dangerous Toys (who made up the tour) with all of their
roadies and toadies and groupies, the bottom line probably would have
outnumbered the fans who came out to see the performance.  </LEADPARA>

TURNOUT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Not really. But barely a quarter of <ORGANIZATION>Shoreline</ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000 seats were filled by
the time <ORGANIZATION>Metal Church</ORGANIZATION> began the metal slugfest at about <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> And for the
next seven hours, the turnout was roughly proportionate to the quality of
music presented onstage.;    What is the Iraqi word for "dismal"?;    <ORGANIZATION>Metal
Church</ORGANIZATION> had the thankless job of opening this debacle. And it must be said that
the group did have a raw power and energy that got the crowd -- what there was
of it -- up and moving. Vocalist <PERSON>Mike Howe</PERSON> and his mates have a trace of the
punk-based bite that they did when they started out 10 years ago, and they
used it in a set that was, if nothing else, exciting. But, in fact, there was
nothing else to Metal Church.;    Nor to Dangerous Toys, which displayed the
usual metal cliches with an arena-rock slickness that was boring and annoying.
The Metal Book says that every group should play noisy rock and have a shrill
vocalist and guitarists who squeeze off volleys of notes. And all the troops
of Operation Rock &amp; Roll obviously have been doing their reading.;    One of
the guys who wrote that book, <PERSON>Lemmy</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Motorhead</ORGANIZATION>, was on hand for the event.
In the '70s, it was <PERSON>Lemmy</PERSON> who helped to reduce metal from a viable creative
form to a sort of tag-team contest of sound. And, at this show, he was in
form, shouting out his lyrics like a wino in search of a street corner.
Motorhead performed with a monolithic abandon, with guitarist <PERSON>Wurzel</PERSON> providing
an errant blues phrase or two to remind us where metal came from eons ago. But
for the most part its set wasn't about songs as much as sound -- pure,
ear-melting sound.;    <ORGANIZATION>Cooper</ORGANIZATION>'s conviction intact;    <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON> came next.
Now, <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> isn't a real metalist. He uses the style as an aural scrim on
which he projects his theatrical visions. With metal blaring in the
background, he entered the stage from the gaping mouth of a skull and --
depending on one's tastes in such matters -- got either better or worse from
there. At various points he hugged a snake -- the lovely and talented Salt
Lake <PERSON>Sidney</PERSON> -- and grabbed a "fan" from the crowd, strapped her onto a
"Frankenstein table" and turned her into a monster, which he proceeded to
assault and cast aside. During "School's Out," he kicked a bunch of gigantic
balloons into the crowd, sticking them with a saber, which made them explode
into clouds of multicolored confetti.;    Whew!;    Yes, it was silly and
hokey. And in his black, studded leather tights, <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON>'s stooped posture made
him look like a hilarious version of the Alien (although that creature would
never have worn such flashy eye makeup).;    But <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON>'s garish set also came
with <ORGANIZATION>Cooper</ORGANIZATION>'s songs, which made the effects worth the time and bother. "I'm
18" is one of the teen angst classics of all time, and <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> sang it with a
conviction that masked his 43 years. And <DATE>1989</DATE>'s "Poison" was equally
wonderful, not metal as much as unalloyed pop. And his new "Hey Stoopid" had a
hook-laden grandeur that was smashing; it even survived a thorough trashing
from guest guitarist <PERSON>Joe Satriani</PERSON>. Cooper endures because his music does the
same, and he and it made his performance a pleasure.;    A tired Judas Priest;
   <ORGANIZATION>Judas Priest</ORGANIZATION> has endured, as well. But not, as it were, well.;    Vocalist
<PERSON>Rob Halford</PERSON> came onstage on his <PERSON>Harley</PERSON>, the way he usually does. And K. K.
Downing and <PERSON>Glenn Tipton</PERSON> provided the fleeting and screaming guitar licks that
have provided <LOCATION>Priest</LOCATION>'s punch over its long career. And with its high-tech set
and glaring and arcing spotlights and explosions and the rest, Priest did give
the crowd its money's worth.;    But the group seemed archaic and tired, as if
it had done one tour too many along the line. Even newer songs like "A Touch
of Evil" and the title cut from its most recent album, "Painkiller," sounded
like the Priest was playing on the sound of its past instead of trying
anything fresh.;    But then metal has never had much to do with such things.
It's about street-warrior poses and the same old licks and a "rebellious"
attitude that is oddly conservative in its conformity. In modest doses, its
various idiocies can be enjoyable and charming in their way.;    But seven
hours of it at one sitting was too much of a bad thing.  </TEXT>

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Film: An Old Man's Travels in His Memory
   ----
   By Julie Salamon
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11
</SO>
<LP>
   Every once in a while a movie feels as if it's come out of
your own dreams -- even if nothing in it remotely resembles
the details of your real life or your fantasy life. "Night of
the Shooting Stars," for example, was such a film for me,
though nothing in my memory resembled the movie's surreal
story of Tuscan peasants fleeing their village in the final
days of World War II.
   "Toto Le Heros," a mesmerizing new Belgian film,
deliberately sets out to be a movie of dreams. It's the story
of an old man's determination to figure out what his life has
been -- if it's been anything at all -- before he dies. The
life has been depressing, but director Jaco Van Dormael turns
the old man's journey through memory and fantasy into a
startling, buoyant adventure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Van Dormael</PERSON>, directing a full-length feature for the
first time here, performed as a clown for <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s Big
Flying Circus before he turned to film. That makes perfect
sense. "Toto" has the spirit of a great circus -- exciting
and delightful yet sad and dangerous as well.
   <PERSON>Michel Bouquet</PERSON> is intense and perfectly unsentimental
playing "Toto" as a cranky old man who's been deposited in a
nursing home. His real name is <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, but he thinks of
himself, secretly, as Toto, an action hero modeled on a
television hero. He dreams of rebellion. When a nurse dumps
pills in a cup for him he fantasizes about grabbing her and
stuffing a whole bottle of the pills down her throat.
   But mainly he's obsessed with murdering someone named
<PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>. "I'll kill you, I'll kill you Alfred" are the first
words he utters in the film.
   He's convinced that <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> stole his life, that he and
<PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> were switched at birth in a hospital fire, and that he
should have lived the charmed life he's sure <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>'s been
living. Like everything in <LOCATION>Thomas</LOCATION>'s imagination, that fire is
vividly presented on screen, a nightmarish vision of a
nursery on fire. And even though <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> believes that fire
was real, he's also convinced his life was a bore. "Nothing
ever happened is this guy's story," he says.
   His life as a child, however, was fantastic, the way <PERSON>Mr.
Van Dormael</PERSON> shows it, as a playful fable told from the point
of view of a little boy with a lively mind. Young <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>
remembers his parents telling him he fell from the sky and
was found by his parents, a cheery couple who have the bouncy
pep and humor of a '60s sitcom mom and dad.
   Dad, an airplane pilot, does magic tricks for his kids and
sings them funny songs. That memory is staged like an antic
bit from a <ORGANIZATION>Vincente Minelli</ORGANIZATION> musical. Dad sings "The Singing
Fool" (with the lyric "Boom] The sun goes boom]") while
bright tulips sway to the beat on the front lawn.
   That glorious vision wasn't entirely accurate, even in the
golden period of Thomas's youth. Not everything was perfect.
Thomas's little brother had Down's syndrome, but was
good-natured even when neighborhood kids tormented him.
Thomas had to endure the ridicule of his next-door neighbor
<PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>, the smug rich boy who <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> believed was living with
the wrong parents. Still, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s older sister, was
perfection, the exquisite object of a little boy's vaguely
incestuous adoration. When <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> begins to flirt with <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> finds new, urgent reasons to hate the boy next door.
   The scenes between <PERSON>Thomas Godet</PERSON>, the actor playing little
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Sandrine Blancke</PERSON> as <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> are exquisite. He
worships her. You can see it in the way he looks at her, even
before he informs her that the Egyptian queen <PERSON>Nefertiti</PERSON>
married her brother. Skinny little <PERSON>Ms. Blancke</PERSON> has a
remarkable presence. You understand why <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> gets so
shivery when she climbs into bed with him and casually asks
him if he likes her hands, her feet, her legs.
   Still, things were pretty ideal until they went "boom."
Thomas's father was killed flying goods across the English
Channel for <ORGANIZATION>Alfred</ORGANIZATION>'s father. When the film moves into the
middle years of <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s memory, the brightness is gone. He's
become a drab bureaucrat, played with acute misery by <ORGANIZATION>Jo De
Backer</ORGANIZATION>.
   Thomas has never stopped being obsessed by his sister and
has never been able to replace the warm goofiness of his
childhood home. One day he sees a woman who resembles his
sister and he follows her. For a time he's brought back to
life, only to find that she's married to his old neighbor,
<PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mr. Van Dormael</PERSON>, who also wrote the screenplay, skips
around time, as he sifts through <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s memory, as <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>
tries to understand his lifelong feud with <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>. The scenes
from <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>'s childhood seem to take place in the '60s,
judging by artifacts like cars and television sets. That puts
the "contemporary" scenes of Thomas as an old man somewhere
in the future. The movie feels timeless, the way memory does,
picking an instance from one era to make a connection with
something that may have happened a dozen years later. There's
no fake, insulting uplift in this story of missed
opportunities and lost lives. But when you walk out of the
theater you'll feel just wonderful.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: <PERSON>John Boorman</PERSON> beautifully mingled nostalgia with
horror in "Hope and Glory," his picture about his boyhood
experiences during the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> blitz. Though it's quite
different from "Toto Le Heros" in style and story, its spirit
seems strangely similar to that of the <ORGANIZATION>Van Dormael</ORGANIZATION> film.

<HEAD>The Kind of Cooperative Victorian Women Could Have Used</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the J-K volume of a recent
<ORGANIZATION>Encyclopedia Brittanica</ORGANIZATION>, the writer <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON> has a six-column
entry. His sister, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, is given no mention at all.
   The 19th-century diarist never succeeded in establishing herself
as a talent, which seemed a literary crime to the small group of men
and women who founded a writers' collective in her name.
   <PERSON>Alice James Books</PERSON>, an independent press that emphasizes women's
work, was conceived in <DATE>1972</DATE> as a strike against not only Victorian
mores, but also against the male-dominated reading lists most
college freshmen were studying in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   ``At the time, the people who sat in the important chairs at the
publishing houses were men,'' said <PERSON>Marjorie Fletcher</PERSON>, a poet and
co-founder. ``It was far easier to get a book on baseball into print
than one by a woman or about women's issues.''
   The collective publishes about 2,100 copies each of two books of
poetry every <DATE>summer</DATE> and <DATE>spring</DATE>. Its authors vary in age, race and
lifestyle, but they all share in the ideals from which the
non-profit enterprise grew.
   When <PERSON>Alice James</PERSON> writers agree to join the cooperative, they
agree to nurture their colleagues as well as their own work.
   So far about 70 authors have made the two-year commitment, during
which they guide their own book into print. Three have received
<PERSON>Beatrice Hawley Awards</PERSON>, a grant named after the poet that allows
poets outside of <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> to publish.
   <PERSON>Rosamond Rosenmeier</PERSON> is just wrapping up work on her first
collection, ``Lines Out,'' which appears this <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   ``The experience is extraordinary,'' says <PERSON>Rosenmeier</PERSON>, a writing
professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   With the help of a ``buddy,'' a veteran collective member who's
already been through the process, she has taken her book from pen
and paper to its final production stages.
   ``It's definitely my book,'' <PERSON>Rosenmeier</PERSON> said. ``I've had a hand
in everything: choosing the print, negotiating with the typesetter,
picking the cover design. We even did the paste-up.''
   That participation and the support collective members lend one
another are part of the philosophy inspired by <PERSON>Alice James</PERSON>, who
struggled in the shadow of her five brothers, including <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> and
<PERSON>William</PERSON>, a prominent psychologist.
   <PERSON>Henry James</PERSON>, the author of such works as ``Portrait of a Lady''
and ``The Ambassadors,'' was so unsettled by his sister's diaries,
which he considered an invasion of privacy, that he burned his copy,
according to biographers..
   ``She was a talented woman who never had a chance to develop,''
<PERSON>Fletcher</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Alice James</PERSON>, who died at the age of 43.
   Today, <PERSON>Fletcher</PERSON> says, it's a whole new ballgame. Women have
gained widespread acceptance, so much so that the collective has
begun casting its net wider and more actively soliciting minority
writers.
   Inclusion is the idea.
   Rosenmeier chuckles to think of the group's regular <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
afternoon meetings. ``We're all so different,'' she says. About a
dozen writers from all walks of life gather at one member's home,
bringing with them plenty of pasta salad, fruit, cheese and wine.
   Fletcher says it's funny to watch everyone file in when the
meeting convenes.
   ``Everybody finds a chair that somehow issues from her
personality. Some sit on the floor, the clubby people sit on the
couch. I sit on a chair,'' she says.
   The business of running and promoting <PERSON>Alice James</PERSON> is always high
on the meeting's agenda. The authors take no salary, but revenue
from limited sales through catalogs, book fairs and a few stores is
far from enough to sustain the collective's budget.
   The press relies in large part on state, federal and private
grants, which <PERSON>Fletcher</PERSON> said have dwindled steadily, particularly
under the strain of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>' current fiscal crisis.
   But <PERSON>Jenney Milner</PERSON>, a part-time office manager and the only paid
employee, said the gatherings inevitably swerve from the pragmatic
to a free-for-all.
   ``That's when they get interesting,'' she said, ``when we talk
about the philosophy of the press.''
   And, adds <PERSON>Fletcher</PERSON>, ``The vagaries of the commercial world or
damned luck can't change our commitment to empowerment, to fairness,
to our philosophy.''

college and then to law school, and now works in a Washington firm. She earns
good, not great, money and it's too soon to tell if she'll make partner. She
is 5 feet 6 inches tall and attractive -- at least I think so. Her name is
Alice, and several times a year she is called upon to celebrate what she
considers to be her relative failure.;   What does she mean by that? It's
this. You may have noticed from the description above that Alice is not
married. She has no children either. She is 30 (did I tell you that?); not
old, but neither is it young. It is slowly dawning on Alice that she may never
marry.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ALICE IN SINGLEHOOD: WHEN IS HER TURN, SHE WONDERS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cohen is a columnist for the Washington Post.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Alice is not yet panicked. Anyway, she has a plan. If she is not married
by, say, 35, she will adopt a child. But even before that, she intends to
register at various department stores. She will stipulate her choice in
silverware and china and -- why not? -- linens as well. She will tell her
friends where she is registered, and then she will invite them all to mark
with her the passage of that 35th year, when, she feels, she will pass
irrevocably into singlehood. Why should only married people get to have all
the gifts?;   It sometimes seems to <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> that her life is a wearying round of
parties and weddings, showers and more parties. She is asked to celebrate what
she is coming to see as reminders of her own failure: the engagements,
weddings and babies of others. Each invitation is like a flunking report card.
Alice has a nightmare. She is on a treadmill, loaded with gifts from <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany's</ORGANIZATION>
and Baccarat, price tags trailing behind her, trudging from one party to
another against a stiff wind, getting no closer to her goal.;   <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION> operates
on her own fiscal year of <DATE>September</DATE> to <DATE>September</DATE>. This has been an expensive
year. Alice has bought a crystal bourbon decanter from <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany's</ORGANIZATION>. She has
bought a sandbox kit for a child's birthday. She has bought ceramic bookends,
a nightgown, a silver casserole set, some flatware, a crystal bowl, two
crystal wine coasters and some china -- a plate, a bowl and a cup. She lists
these items, always citing the manufacturer and approximate price. Alice
thinks she spent about <MONEY>$600</MONEY> on such gifts. It's a bit of change.;   But the
money is the least of her complaints, although it's not unimportant. Instead,
she resents the effort that she expends on people who, it seems to her, are
already blessed. Why should the single be called on to celebrate the married?
Why should the childless have to buy gifts for the people with children? Why
do the unfortunate have to celebrate the good fortune of the fortunate? This
is what's bothering <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>. When, oh when, will her turn come?;   How did this
happen? Alice doesn't really know. There were guys, some close calls, an
engagement made or nearly made or maybe one broken. Alice kept exercising
choice -- not just bumper sticker "choice" about abortion, but other choices
as well. She chose this college and that graduate school and this career and
that guy and this city and then another guy and then another career and then.
. . . And then, somehow, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> ran out of choices.;   <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION> is out shopping
right now. She is shopping a lot of the time. When she is not actually
shopping, she is thinking about it. She plans her gifts. She cares about what
she will give. When she sees something in a store, she makes a note of it. She
started doing this kind of thing years ago. She assumed, without actually
thinking it out, that when her time came, people would buy gifts for her just
as carefully. Reciprocity, she thought. She hoped. So far, though, nothing has
come back.;   A colleague is pregnant. Alice, come to the party. A friend is
getting married. Alice, here's your invitation. Alice's college roommate has
given birth, her second. Alice, can you come to the party -- at their <DATE>summer</DATE>
home on the dunes? Children have birthdays and the divorced remarry and the
single get hitched. The invitations arrive like Scuds, tiny thuds that build
in intensity as the years go by. Before one hits real close, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is going to
announce her own celebration and register for her stuff.;   <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION> is my
invention. She did not go to college or to law school and does not now
practice law -- trademark infringement, actually. She is not single and
childless and she did not spend <MONEY>$27.10</MONEY> on a monogrammed sandbox kit for a
child that someone else had. Alice, my invention, does not exist. If she did,
she'd break your heart.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  DANCE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ALONZO King doesn't abide much by bourgeois affectations such as costumes and
sets for his chamber ballet, Lines Dance Company.;    Its spring season at the
Cowell Theater was as austere as it could be: four abstract works in
more-or-less flesh-colored unitards, assisted only by Wendy W. Gilmore's
delicate lighting.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  KING OF SUBTLETY
LINES DOES FINE WITH GREAT MUSIC, DANCE;
'ADVENTURES OF ALICE' OFF TO A GOOD START  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Dance Reviews  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     King is a talented maverick who does what he wants, his way, without paying
much attention to the questions of marketing and audience appeal that bedevil
most arts organizations. So what if all my pieces look alike? he seems to
shrug. They're not.;    The subtle distinctions between them are organic,
coming directly out of the music, which is invariably ambitious, unusual and
sophisticated. This program featured off-the-beaten-track <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>; <PERSON>Donald
Fontowitz</PERSON>, a frequent collaborator; and <PERSON>Charles Valentin Alkan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Sofia
Gubaidulina</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bohuslav Martinu</PERSON> -- not exactly household names but all makers
of wondrous music.;    "Without Wax" (<DATE>1990</DATE>), made for BalletMet of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, is a very special work, and its title says a great deal about King. It
comes from a custom in Roman times, when sculptors signed their work "sine
cereus" to show that no artificial smootheners were used to disguise nicks,
flaws and cracks. It's an indication of integrity, though it may leave the art
looking grainy or rough-hewn.;    So with the piece. King's company has strong
women and weak men, but he presents all proudly: These are his dancers; take
them for all in all.;    Much of it is danced to silence, which demands great
ensemble awareness and instinct; the silvery, thin, celestial streaks of
"Rejoice for Violin and Cello" by <ORGANIZATION>Gubaidulina</ORGANIZATION>, a contemporary Soviet composer,
are less musical background than evocative sound effects. There's an
invocation for men, a response for the women, a finale for all; and at the
center, a sumptuous pas de deux for <PERSON>Summer Lee Rhatigan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gregory Dawson</PERSON>,
set to a heart-breaking score by <PERSON>Martinu</PERSON> (1890-1952).;    The program also
included revivals of "Toccata in D minor" (<DATE>1990</DATE>), the duet from "Alkan"
(<DATE>1989</DATE>), by far the best section of <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s one-act homage to the eccentric
French pianist and composer (1813-88); and "Awake in the Dream," made for
<LOCATION>Sacramento Ballet</LOCATION> in <DATE>1988.</DATE>;    The last is a post-apocalyptic dreamscape for a
single woman in blue (<ORGANIZATION>Katherine Warner</ORGANIZATION>) and a heartless group who turn on her.
King seems determined not to give us any clues about the internal narrative,
and the ballet's edge of menace is somewhat dulled by his elliptical
story-telling.;    <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Balletland</LOCATION>; "The Adventures of Alice," the
ambitious new <DATE>spring</DATE> production of <ORGANIZATION>San Jose Dance Theater</ORGANIZATION>, is the start of a
wonderful children's ballet. Only the start, mind you, but a good healthy
one.;    This immense work -- 120 dancers, 160 costumes, seven flexible
set-pieces called periaktoi (their origin is in Hellenic theater), lights and
fog, a commissioned score for 11 instrumentalists, vocal quartet and
electronics -- was put together in just three months. This in itself is a
miracle. Getting the bugs out can be left for next year, for the company would
like to make "Alice" an annual event, on the order of "Nutcracker.";    More
words;  Right now, it badly needs a libretto, and probably a voiceover
narrator. What has been created by choreographer <PERSON>Jody White</PERSON>, a dance teacher
from <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Marin County</LOCATION>, is not so much "The Adventures of Alice" as
"Episodes From 'Alice.' " There are a few scenes and characters from "Alice in
<LOCATION>Wonderland</LOCATION>," but the bulk of the ballet is taken from the less familiar
"Through the Looking-Glass.";    I would be tempted to scrub the "Alice"
sections entirely and expand the piece into a "Looking-Glass" ballet, except
the noble polonaise for the <ORGANIZATION>Gryphon</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Mock Turtle</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is very
beautiful and, moreover, the high point of composer <PERSON>Henry Mollicone</PERSON>'s charming
score.;    In rehearsal, to help the dancers (<PERSON>Jennifer Larsen</PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION>Gryphon</ORGANIZATION>
and <PERSON>Griffin Dong</PERSON> as the Mock Turtle) establish the proper mood, White was
inspired to say, "Think of the <ORGANIZATION>Gryphon</ORGANIZATION> as an endangered species." They caught
on immediately, and the dance is fragile and wistful, steps from a bygone
era.;    White's most effective device is to have <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> (15-year-old <PERSON>Sharon
Wehner</PERSON>) end the ballet by leaving the stage and opening one of the exit doors
of the house, where golden sunlight streams in, returning her to reality.;   
Other good episodes are "Jabberwocky," featuring <PERSON>David Roxander</PERSON>, White's son,
a former principal dancer with the <ORGANIZATION>National Ballet of Canada</ORGANIZATION>, as the <PERSON>Beamish</PERSON>
Boy; the war of the chess pieces, accomplished by strobe lights and the
harmless but showy explosions of flash pots; and the Queen of Hearts' garden,
where the white roses are painted red by the gardening staff.;    On the down
side, there are a lot of terrific costumes wasted on characters who barely
appear, such as the Mad Hatter, the <DATE>March Hare</DATE> and the Dormouse. And the
senior dancers of the company dribble by in a floral episode that has nothing
to do with the story.;    When I saw the piece at dress rehearsal, it was
severely overcast by machine-made fog, and the lights, by <PERSON>Brad Belleville</PERSON>,
were prosaic. Some of these problems may have been corrected for the
performances; if not, there's always next year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     A young <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> matron, unhappy with her pampered but sterile life, finds
escape by realizing her childhood dreams of  helping the poor a la Mother
Teresa.;    Catholicism -- its institutions, rituals and unique moral and
ethical world view -- has long fascinated filmmakers, both of and outside the
faith, and it seems to be everywhere on screen lately.;    Its presence is
nowhere so pronounced as in "The Godfather Part III," in which <PERSON>Michael
Corleone</PERSON> enlists the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> in his final maneuver to make the family business
legitimate -- and unexpectedly finds in the sacrament of confession some
measure of personal redemption.;    From the start, the church has always
figured in the "Godfather" saga -- think of all the weddings, baptisms and
other ceremonies <PERSON>Francis Ford Coppola</PERSON> has used as set pieces. In this third
installment, <PERSON>Coppola</PERSON> has made it a major player in the <PERSON>Corleone</PERSON> family's
fortunes.;    The film depicts the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> at its best and
worst. A principal villain is a corrupt <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> treasurer, who proves to be no
more trustworthy than any of the mob figures <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> has dispatched over the
years.;    On the advice of an old Sicilian mentor, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> approaches a
friendlier power broker, <ORGANIZATION>Cardinal Lamberto</ORGANIZATION>. But Lamberto sincerely cares about
<PERSON>Michael</PERSON>'s soul, and the price he exacts for his cooperation is <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>'s
confession.;    <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> initially demurs. He can confess, he tells Lamberto,
but he cannot repent.;    But the cardinal gently insists, and reluctantly
<PERSON>Michael</PERSON> sketches out a lifetime of cold-blooded murder capped by the
"Godfather II"-closing assassination of his own brother.;    As he actually
speaks the unspeakable, however, something happens: In one of <PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON>'s most
powerful performances in the film, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> breaks down. It's an unforgettable
scene that is also as eloquent an endorsement of the faith as has been seen on
the big screen.;    Salvation of another sort is the carrot that lures <PERSON>Winona
Ryder</PERSON>, as <ORGANIZATION>Cher</ORGANIZATION>'s adolescent daughter <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, to Catholicism in "Mermaids."
Cher's character, <PERSON>Rachel Flax</PERSON>, is a gypsy soul whose obvious love for her two
daughters doesn't quite compensate for her inability to handle the commitment
required to maintain a stable home or even cook a normal meal.;    <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>
may not know what she's looking for, but she's certain it isn't her mom's
endless parade of lovers and annoying habit of moving to a new town whenever a
love affair ends.;    Out of some conviction that the sins of the mother can
be expiated by the daughter, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> turns to Catholicism, a religion imbued
with the kind of discipline so lacking in her home life. She sets up shrines
in her bedroom, dreams of becoming a nun (one way of avoiding the kind of
messy situations her mother's love life creates) and, when her own nascent
sexuality rears its bothersome head, consults religious tracts for advice.;   
There's plenty of comedy to be mined from the spectacle of a pretty young
Jewish girl trying desperately to solve her problems by wearing black dresses
and clunky shoes and quoting the saints -- and director <PERSON>Richard Benjamin</PERSON>
doesn't let any opportunity go by.;    In the end, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>'s Catholicism is
only an adolescent passion; she embraces and outgrows it much the way other
kids go through a heavy metal or punk phase. Small wonder her mother never
worries about it too much: It's a lot less noisy than rock 'n' roll.;    In
<PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>'s "Alice," <PERSON>Mia Farrow</PERSON> plays a good Catholic girl who has lost her
way in the material world of the '80s. She has everything money can buy but is
poor in the intangibles that really matter. Under the ministrations of a
Chinese herbalist (played by <PERSON>Keye Luke</PERSON>), she cuts through the pretenses that
have been cushioning her pain and finds in herself the idealist who once
wanted only to do good for others.;    <ORGANIZATION>Farrow</ORGANIZATION>'s Catholicism, however, is like
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s Judaism: Its main attribute is a persistent sense of guilt that keeps
her loyal to her faithless and patronizing husband. You don't see her hanging
around churches or going to a priest with her problems. At first, she doesn't
even realize she has them, and it's the forthright Chinese herbalist who acts
as her father confessor.;    <ORGANIZATION>Allen</ORGANIZATION> isn't really out to paint a full-blown
portrait of a Catholic woman. Alice's faith is a manifestation of her basic
goodness: The point is to show up the people that surround her as selfish,
uncaring jerks.;    Ultimately, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s story is that of a woman who takes off
her rose-colored glasses and learns to look for answers, not in any
pre-fabricated social or religious framework, but within herself.;    <ORGANIZATION>The
Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> has long been a presence in films from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, which is not
surprising, since the histories of the continent and the church are
inseparable.;    Over the years, there have been Catholic-themed comedies
("Nuns on the Run" and a remake of "We're No Angels" recently), murder
mysteries ("True Confessions") and horror films ("The Exorcist" and its
sequels).;    There are many reasons why the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> pops up in so
many films: the rich visual imagery of Catholicism, its lush liturgical music,
its history and rituals lend a majesty that is lacking in contemporary
American life.;    It's a faith that has weathered drastic social change with
minimal change outside the abandonment of the Latin mass and permitting the
consumption of meat on Fridays.;    <PERSON>Like Judaism</PERSON>, Catholicism is a religion
that people can't get away from, even those who give it up (ever hear of a
lapsed Protestant?) -- and that makes it almost an ethnicity.;    All of this
is fine fare for filmmaking. There's a metaphor for almost everything in
Catholicism, and a faith this grounded in tradition provides a fine framework
for almost any consideration of our secular society. There may be a shortage
of priests, but, in movies, Catholicism is thriving.  </TEXT>

<P>
<PERSON>Craig Lucas</PERSON>' black comedy "Reckless" has found the right director. Pope 
<PERSON>Freeman</PERSON>'s intense multilayered production at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Barbara City College</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Studio Theater is reminiscent of Antonin Artaud's "theater of cruelty." And it 
corroborates <PERSON>Jerzy Grotowski</PERSON>'s theory that the content of theater should be 
"myths of the blood" rather than fictions bearing on social life and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The plot has <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON>, a sort of <ORGANIZATION>20th-Century Alice</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wonderland</LOCATION>, catapulted 
through a series of events that ostensibly have to do with social life and 
behavior -- but which may be fantasy, dream, memory or all three. Catapulted is 
not a strong enough image; if <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> fell down the rabbit hole, <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> is a cat 
being dragged through a knothole. 
</P>
<P>
It starts on <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Eve</ORGANIZATION>. Rachel is a normal, if slightly hysterical, wife in 
her own home, happily stuffing Christmas stockings for her children, chatting 
to her husband who suddenly informs her that he has taken out a contract on her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to a roadside telephone booth in the snow. Rachel, in robe and slippers, 
gets a ride with a stranger, <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>, who takes her home to live with him and his 
deaf paraplegic girlfriend (who isn't really deaf and who may be his mother). 
Rachel changes her name, gets a job and life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
On the next <PERSON>Christmas Eve</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON>'s husband arrives at the door with a bottle 
of champagne. Within minutes, he and the paraplegic girlfriend (who is clad in 
reindeer horns and a fake red nose) die a horrible death by poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> (comatose and wearing a <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> suit), who are back 
in the car running away to a new life, where they will change their names 
again. Lloyd will refuse to take off the <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> suit or stop drinking 
champagne until the next <DATE>Christmas</DATE>, when he dies too. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel is on the road again, and we follow her through several more bizarre 
Christmases, interspersed with scenes in which she tries to explain to various 
obtuse psychiatrists what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is that it could all be true. <PERSON>Freeman</PERSON> has directed the actors 
to play it straight, as if it were true. This somehow creates a chilling effect 
that activates a seldom used section of our funny bone: We find ourselves 
laughing hysterically when <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> finally keels over in his <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> suit; 
then we feel embarrassed when we realize that we are laughing at his death. But 
before we can buffer that, we are whisked off to the next incredible event. 
Nothing comes to rest in itself. Every event calls forth a new horror clothed 
in everyday dress. 
</P>
<P>
The issues become life, death, sanity, recurrence, betrayal, recognition, 
salvation . . . the list is unfinished but it leads further away from mere 
social life and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The mise-en-scene deserves a paragraph -- the stage is a claustrophobic jumble 
of all the scenery and props needed for 20 scenes. Thus as two characters sit 
on the double bed, they are inches from the red automobile they will drive in 
the next scene. Two hanging video screens record some of the action. The effect 
is disturbing, disorienting, dreamlike and wholly effective. <ORGANIZATION>Douglas Tal

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James and <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON>, the names of British kings
and queens, were the most popular names for babies born in <DATE>1989</DATE>,
according to the social editor of the Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> newspaper.
   Of the 2,780 boys whose births were announced in the newspaper
last year, 392 had <PERSON>James</PERSON> as one of their names, 120 ahead of the
runner-up, <LOCATION>William</LOCATION>, said social editor <PERSON>Helen Beard</PERSON>.
   Of the 2,645 birth announcements for girls, 254 had <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>
among their names, 106 ahead of the second most popular choice,
<LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, she said.
   Of the first names chosen, <PERSON>James</PERSON> was also the most popular for
boys, as it has been every year since <DATE>1964</DATE>, <PERSON>Ms. Beard</PERSON> wrote in her
annual letter to the editor outlining parents' selections. James
was followed by <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON>, <PERSON>William</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Edward</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Oliver</PERSON>, <PERSON>George</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Henry</ORGANIZATION>.
   Elizabeth was only the 10th most popular choice as a first name
for girls, the newspaper reported. Charlotte was the top choice, a
position acquired in <DATE>1983</DATE> but surrendered to <LOCATION>Emma</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> in <DATE>1987</DATE>
and <DATE>1988</DATE> respectively.
   Charlotte was followed by <PERSON>Emily</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sophie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Emma</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Olivia</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON>, <PERSON>Katherine</PERSON>, Lucy and then <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has had two queens named <LOCATION>Elizabeth</LOCATION>, including the
current monarch, <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, and two <LOCATION>King James</LOCATION>. William, <LOCATION>Edward</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Charles</PERSON>, <PERSON>George</PERSON>, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexandra</PERSON> are also
names associated with the royal family past and present.

<LEADPARA>  AS THE Labor Day Weekend rolls through and the summer rock season rolls out,
the receipts have been tabulated and the winners are: the Grateful Dead, the
Lollapalooza tour and rap/dance music in general.;   But the big news was the
losers, which included just about everyone else.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The old geezers in the Dead topped the national mid-year revenue totals
with <MONEY>$22.6 million</MONEY>. Dominating the local concert scene, the 21-city, nine-act
Lollapalooza tour -- headlined by <PERSON>Jane</PERSON>'s Addiction -- and the <ORGANIZATION>KMEL Summer</ORGANIZATION> Jam
rap/dance spectacular sold out two shows apiece at Mountain View's Shoreline
Amphitheatre.;   But these few successes were eclipsed by the stunning decline
in the business itself. The Fresno-based concert business publication Pollstar
listed mid-year revenues for the Top 100 shows at <MONEY>$76 million</MONEY>, down by <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> from the record <MONEY>$110 million</MONEY> of 1990.;   One of the most highly touted
tours at the start of the pop <DATE>summer</DATE> season was one that included the <ORGANIZATION>Sisters
of Mercy</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Public Enemy</ORGANIZATION> and Gang of Four. But when the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> leg of that
tour was canceled because of poor ticket sales, its title, "The Tune In, Turn
On, Burn Out Tour," came to symbolize the state of the rock concert business.
In <DATE>1991</DATE>, the fans did tune in and turn on, but they didn't turn out in the
record-smashing numbers of the past.;   Other touring "festivals" of the
season didn't fare much better. Operation Rock And Roll (Judas Priest, <PERSON>Alice
Cooper</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Motorhead</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Metal Church</ORGANIZATION> and Dangerous Toys) drew barely 5,500 fans to
the 20,000-seat Shoreline Amphitheatre in <DATE>July</DATE> (in <DATE>1990</DATE>, <LOCATION>Judas Priest</LOCATION> drew
13,000 fans to a show in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>) and did the same poor business in other
parts of the country. And the nostalgia-infused Gathering of the Tribes II,
with nine acts including <ORGANIZATION>Fishbone</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Primus</LOCATION>, drew 7,000 to <LOCATION>Shoreline</LOCATION>; its
tour was canceled after three shows.;   <PERSON>David Lee Roth</PERSON>, who had sold out the
<ORGANIZATION>Cow Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Daly City</LOCATION> in past years, was forced to cancel his <DATE>summer</DATE> tour
because of disappointing ticket receipts.;   And while the Guns N' Roses tour
has done well in many venues (the group sold out its two-night stand at
<LOCATION>Shoreline</LOCATION>), it hasn't done sellout business in several of the cities where two
shows were scheduled -- a major disappointment given the group's stature in
the scene.;   <ORGANIZATION>Pollstar</ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON>Gary Bongiovanni</PERSON> cites several factors in the
poor showing of various tours and venues: the recession; competition from
other forms of entertainment; and a continuing trend of escalating ticket
prices.;   "This is the first time that a recession has adversely affected the
business," he says. "And with fewer entertainment dollars out there, these
shows have had to compete with movies like 'Terminator 2' and with places like
<LOCATION>Great America</LOCATION> and with activities like going to the beach. It's been a rough
year.";   He also notes that for the first time the business has seen
"resistance on the part of the fans to escalating prices" of tickets, which
have gone up <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1990.</DATE>;   <LOCATION>The Bay Area</LOCATION> has suffered a decline in
business (although it hasn't been affected as much as other parts of the
country, particularly the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>).;   Promoter <PERSON>Bill Graham</PERSON>,
whose <PERSON>Bill Graham</PERSON> Presents books <PERSON>Shoreline Amphitheatre</PERSON>, said business at that
venue was off approximately <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> so far this year. "But
while our business hasn't been as good as in previous years it wasn't that
bad. We're like a baseball player who usually hits .400 and is now hitting
.350 this season.";   While <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> also blames the recession, he said there
haven't been as many shows on the touring circuit. "In <DATE>1990</DATE> we did 58 shows at
Shoreline," he said, "but this year we did 45.";   Given the decline in the
concert business, many groups were reluctant to tour during the usually prime
<DATE>summer</DATE> season. Acts such as Queen and R.E.M. released new records (R.E.M.'s
"Out of Time" was No. 1 on the charts at one point) but declined to tour. And
acts such as Dire Straits and New Kids on the Block postponed tours they had
initially scheduled for the <DATE>summer</DATE> because of the dreary commercial climate.; 
 The absence of the stadium tours by the usual blockbuster names was also
partly to blame for the season's poor showing. In past years, seasonal
revenues have been bolstered by the stadium tours of such acts as U2, <PERSON>Bruce
Springsteen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul McCartney</PERSON>. But this season the only consistent stadium
draw was the Grateful Dead, which averaged approximately 47,000 tickets per
show. (Those bewhiskered galoots of ZZ Top, who had the second-highest
grossing tour at mid-year with revenues of <MONEY>$18.5 million</MONEY>, did divert from
their arena tour to play a sold-out show at <LOCATION>Spartan Stadium</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> <DATE>Aug.
10</DATE>.);   But if the blockbuster acts haven't been present in this <DATE>summer</DATE> pop
season, blockbuster ticket prices have. <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> says the responsibility for
that resides with the artists.;   "One of the misconceptions on the part of
the fans," <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> says, "is that it is the promoter who establishes the prices
of tickets. But those are predicated by the amount that the acts are charging.
If an act decides to charge, hypothetically, <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> (to perform), I have to
adjust what we are charging for tickets. Any time that an act is willing to
play for less, I will charge less.";   Is he saying the acts are greedy?;  
"When it comes to the ticket prices," <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> said, "the superstars could care
less" about the fans.;   But with fans resisting those prices, <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> thinks
there could be an upside to all of this. "I think the poor showings of these
tours might force them to rethink what they will charge.";   A few of the
tours, such as the one that came with Damn Yankees and Bad Company, lowered
their ticket prices and, Pollstar reports, ended up making as much money as
other tours while performing to vastly greater numbers of fans. And with one
of the primary roles of tours being record promotion, that arguably translates
to wiser  career enhancement. (But even that did not work out for <ORGANIZATION>Roth</ORGANIZATION>, who
lowered the ticket prices to <MONEY>$9</MONEY> for lawn seats at his various "shed" shows.); 
 "It's been a wacky year," <PERSON>Bongiovanni</PERSON> says. "But the business is cyclical and
it looks as if the latter part of the year and the next year should improve.";
  At this point, demand for tickets for a tour by the consistently
best-selling Van <PERSON>Halen</PERSON> (which comes to the <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> <DATE>Sept. 13-14</DATE>) has been
relatively heavy. And other acts that are set to begin tours include <PERSON>Tom
Petty</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Prince</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Paula Abdul</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Luther Vandross</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bob Seger</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Metallica</ORGANIZATION>. And
there is speculation that U2 and <PERSON>Springsteen</PERSON> could be touring in <DATE>1992.</DATE>;   But
at the moment, until these heavy-hitters hit the circuit, all the business can
do is tend its wounds and hope that the recession and its woes will go away.

<LEADPARA>  THE love that illuminates "Wildflower," a hauntingly beautiful movie on
cable's Lifetime channel Tuesday at 9 p.m., flows through it like sunlight
through stained glass.;   The tale, set in rural Depression-era Georgia and
directed by actress Diane Keaton, has the timelessness of a parable. It's
almost biblical in its simplicity.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DIANE KEATON'S LATEST STARRING ROLE: DIRECTOR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     <PERSON>Patricia Arquette</PERSON> stars as a beautiful, neglected 17-year-old girl
imprisoned by her wicked stepfather because she is "touched by the devil" --
deaf and epileptic.;   <PERSON>Reese Witherspoon</PERSON> plays 13-year-old <PERSON>Ellie Perkins</PERSON>, a
neighbor who discovers the grimy, half-wild girl locked away in a chicken
coop. She is unwashed, illiterate, and barely capable of speech.;   <PERSON>Ellie</PERSON> and
her 18-year-old brother, <PERSON>Sammy</PERSON> (<PERSON>William McNamara</PERSON>), befriend <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, against the
vehement wishes of their father, <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Beau Bridges</ORGANIZATION>, in a masterly
performance), a widower still locked in his grief.;   They help <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> emerge
from her ignorance and isolation, and when conflict looms with <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s father,
papa <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> is forced out of his own emotional isolation.;   At the same time,
young <PERSON>Sammy</PERSON> realizes that his unsophisticated friend is rapidly becoming a
beautiful woman, and he doesn't quite know what to make of his feelings.;  
<PERSON>Sara Flanigan</PERSON>'s script, based on her books, treats these kinds of love with
great feeling and without a trace of greeting-card sentimentality.;   Here is
the unselfish love of humankind; here is redemptive love; here is familial
love (as well as its cancerous absence); and here, happily and unhappily, is
the love of a man and a woman.;   <ORGANIZATION>Arquette</ORGANIZATION>'s portrayal of a profoundly
hearing-impaired girl is utterly believable. According to production notes,
she researched the role by listening to speech tapes of hearing-impaired
children before and after cochlear implants. She also worked with a speech
therapist, and was coached by a girl who has a hearing loss similar to
<ORGANIZATION>Alice's</ORGANIZATION>.;   "Wildflower" is a superb movie, a fully realized, sophisticated
piece of film-making. But try telling that to its director, and you can
practically hear her blush over the telephone.;   Although the movie is billed
as director <PERSON>Keaton</PERSON>'s first dramatic feature, she demurred at calling
"Wildflower" a movie.;   "I don't see it as a film, I see it as a television
show," she said. "You have to plan the whole movie according to these
breaks.";   To ease the transition shock, <PERSON>Keaton</PERSON> designed thematic "bumpers,"
which show <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s lovely eyes against a background of lush, red wildflowers.;
  She consciously set about saturating the production with green and red
tones.;   "I didn't want to see much blue, because I felt like I wanted to
just sink into this world of green, and being caught up in the woods, and the
romance of that," she said. "I wanted to be hidden under green.";   <PERSON>Keaton</PERSON>,
who has directed a documentary, "Heaven," and episodes of <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>'s "<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> Beach"
and "Twin Peaks," was reluctant to discuss her contribution to the film,
praising her cast and collaborators. "I got lucky on this," she said.;   And
she wants to do more directing.;   "The problem with acting is sitting in a
trailer, and being left to your own devices and thoughts and fantasies and
self-obsessions, and all the things that are terrifying about acting," she
said.;   "With directing it's a different kind of terror. You don't have time
to think about your terror as much. You don't have time to contemplate about
all the horrible accidents of what you're doing.";   "When you're acting, it's
an interior adventure that's about feelings and anticipations. And I kind of
am more afraid of that, in a strange way," she said. "In terms of using my
feelings and my emotional life, I really feel like acting is, in a way,
harder."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  ELDERLY; WOMEN; TRIP; MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT'S the start of a thousand typical movies. A bus with eight women breaks
down in the middle of the woods. Night is falling. There's only a deserted
house for shelter. Is this a chain-saw I see before me?;   But "Strangers in
Good Company" (playing at the Towne, through Thursday) isn't a typical movie.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THERE'S GOOD COMPANY ON THIS WAYWARD BUS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  MOVIES; REVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For one thing, the average age of the stranded passengers is about 70. For
another, the closest thing to violence is the barbecuing of a couple of fish.
And the only scene remotely resembling nudity comes when three of the women
take off their shoes and wade in a pond.;   "Strangers in Good Company" isn't
a horror film, or even a Hollywood movie. It's a Canadian character study of
seven passengers and their young bus driver, who have to flee a wayward bus in
search of aid. Along the way they find themselves, and help each other.;  
There are a few moments of humor, some singing, and practical information on
fixing bus engines with emery boards and catching fish with pantyhose. Mostly
there's talk.;   And talk. And more talk, broken only by periods of
introspection. Those who sat stunned through "The Whales of <DATE>August</DATE>" may have a
strange feeling of deja vu as one old woman after another looks off across a
misty body of water and sighs. Others may want to storm the screen by the end
and help these people fix their bus. Please, somebody -- get them home so we
can go home.;   But if you can slow yourself down to the film's pace, there
are other charms. The movie is full of overlapping dialogue and casually
observed moments. It plays a little like a documentary. And in a way, it is.; 
 Director <PERSON>Cynthia Scott</PERSON> decided to let the women in the film -- all non-actors
-- use their own first names and tell bits of their own stories. The
photographs intercut through their monologues are pictures of them. And
although there was a script, the pains and memories they reveal are theirs,
too.;   Knowing that going into the film makes it more powerful. Seeing it
unprepared, the movie seems a little contrived and politically correct. One
woman (<PERSON>Alice Diablo</PERSON>) is a Mohawk Indian, the bus driver (<PERSON>Michelle Sweeney</PERSON>) is
black, another passenger (<PERSON>Catherine Roche</PERSON>) is a nun. It's a little like the
<ORGANIZATION>Rainbow Coalition</ORGANIZATION> on a day trip.;   But once you realize the fact behind the
fiction, the film begins to work. <PERSON>Beth Webber</PERSON>, who confesses to a frail vanity
about the lines in her neck, really does worry about looking old. <PERSON>Mary Meigs</PERSON>,
who talks of her once-secret life as a lesbian, did come out of the closet at
age 60. These aren't just characters; they're real people, and the movie is an
artful kind of eavesdropping.;   Moreover, the film has a pointed message:
Growing old doesn't mean giving up. These women are involved, political,
funny, bawdy. And although they talk about men, they're not dependent on them.
They're perfectly able to take care of themselves, even in their 80s, even
stranded in the woods.;   "We're alive," they shout at one moment in unison.
"We're alive." And it isn't so much a call for help as it is a simple,
triumphant statement.; Strangers in Good Company; (star)(star)(star); Rated:

'ALICE' A FEMINIST REVUE WITHOUT THE OUTRAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, no! Not another feminist revue, <PERSON>Alice!</PERSON> Please say it isn't so! 
</P>
<P>
That might be one's first reaction to the nomenclature -- "feminist revue" -- 
but "A . . . My Name Is Alice," which opened <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the Old Globe's 
<ORGANIZATION>Cassius Carter Centre Stage</ORGANIZATION>, is more winning than its English primer title. 
</P>
<P>
It has class and a decidedly optimistic (if slightly diffused) point of view, 
delivered by a sum total of 28 savvy contributors (from <PERSON>Amanda McBroom</PERSON> to <PERSON>Steve 
Tesich</PERSON>) and a director who understands the value of restraint (<PERSON>Julianne Boyd</PERSON>). 
</P>
<P>
Boyd and film maker <PERSON>Joan Micklin Silver</PERSON> ("Crossing Delancey") originally 
conceived of "Alice" as a response to the more militant feminist outbursts of 
the angrier <DATE>1960s</DATE>. They took their time to collect their material and pare the 
show down to size, assembling and disassembling this collage of songs and 
scenes, until they had it the way they wanted it. That was <DATE>1983</DATE>. In its present 
form, "Alice" is about many aspects of being female -- good and bad -- in a 
world populated by men and other creatures, all given their due. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't gripe. 
</P>
<P>
Au contraire. Upbeat is the name of this game. If "Alice" can be chided for 
anything, it would be for managing to remain inoffensive. It has its occasional 
cliches (yet another sketch or two set in the confessional of the beauty 
parlor) and its sentimental indulgences (as in a daughter's song to the mother 
she feels she has failed, or the sisters who learn to appreciate one another 
rather late in life). But these are bracketed by enough bracing self-mockery, 
good humor, keen observation and plain fun to serve as appropriate and even 
welcome pace-changers. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the show's success rests with the five performers in charge: the 
quizzical <PERSON>Roo Brown</PERSON>, brash young <PERSON>Rozz Morehead</PERSON>, hip <PERSON>Susan Mosher</PERSON>, elegant 
<PERSON>Michele Pawk</PERSON> and big-voiced and big-hearted <PERSON>Avery Sommers</PERSON>. Each is distinct, 
talented and unstereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
At about two hours with an intermission, the performers riff through "Alice," 
moving with ease from the wistful ("At My Age," wherein an inexperienced 
18-year-old and a widow-of-a-certain-age share counterpoint tribulations about 
the trials of blind dates) to the sly ("I Like the Boys," says <LOCATION>Morehead</LOCATION> in a 
celebration of the gentler, kinder elements in the opposite sex), to the 
out-and-out parodies of a kindergarten teacher-parent conference (<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Pawk</PERSON>) and a macho all-female basketball team ("Good Sports"). 
</P>
<P>
The Act One finale, "Bluer Than You," is an artful lesson in how to top the 
other person at feeling sorry for yourself ("My man called me such terrible 
names . . ." -- "Your Man speaks to you?" or "When I get up in the <TIME>morning</TIME> . . 
. " -- "You can get up in the morning?"). 
</P>
<P>
It goes on like this, with the second half serving up more of the same and 
hitting such familiar locales as a male strip joint ("Pretty Young Men") and 
the inevitable psychiatric clinic ("Honeypot," raised a couple of notches by 
<PERSON>Sommers</PERSON>' joyously sexual performance). Along the way we go through the 
seemingly unrelated but amusing vamping of a German-born French chanteuse 
(<PERSON>Pawk</PERSON>) and <LOCATION>Morehead</LOCATION>'s rousing declaration of independence when she tells her 
decamping boy-friend that parting as enemies beats the dickens out of parting 
as friends. 
</P>
<P>
A delectable leitmotif that repeats throughout the evening is the reading of 
poems by <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> "from my collection, 'For Women Only.' " The poems change, but 
their hilarious awfulness doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Cliff Faulkner</PERSON> has designed a simple platform set, simply lit by <PERSON>John B. 
Forbes</PERSON>. But "Alice" is not about settings or costumes (by <PERSON>Shigeru Yaji</PERSON>). It is 
about lampooning at its merriest and mildest. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice" lacks the outrage satire requires. And even though the show is only six 
years old, its targets are beginning to feel worn. They were predictable to 
start with and have since been hit by others. What this production has going 
for it chiefly is quality -- in the performers and in the distinction of the 
individual sketches. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Alice" is everything that the long-running "Six Women With 
Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know" aspires to be but isn't. You can't 
rise much above written material any more than you can sink too far below it. 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s spontaneous ovation for "Alice" partially at least attests to 
that. A final word of commendation: Musicians <PERSON>James Raitt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gary Scott</PERSON> are 
terrific.

   Alice, the 8-foot boa constrictor, hasn't
been home since <DATE>last weekend</DATE> and neighbors are wondering _ is Alice
getting hungry?
   Alice normally eats once a week and it's been that long since
the male snake's last meal, a rat, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON>Richard
Faulkner</PERSON>.
   ``You know what it's going to do out there. It's going to
grow,'' said <PERSON>Carole Stevens</PERSON>, whose cat is locked inside until Alice
turns up.
   Alice got loose after a friend of its owner took it outside <DATE>last
Saturday</DATE>, police said. The friend fell asleep and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> slithered
away.
   ``I saw these two people outside looking in my trees. I thought
maybe they lost a bird,'' said <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON>, who lives near snake owner
<PERSON>Linda Pyorala</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Country Cousin Mobile Home Village</ORGANIZATION>. When
<PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> learned <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> was missing, she called police.
   Pyorala declined to comment about her missing boa.

<HEAD>Golden Years Dimmed by Abuse for Many Elderly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA METZLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Alice didn't dare wait for the elevator.
   She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years weighing heavy
_ less for the age and a bad hip, more for her 52-year-old son who
was waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street
<PERSON>Alice</PERSON> headed for a neighbor's phone to tell the police her son had
turned abusive again.
   ``You work and support a child all your life,'' she said from
<LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, where she lives. ``Then they act like they hate
you.''
   Alice (not her real name) isn't alone. As many as 2 million
elderly people may be abused, researchers say, often by children,
grandchildren, even great-grandchildren _ the very people they
depend on for care in their old age.
   ``This happens with these blood relatives _ sons, daughters,
nieces, nephews,'' said <PERSON>Dorothy Brodie</PERSON>, a 75-year-old retired
social worker who works with the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Elder Abuse</ORGANIZATION> Support Projsaid <PERSON>Elizabeth
Holtzman</PERSON>, District Attorney of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>,
where elder abuse has risen <PERCENT>400 percent</PERCENT> since <DATE>1986</DATE> to 370 cases
last year. She attributes the increase to abusers' use of crack
cocaine.
   Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported
nationwide, an increase of <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>1987</DATE>, said <PERSON>Toshio
Tatara</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aging Resource Center on Elder
Abuse</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> ``People still find it incredible that we
abuse our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years
ago. And we're doing it like a national pastime.''
   Tatara believes just one in 14 cases is likely to be reported.
   The victim usually is 75 or older, a woman and generally
dependent, the abuser a son or daughter, the congressional report
found.
   Lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> woman whose
daughter kept her in a room so cold the urine in a catheter froze;
a 75-year-old retired nurse from <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> whose 42-year-old
son attacked him with a hatchet; a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> woman whose
<MONEY>$167,000</MONEY> estate was whittled to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> by a son-in-law.
   ``These cases are really difficult and scary even to experienced
social workers,'' said <PERSON>Lucy Friedman</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Victim
Services Agency</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which helped <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> seek a temporary
restraining order against her son.
   ``I was really afraid of him,'' said <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, who bears a scar on
her neck where her son once sliced her. ``Once he gets the wine, he
goes crazy.''
   The abusers many times have their own problems: drug and alcohol
abuse, unemployment, money, mental illness. Violence may be
repayment for abuse a son or daughter received. A cramped house may
spark it; middle-aged children free at last of their own children
may resent the intrusion of a frail parent. In some cases, it's the
stress of caring for an elderly parent.
   Paramedics answering a call in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>San
Fernando</LOCATION> found 77-year-old <PERSON>Virginia Grimes Jeter</PERSON> covered with
excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died <DATE>five hours
later</DATE>.
   The woman's daughter, <PERSON>Cynthia Jeter Green</PERSON>, 39, had promised her
mother not to put her in an old folks' home, said Prosecutor <PERSON>Lee
Harris</PERSON>. A probation report found <PERSON>Ms. Green</PERSON> ``was under a degree of
emotional distress.''
   She pleaded no contest <DATE>April 12</DATE> to elder abuse and was ordered
to begin psychiatric counseling and perform 300 hours of community
service. She did not return several calls requesting an interview.
   ``The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to
put their loved ones in a nursing home or feel they have to be
responsible for total care is fairly common in these cases,'' said
<PERSON>Rosalie Wolf</PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>University Center on Aging</ORGANIZATION>
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Part of the solution is getting seniors to take responsibility
for stopping and even preventing abuse, said <PERSON>Lee Pearson</PERSON>, assistant
manager of criminal justice services for the <ORGANIZATION>American Association
of Retired Persons</ORGANIZATION>.
   The elderly should keep regular appointments and stay in touch
with old friends, especially if they move in with a relative,
<PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> said. They should have someone stop by once a week to make
sure all is well.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Victim Services Agency</ORGANIZATION> offers a 24-hour hotline,
individual and group counseling and help in court, getting locks
changed, and finding shelter, transportation and clothing. In a
<ORGANIZATION>Bronx group called Safe Place</ORGANIZATION>, the elderly hesitantly confide what
has happened to them and try to make sense of it.
   ``People just believe and hope so much that this will be the
last time, things will change, he won't do it again. But they do,''
said <PERSON>Diana Walcott</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Elder Abuse Support
Project</ORGANIZATION> and leader of Safe Place.
   In many cases, the parents blame themselves, <PERSON>Ms. Friedman</PERSON> said.
``They say `Well, how did I bring up this monster?'''
   Forty-two states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> have statutes
requiring reporting of elder abuse, but those involved with the
cases say the nation has a long way to go toward recognizing the
problem.
   The states spend an average <MONEY>$22</MONEY> per abused child, but just <MONEY>$2.90</MONEY>
for each abused older person, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> found. Its report
recommended emergency shelters, tax credits for families caring for
older adults, amendments to Medicare and Medicaid eliminating
limitations on benefits and services to elderly people cared for by
family members at home, and mandatory reporting of abuse.
   ``It's so foreign to our thinking,'' said <PERSON>Ms. Holtzman</PERSON>.
``Doctors won't even ask if abuse has taken place. It's possible
the person, once cured, will be sent back to the same environment,
possibly to be killed.''

POP BEAT / SOUND &amp; VISION: PLAYBOY'S 'HOT ROCKS': NOT-READY-FOR-MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you thought <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> was sexist, brace yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Playboy Channel</ORGANIZATION> has stepped forward with a show that makes MTV look almost 
prudish. It's "Playboy's Hot Rocks" -- a new, hourlong program spotlighting 
uncensored, not-ready-for-MTV music videos, complete with partial or 
full-frontal nudity, as seen usually only over on that naughty continent of 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bee Gees, for example, got plenty of publicity on "Entertainment Tonight" 
recently by feigning surprise that their steamy "Body Guard" video had been 
turned down for airplay on <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION>, VH-1 and other Victorian outlets. 
</P>
<P>
But the curious can catch that clip and others like it on "Hot Rocks," complete 
with titillating comments between songs from the va-va-voom veejay, Miss <DATE>March</DATE>, 
<PERSON>Deborah Driggs</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere, which aired several times this month, also includes uncensored 
<PERSON>Quincy Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON> and 2 Live Crew; a look at musical sex-meister <PERSON>Barry 
White</PERSON>; and an "exclusive" interview with male-bimbo rocker <PERSON>Tim Karr</PERSON>. Scheduled 
guests for the second episode, airing <DATE>June 2</DATE>: the <ORGANIZATION>Red Hot Chili Peppers</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Playboy Channel can clearly get more explicit in what it shows, the 
pervasive attitude in many of the rap and rock videos routinely shown on <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> 
differs little. This month's edition of <ORGANIZATION>Sound &amp; Vision</ORGANIZATION> -- where current pop 
clips are rated on a 0-100 scale -- takes a voyeuristic peek into the pop video 
bedroom, and finds only one "adult"-themed clip that also has an adult point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
VID PICK OF THE MONTH: 
</P>
<P>
The The's "Kingdom of Rain." (Director: <PERSON>Tim Pope</PERSON>.) Like several other clips in 
this lot, "Rain" sports a bewigged blond woman in a bedroom, but there's a 
universe of difference in how it moodily delineates the complexities of emotion 
in a long-standing, free-falling love affair. While Angst-ridden singer <PERSON>Matt 
Johnson</PERSON> gazes into his well-furnished fish tank, his neglected lover sits at 
his feet, making faces that disturbingly alternate between fake-seductiveness 
and all-out rage. Remarkably rich and potently cinematic, this video -- which 
has been airing for many months -- is notable now for another reason: <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s 
unseen duet partner, representing the female point of view, is the 
suddenly-a-superstar <PERSON>Sinead O'Connor</PERSON>. 93 
</P>
<P>
GAMMA RAY ROT: 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Billy Idol</PERSON>'s "Cradle of Love." (D: <PERSON>David Fincher</PERSON>.) An all-out reverse rape 
fantasy. Shy guy gets mauled by gorgeous woman crawling around on all fours 
(shades of the devil-doll in "Trilogy of Terror"!); after she's had her way 
with him, her real date for the evening knocks on the door. 18 
</P>
<P>
Heart's "All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You." (D: <PERSON>Andy Morahan</PERSON>.) Yet another 
insatiable woman courteously picks up a pretty-boy hitchhiker (which decade is 
this?) and takes him to a motel for one night of sin. <PERSON>Ann Wilson</PERSON> as the distaff 
<PERSON>Brando</PERSON> in a "Last Tango" reversal? Hardly. Danger disregarded, this is played 
up for all the phony romanticism it's worth. (By the way, yes, they're still 
electronically "squeezing" poor <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> into a size 9.) 7 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON>'s "Poison (uncensored)." (D: <PERSON>Nigel Dick</PERSON>.) On MTV you get bondage 
and death by poisoning; on the Playboy Channel you get all that and breasts 
too. But never in the same takes as the women's pouty faces. This suggests 
different models were used for the body shots, but it's indicative of the 
extent to which guys like <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> separate women's heads from their torsos. 5 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew's "Me So Horny." (D: Tass Sheik.) Him so sexist. <PERSON>Luke Skyywalker</PERSON> -- 
er, <PERSON>Luther Campbell</PERSON> -- is "a dog in heat," and to prove it, he lifts his leg as 
if to urinate on the camera and, by extension, us. Self-satisfied as a recently 
relieved cocker spaniel, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> reclines in bed, reminding a young woman (who 
looks appropriately depressed) that he made her the sex-toy she is today. He 
also mocks her parents' naivete and boasts that he'll soon dump her. Obscenity 
trials aside, any man who could invest so much braggadocio in the using and 
discarding of women is already in a jail -- of his own making. 0

<TEXT>
   
   ``COLORS''
   
   ``Colors'' marks the return of <PERSON>Dennis Hopper</PERSON> to directing, and
that should have been news in itself.
   His <DATE>1969</DATE> ``Easy Rider'' changed the face of the Hollywood film
industry forever, then <ORGANIZATION>Hopper</ORGANIZATION> fell from grace. After two decades of
drugs and booze, he turned his life around and returned as an actor
of remarkable depth.
   Reportedly the insistence of <PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON> resulted in <LOCATION>Hopper</LOCATION>'s
chance to direct again. A good thing. ``Colors'' reveals <PERSON>Hopper</PERSON> as
a filmmaker of great skill, though a glimmer remains of the
indulgences that contributed to his downfall.
   As a director of action, <ORGANIZATION>Hopper</ORGANIZATION> is superlative. Just when you
think you had seen every kind of car chase, he provides one through
the streets and back alleys of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> that is truly
breathtaking. And a fugitive's rampage through a crowded
restaurant, pursued by <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION>, is a kinetic wonder.
   On the downside, <PERSON>Hopper</PERSON> betrays his existential tendencies,
staging confrontational scenes that have no real motivation or
payoff. This partly may be due to <PERSON>Michael Schiffer</PERSON>'s rather
formless script.
   <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Duvall</PERSON> are unlikely partners on the gang war scene.
<PERSON>Duvall</PERSON> is nearing retirement, a cool head who tries to establish a
rapport with gang members. Penn is hotheaded and himself prone to
violence. Both try to act as <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> peacemakers in the growing war
between the ``Bloods'' and the ``Cripps.''
   ``Colors'' manages to portray the gang members as human beings
not senseless criminals. Penn, who may be the <PERSON>Brando</PERSON> of his
generation, continues his string of impressive performances, and
<PERSON>Duvall</PERSON> performs with his usual authority. <PERSON>Maria Conchita Alonso</PERSON> is
wasted as the obligatory love interest.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Orion</ORGANIZATION> release was produced by <PERSON>Robert H. Solo</PERSON> and scored with
fine, thumping style by <PERSON>Herbie Hancock</PERSON>. The R rating is well
deserved because of the street language, violence, nudity and sex
scenes. Running time: 2 hours.

As "To the Birdhouse" opens, <PERSON>Alice Brody</PERSON> is a happy woman. She has just married 
<PERSON>Peter Eiger</PERSON>, a rare bird of solitary habits who makes his living doing baseball 
statistics. Alice's brother, young <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>, is still in his bachelor stage, 
about midway through a string of ethnically variegated girlfriends, the current 
one a Japanese sociologist named Yuki. Alice's father has flown from the family 
nest and married again, but the rest of the relatives -- <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s relentlessly 
eccentric grandma and an assortment of aunts and great-aunts -- make up a 
friendly, nurturing flock. 
</P>
<P>
Only <PERSON>Brenda</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s mother, seems unhappy. A kind and beautiful dove, she has 
somehow gotten mixed up with <PERSON>Louie Scifo</PERSON>, a kind of immigrant Italian carrion 
crow. Louie deals in stolen goods and secondhand furniture. He wears gabardine 
leisure suits and butts in where he's not wanted. He's an embarrassment, a 
disaster, and although <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> -- as a newly married woman -- wishes domestic 
contentment on everyone she knows, she draws the line at <LOCATION>Louie</LOCATION>. He's a curse. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda soon finds this out for herself. She breaks up with <PERSON>Louie</PERSON>, but he will 
have none of it. His heart (if he has a heart) is broken. In a string of 
bizarre incidents, <PERSON>Louie</PERSON> begins the secondary courtship of the already rejected 
lover: He bashes in <LOCATION>Brenda</LOCATION>'s windows, puts black widow spiders under her 
pillow, makes crank phone calls to her and her extended family at <TIME>all hours of 
the day and night</TIME>. Finally, he hauls out his binoculars and begins watching the 
<PERSON>Brody</PERSON> family. Alice can't look out of a window into a tree without seeing a 
ClamberingLouie, his binoculars trained on her. 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, this is particularly disconcerting. She is a bird watcher by trade, 
putting out a newsletter for <ORGANIZATION>New York Birders</ORGANIZATION>. The morning after her wedding 
night, she rises early to take the subway to Prospect Park, all for the sake of 
a <ORGANIZATION>Bullock</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Oriole</ORGANIZATION>, blown in from the Rockies on the mighty wings of a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
The story of <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s first year of married life, then, is punctuated by typed 
lists of birds she spots: On <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION>: "1. 
2 Pied-Billed Grebes, 2. 14 double-crested cormorants, 3. 2 great blue herons," 
and so on. When <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is happy, she sees a lot (this particular list runs to 53 
items). When she's sad, or tormented by <PERSON>Louie</PERSON>, she finds only: "1. 67 Cicada 
shells." 
</P>
<P>
By now, the family has moved to <PERSON>Brenda</PERSON>'s <DATE>summer</DATE> home in <LOCATION>Westport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION>. Louie 
has gotten himself hired as a gardener by the woman next door and runs a power 
mower back and forth across their yard, howling, "Brenda! Brenda!" Things have 
gotten out of hand, and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> must devise a strategy to drive the Clambering 
Louie out of their collective lives. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this book is not for everyone. You have to buy into the idea that 
all of us are terminally weird and driven by behavior patterns that are best 
described as birdbrained. Ethically, I must disclose my own bias here: This 
review was written on a day when seven <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Jays, two pairs of nesting 
doves, one pair of nesting quail, eight house finches, one towhee and one 
red-shafted flicker flew through our patio. (But no Clambering Louies, thank 
God.)

<TEXT>     Cecilia, the heroine of the depression-era "The Purple Rose of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>," is a
waitress who breaks two dishes for every one she successfully delivers.
Smacked with regularity by her out-of-work husband, <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON> is Jell-O when a
handsome fellow wearing a pith helmet, a character inside the movie she's
watching, steps down from the screen and sweeps her out of the small-town
theater.;    "I just met a wonderful man," <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON> later tells her sister.
"He's fictional, but you can't have everything.";    <PERSON>Sally</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON>, who
inhabit universes in which the mundane and the miraculous are inextricably
merged, are just two of the enchanting characters <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> has written and
directed for <PERSON>Mia Farrow</PERSON> since 1982.;    Now it seems as if they've all been
leading up to "Alice," <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s new comedy about the cockeyed, herb-induced
liberation of a rather solemn, inhibited Central Park West wife and mother.;  
 In the world of movies, where relationships that survive more than two or
three productions are rare, the collaboration of <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON> is sublimely
eccentric -- and a measure of the personal nature of <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s cinema and of
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Farrow</ORGANIZATION>'s relationship. "Alice" is their 11th film together, and it
marks a partnership which is certainly singular and possibly unique.;   
<PERSON>Federico Fellini</PERSON> often collaborated with his wife, <PERSON>Giuletta Masina</PERSON>. At least
one of their films -- "Nights of Cabiria" -- remains a matchless comedy. But
the director's point of view eventually shifted from the beloved to the lover,
and <PERSON>Marcello Mastroianni</PERSON> replaced <PERSON>Masina</PERSON> as his star.;    <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON> has now
appeared in more than half of <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s movies, but when she entered <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s
world in "A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer Night</ORGANIZATION>'s Sex Comedy," she was in danger of becoming the
screen's most formidable waif.;    There's still a bit of the waif, but now
there's also much, much more.;    In her first <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> film, she plays <PERSON>Ariel
Weymouth</PERSON>, a free spirit with some of the amiable klutziness of <PERSON>Annie Hall</PERSON>
about her. Ariel looks like a golden-haired <ORGANIZATION>Botticelli</ORGANIZATION> angel, but she has a
reputation as long as your arm.;    In addition to the ambitious <PERSON>Sally</PERSON> and the
incurably romantic <PERSON>Cecilia</PERSON>, three of the more memorable <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON> performances
are the common-sensical psychiatrist, <PERSON>Eudora Fletcher</PERSON>, who successfully treats
the "chameleon man" in "Zelig"; <PERSON>Tina Vitale</PERSON>, the teased-blond doxy in
"Broadway Danny Rose"; and the unexpectedly staunch wife and mother, <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON>,
in "Hannah and Her Sisters.";    Just as <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> has shaped <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON>'s career, she
appears to have given direction to his. After her appearance in "A <ORGANIZATION>Midsummer
Night</ORGANIZATION>'s Sex Comedy," there is, among other things, a new sense of community in
his work, of family and children.;    This is most somberly and successfully
expressed in "Hannah and Her Sisters" (which features a stunning performance
by <PERSON>Maureen O'Sullivan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON>'s real-life mother) and most riotously in the
brand-new "Alice.";    One of the most magical things about "Alice" is the way
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> persuades the audience to accept not only magic but also what seem to be
some deeply felt observations about life. It's a risky moment when <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON>, as
a woman who worries that her children are being brought up with the wrong
values, dashes off to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to work with <ORGANIZATION>Mother Teresa</ORGANIZATION>. Were the character
less firmly rooted in its own reality, the movie would go sailing out the
window.;    It doesn't. <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> takes <PERSON>Alice Tate</PERSON> seriously. He believes in her
and is able to give conviction to a character who is quite unlike any other in
screen literature.;    "Alice" is a personal triumph for both <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Farrow</PERSON>, in part, at least, because of a fascinating shift in their
professional relationship.;    There had been hints of things to come in
earlier films, particularly in "The Purple Rose of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>." The shift is
manifest in "Alice" in the scene in which <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> decides to throw caution to
the wind and have an extramarital affair with <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> (<PERSON>Joe Mantegna</PERSON>), a musician.;
   Sitting on the bed with <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is overwhelmed by pre-coital guilt.
She's eager to get on with it, but she talks non-stop to put it off. She says
in desperation that she thinks she might be out of practice. Joe tells her to
relax. "It's not like juggling.";    Gently, he pulls her down on the bed.
With her last words, "I'm going to be going on a diet next week," it's
suddenly clear that <PERSON>Farrow</PERSON> is not only <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s Masina but also his
Mastroianni.;    In her, the two functions become one. She's both the one
beloved and the one who would love, that is, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s stand-in. The
collaboration is complete.;    <PERSON>Alice Tate</PERSON> is her own woman, but she's also
<PERSON>Danny Rose</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Zelig</LOCATION>, and any number of other <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> roles. She's a sheep in
wolf's clothing.;    <ORGANIZATION>Magic</ORGANIZATION>.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The secret is out and remember that you heard it
here first: <PERSON>Arlo Guthrie</PERSON> never really wanted to be a folk singer.
   Forget for a moment that he's the son of <PERSON>Woody Guthrie</PERSON>, who
wrote more than 1,000 songs, or that he's written a sizable number
of memorable tunes himself. Forget all those great interpretations
of ``Goodnight Irene,'' ``Amazing Grace,'' ``Stealin''' and ``This
Land Is Your Land'' that you've heard him do over the years. Don't
even think about ``Alice's Restaurant,'' that epic tale of youthful
rebellion and anti-war protest.
   What <PERSON>Arlo Guthrie</PERSON> really wanted to be was a newspaper reporter.
   ``Yeah, there must be a repressed reporter in one of my hidden
personalities because I love to write,'' laughs <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON>, whose
musical career has seen him evolve from the '60s-kid protest singer
with a sense of humor to one of the pre-eminent voices in American
folk music.
   But he says, ``I didn't become a folk singer because I wanted to
be. I ended up doing this because I didn't know how to do anything
else.
   ``And that hasn't changed much,'' he adds with that quick,
good-natured laugh that his fans have heard so often over the
years. It's the one that sometimes surfaces right on stage, in the
middle of a song, when something strikes him so funny that he has
to stop and tell everyone about it.
   But now the funny stories, the wry asides, the general
observations on the oddities of life are as apt to go down on paper
as over a microphone in a concert hall.
   The ones that are written go into <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON>'s newsletter, The
Rolling Blunder Review, an espistle written in a style that evokes
rollicking images of the kind of old-time journalism chronicled in
such movies as ``The Front Page.''
   But the newsletter never started out to be a newsletter.
   ``It sort of came about by accident,'' <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON> says.
   In the mid-'70s he began collecting addresses of people who
might want a schedule of his shows, but he never really got around
to sending them one.
   ``People started asking us, `When are you going to send us
something?' They'd say, `I signed up 14 times and I never got
anything,''' he recalled.
   So with a great sense of guilt, <ORGANIZATION>The Rolling Blunder Review</ORGANIZATION> was
born. <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON>, typed it on a single sheet of
paper, made copies and mailed it from their home in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. Early issues contained only the long-sought schedule and a
few funny comments on ``Alice's Restaurant'' and other songs.
   But as word spread, the newsletter grew. Five years later, it's
an eight-page quarterly, containing stories, letters to the editor
and information on how to buy <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON>'s albums, T-shirts and other
merchandise. There's even a cooking column by <PERSON>Alice Brock</PERSON>. (``You
remember <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>. There's a song about Alice.'')
   Some 60,000 to 70,000 people pay <MONEY>$3</MONEY> a year for it, although it
goes free to people in hospitals and prisons.
   Among the stories in recent issues are reports on concerts to
benefit the environment and in support of student protests in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
and elsewhere. But somehow, almost everything, no matter how
serious, comes out funny. Sort of like an <PERSON>Arlo Guthrie</PERSON> concert.
   He notes that one role of a folk singer is to comment on
political events of the day as his father, <PERSON>Pete Seeger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joan Baez</PERSON>
and so many others have done.
   ``But it's not the only job, and it may not even be the most
important job,'' he said. ``The most important thing, for me
personally, is maintaining a sense of humor in an often-humorless
world.''
   For <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON>, the laughs have been frequent. Only he, for
example, could show us (in ``Alice's Restaurant'') how to use a
litterbug arrest as a reason to stay out of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> during the
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War. Only he has dared speculate (in ``The Pause of Mr
Claus'') that <LOCATION>Santa Claus</LOCATION> might enter houses late at night because
he's a dope fiend. Or that a delightful folk ditty about the joys
of tilling the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> (``The Garden Song'') should be played
backward in search of evil messages.
   The laughs have been so frequent that they've allowed some to
overlook the musical talent. Guthrie is more than proficient on
guitar, piano, harmonica and banjo, as well as a singer of some
range and a writer whose best songs evoke strong images of joy and
sometimes sorrow.
   ``Alice's Restaurant'' started it all in <DATE>1967</DATE>, making him an
overnight star at age 20.
   ``Who could have ever imagined it,'' he says of the way the
youth culture embraced his 18-minute, guitar-accompanied monologue
on how he used a Thanksgiving Day arrest to stay out of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>.
The song also helped him escape early comparisons with a legendary
father.
   And although <PERSON>Guthrie</PERSON> has almost always included a <PERSON>Woody Guthrie</PERSON>
song or two in his concert repertoire, he downplays the father-son
connection.
   ``For whatever cosmic reasons - and who really understands those
things - I ended up similar to my dad in some ways,'' he says.
``But we're vastly different in other ways.''
   But the connection also brings up another inevitable question.
<PERSON>Woody Guthrie</PERSON> died in <DATE>1967</DATE> of the debilitating neurological
disorder <LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION>'s Chorea. It has a 50-50 chance of being passed
from parent to child, it strikes in middle age, and <PERSON>Arlo Guthrie</PERSON> is
43.
   But he dismisses such inquiries good-naturedly. ``I'm not dead
yet,'' he says. ``Does that answer your question?''
   He is also not through working yet, continuing to tour regularly
and making plans to record again after several years without a new
album.
   ``I've written some new songs,'' he says. ``I've got enough for
a totally new record.''
   He's also thinking about an animated version for children of
``Alice's Restaurant,'' which was made into a movie in <DATE>1969</DATE>.
   ``It would focus more on the Thanksgiving part and less on the
littering and draft parts,'' he says.
   He notes that the idea of dumping ``a half a ton of garbage'' by
the side of the road isn't as popular as it once was, even if the
dump was closed on Thanksgiving and you'd ``never heard of a dump
closed on Thanksgiving before.''
   ``Littering isn't such a good idea anymore,'' he says a bit
sheepishly. But then he adds with that quick laugh: ``I sure had a
lot of fun on that day though.'

<TEXT>
And back we go into the nursery, into the place where we now analyse
childhood enchantments in context of disenchanted knowledge of adult life.
Can there be one simple reaction to <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Adventures Under Ground</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Christopher Hampton</PERSON>'s new adaptation of <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON>'s writings and aspects
of his (ie <PERSON>Charles Dodgson</PERSON>'s) life? On the one hand, since this <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> is
full of episodes from those classic books, it is a bracing dip back into a
sane child's discovery of the nonsensical grown-up world. On the other hand,
it is a disturbing study of the stammering, polite, scholarly <PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON>'s
melancholy fascination with little girls.
Hampton means, I take it, to examine <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>'s creativity in terms of what
<PERSON>Edmund Wilson</PERSON> called 'the wound and the bow': the wound, in this case, being
<PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON>'s paedophile inclinations, the bow being the tales he told to
enthrall his listeners. The wound/bow theory proposes that the spot where
some artists are psychologically vulnerable is precisely what gives them
their archery - their creative genius. In <PERSON>Martha Clarke</PERSON>'s staging, there are
only five actors, and the overlap between little <PERSON>Alice Liddell</PERSON>'s real world
and the dream world that <PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON> creates for her in the nursery is
considerable.
Hampton's view of Dodgson/Carroll is compassionate - too much so. The bow
only interests him as far as it reveals the wound, and many of the books'
multi-faceted quotations are so placed that we read them in terms of
<PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON>'s private feelings. 'Seven and a half] Uncomfortable sort of age. If
you'd asked my advice, you'd have left off at seven.' We also watch <PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON>
start to cry as he slowly unbuttons little <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s dress.
But <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>'s own mind, for all its pathos, is weak tea beside the
intoxicating concoctions of his tales. Though <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Adventures Under
Ground</ORGANIZATION> is sensitively shaped, its eventual thrust is merely sentimental. And
sentimentality, surely, is wrong for the man who made <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> cry out 'You're
nothing but a pack of cards]'
At the Cottesloe Theatre, <PERSON>Robert Israel</PERSON>'s nursery set is eloquent. One look
at its rocking-horse, its white walls, its large dark looking-glass above
the mantel, and we are prepared for meanings both surreal and psychological.
<PERSON>John Carlisle</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gabrielle Lloyd</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Joseph Mydell</PERSON> play a marvellous range of
supporting roles. <PERSON>Martha Clarke</PERSON> has them act with a fine dash of exaggerated
intensity.
Little <PERSON>Sasha Hanau</PERSON> would be an ideal <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> - grave, focused, precise,
responsive - if she did not gabble rapid lines. Such manners are affecting
in so small a child. <PERSON>Michael Maloney</PERSON> (despite overdoses of vocal virtuosity)
beautifully creates a Carroll/Dodgson of immense courtesy, birdlike staccato
head movements, and eyes both burning and pleading. He is adult among
children, child among adults. Judiciously, <PERSON>Hampton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clarke</PERSON> have him play
his own Dormouse.
In repertory at the <ORGANIZATION>Cottesloe</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Theatre</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>South Bank</ORGANIZATION>, into <DATE>1995</DATE>.

   The world's first test-tube tiger cub pounced
and growled during her National Zoo debut <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> before settling
down with a big bottle of milk.
   The 20-pound bouncing <LOCATION>Bengal</LOCATION> is one of a litter of three cubs
produced by in vitro fertilization in an effort to save endangered
tiger species.
   <PERSON>Mary Alice</PERSON>, the only surviving cub, was born by Caesarean
section <DATE>April 27</DATE>.
   ``This is a marvelous step forward for all those cats on the
verge of extinction,'' said <PERSON>Michael Robinson</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Zoo</ORGANIZATION>. ``In 20 years of our lifetime, we have lost three
subspecies of tigers.''
   During a meetings with journalists, <PERSON>Mary Alice</PERSON> fussed and
squirmed until her keeper stuck a milk bottle in her mouth.
   Then, the yellow-and-black cub stood up on her hind legs,
grasped the bottle with her front paws, closed her eyes and sucked
aggressively until her chin was covered with milk.
   <PERSON>Mary Alice</PERSON> is expected to weigh about 300 pounds when she is
fully grown.
   A second yellow-and-black cub died of pneumonia three weeks
after birth, but zoo officials said the death was not related to
the in vitro procedure. The third cub, a white tiger, died shortly
after birth.
   The surrogate mother, <PERSON>Nicole</PERSON>, a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger is
from the <ORGANIZATION>Henry Doorly Zoo</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb</LOCATION>. A male tiger named <PERSON>Chester</PERSON>
provided the sperm that scientists used to fertilize three eggs
taken from two other tigers.
   <PERSON>Mary Alice</PERSON> eventually will be housed at the <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> zoo.
   Of the 37 species of felines, all but the domestic cat are
threatened or endangered, according to the National Zoo's Center
for New Opportunities in <ORGANIZATION>Animal Health Sciences</ORGANIZATION>. That means a
species is either dying out or not reproducing rapidly enough to
survive long-term.
   Since <DATE>1969</DATE>, three subspecies of tigers have become extinct and
the <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> tiger is critically endangered, with only 50
remaining in the world.
   There are more tigers in the world's zoos than there are in the
wild _ 31 black-footed cats; 21 sand cats; and 12 pallas cats in
zoos, according to center officials.
   ``Sometimes people use the words `captive' and `research' as
four-letter words,'' said <PERSON>Lee Simmons</PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> zoo.
   ``This animal's relatives are captive in <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION> and other
countries,'' he said. ``The habitats for many animals are in
isolated enclaves.''
   When tigers' natural habitats are destroyed, they are limited to
a small area, isolated from other tiger species in their home
countries. While kept in a small area, tigers inbreed, not
producing new genetic material, which causes extinction, <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON>
said.
   National Zoo officials said in vitro fertilization helps
conserve rare tiger species by allowing animals that are sexually
incompatible or separated by long distances to reproduce.
   <PERSON>Mary Alice</PERSON> is named after the wife of <PERSON>Ulysses Seal</PERSON>, a major
participant in programs to conserve tigers in zoos, <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
   There was a time when <PERSON>Alice Faye</PERSON> was queen of
the <ORGANIZATION>20th Century Fox</ORGANIZATION> musicals.
   ``It was great, it was glamorous, it was wonderful. I don't
spend too much time thinking about it, but when I do, it was
lovely. I had so many nice friends, people who were good to me. I
didn't have too many beefs, many complaints,'' she said.
   ``I have great memories _ of the working people. Wonderful stars
like <PERSON>Don Ameche</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Payne</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tyrone Power</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack Oakie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack Haley</PERSON>,
on and on. We had so much fun, we really did. They don't seem to
have that kind of fun today.''
   Now she has produced a book, ``Growing Old, Staying Young''
(<PERSON>E.P. Dutton</PERSON>, <MONEY>$18.95</MONEY>), written with <PERSON>Dick Kleiner</PERSON>. Still a striking
blonde at 75, she also has been spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I go out every month, almost,'' she says. ``I travel a day, I
rest a day, then I work two days and I come home. It works out real
nice. It's kind of fun; it keeps me active, keeps me involved and
keeps me off the street.''
   Her book contains the message Faye imparts to her audiences,
whom she calls ``young elders.'' The Faye method:
   ``1. Staying active and involved.
   ``2. Eating a well-balanced diet.
   ``3. No smoking, which is tough for a lot of people.
   ``4. Exercising; that's a key: walking, swimming, stretching.
   ``5. Seeing your doctor and talking to him about your problems.
   ``I throw in 6. Please God, have a sense of humor, because it
helps.''
   She enjoys meeting fans who recall her films of the <DATE>'30s</DATE> and
<DATE>'40s</DATE>. ``All of them have a story to tell you _ they had a baby at
the time I did this movie or I sang that song,'' she said.
   Faye was born <PERSON>Alice Jeanne Leppert</PERSON>, daughter of a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
police officer. A teen-age beauty who danced in the Capitol Theater
chorus at 14, she eventually made her way to <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION>.
   For 10 years she starred in a string of popular musicals: ``Sing
Baby Sing,'' ``Stowaway'' (with <PERSON>Shirley Temple</PERSON>) ``On the Avenue,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``<PERSON>Sally</PERSON>, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>,'' ``Rose of
<LOCATION>Washington Square</LOCATION>,'' ``<PERSON>Lillian Russell</PERSON>,'' ``Weekend in <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>'' and
more.
   Faye seldom watches her old movies on television (``I was never
a fan of me''). But she saw one recently that she remembered
fondly, the wonderfully slapstick ``Hollywood Cavalcade'' (<DATE>1939</DATE>).
   ``I really enjoyed seeing that one again,'' she said. ``I had
forgotten how funny (<PERSON>Buster</PERSON>) <PERSON>Keaton</PERSON> was. He was a genius who never
got his due in Hollywood.''
   She has less pleasant memories of her relations with studio boss
<PERSON>Darryl Zanuck</PERSON>.
   ``I wanted to do something more mature, but <PERSON>Zanuck</PERSON> didn't see it
that way,'' she said. ``They were making lots of money with
pictures that <PERSON>Betty Grable</PERSON> and myself were doing, all those
musicals. Always it was the same story. We changed costumes and
leading men, and off we'd go and make another one.''
   ``The only chance I had (for a dramatic role) was `Fallen Angel'
(<DATE>1945</DATE>). That was a good, meaty part. But when I finally saw it on
the screen, I was on the cutting room floor.''
   Faye was a victim of the big-studio era, when stars were
pigeon-holed. Her musicals were a studio staple, so <PERSON>Zanuck</PERSON> refused
to change the formula until ``Fallen Angel,'' a box-office failure.
Because of <PERSON>Zanuck</PERSON>'s cuts, no one will ever know whether Faye could
have succeeded in drama.
   And Faye left. She never went back.
   She and her husband starred for a decade on their top-rated
radio program, ``The <PERSON>Alice Faye-Phil Harris</PERSON> Show.'' She was a
frequent guest on television and returned to Fox for the <DATE>1962</DATE>
musical version of ``State Fair,'' with a score by <PERSON>Rodgers</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Hammerstein</ORGANIZATION>. In more recent times, she toured in ``Good News,''
first with <PERSON>John Payne</PERSON> and then with <PERSON>Don Ameche</PERSON>.
   For many years <PERSON>Faye</PERSON> and her husband have lived in <LOCATION>Rancho Mirage</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, 85, often travels to golf tournaments.

BALLET  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     What she's constructing looks like a tonneau cover for a small aircraft.
However, it's the armor of a large dragon.;    Powered by 13 children, this is
the Jabberwock, namesake of <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON>'s epic poem, "Jabberwocky" -- one of
the core numbers of "The Adventures of Alice," the <DATE>spring</DATE> production of <ORGANIZATION>San
Jose Dance Theater</ORGANIZATION>, which plays this weekend at the CPA.;    Traditionally,
SJDT performs a classical story ballet, such as "Sleeping Beauty," for its
<DATE>spring</DATE> season.;    But "Alice" is its most ambitious effort yet: an all-new
production whose costumes and sets were built from the ground up, with a
commissioned score by <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara University</ORGANIZATION> composer <PERSON>Henry Mollicone</PERSON> and
original choreography by <PERSON>Jody White</PERSON>, a well-known dance teacher from Fairfax.;
   Most of its <MONEY>$125,000</MONEY> cost has gone into an elaborate production constructed
by an army of parents.;    Like all San Jose Dance Theater productions, this
is a showcase for young dancers, drawn from schools all over the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>.
The goal of the company is to give a professional-quality performing
experience to as many as possible. White says her task has been to create
"choreography that children could do that would not make them nervous.";   
That doesn't mean it's easy. In <ORGANIZATION>SJDT</ORGANIZATION>'s rehearsal space in a renovated
warehouse at Ninth and <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> streets, 16 preteens rehearse the lobster
quadrille, an intricate figure dance inspired by the courtly minuet. "All
right, ladies, collect your claws," calls the wardrobe assistant.;    Next
door, 17 smaller children march through the drill-team maneuvers of the deck
of cards, learning from rehearsal assistant <PERSON>Kim Gardner</PERSON> how to make sure
they're in a straight line.;    How many children are there in "Alice"? "I
would say about 1,275," says White, whose sharp nose and close-cropped hair
make her look like one of the <ORGANIZATION>Keebler</ORGANIZATION> cookie elves.;    Actually, there are
120, multiplied about threefold by parents and siblings, and they've given all
their free time to it for months.;    Since the middle of <DATE>January</DATE>, White has
come down from <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> every <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and the dancers worked with
her until <TIME>late evening</TIME>. She'd stay over to start the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> rehearsal at <TIME>10:30
a.m.</TIME> and drive back to <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. During the week, her work was
reinforced by her two rehearsal assistants, <PERSON>Gardner</PERSON>, who has danced with
<ORGANIZATION>Margaret Wingrove Dance Company</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Ballet</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Kristin Elliot.</PERSON>;    As
the kids rehearse, their parents and others man the oars of an immense galley,
sewing costumes, constructing masks and props, building sets.;    The music
was composed in long-distance telephone calls. White would call <PERSON>Mollicone</PERSON> and
tell him the plan for each scene, how much music she wanted and what kind.
He'd write, call her back and sing it to her. The kids rehearsed from a
work-tape on which <PERSON>Mollicone</PERSON> played the piano and sang the instrumental solos
and even sound effects such as the sobs of the Mock Turtle.;    The idea for
"Alice" came from SJDT's artistic director, <PERSON>Paul Curtis</PERSON>. " '<PERSON>Alice</PERSON>' lends
itself to imaginative effects," says White, who conflated "Alice's Adventures
in <LOCATION>Wonderland</LOCATION>" and "Through the Looking-Glass" for the ballet. She and
lighting designer <PERSON>Brad Belleville</PERSON>, for instance, devised a dazzling war for
the chess pieces, all done in strobe lights.;    In translating it into dance,
she tried to select episodes that could be expressed in movement. The ballet
includes such danceable passages as the lobster quadrille, the chess game and
"Jabberwocky," whose slithy toves gyre and gimble in the wabe. ("Don't be
classical," White chided the dancers at one rehearsal. "Do it like a tove
would do it.");    The costumes were designed by <PERSON>Shawn Stuart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON>'
longtime partner, who also thought up the idea for its ingenious, economical
sets. The scenery, designed and built by <PERSON>George Pettit</PERSON>, consists of seven
periaktoi -- three-sided, 10-foot-high movable pillars, whose name and concept
come from the Hellenistic theater of the first and second centuries <ORGANIZATION>A.D. Each</ORGANIZATION>
has a man inside, who walks it around the stage; there's a different
configuration for each stopping place in <LOCATION>Alice</LOCATION>'s journey.;    The ballet's
familiar characters include <LOCATION>Tweedledum</LOCATION> and Tweedledee, the Mock Turtle and the
<ORGANIZATION>Gryphon</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>White Rabbit</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION>, the Queen of Hearts and the
White Knight.;    <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION> will be danced by <PERSON>Sharon Wehner</PERSON>, a 15-year-old
sophomore at <ORGANIZATION>Live Oak High School</ORGANIZATION>. A third-year company member, <PERSON>Wehner</PERSON> has
been a snowflake and a demi-soloist in the divertissement of the annual
"Nutcracker.";    <PERSON>Ralph White</PERSON>, the choreographer's husband, an actor
accustomed to working in dance, plays the White Knight. Her son, <PERSON>David
Roxander</PERSON>, who just retired after 18 years with the <ORGANIZATION>National Ballet of Canada</ORGANIZATION>,
is dancing the <PERSON>Beamish</PERSON> Boy, slayer of the fierce Jabberwock.;    "It's the
first time in many years we've worked together as a family," said White -- and

   Love Conquers Almost All
   ----

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14
</SO>
<LP>
   Apart from Gothic romances, there are not many novels
these days that celebrate the escapist theme of love as a
magic cure-all defying common sense. Far more novelists seem
to be concerned with demonstrating how romantic delusions can
deprive people -- especially women -- of freedom, peace of
mind, and, occasionally, life and limb. Yet, in her third
novel, "Temples of Delight," (Grove Weidenfeld, 311 pages,
$19.95), the South African-born Barbara Trapido, who's lived
in England since 1963 and deftly appropriated the polished
style of sophisticated British social comedy, applies her
sharp sense of social nuances and her dry wit to advance the
old-fashioned proposition that love conquers all.
   Alice Pilling is a bright, blond, levelheaded English
schoolgirl, whose adolescent world is transformed by the
arrival of a new girl in the middle of the term: Veronica
Bernadette McCrail, who styles herself "Jem" (after the
"jem-sengwiches" in P.G. Wodehouse, as she glibly informs her
incredulous teachers). In a school full of scrubbed,
upper-middle-class girls mainly interested in hockey matches,
Jem comes to class reading Lampedusa's "The Leopard" and
enchants Alice with astonishing stories of a French mother
who was "rudely forced" in the woods and a handsome father
who shaves to Gregorian chants and is so hyper-literary that
he thinks news reports on the decline of the pound refer to
the health of Ezra Pound.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Alice is charmed by everything about her precocious new
friend, from her "exotic" background to her enthusiastic
disquisitions on the wonders of <ORGANIZATION>Mozart</ORGANIZATION>'s "Magic Flute." Then,
one day, <PERSON>Jem</PERSON> disappears when the school authorities pass her
over and award what should have been her scholarship to a
prim, mean-spirited grade-grubber. A light goes out of
<ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION>'s life. Outwardly, she proceeds as normal, going on to
<LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, acquiring a suitable fiance (two, in fact, seriatim,
as in a fairytale). Everything looks right, but nothing feels
right. Then, a bizarre set of circumstances brings Jem back
into <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s life, and through her, an exotic, high-strung
Italian-American man called <PERSON>Angeletti</PERSON>, who seems like <PERSON>Mr.
Wrong</PERSON>, but in the curious dream-logic of this boldly
anti-realist novel, turns out to be exactly the right person
to rekindle <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s lost capacity for joy and delight.
   Invoking ghostly parallels with "The Magic Flute"
(Angeletti as <ORGANIZATION>Sarastro</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jem</PERSON> as a benign Queen of the <TIME>Night</TIME>),
<PERSON>Ms. Trapido</PERSON> invites us to suspend our customary suspicions of
overly charismatic people and our usual disbelief in
improbable happy endings. The aura of preciousness and
artifice surrounding the proceedings is occasionally a little
cloying, but <PERSON>Ms. Trapido</PERSON> has a light, sure touch that enables
her to carry it off with panache. By portraying the genuine
difficulties of Alice's various relationships -- the
deadening qualities of the seemingly sensible ones, the
liberating intensities of those that are based on romantic
love -- she manages to make the improbable surprisingly
possible.
   <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sarah Rose</PERSON>, the happily married, middle-aged
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Jewish couple in <PERSON>Susan Sussman</PERSON>'s second novel, "Time
Off from Good Behavior," (Pocket Books. 274 pages, <MONEY>$20</MONEY>), are
as humorously "real" as the middle-aged and middle class are
expected to be in novels of this kind. Asher is a lovable guy
who's just sold the family company he built up from scratch.
Having made <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> from the sale, <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> is looking
forward to travel and romance with his wife. Their children
have grown up. They are still in love. They've earned the
right to enjoy themselves.
   There's a slight glitch: After years of working on the
fringes of the costume design industry, <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> has landed a
job designing clothes for a feature-length film. This is her
big chance, and she expects her husband to be as supportive
of her career as she was of his. Asher, however, feels lost
without his company to fuss over.
   Anxious to succeed in her work, <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> sends <PERSON>Asher</PERSON> off to
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with her "permission" to have an affair if he likes:
time off for years of good behavior as a faithful husband and
devoted family man. Sarah herself finds temptation in the
form of a dashing set designer, who could take his pick from
hordes of ingenues but seems to prefer <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON>'s mature charms.
   Even with her husband out of the house, <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> can scarcely
concentrate on her work because of the incessant nagging of
her ailing mother, a self-dramatizing 78-year-old former
actress. It soon becomes clear that the real problem isn't
<PERSON>Sarah</PERSON>'s hapless, self-effacing spouse, but her prima donna of
a mother.
   The story is narrated alternately by <PERSON>Sarah and Asher</PERSON>, who
unfortunately sound very much alike. <PERSON>Ms. Sussman</PERSON> relies on
heavy doses of wisecracking, supposedly self-deprecatory
humor that only thinly disguises her characters' basic,
unflappable self-satisfaction. Still, this novel has its
funny moments of desperation, and its moments of wisdom that
come from having survived the desperation. As <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> tells her
own daughter, who is on the verge of a divorce, "You show me
a woman who hasn't fantasized getting in the car and leaving
home and I'll show you a woman who doesn't drive. . . . But
if you love someone, you get through it."

TALES FOR A SUMMER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time to celebrate Independence Day and, not coincidentally, the second <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles Times Magazine</ORGANIZATION> fiction issue. We have collected five new stories from 
western writers that will transport you on horseback to <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION>, put you 
through grad school at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, admit you to a magic show on the <LOCATION>Kern River</LOCATION>, 
effect your escape from <LOCATION>Seguin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, or teach you the scientific name of the 
housefly. So light the sparklers, slice the watermelon and put on your reading 
sunglasses. Happy Fourth!

MAX <PERSON>SCHOTT</PERSON>

<P>
"Writing," <PERSON>Max Schott</PERSON> says, "is a way of thinking about my own past." In fact, 
the characters and events in "Shannon" (Page 18) are autobiographical: There 
was a stable owner who was like a second father to <PERSON>Schott</PERSON> when he was growing 
up in <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION>; there was a girl who died trick riding and another who 
fibbed her way into the stable where he worked. "The story was inspired by 
memories, but I was also fascinated by ideas of independence in rodeo girls. 
They simply wouldn't be imposed on by anyone. They fascinated me as a kind of 
ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the cast of "Shannon" is also the cast of <PERSON>Schott</PERSON>'s latest novel, "<PERSON>Ben</PERSON>," 
published last month by <ORGANIZATION>North Point Press</ORGANIZATION>. Schott, a horse trainer and rodeo 
roper till he was 30, is 55 and a professor of writing and literature at <ORGANIZATION>UC 
Santa Barbara</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>SANDRA CISNEROS 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Cisneros</PERSON>, 35, a Chicago-born Texan, calls herself a "migrant professor." 
She has taught for the past few years on three <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> campuses -- most 
recently at <LOCATION>UC Irvine</LOCATION>. Her story, "Woman Hollering Creek" (Page 14), is all 
about reality: "The soap operas are real," she says, "the people are real; the 
character Cleofilas is based on a woman I encountered, helped escape from an 
abusive husband. And a creek by the name Woman Hollering really does exist in 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. When I passed over it, I gave a hoot." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros' collection of short stories, "The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on Mango Street," won the 
<ORGANIZATION>Before Columbus Book Award</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>; "Woman Hollering Creek" will appear in a 
new collection due from <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>spring</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>ETHAN CANIN</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what writers say, most stories are about ourselves," says <PERSON>Ethan 
Canin</PERSON>. "The facts might change a little, but not much." Canin, 29, lives in <LOCATION>San 
Francisco</LOCATION>, but he grew up in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and small-town <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, a self-confessed 
"sort of semi-nerd." He majored in English at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and left <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Medical 
School</ORGANIZATION> one month away from obtaining an <LOCATION>MD</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
His story, "The Scientific Method" (Page 10), is excerpted from a 
novel-in-progress that will be published next year by <LOCATION>Houghton Mifflin</LOCATION>. It 
expands on the story "American Beauty," which appeared in <PERSON>Canin</PERSON>'s best-selling 
collection, "Emperor of the <ORGANIZATION>Air</ORGANIZATION>," in <DATE>1988</DATE>. This <DATE>fall</DATE>, <PERSON>Canin</PERSON> will teach writing 
at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
ALICE <PERSON>ADAMS</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
"The Easterners" (Page 24) is just a few months out of <PERSON>Alice Adams</PERSON>' typewriter. 
Since <DATE>1966</DATE>, she has published six novels ("Superior Women," in <DATE>1985</DATE>, was a 
bestseller), four short-story collections and many individual pieces. She began 
by writing "awfully bad" poetry but gave it up in college. It wasn't until she 
was 40 that her first novel was published. 
</P>
<P>
"The Easterners," <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> says, contains a theme that especially interests her: 
"the myth of the evil <ORGANIZATION>Easterner</ORGANIZATION> and the good Westerner." 
</P>
<P>
Adams lives in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>; her latest novel, "The Last Lovely City," will be 
released next <DATE>spring</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Knopf</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>GERALD HASLAM</PERSON> 
</P>
<P>
"Quintessentially Californian" is the way <PERSON>Gerald Haslam</PERSON>'s dozens of <ORGANIZATION>Central 
Valley</ORGANIZATION> essays and short stories are usually described. "Writing about rural 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Haslam</PERSON> says, "has been to my advantage. Outsiders think we all 
roller skate to hot tubs, but we also work in the oil fields. I get a lot of 
creative energy from that tension." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Haslam</PERSON>, 53, teaches English at <ORGANIZATION>Sonoma State University</ORGANIZATION>. "Upstream" (Page 30) is 
taken from "That Constant Coyote," published last month by the <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Nevada Press</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"What does 'Upstream' mean? I honestly don't know," he says. "It's a tall tale, 
about primordial escape, I guess. Who knows where such a story comes from?"

<LEADPARA>  George Gobel, the sad-eyed comic with the flat-top haircut whose battles with
his TV wife, "Spooky Old Alice," added a dimension to 1950s domestic warfare,
died Sunday at 71.;    Sam Honigberg, his friend and publicist for nearly 40
years, said Gobel had suffered a series of strokes, which left him unable to
walk, and had undergone surgery nearly a month ago to determine whether his
mobility could be improved.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SINGING COMEDIAN GEORGE GOBEL DIES
DEADPAN HUMOR WAS TV HIT IN '50S  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "He may have had another stroke" and died at <ORGANIZATION>Encino Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Honigberg</PERSON> said.;    <PERSON>Gobel</PERSON> had several nicknames during his long
career, which began when he was 11 and sang as "Little <PERSON>George Gobel</PERSON>" on
radio's "The <ORGANIZATION>National Barn Dance</ORGANIZATION>.";    He next became "Lonesome George,"
singer of sad cowboy ballads in which he would pick at his guitar while pining
for lost loves or evenings on the prairie.;    On television, 20-plus years
later, <PERSON>Gobel</PERSON> enriched the language with such phrases as "Well, I'll be a dirty
bird" and "You don't hardly get those no more." His underplayed, deadpan humor
contrasted with other TV comics of the day -- frenetic entertainers such as
<PERSON>Milton Berle</PERSON> and Red Skelton.;    His flair as a teller of tall tales, kept
him at, or near, the top of the ratings throughout the 1954-to-1960 run of
"The <PERSON>George Gobel</PERSON> Show.";    The <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> show, which won him an Emmy in <DATE>1955</DATE>,
started with an opening monologue, a sketch or song by a guest star and then
the inevitable aggravation he suffered at the hands of his wife, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>. Had
<ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>'s "Gunsmoke" not been his opposition, his series might have lasted even
longer.;    <PERSON>George Leslie Gobel</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to a grocer father and a
mother who taught piano.;    <PERSON>Gobel</PERSON>'s interest in entertainment began as a
child, when he imitated his father's customers. He learned to play guitar in
grammar school and sang in a church choir. The choir appeared on a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>
radio station, and his solo won him an invitation to the <ORGANIZATION>Barn Dance</ORGANIZATION> program.; 
  <PERSON>Gobel</PERSON> learned to fly and in <DATE>1943</DATE> enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION>Army Air Corps.</ORGANIZATION>;    In
<DATE>1961</DATE>, <PERSON>Gobel</PERSON> was featured on Broadway in a musical adaptation of <PERSON>George
Abbott</PERSON>'s "Three Men on a Horse," retitled "Let It Ride." He also toured in
"The Odd Couple" and "The Last of the Red Hot Lovers.";    His films included
"The Birds and the Bees" and "I Married a Woman." He did many voice-overs for
TV commercials and was a regular on the syndicated "Hollywood Squares" game
show.;    There was a real <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> in <PERSON>Gobel</PERSON>'s life -- high school sweetheart,
<PERSON>Alice Humecki</PERSON>, whom he married in <DATE>1942</DATE>. She and their two daughters, son and
three grandchildren survive him.  </TEXT>

FT  01 DEC 94 / Arts: New England, hilarious but serious - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Richard Nelson</PERSON> has written a play at once brilliantly
accomplished and repulsively artificial. Every word, every scene, makes its
contribution to the whole. And not a word, not a scene, rings true.
Nelson is perhaps the most eminent of the several American playwrights who
now have the world premieres of their plays take place in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>New
England</LOCATION>, set in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> today, covers the events of one weekend, starting
almost at once with the onstage suicide of <LOCATION>Harry</LOCATION>, before the very eyes of
his cohabitrix, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>. Harry's children and brother promptly arrive. None of
them know <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> well, and none of them have ever previously met <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>, who
happens to have arrived as <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION>'s weekend guest some two minutes before
<PERSON>Harry</PERSON> blew his brains out. What follows is as hilarious as it is serious. Oh
yes, and all of them are English expats living in various parts of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>:
hence the ironic title.
Nelson's brilliance is most evident in his ability to keep juggling several
dissimilar objects in the air at once. In one scene, two of <LOCATION>Harry</LOCATION>'s children
and Tom do a jigsaw while airing various features of their own
Americanophobia, while the floorboards overhead tell everyone in the house
that <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s brother Alfred have been having sex for the past
hour. Meanwhile, all of them are trying to come to terms with <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s
suicide and are engaged artfully in preserving the illusion of fluent
discourse while actually jumping from subject to subject. Here and
everywhere else, <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> can sustain separate currents of farce, misery,
pathos, satire, irony, suspense, and cultural commentary.
But so what? Even in the four or five minutes before <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> becomes the late
<PERSON>Harry</PERSON>, the lines have been ringing hollow: with the blatantly
pseudo-naturalism of their construction, their self-interruptions, their
contrived non-sequiturs, their awful theatricality. 'Take it easy, this
can't be easy' - spoken by <PERSON>Tom to Alice</PERSON> - is a minor, but typical, example
of <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION>'s cleverness. What is its effect? Less to reveal <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>'s efforts to
console <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> than to show us how admirable <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> is in this little feat of
putting two apparently contradictory sentences back to back in unbroken
flow. Why is the jigsaw scene there at all? So that <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s son <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> can
utter lines (about apportioning jigsaw areas) 'The sky is mine.' Poor
<ORGANIZATION>Chekhov</ORGANIZATION>, whose tragicomic influence is everywhere obvious, must be blushing
in his grave; for <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION>'s artfulness is not what he - <PERSON>Chekhov</PERSON> - had in mind
at all.
Ironically, it is the theme for which <ORGANIZATION>Nelson</ORGANIZATION> is most renowned -
Anglo-American relations - which he has crafted least successfully here.
Most of the time, the occasional discussions that these English expats have
about the American culture in which they live are mere set pieces that could
be replaced by discussions of sex or traffic or art to the same effect (and
most of the play could be happening in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> anyway).
There are, we eventually see, two plot connections between <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s suicide
and his Americanophobe despair: the facts that he never told <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> that his
wife was still alive in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> until two months ago (and was still his
wife) and that, only minutes before his suicide and before the play's start,
he had reviled his daughter <PERSON>Gemma</PERSON> on the phone for planning to marry an
illiterate gardener's assistant in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> ('the barbarians are sweeping
over us'). Nelson leaves these bombs hanging unexploded in the air. Which
should be brilliant - except that the very way he shows the characters
avoiding their significance is too neat.
Nelson is often funny. There are lines and stories that make us laugh aloud,
and others at which we chuckle inwardly. On a larger scale, though, he
creates characters and situations without a jot of freshness in them. Paul's
French wife <PERSON>Sophie</PERSON> - humourless, possessive, coolly paranoid - is obviously
introduced solely as a two-dimensional comic device. Yet which of the
characters is three-dimen-sional? I could believe in none of them.
<PERSON>Peter Gill</PERSON>'s production and the performances by the seven actors are exactly
in harmony with the play: polished, fluent, amusing, contrived in their
naturalism, and unconvincing. <PERSON>Angela Thorne</PERSON> is Alice; <PERSON>Selina Cadell</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Diana Hardcastle</PERSON> are <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>'s daughters <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Gemma</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Duncan Bell</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Annie Corbier</PERSON> are <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Sophie</PERSON>; <PERSON>David Burke</PERSON> doubles as <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> and
his twin brother <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON>; <PERSON>Mick Ford</PERSON> is poor <PERSON>Tom</PERSON>. Possibly the play would seem
more persuasive if it were played with more spontaneity, but that would be
to swim against the current of its writing. <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> reminds us of real
life to the extent that a Faberge egg reminds us of a hen's egg.

and women did for our country and what made <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> great," said Herz.;   
"This tour in <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> features the former homes of working people; the
orchardists, farmers, cannery people who were the economic backbone of this
area. By preserving these homes, and others like it, we can show how these
people lived and what was important to them. And, in seeing some of the values
they had, we can incorporate them into our lives today.";    <ORGANIZATION>The
Young-Sartorette House</ORGANIZATION> was designed and built in <DATE>1928</DATE> for <ORGANIZATION>Earl</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia
Young</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Earl Young</PERSON>, a farmer and insurance agent, was also active in the <LOCATION>Prune</LOCATION>

POP CAPSULES : COOPER: FREAKY SIDESHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Alice Cooper</PERSON> was wearing dresses before <PERSON>David Bowie</PERSON> became an androgynous 
rebel, and he did stupid pet tricks with reptiles before <ORGANIZATION>Ozzy Osbourne</ORGANIZATION> went 
batty. Still, <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> is generally considered a freaky sideshow rather than a 
rock pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
His concert at the Pantages Theatre on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> was a forceful reminder that 
the endearingly tacky ghoul-rocker's anthems like "Eighteen" have influenced 
everything from punk to metal. History doesn't mean much, though, when you're 
only as valid as last week's sales report, so <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> (who also plays <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Theatre on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>) alternated his familiar shock-rockers 
with material from his latest album, "Trash." These songs, as faceless as most 
Republican-era rock, fit the <LOCATION>Bon Jovi</LOCATION> hit formula: predictable sing-alongs 
blasted with a technical efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> will headline <PERSON>Lee Atwater</PERSON>'s next function. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 
wives might be chagrined by the show's re-staging of the rumble from "West Side 
Story," with <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> slashing a girl's throat before singing "Only Women Bleed." 
But these contrived, comic-book theatrics are really as inoffensive as a 
spook-house ride. In fact, the most frightening part of the evening was 
probably the drum solo. CRAIG LEE

BROOKLYN PROSECUTOR CALLS IT 'A TERRIFYING SOCIAL PHENOMENON'; 
</P>
<P>
ABUSE, NEGLECT OF DEPENDENT ELDERS EMERGES AS NEW 'NATIONAL PASTIME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA METZLER, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice didn't dare wait for the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years and a bad hip weighing heavily 
-- but not as heavily as the need to get away from her 52-year-old son who was 
waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> headed for 
a neighbor's phone to let the police know that he had turned abusive again. 
</P>
<P>
"You work and support a child all your life," she said, "then they act like 
they hate you." 
</P>
<P>
Alice (not her real name) isn't alone. As many as 2 million elderly people may 
be abused, researchers say, often by their children, grandchildren, even 
great-grandchildren -- the very people they depend on for help in their old 
age. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens with these blood relatives -- sons, daughters, nieces, nephews," 
said <PERSON>Dorothy Brodie</PERSON>, a 75-year-old retired social worker who works with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Bronx Elder Abuse Support Project</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Abuse Common 
</P>
<P>
"They'll do things like keep telling the victim 'You're stupid. You're senile. 
You have Alzheimer's disease.' They'll do things like maybe even taking their 
dentures away so they're forced to eat soft food; or take eyeglasses away so 
they can't even read a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
One in 25 older adults is abused, according to an estimate in a <DATE>1985</DATE> report to 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, "Elder Abuse: A National Disgrace." The abuse takes all forms: 
psychological torment, neglect, theft -- and often, it is physical. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, an 18-year-old man punched and kicked his 87-year-old 
great-grandmother and later explained that: "She bugs me because she asks me to 
fix her something to eat." 
</P>
<P>
A 54-year-old salesman on <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> was charged last year with having 
brutalized his parents for three years while demanding that they turn over 
their life savings. When they saw police arrive, neighbors asked, "Did he kill 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
"'This is a terrifying social phenomenon," said <PERSON>Elizabeth Holtzman</PERSON>, district 
attorney of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>, where reports of such abuse have 
risen <PERCENT>400%</PERCENT> since <DATE>1986</DATE>, to 370 cases last year. She attributed the increase to 
the widespread use of crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Statistics 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported nationwide, <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> more than 
in <DATE>1987</DATE>, said <PERSON>Toshio Tatara</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aging Resource Center on 
Elder Abuse</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> "People still find it incredible that we abuse 
our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years ago -- and we're 
doing it like a national pastime." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, <ORGANIZATION>Tatara</ORGANIZATION> estimated that just one in 14 incidents is likely to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
The typical victim is 75 or older, a woman and generally dependent. The abuser 
often is a son or daughter, the congressional report said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> woman whose daughter 
kept her in a room that was so cold the urine in a catheter froze; about a 
75-year-old retired nurse from <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> whose 42-year-old son attacked him 
with a hatchet; about a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> woman whose <MONEY>$167,000</MONEY> estate was whittled 
to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> by a son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases are really difficult and scary, even to experienced social 
workers," said <PERSON>Lucy Friedman</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Victim Services Agency</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION>, which helped <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> seek a temporary restraining order against her son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Blames 'the Wine' 
</P>
<P>
"I was really afraid of him," said <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>. She still bears a scar on her neck 
where her son once sliced her. "Once he gets the wine, he goes crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The abusers many times have their own problems: a drug or alcohol problem, 
being out of work, broke or mentally unstable. The violent treatment may be 
repayment for abuse that the son or daughter received as a child. A crowded 
home may spark it; middle-aged people free at last of their own children may 
resent having to take in a frail parent. In some cases, the stress of caring 
for an elderly relative is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics called to a home in <LOCATION>San Fernando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, found 77-year-old <PERSON>Virginia 
Grimes Jeter</PERSON> covered with excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died 
<DATE>five hours later</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's daughter, <PERSON>Cynthia Jeter Green</PERSON>, 39, had promised her mother she 
would not put her in an old folks' home, prosecutor <PERSON>Lee Harris</PERSON> said. A 
probation report described <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> as "under a degree of emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Sentenced 
</P>
<P>
She pleaded no contest to abuse charges and was ordered to get psychiatric 
counseling and perform 300 hours of community service. She did not return 
several calls from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to put their loved 
ones in a nursing home, or feel they have to be responsible for total care, is 
fairly common in these cases," <PERSON>Rosalie Wolf</PERSON>, associate director of the 
<ORGANIZATION>University Center on Aging</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution is getting older people to take responsibility for 
stopping, even preventing abuse, said <PERSON>Lee Pearson</PERSON>, assistant manager of 
criminal justice services for the <ORGANIZATION>American Assn. of Retired Persons</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly people should keep regular appointments and stay in touch with old 
friends, especially after moving in with a relative, <PERSON>Pearson</PERSON> said. They should 
have someone stop by once a week to make sure that all is well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Assistance 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Victim Services Agency</ORGANIZATION> maintains a 24-hour phone line for access to 
counseling and help in court, getting locks changed, and finding shelter, 
transportation and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
In a <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION> group shelter called Safe Place, the elderly hesitantly confide what 
has happened to them and try to make sense of it. 
</P>
<P>
"People just believe and hope so much that this will be the last time, that 
things will change, he won't do it again -- but they do," said <PERSON>Diana Walcott</PERSON>, 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Bronx Elder Abuse Support Project</ORGANIZATION> and leader of Safe Place. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents blame themselves, <PERSON>Friedman</PERSON> said. "They say 'Well, how did I bring 
up this monster?' " 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> have statutes requiring that 
abuse be reported, but those involved with the cases say the nation has a long 
way to go toward recognizing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The states spend an average of <MONEY>$22</MONEY> to aid each abused child, but just <MONEY>$2.90</MONEY> for 
an abused older person, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> found. Its report recommended emergency 
shelters, tax credits for families caring for older adults, amendments to 
Medicare and Medicaid to eliminate limits on benefits and services to elderly 
people in relatives' homes, as well as mandatory reporting of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so foreign to our thinking," said <PERSON>Holtzman</PERSON>. "Doctors won't even ask if 
abuse has taken place. It's possible the person . . . will be sent back to the 
same environment, possibly to be killed."

ALICE KAHN: GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weird to be in high school again after all these years. Some things are the 
same; some things are different. The French have an expression for this, but I 
don't know what it is because I took Spanish. I heard it was easier. 
</P>
<P>
One thing you immediately notice that is different is that everyone in class 
seems to be over 40. It's Back to <ORGANIZATION>School Night</ORGANIZATION> at my daughter's high school, 
and for one evening I must live through a condensed version of what she lives 
through every day. 
</P>
<P>
Our classes are 10 minutes instead of 50, which is about as long as I could 
ever sit still in a high school class. When the bell rings, we must figure out 
the difficult task: how to get from the top of H Building to the bottom of C 
Building in five minutes. Even aerobically correct mothers come panting in 
late, saying, "This is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
That five-minute fix of hall time is still my favorite part of high school. I 
walk through the halls as I did then, my eyes scanning for Whom I Know. 
</P>
<P>
There are three kinds of parents I see at Back to <ORGANIZATION>School Night</ORGANIZATION>. There are 
people who look familiar and I can't place. These are the people I'll pass and 
then suddenly stop dead and scream down the hall of G Building, "Hey, you're my 
gynecologist!" 
</P>
<P>
There are the parents I don't know. We sit in class together and share grins of 
solidarity as the teacher says, "Of course, your student has told you that the 
essay is due tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the parents I know from various past lives: political groups, 
support groups, Lamaze class, our kids' nursery school, grade school, camp, 
<LOCATION>Brownies</LOCATION>, as well as old friends from the days when we had time for a social 
life. Sometimes we look at each other as if we are mirror images of Dorian 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, is that you?" says some old lady. I realize with horror that she's my 
age! 
</P>
<P>
I say "Hi" in C Hall to <LOCATION>Bob</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Roxanne</PERSON>. (Still together, I note.) Their 
daughter is a senior. "Where's <PERSON>Leah</PERSON> going to college?" I ask them. 
</P>
<P>
"As close to the beach as possible," is the reply. 
</P>
<P>
Bob -- <PERSON>Butcher Bob</PERSON>, as I knew him when his long black hair was restrained with 
a macrame headband -- is right on target. His beard is graying. But his wife 
<PERSON>Roxanne</PERSON> is a traitor. Her blond hair isn't even turning dishwater brown. 
There's not a wrinkle in her face. "Throw her in the sun," I say as I dash off 
to Trig. 
</P>
<P>
We pass a guy named <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> who was there for the baby boy he had in <DATE>1974</DATE>, the 
year he shaved his head. The son he had named Moonlight is currently going by 
the name of <PERSON>Dan</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Steve</PERSON> and his now ex-wife sat side by side in class, each holding a baby from 
their latest marriages. All very friendly. And <PERSON>Steve</PERSON> has no need to shave his 
head anymore. One more year and time will accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
As we go through the classes, I realize how the scene changes, depending on 
what role you're playing. When I was a student, I thought that all that the 
teachers cared about was coming up with irrational and boring assignments. I 
viewed it as my role then to assert creative control of the classroom through a 
constant volley of wisecracks. Through my cleverness, I spent a lot of time 
writing "I Will Not" statements and managed to keep my grade-point average 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s, when it was my turn to serve on the other side of the desk, 
as a young high school teacher, I saw the obstacles to creative teaching. It 
wasn't just the pay, it was the politics. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when I explained my course at a Back to <ORGANIZATION>School Night</ORGANIZATION>, a dad suddenly 
stood up, waved the book I had assigned and screamed, "You are blaspheming 
God's name!" 
</P>
<P>
The book was <PERSON>Ray Bradbury</PERSON>'s "The Martian Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
In class tonight, I see the teachers struggling to juggle the various political 
dumbbells that might smack them in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The journalism teacher explains that the students are critiquing humor columns 
that have appeared recently in the school paper to see if they are racist or 
sexist. (I really need to hear about offensive humor columns when I'm off 
duty!) 
</P>
<P>
The biology teacher answers a parent by saying that no, she did not, intend to 
kill frogs. "We have computer programs to dissect frogs now," she says. The 
approving nod from the parent tells the teacher she has passed. 
</P>
<P>
The English teacher explains that they are reading <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON>'s "The 
Crucible." A father raises his hand. "Are you linking that to McCarthyism and 
the Communist witch hunts?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she tells him, that's the whole point. He says, "Good! Good!" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you linking it to the Salem witch hunts?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
She stares at me uncertainly. Dumb parents are not in her contract. 
</P>
<P>
Now, why do I still do things like that? 
</P>
<P>
One more smart-alecky question from you, <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, and you'll have to write 100 
times: "I will act like a grown-up on parents' night."

HART OF GOLD: Who's the world's youngest popster? Our money's on <PERSON>Taro Hart</PERSON>, son 
of Grateful Dead drummer <PERSON>Mickey Hart</PERSON>, who is the co-star of <PERSON>Hart</PERSON>'s new album,

   AND BOB AND CAROL and Ted and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> thought they knew all the angles? 

   (We borrow the familiar names to relate a gift-tax scam involving brothers.) 
One may give <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> a year each to any number of people, free of gift tax. 
So, in <DATE>1982 through 1985</DATE>, <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> each gave <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to each of their two children and <PERSON>Ted</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s three children; Ted and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> each gave <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to each of the five children. 
Also in <DATE>1982</DATE>, Ted and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> each gave <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> (<MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> over the limit) to each of <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carol</PERSON>; in <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, Ted and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> each gave <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to each of Bob and <PERSON>Carol</PERSON>. 

   In the next episode, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> audited the foursome, who claimed that only the <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> excesses of <DATE>1982</DATE> were subject to gift tax. 
But in private ruling 8717003, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> takes the couples to task and tax: The reciprocal transfers between families were related and generally equal. 
They doubled what each child got. 
Ted's and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s gifts to <PERSON>Bob</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> in effect repaid gifts to <PERSON>Ted</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>'s third child. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> found that each parent should be treated as having given each of his or her own children <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> a year -- twice the exempt sum. 

   IRS WARNINGS to abusive-shelter investors are upheld by appeals judges. 

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Judge Neese</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, found that <ORGANIZATION>Mid-South Music Corp.</ORGANIZATION> promoted illegal shelters. 
But in <DATE>1985</DATE>, he also ordered the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> to pay damages for illegally revealing company tax information to investors; <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> letters, sent before it took public action against <LOCATION>Mid-South</LOCATION>, warned investors that they risked audits and penalties if they claimed the shelter deductions. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> turned to the sixth-circuit appeals court. 
Now a three-judge panel has held that the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>'s pre-filing notices didn't violate the confidentiality of <ORGANIZATION>Mid-South</ORGANIZATION>'s returns and has reversed the damage award. 
<PERSON>Judge Norris</PERSON> said the notices identified Mid-South as a shelter promoter, not a taxpayer, and gave "no indication" that its returns were being audited or investigated. 

   ANON. WRITES another hit: The official tax-act handbook. 

   The "General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of <DATE>1986</DATE>, Prepared by the Staff of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Committee on Taxation</ORGANIZATION>," or "blue book," is a best seller for the <ORGANIZATION>Government Printing Office</ORGANIZATION>. 
Some 13,450 copies of the first printing of 14,870 have been sold at <MONEY>$31</MONEY>, mailing included. 
Experts peruse the 1,379 pages, especially notes on probable technical corrections, to see how far the anonymous authors have advanced understanding of what <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> really meant. 

   But <PERSON>Uncle Sam</PERSON> can be undersold: Prentice-Hall, using "non-archival paper," sells a two-pound, 1.7-ounce facsimile at <MONEY>$16</MONEY> prepaid, including mailing; the GPO book weighs two pounds, 10.5 ounces. 
<ORGANIZATION>Commerce Clearing House</ORGANIZATION> offers a one-pound, 13.4-ounce facsimile at <MONEY>$15</MONEY>, plus mailing. 
Both publishers report brisk sales above the tens of thousands of copies given to their regular subscribers. 
Two publishers resell the GPO book-Bureau of <ORGANIZATION>National Affairs</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$51</MONEY>, Tax Notes magazine for <MONEY>$48</MONEY> plus mailing. 

   Just out is a separate, 235-page explanation of <DATE>1986</DATE> technical corrections to past acts; GPO price, <MONEY>$6.50</MONEY>. 

   AFTER THEIR DIVORCE, <PERSON>Louise</PERSON> stayed on with <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> to look after their seven kids. 
He paid all her expenses; they later had another child. 
She wasn't just employed as a housekeeper, as the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> argued, the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> decided. 
It let <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> claim his ex-wife as a dependent. 

   MOVING ON: <PERSON>Roger Olsen</PERSON>, resigning <DATE>June 4</DATE> as assistant attorney general for tax, will join the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> office of Fried, <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Shriver &amp; Jacobson Aug.</ORGANIZATION> 1. 
<PERSON>John Murray</PERSON> is retiring as deputy assistant attorney general for tax this week to join an unidentified law firm. 

   INFORMATION RETURNS, such as the Form 1099 reports on interest payments by banks, must be filed in high-volume cases on magnetic tape or other "machine-readable" forms. 
New <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> rules say failure to comply will subject a payer to penalties for failing to file the reports at all. 

   ROYALTIES may be costly for software corporations that chose "S" status. 

   Tax revision created incentives for a closely held regular corporation to become an S corporation, taxed like a partnership. 
But many computer-programming concerns that get passive income -- royalties -- from licensing software fell unawares into a trap, says <PERSON>Charles Medallis</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, CPAs. 
They are successful concerns that ploughed profits into expansion and so had large earnings and profits on their books when they converted to S status. 

   The companies have run afoul of two S-corporation rules, <PERSON>Medallis</PERSON> says: First, if an S concern holds earnings and profits from its regular-corporation days, and over <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of gross receipts is passive income (royalties), the excess passive income is taxable to the company (instead of only to its owners) at the highest corporate rate. 
Second, if that happens for three straight years, the company's S status is canceled. 

   Companies that would have trouble paying out profits to owners may seek to change the law, <PERSON>Medallis</PERSON> says. 

   BRIEFS: The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> created an award plaque for law-enforcement people who make significant contributions to its criminal investigations. . . . 
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> issued instructions for the required reporting of real-estate transactions on Form 1099-B. . . . 
<ORGANIZATION>The House Ways and Means</ORGANIZATION> oversight panel plans hearings in the <DATE>week of June 22</DATE> on exempt entities' taxable business activities.

   What a groovy guy that <PERSON>Jason Voorhees</PERSON> is _ ahead
of his time with that goalie mask fashion look, and ever so
creative with axes, knives and spears.
   He's a real human slice-and-dice machine, but not not too many
