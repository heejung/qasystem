<LEADPARA>  Q What is the "dew point" that they are always mentioning on weather reports?;

<MEMO>  Q&amp;A  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Fostoria, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>; A The dew point is the temperature at which moisture would
start to condense out of air if the air were cooled. The reason the moisture
condenses out is because warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air
can.;    Suppose you were in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in the <DATE>summer</DATE>, and the temperature was 80
degrees, with <PERCENT>91 percent</PERCENT> humidity. That would mean the air had <PERCENT>91 percent</PERCENT> of
the maximum amount of water vapor it could hold at 80 degrees. But if you took
that air and cooled it to 77 degrees, it would no longer be able to hold all
that moisture, and water would begin to condense out, according to <ORGANIZATION>San Jose
State University</ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON>Peter Lester</PERSON>. At 77 degrees, you would have
reached the dew point.;    On the other hand, if you were in the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>
desert on an 80-degree day, with <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> humidity, the dew point would be a
mere 28 degrees. You would have to chill that dry desert air to below freezing
before any water would condense out.;    Although the humidity varies with the
temperature, the dew point depends solely on the moisture content of the air.
For example, if you cooled that 80-degree desert air, its humidity would rise
steadily until it finally reached <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> at the dew point temperature of
28 degrees. But all those temperatures and humidities along the way would have
the same dew point -- 28 degrees -- as long as the amount of water in the air
didn't change.;    Meteorologists use the dew point as one of many indicators
of what kind of weather to expect. High dew points, for example, are good
predictors of thunderstorms. And if the dew point is not far below the air
temperature, that means fog is likely when the temperature drops at night.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Japan Shoring Up Two Rocks to Preserve Sea Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So what if two tiny, faraway rocks crumble or sink
into the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>? <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> might lose fishing and mining rights to
155,000 square miles of ocean, that's what, so it is spending about
<MONEY>$236 million</MONEY> to shore them up.
   The rocks called <LOCATION>North Dew</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>East Dew</LOCATION>, each barely large
enough for a person to sleep on, are <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s southernmost points
and hold the key to treasure in this age of national
economic-control zones extending 200 miles from shore.
   Since <DATE>April</DATE>, about 200 workers using helicopters and
ship-mounted cranes have surrounded them with thousands of
four-pointed steel blocks, like anchors. The blocks form protective
circles 165 feet in diameter on a coral reef about 10 feet below
the surface 1,100 miles south of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Haruo Aoki</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Construction Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s coastal department
said the work has cost <MONEY>17 billion yen</MONEY> (<MONEY>$134 million</MONEY>) so far and
total is expected to be <MONEY>30 billion yen</MONEY>. He said the circles will be
filled with concrete, beginning next year.
   At high tide, the rocks extend 3 to 10 feet above sea level. If
the tide should cover them, the reef no longer could be defined as
an island and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> no longer could claim a 200-mile economic zone
around it.
   That means the nation's southermost point would move about 300
miles north, between the <LOCATION>Volcano Islands</LOCATION> on the east and the
<LOCATION>Yaeyama Islands</LOCATION>.
   North Dew and <LOCATION>East Dew</LOCATION> are about a mile apart on the reef, which
was an island called <ORGANIZATION>Parece Vela</ORGANIZATION> when it appeared on 17th century
Spanish navigation charts.
   The Japanese call it Okinotorishima (Remote Bird Island) and
official records say it was put under <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s jurisdiction in <DATE>1931</DATE>.
It is recognized as Japanese in the World War II peace treaty.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> declared a 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the
reef in <DATE>1977</DATE>, following the international trend to such areas of
control.
   Both rocks are shaped like mushrooms with thin stems attached to
the submerged reef, which is about three miles square. North Dew is
about 15{ feet in diameter and <LOCATION>East Dew</LOCATION> just over half that size.
   Agriculture Ministry figures say 2,577 tons of bonito, tuna and
other fish were caught in the 200-mile zone around them in <DATE>1985</DATE>,
the last year for which figures are available. The catch was worth
<MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> at the current rate of exchange.
   No signs of oil have been reported but surveys are continuing to
determine whether mining of cobalt, nickel and other metals would
be feasible on the undersea mountain capped by the reef, said
<PERSON>Motohiko Kato</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>International Trade and Industry Ministry's
National Resources and Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   The mountain rises 16,400 to 19,700 feet from the ocean floor.
   No estimate has been made of how much <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> would lose if the
rocks slipped below the surface and the area around Okinotorishima
became international, an <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official said.

comes from the <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> library system. The rest must be raised
though grants and fund-raisers, <PERSON>Barrett</PERSON> said.;   All proceeds from the cow

<PERSON>Barrett</PERSON> said.;   The <LOCATION>South County</LOCATION> office runs a tutoring program for adults
that, on average, has about 50 volunteer tutors working one-on-one with
students, he said.;   In addition, the office operates pilot reading programs
for children at <ORGANIZATION>Jordan School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Gilroy</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>P.A. Walsh School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Morgan Hill.</LOCATION>;
  In those programs, volunteers read to children who may not be read to at

FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Two 'Beauties' - The Cullen Theater, Houston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must have seemed a splendid idea at the time - and <LOCATION>Houston Grand Opera</LOCATION>
during <PERSON>David Gockley</PERSON>'s 20-year directorship, has consistently traded in
lively ideas about expanding the repertory, as the company track record
shows.
A specially commissioned new 'Beauty and the <LOCATION>Beast</LOCATION>' opera, Desert of Roses
by <PERSON>Robert Moran</PERSON>, was to be played in alternation with an updating of
<ORGANIZATION>Gretry</ORGANIZATION>'s 1771 Zemire et <PERSON>Azor</PERSON>, which has the same theme. Both the new and the
old version of the fairytale would have English texts, the Zemire (by
Marmontel) translated by <PERSON>John Michael LaChiusa</PERSON>, the Desert of Roses
librettist. Both would be staged by <PERSON>John Dew</PERSON>, the Englishman resident in
<LOCATION>Bielefeld</LOCATION>. The Zemire production had originally been devised for that city;
the <LOCATION>Desert</LOCATION> is due to make the journey there later in the year.
A plausible package - but this time, alas, <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s luck in arranging such
things ran out, for the wrapping proved both flashy and ill-finished, and
the contents, though in themselves by no means valueless, had been
injudiciously selected.
Last <DATE>November</DATE> Dew gave Covent Garden audiences that wretchedly empty,
poorly-warmed-over Les Huguenots in modern dress. In similar vein he had
conceived of <ORGANIZATION>Gretry</ORGANIZATION>'s lovely, tender, sturdily fashioned opera-comique fable
(which Londoners remember from the <DATE>1981</DATE> Camden Festival revival) as an
exercise in pop updating, with the <LOCATION>Beast</LOCATION> as a rock-singer, <ORGANIZATION>Beauty</ORGANIZATION>'s father a
vacuum-cleaner salesman, and other bits and bobs of added Americana.
The taste level was pitched low - so low, in fact, that <PERSON>Gockley</PERSON> (who
apparently acquired the staging sight unseen) asked for 11th-hour
improvements and amendments. At this point Dew left town, and both shows,
still credited to him, were patched together by assistants.
This Zemire may have amused those spectators who find the whole notion of
opera got up to look like bad television killingly funny - Dew's borrowings
from game shows, celebrity interviews and rock spectaculars were of
unwavering predictability. But it was still a distressing example of
Producer's Patronage - of an audience presumed stupid enough, and a work
presumed trashy enough, to need 'help' of this kind. Apart from praising the
bright-toned Zemire of <PERSON>Diana Amos</PERSON>, and relishing the promise of another
young soprano, <PERSON>Kimla Beasley</PERSON>, as her sister Fatime, one is probably well
advised to pass over the whole sorry thing without further comment.
Desert of Roses had a lot more going for it. <PERSON>Moran</PERSON>, a 54-year-old American
avant-gardist previously best known for his humorous music-theatre
extravagances (such his <DATE>1971</DATE> Hallelujah for 20 marching bands, 40 church
choirs, organs, carillons, rock and gospel groups, and the entire city of
<LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>), has come to 'straight' opera via The Juniper Tree
(<DATE>1985</DATE>), which he composed in collaboration with <PERSON>Philip Glass</PERSON>, and which <ORGANIZATION>HGO</ORGANIZATION>
performed in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
He has stripped his 'Beauty' of conceptual posturing, experimentalist
pranks, and indeed of all avant-garderie; the score, written for
chamber-forces plus delicately used synthesisers, is catchy in what one
might call a minimalist-plus vein, with tootling um-cha-um-cha
accompaniments (well handled by the <ORGANIZATION>HGO</ORGANIZATION> music director <PERSON>John DeMain</PERSON>) layered
upon harmonies high in sugar content.
Moran writes well for voices, and knows how and where to place his numbers;
where he and <PERSON>LaChiusa</PERSON> showed their inexperience was in being seldom able to
get to the point, economically and quickly. Both on the comic family scenes
 -Beauty here has an ugly brother as well as two ugly sisters - and on those
of sentiment I found myself itching to wield an editor's pruning shears.
Because of this, and the sweet-toothed idiom, the whole work seemed blander
than it should or could have. But maybe the production was also to blame: it
was sad that the apt prettiness of the decor (designed by <PERSON>Heinz Balthes</PERSON>) had
not been matched by a similar aptness in the direction of the comedy
characters - gross clowning is clearly a John Dew trademark.
There were two fine young sopranos to note: <PERSON>Jayne West</PERSON> (Beauty) dewy-fresh
and appealing, <PERSON>Stella Zambalis</PERSON> (Woman, a narrator-chorus figure) strikingly
rich-toned. About this 'Beauty' at least, and for all its imperfections,
<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> need feel no embarrassment.

<HEAD>Newspaper Fires Woman for Anti-Abortion Activities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newsroom receptionist fired for her
anti-abortion activities, including picketing, says her rights have
been infringed, but the newspaper says her actions violated its
long-standing ethics policy.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Journal</ORGANIZATION>'s dismissal of <ORGANIZATION>Diane Dew</ORGANIZATION> has prompted the
filing of a grievance by the newspaper employees union, an
investigation by a state agency and complaints by a religious
freedom organization.
   But Deputy Managing Editor <PERSON>Howard Fibich</PERSON> said the Journal stands
by its decision to fire Ms. Dew even though The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post did not discipline employees in similar
circumstances.
   ``She was part of the news process,'' <PERSON>Fibich</PERSON> said. ``She did not
report the news but she handled the news. She took dictation from
reporters and that type of thing.''
   The newspaper's ethics code, established in <DATE>1973</DATE>, prohibits
newsroom employees from participating in many outside political
activities and also from accepting gifts from outside sources, the
newspaper said.
   ``The reason that it (code) is there is to make sure that we are
able to maintain an image of objectivity,'' <PERSON>Fibich</PERSON> said. ``In my
judgment, our credibility is a precious asset and nothing must
compromise that.''
   Attorney <PERSON>Craig Parshall</PERSON>, who represents <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON>, said his client
was fired as a part-time receptionist-secretary in <DATE>July</DATE> after she
refused to sign a statement promising to end her anti-abortion
activities.
   <PERSON>Parshall</PERSON> said <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON>'s activities were brought to the
newspaper's attention after a reporter saw her participating in an
anti-abortion protest.
   <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON> said she feels compelled to protest abortion and that
the newspaper's restrictions violate her right to free speech and
religion.
   ``I can't just choose not to believe what I believe,'' she said.
``I'm responsible to speak out because I feel that abortion is
murder and murder is wrong.''
   <PERSON>Bob Dye</PERSON>, communications manager for <ORGANIZATION>Journal-Sentinel Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the
newspaper's parent company, said <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON> was warned that her
actions violated the ethics code and was offered another job
outside the newsroom with no loss in pay, but turned it down.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Rutherford Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a Milwaukee-area group that
specializes in cases of religious liberty, filed a religious
discrimination complaint on <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON>'s behalf.
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Equal Rights Division</ORGANIZATION> is investigating to determine if
<PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON> was a victim of discrimination, said <PERSON>John Kimble</PERSON>, program
supervisor of investigation in the agency <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> office. If the
division finds there is probable cause to rule discrimination
occurred, the case will go to a hearing, he said.
   The <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>Newspaper Guild</ORGANIZATION>, a labor union,
filed a grievance with the Journal challenging the dismissal.
   ``We argued that her activities were protected by our contract
and that the company violated the contract by trying to force upon
her a different set of working conditions,'' local president <PERSON>Mike
Kuchta</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Fibich</PERSON> said <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON>'s position on abortion played no role in her
dismissal. If she was a pro-choice activist the newspaper would
have taken the same action, he said.
   He cited an abortion rights march in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <DATE>last spring</DATE> in
which reporters from the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post
participated.
   ``I thought that was unacceptable,'' he said. ``If it had
happened here, the people involved would have been somehow
reprimanded.''
   Times editors disagreed with <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON>Linda
Greenhouse</PERSON>'s decision to participate in the march, but they took no
punitive action, Assistant Managing Editor <PERSON>Warren Hoge</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Richard Harwood</PERSON>, ombudsman at the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION>, said no disciplinary
action was taken against the few reporters who were involved in the
abortion rights march.
   ``People were reminded that this was inappropriate and that you
are not to take part in political activities if you work for The
Washington Post,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Harwood</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION>'s ethics code does not mention newsroom
secretaries and he could not say for certain if they are bound by
the code.

Only Hunt and <PERSON>Dews</PERSON> are seniors. Is it too late to break up the Scorpions? 
</P>
<P>
Too late, perhaps, for the league, as <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> became the first team in four 
years other than <LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION> to earn part of the league title. Against <ORGANIZATION>Newbury 
Park</ORGANIZATION>, the Scorpions did it with <PERSON>Harbour</PERSON>, who scored 23 points, including six of 
13 shots from three-point range. And <PERSON>Dews</PERSON>, who added 16, two from 12 feet away 
with 1:55 left that gave <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> a 58-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And Foster, who had 12 rebounds plus a layup with 12 seconds remaining to seal 
the win. And <PERSON>Schnell</PERSON>, who scored a sneaky 12 points. And Hunt, who played 
rugged defense despite a badly bruised right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
All so simple? Not really. Newbury Park, led by <PERSON>Wayne Cook</PERSON>'s 20 points and 11 
rebounds, trailed, <DATE>45-35</DATE>, but rallied to take a 52-51 lead with 5:38 left on 
<ORGANIZATION>Cook</ORGANIZATION>'s 16-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, free throws by <PERSON>Dews</PERSON> and Foster and <LOCATION>Harbour</LOCATION>'s sixth three-point basket 
gave the Scorpions a 56-52 lead they never relinquished. Harbour, who had 
struggled for two games, had finally broken out. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach <PERSON>John Harbour</PERSON>: "He came through and hit some big shots for us. He 
(always) thinks he's going to make the next five. And that's a quality you've 
got to have." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly so against <ORGANIZATION>Newbury Park</ORGANIZATION> (13-10, 4-8), which but for some poor 
free-throw shooting (the <ORGANIZATION>Panthers</ORGANIZATION> missed the front end of five one-and-one 
opportunities), could have upset the Scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry light, by the way, is out. Camarillo is heading to the payoff 
window. Or should that be playoff window?

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pernod trades a whiskey for a

<TEXT>
<LOCATION>Pernod Ricard</LOCATION>, the French drinks group, yesterday announced it would swap
one of its Irish whiskey brands for a Canadian whisky owned by <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION>
of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>.
The French group said the exchange of <LOCATION>Tullamore Dew</LOCATION> for Royal Canadian would
allow it to expand its range of whiskies. It currently owns several Irish
whiskeys, including Jamesons and Bushmills; Scotch whiskies such as Abelour;
and a bourbon, <LOCATION>Wild Turkey</LOCATION>. However it does not have a Canadian whisky
brand.
The deal will also give <ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> its first Irish whiskey. 'It is a niche
premium brand which does well in international duty free,' said the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>
group. 'It is a good addition to our portfolio.'
The deal involves only the distribution of the whiskies. Pernod's
subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION>Irish Distillers</ORGANIZATION>, will continue to produce <ORGANIZATION>Tullamore Dew</ORGANIZATION>, while
<ORGANIZATION>Allied-Lyons</ORGANIZATION> will produce Royal Canadian. The Canadian whisky brand is
currently distributed by <PERSON>Hiram Walker</PERSON>, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> group.
Pernod said it would also receive payment for <ORGANIZATION>Tullamore Dew</ORGANIZATION> since it was
more profitable than Royal Canadian. However it declined to disclose the
amount.
Pernod's whisky business is its second-largest division, in terms of sales,
after its aperitif drink. The company said whisky was one of the fastest
growing segments of the French drinks market, although demand remained
depressed in international markets.
L'Union des Assurances de <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> (UAP), the French insurance group, announced
yesterday that the advisory banks for its privatisation were to be <ORGANIZATION>Banque
Lazard</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Banque Nationale de Paris</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Banque Worms</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>UAP</ORGANIZATION> flotation is likely to go ahead after the sale of <LOCATION>Elf Aquitaine</LOCATION>,
scheduled for early <DATE>1994</DATE>.

<HL> What Is Our Man

He Is Angling to Hook Up
With Some Dew Worms,
But They Turn on Him

By Gary Lamphier
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<DATELINE> ARVA, Ontario  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> on the front nine at <ORGANIZATION>Sunningdale Country Club</ORGANIZATION> with not a golfer in sight. 

   A can of worms is strapped to my right ankle, a can of sawdust to my left. 
A miner's lamp glows on my forehead as I hunt for my quarry: "Lumbricus terrestris," the Canadian dew worm, the American night crawler. 

   He is everywhere -- poking out of his burrow, lolling on the stubby grass, playing chicken with his predators, of which I am one. 

   I step gingerly, dip dewy fingers into sawdust for a better grip on the slimy creatures, crouch low and pinch. 
Fffft. 
A worm zips through my fingers and underground, leaving a sticky mucus as his calling card. 
"You don't know how to pick," scolds <PERSON>Ola Przyszlak</PERSON>, a sturdy woman who does. 
She will round up 3,000 worms tonight while I snag fewer than 50, not counting ones I accidentally tear in two. 

   Several thousand pickers like <PERSON>Mrs. Przyszlak</PERSON> hunt for worms starting in <DATE>April</DATE> and continuing until about now on golf courses and pastures in southern <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>. 
They catch about half the 2.5 billion worms that American anglers buy each year, says <PERSON>Alan Tomlin</PERSON>, the Canadian government's lone worm researcher. 
As a Canadian crop, dew worms aren't in a class with wheat, say, but they are "larger than <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s onion business, almost as big as tomatoes," he says. 

   Though worms help to aerate and mix the soil, they are generally reviled by all except the Maoris of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, who consider certain varieties delicacies, and anglers, who revere them as bait for freshwater fish from bass to catfish. 
Worms hereabouts swarm to the surface on mild, damp nights, to soak up oxygen through their slimy skins. 
When conditions are just right, as after a rain, a top picker can grab 20,000 and earn about <MONEY>$380</MONEY>. 
But tonight is too hot and dry. 
Our dozen-member crew collects only 10,000 worms. 
My three wriggling handfuls bring about <MONEY>95 cents</MONEY>. 

   Picking worms is nauseating, backbreaking toil. 
"At least you didn't get sick," <PERSON>Mrs. Przyszlak</PERSON> tells me, recalling one first-time picker who did. 
The work is done mainly by Vietnamese and other new immigrants. 
As with the Hungarians who many say started <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s worm trade in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> or the Greeks and <LOCATION>South Koreans</LOCATION> who followed, the dew worm is their slippery ticket to a better life. 

   "No worms in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
No business," says <PERSON>Bohdan Ciekanski</PERSON>, a bearded former tool-and-die maker who has been in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> just three weeks and is learning grassroots capitalism. 
"We are miners," he jokes, tapping his headlamp. 

   This can be underground work in other ways. 
The Canadian worm industry has no association, no regulators, no statistics and a wary view of outsiders. 
"A lot of these people don't pay taxes and don't want to advertise it," says <PERSON>Joseph Hubert</PERSON>, a worm wholesaler who stores his livestock in a warehouse under a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> expressway. 

   One of the few places worm traders surface is the Cafe Santan, a spartan coffee bar sandwiched between a real-estate office and women's clothing shop in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>'s Greek neighborhood. 
Cafe Santan is the Comex of the worm world. 

   One morning, the surrounding streets are lined with dozens of boxy <PERSON>Dodge Maxivans</PERSON>, the trucks preferred for ferrying crews and worms to and from picking sites, sometimes 150 miles away. 
"After a good night, there might be 15 million worms on the street," says <PERSON>Carole Lynch</PERSON>, who runs a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, wholesale business with her husband, <PERSON>Larry Hurlbut</PERSON>. 

   Almost 100 worm brokers and wholesalers crowd the coffee shop and the sidewalk outside, for one-on-one bargaining over the cargo in the trucks. 
Some shout and wave their arms, some whisper urgently. 
The same worms may change hands several times in a morning, and the wholesale price may move as much as <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> in a day. 
This season's price paid to wholesalers typically was <MONEY>$35</MONEY> or more for a thousand worms (in terms of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar), representing a markup almost <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> from the price paid to pickers. 
By the time the worms reach fishermen in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, the price typically exceeds <MONEY>$1</MONEY> a dozen, or <MONEY>$83</MONEY> a thousand. 

   Brokers buy and sell worms in a hurry because they don't have a place to store them. 
Wholesalers operate refrigerated warehouses where they store styrofoam cartons of dirt and hibernating worms. 

   The worms snuggle in their cartons as long as they think the sun is shining. 
But a stampede can start if someone accidentally turns off the warehouse lights. 
When that happened in <PERSON>Mr. Hurlbut</PERSON>'s warehouse, he says, he found 50,000 worms all over the floor and three or four feet up the walls. 

   For wholesalers with fixed costs, price fluctuations can be murder. 
<PERSON>George Alifagonis</PERSON> says his wholesale business went belly up in <DATE>1982</DATE> when he bought high-priced worms he couldn't sell. 

   Pickers face risks, too. 
Bulls in the pasture, for instance. 
"They chase our people. 
The animals are so big and our people are so small," says the Vietnamese foreman of my worm-picking crew. 

   More worrisome are worm thieves and poachers who gate-crash on pastures or golf courses leased to legitimate operators. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hurlbut</PERSON> says he pays about <MONEY>$2,275</MONEY> to lease a course like <LOCATION>Sunningdale</LOCATION> from dusk to dawn for a season. 
When poachers show up, fights can erupt. 
"That's a good part of the reason I have Goliath," says <PERSON>Mr. Hurlbut</PERSON>, patting his German shepherd. 

   Police in <LOCATION>Chatham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, say marauders broke through the concrete wall of a warehouse there this <DATE>summer</DATE> and stole 200,000 worms. 

   Worms are picked commercially in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, mostly in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>. 
Some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> producers even use electric rods that somehow coax worms to come up. 
But, says <PERSON>Wayne King</PERSON>, a wholesaler in <LOCATION>Canton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, "there's more worms go into <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> after a good night's picking than all the worms produced in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> in a whole year." 

   Why is this corner of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> so blessed with worms? 
<PERSON>Mr. Tomlin</PERSON>, the government researcher, believes <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s thick winter snow cover protects dew worms from predators and helps them live longer, multiply faster, and grow bigger than other worms. 
Because dew worms snooze for months in refrigerated coolers at temperatures that would kill other varieties of worms, he says, "Shelf life goes up -- you can ship them great distances." 

   <PERSON>Robert Lytle</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, wholesaler, says hotter, drier summers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> limit worm picking except in the <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
"Our season is short, so we can't attract people" to pick, he says. 
"There's more of a professional worm catcher in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>." 

   But <PERSON>Mr. Alifagonis</PERSON>, who now works for the bait-wholesaling business of his brother, <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, says worms are getting harder to find in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and they are smaller than they used to be. 
"Something is wrong," he says, tugging his graying beard. 
"It must be the acid rain." 

   He also worries about a deteriorating work ethic. 
"You don't see young people picking worms. 
They want the easy life. 
I don't know what's going to happen with this generation," he frets. 
But after early stints as a cab driver and construction worker, he says, he plans to stay in the business he has been in for 17 years. 
"You know any work that's not hard?" he asks.

as "Little Shop of Horrors.";   None of his wares, however, bring to mind the
grotesque potted man-eater in that film. Rather, they appear deceptively
innocent.;   The bladderworts look fragile on the surface, with dainty
blossoms nodding on wire-thin stalks. But underground, fast-moving suction
cups are lapping up nematodes.;   The sundews seem equally innocuous. They
resemble scrawny, long-armed cactuses misted with glistening dew -- a "dew" so
gluey that insects rarely break away from its grasp.;   Once the dew secures a
victim, the plant's arm slowly curls around the creature and consumes it with
a secretion of digestive juice.;   Only the nepenthes (nuh-PEN-theeze), loopy
tropical vines strung with potato-size pods full of liquid enzymes -- look
capable of violence.;   Purple veins streak their pods, and rows of horizontal
thorns run up the corners of the pods, serving as tiny ladders that lead bugs
and sometimes mice to doom.;   Despite these aggressive meal-acquisition
tools, no one was sure plants could eat insects until the <DATE>1860s</DATE>, when <PERSON>Charles
Darwin</PERSON> began experimenting with botanical carnivores.;   Sundews, he wrote at
the time, interested him more "than the origin of all the species in the
world." He spent years figuring out what and how they consumed.;   "He'd feed
them hard-boiled egg, which they will eat," <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> said. "They'll even eat
chocolate and cheese, which gives them indigestion.";   Thanks to <PERSON>Darwin</PERSON>'s
discoveries -- and thanks to improved glassmaking and heating technology,
which made greenhouses possible -- Victorians took a fancy to carnivores in
general and nepenthes in particular.;   The voracious vines gorged on indoor
pests until fuel shortages in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> during World War I
killed all but a few collections.;   Interest in them flagged until the <DATE>1970s</DATE>,
when back-to-nature enthusiasts flirted with almost every form of interior
greenery. But carnivores did not enjoy a long return to the limelight, mainly
because they often disappointed their inexperienced owners by dying.;   "It's
tricky to get the conditions right: the soil, the water, the humidity, the
light," said <PERSON>Geoff Wong</PERSON>, a long-time collector of carnivorous plants and a
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Carnivores customer. His most frustrating possession is a nepenthes
that adapted to life 9,000 feet up in <LOCATION>Borneo.</LOCATION>;   "It's 10 years old and one
inch wide, and in its natural state, it would be 10 feet high," said <PERSON>Wong</PERSON>, who
is a research chemist in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. Although the plant is only a few inches
high, "people tell me I should be happy it isn't dead." D'Amato owns another
aged example of the same plant, also an inch wide and a few inches high.;  
"It's a matter of finding out what's important to them," said <PERSON>Bill Baumgartl</PERSON>,
a physician in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> who owns 30 carnivorous plants and frequents
<ORGANIZATION>California Carnivores</ORGANIZATION>. "They're very sensitive to soil pH, and you have to
water them with distilled water and you have to fertilize very carefully.";  
But <PERSON>Marilee Maertz</PERSON>, the greenhouse's general manager, who has accidentally
killed countless other houseplants and has mistaken the word "Dieffenbachia"
for a disease, finds carnivores easy to please. "Only once in a while do we
lose somebody," she said.;   She is a former ship inspector; <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> is a
former design engineer for <PERSON>Levi Strauss</PERSON>, and they have been friends since
<DATE>1973.</DATE>;   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, they displayed <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON>'s private collection at a garden show
in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, just for fun, and were swamped by purchase offers.;   To
sate the public's appetite, they set up a shop of carnivores. "We felt
terrible saying, 'Yeah, these are great, but you can't have any,' " she said.;
  According to the <ORGANIZATION>International Carnivorous Plant Society</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>California
Carnivores</ORGANIZATION> is the newest and one of the largest of the dozen all-carnivorous
retail nurseries in the country.;   Their 2,000-square-foot greenhouse stands
on the grounds of a winery; it once sheltered weeds used in allergy research.
It looks more like a botanical museum than a store: A half-dozen crowded
planters with long textual panels line one aisle, depicting the ways
carnivores can congregate in their natural settings.;   Several sundews spill
out of a green pottery horn of plenty. A baby sundew in the saddle of a pink
china horse will someday make its host resemble Pegasus.;   "Bizarre pots for
bizarre plants," said <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON>, who skips off in midsentence to mist a
nepenthes.;   School groups often tour the shop, as do the curious. Despite
the long hours of describing the wonders of carnivores and despite frequent
pleas to set off a Venus flytrap (requests that are usually ignored, since
flytraps hate to be teased), the staff members never tire of their subject.;  
"To this day," <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> said, "the simplest sundew still puts me in a state of
amazement."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; <ORGANIZATION>California Carnivores</ORGANIZATION> is located at <LOCATION>Mark
West Vineyards</LOCATION>, 7000 Trenton-Healsburg Road, <LOCATION>Forestville</LOCATION>, 95436; (707)
838-1630. The nursery is open daily <DATE>March through November</DATE>, but they recommend
calling ahead for a visit during the winter months.  </TEXT>

<P>
At least 168 gallons of oil fouled more than a mile of <ORGANIZATION>Bolsa Chica State Beach</ORGANIZATION> 
early <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> and investigators said leaking offshore oil rigs may be 
the source of the spill, <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> officials said. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Vincent Campos</PERSON> said an emergency cleanup crew hired by <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION>, 
which operates three offshore oil platforms in the area, was dispatched to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very minor spill," <PERSON>Campos</PERSON> said. "We don't have anything from Fish and 
Game yet, but it may have involved a couple of birds." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica is located just north of the main stretch of <LOCATION>Huntington Beach</LOCATION> that 
was soiled when almost 400,000 gallons of crude oil spewed from the crippled 
tanker American Trader 1.3 miles offshore in <DATE>February</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s spill was minor by comparison, it was enough to leave a mile 
and a quarter of the state beach covered with small patches of oil. Petty 
Officer <PERSON>Lindsay Dew</PERSON> said the heaviest patch was an eighth of a mile long, in 
some sections 12 to 15 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
Several <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> officials estimated the total amount of oil spilled at four 
barrels, or 168 gallons, which they said can easily spread over large areas of 
ocean in a thin film. By <DATE>late Tuesday</DATE>, officials stressed the spill appeared to 
be minor. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no animal life being affected," said Dew. "The oil has all washed 
up on shore. We don't believe there's any left in the water." 
</P>
<P>
State and federal wildlife officials were not immediately available for 
comment, but officials at the scene said only one duck had been found covered 
in oil. However, the grunion were supposed to run overnight and they too could 
be affected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Fish</ORGANIZATION> and Game also dispatched a team to take 
samples of the sand and to observe wildlife in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the source of the spill was not yet determined, <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> decided to take 
responsibility for the cleanup. Company spokesman <PERSON>Barry Lane</PERSON> said the firm's 
emergency crews would work with shovels to remove the contaminated sand by the 
sackful. He said the company took on the job because "We operate in that area 
and we have people there." 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said a 20-person cleanup crew from <LOCATION>Long Beach-based 
Chempro</LOCATION>, the same company that worked on the American Trader oil spill, would 
work through the <TIME>night</TIME> and could have the entire spill cleaned by <TIME>early this 
morning</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Lane said the firm operates platforms <PERSON>Eva</PERSON>, <PERSON>Edith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Esther</PERSON>, all of which are 
between one and three miles off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil Co.</ORGANIZATION> also has platforms in the same area, the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s spill was discovered on the beach shortly after <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME>, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor <PERSON>Thomas J. Mays</PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION>Shell Oil</ORGANIZATION> helicopter spotted the 
slick before it hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a shame we have to continue going through these problems," he 
said. "We've had minor problems with the platforms off the coast before, but I 
believe this is the first time the oil got to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> said his company reported a 10-gallon spill at <ORGANIZATION>Platform Eva</ORGANIZATION> to 
the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> but he said that incident is believed to be 
unrelated to the oil that washed up on <LOCATION>Bolsa Chica</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a crew out at dawn looking for any oil on the water and couldn't find 
any," <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> said of the <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> incident. He said a shield designed to trap 
oil had failed because of high winds, which sprayed the crude around the 
platform.

   THE FORM MUST CONFORM to inform, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> says of exempt groups' reports. 

   Over 300,000 exempt organizations file annual Form 990 reports so the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and the public can check uses and sources of funds. 
A <ORGANIZATION>House Government Operations</ORGANIZATION> panel asked the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> to evaluate the completeness of the reports and <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> procedures for making them public. 
Now a <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> draft report based on a sample of 450 forms for <DATE>1986</DATE> estimates that <PERCENT>48%</PERCENT> of 990s omit at least one schedule supplying details of such items as fund-raising, loans to and from officers, and mortgage debt. 

   Yet <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> of the reports with omissions are treated as complete under <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> criteria, and the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> doesn't go after missing schedules, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> said. 
Its findings went to Rep. <PERSON>Barnard</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>), who expressed his concern. 
But he said the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> plans to change its criteria and demand the missing schedules. 
As for providing 990s on request to the public, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> can do it if given a group's exact name. 

   Although a <DATE>1987</DATE> law requires groups to open their 990s to public inspection, the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> expects the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> to continue to receive most requests for copies. 

   REMEMBER <DATE>1912</DATE>, before the income tax arrived? 
These homeowners should. 

   Since <DATE>1865</DATE>, a mutual company -- call it Ex-Tax -- owned by its 5,000 policyholders has sold homeowner's insurance for one refundable deposit. 
Example: A <MONEY>$2,400</MONEY> deposit buys an <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> policy and may cost, in effect, only <MONEY>$144</MONEY> a year in forgone after-tax interest income. 
But wait, asked the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, should that hypothetical interest income be imputed to policyholders and actually taxed? 
Now, in private ruling 8831004, it answers no -- for the time being. 

   When begun, long before the income tax was enacted in <DATE>1913</DATE>, the plan wasn't a tax-avoidance scheme, and that isn't its aim now. 
The deposit doesn't constitute a taxable interest-free loan. 
But the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> isn't ready to say whether there's a taxable "significant effect" on policyholders. 
<PERSON>Alan Hollander</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> tax lawyer, says the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> is likely to begin imputing income to them when it finally issues related regulations. 

   COL. BLIMP SMILES, as <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> wins <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> credits for British taxes. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> subsidiary had a <DATE>1973</DATE> loss for <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> tax purposes, because of deductions not allowed in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Carried back, the loss erased 1970-71 unit profits, so the unit got <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> refunds. 
But <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> had taken 1970-71 foreign-tax credits in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for the unit. 
The <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> treated the unit's <DATE>1973</DATE> results as profit and denied <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION>'s 1970-71 credits, citing the refunds. 
<ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> paid a <MONEY>$791,241</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> claim, sued for a refund in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Claims Court</ORGANIZATION> -- and lost. 

   The credit formula includes a foreign unit's "accumulated profits." 
<ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION>'s complex suit actually turned on whether <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law requires that sum to be computed under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> law, as the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Claims Court</ORGANIZATION> agreed, or applicable foreign law, as <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> argued. 
Now the federal-circuit appeals court has sided with <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> and held that foreign law must be applied. 
"It's a surprising conclusion," says <PERSON>Steven Hannes</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Touche Ross &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, CPAs. 

   And while the ruling favors <ORGANIZATION>Goodyear</ORGANIZATION> now, <PERSON>Hannes</PERSON> says, it could work against companies in many other cases. 

   THAT LOST CHANCE to appeal a <MONEY>$102.3 million</MONEY> claim against the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> companies looks more tragic to the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>, which missed by a day its appeal deadline last month. 
It also hoped to defeat <ORGANIZATION>Indianapolis Power &amp; Light</ORGANIZATION> on the same issue in a prior appeal. 
But now the seventh-circuit appeals court has rejected that <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> plea. 

   A MATH FOOTNOTE and headache: For the first time, <PERSON>Emil Sunley</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells</ORGANIZATION>, CPAs, says, <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> rules include a quadratic equation (with two solutions). 
It concerns allocations of corporate interest costs between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and abroad. 
The lower positive solution becomes "excess related-party indebtedness." 

   THE IRS WRONGLY SENT notices to an unknown number of people, asking why they haven't paid estimated taxes. 
The answer: They had credited refunds from their <DATE>1987</DATE> returns to cover estimated <DATE>1988</DATE> taxes. 
Taxpayers can clear up the notices with that explanation, the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> says. 

   DAISY-CHAIN MAIL was no armor for this outpost of mail-order ministers. 

   Universal Life Church schemes have been rejected often in court, yet still they pop up. 
Now comes "a perfidious twist" on the usual individual scam, says Tax Court <PERSON>Judge Parker</PERSON>. 
<PERSON>James Edward Dew</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> computer analyst, got a church charter by mail and took in 48 co-workers and friends, 25 of them "ordained," as members. 
Result: A "daisy chain" of "donors" who took charitable deductions for "gifts" and got back "parsonage allowances." 

   The group "simply exchanged checks in a transparent ploy to transmute their nondeductible personal . . . expenses into purported deductible charitable contributions," the judge found. 
The "well-educated" Dew, who appealed the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>'s disallowances, is the sole subject of the judge's opinion, which rejects 1980-81 deductions of <MONEY>$25,883</MONEY> and imposes civil negligence penalties. 

   The judge also orders Dew to pay <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> in damages for pressing a frivolous case despite <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> warnings. 

   BRIEFS: Alimony arrearages of <MONEY>$10,550</MONEY> for 1981-83 all are taxable when received in <DATE>1984</DATE>, not spread over the prior years, the <ORGANIZATION>Tax Court</ORGANIZATION> tells <PERSON>Caroline M. Coleman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Lutherville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION> . . . 
Corporate tax departments' frequent failure to have backup computer storage of data is "a potential time bomb," says Peat Marwick Main, CPAs.

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Tony Conigliaro</PERSON>, whose brilliant baseball career
was cut short when he was hit in the face by a pitched ball at age
22, died <DATE>Saturday</DATE> of kidney failure. The former <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION>
outfielder was 45.
   <PERSON>Vinnie Martelli</PERSON>, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON>'s uncle, said <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> died at
<ORGANIZATION>Salem Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. He entered the hospital <DATE>Thursday</DATE>,
and had been in poor health since suffering a heart attack in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   ``He's been in a bad way since the attack several years back,''
<PERSON>Martelli</PERSON> said. ``He never quite recovered.''
   His mother, <PERSON>Theresa Conigliaro</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> required
constant care after his heart attack.
   ``We lost him after eight years. He's never really been back,''
<PERSON>Mrs. Conigliaro</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. ``The only consolation is he didn't
know what he was going through.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Dick Bresciani</PERSON> said, ``It was a very tragic
finish for Tony. The <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> are deeply saddened.''
   The man the fans called ``Tony C'' was, at age 22, the youngest
major league player to hit 100 career home runs.
   He was probably most widely known, however, for the beaning that
tragically cost him his career. On <DATE>Aug. 18, 1967</DATE>, during a game
with the <ORGANIZATION>California Angels</ORGANIZATION>, a pitch by <PERSON>Jack Hamilton</PERSON> hit <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON>
on the left side of the face, leaving him with a fractured
cheekbone, a dislocated jaw and blurred vision.
   The crowd fell silent at the sound of the pitch hitting
<PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON>'s face, recalled <PERSON>Dick Dew</PERSON>, who was a sportswriter
covering the game.
   ``It stopped everybody in the place because of the sound of it.
It was unmistakable,'' said Dew. ``You knew the injury was serious
the moment you heard it.''
   Conigliaro sat out the rest of the <DATE>1967</DATE> season, and all of <DATE>1968</DATE>
with vision problems.
   But in the <DATE>fall of 1968</DATE> he attempted a comeback as a pitcher in
the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Instructional League</ORGANIZATION> at age 23. His vision sharpened,
and the <DATE>1969</DATE> season found him back with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> in his familiar
right field position.
   At the end of the <DATE>1970</DATE> season, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> was traded to the
Angels after having belted 36 homers and driving in 116 runs, both
career highs.
   Citing recurring vision problems, he retired after half a season
with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> the following year.
   In <DATE>1975</DATE>, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> again attempted a comeback with <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, but
it ended after 21 games.
   <PERSON>Johnny Pesky</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> coach who managed the team when
<PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> joined the club in <DATE>1964</DATE>, said, ``He was so good and you
could see it. You knew he was going to be a great player.
   ``It was a shame he got hurt when he did,'' Pesky said of the
pitching accident. ``With a few more years, he could have made the
Hall of Fame.''
   After the heart attack, Pesky said he visited <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> several
times.
   ``When I went over to see Tony I'd end up crying,'' Pesky said.
``He was such a big, strong kid you would have never thought that
something like that could have happened.''
   Born in <LOCATION>Revere</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION> on <DATE>Jan. 7, 1945</DATE>, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> made a splash
as a rookie in <DATE>1964</DATE>, when he hit 24 homers and batted .290, despite
missing six weeks with two broken bones and other injuries.
   A year later he led the <ORGANIZATION>American League</ORGANIZATION> with 32 homers. A wrist
fracture that sidelined him for 24 games kept him from hitting
more. Still, at age 20, he was the youngest major leaguer ever to
win a home run crown.
   His lifetime major league batting average was .264, with 516
runs and 166 home runs.
   After his baseball career ended at age 30, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> worked as
a sportscaster for television stations in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>. He also worked for a sports agent's firm in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>,
and ran a health food store north of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Jan. 7, 1982</DATE>, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> auditioned for a spot on the <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION>
telecasting team. <PERSON>Joseph Dimino</PERSON>, station manager of WSBK-TV, said
<PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> had been ``a leading candidate'' for the job.
   Two days later, <PERSON>Conigliaro</PERSON> suffered a heart attack, which put
him in a coma for four months. It also left him brain damaged and
affected his speech.
   He never recovered fully, but was able to walk with the aid of a
walker in his final years.
   <PERSON>Martelli</PERSON> said funeral arrangements were being planned.

<P>
Bye should not mean a hasty farewell from the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section</ORGANIZATION> basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Teams that performed best during the regular season earned the privilege of 
skipping the first playoff round, giving them more time to practice and allow 
injuries to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, this is regarded as an advantage. However, coaches -- most of whom 
are prone to bouts of anxiety, anyway -- aren't sure if their byes are so good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather there were no byes," said <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>John Harbour</PERSON>, whose team 
earned a first-round bye in the 4-AA Division by winning a share of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Marmonte League</ORGANIZATION> title. "Teams that play in the first round get their playoff 
jitters out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Yet jitters aside, a bye advances a team one step closer to saying hello to a 
Southern Section championship. In addition to <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, county teams that 
begin play in the second round <DATE>Friday</DATE> are Buena (5-A), <LOCATION>Rio Mesa</LOCATION> (4-A) and <LOCATION>Santa 
Clara</LOCATION> (2-A). 
</P>
<P>
Because only 13 teams qualified for the 2-A playoffs, <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, the 
top-seeded team, needs to win only three games to give Coach <PERSON>Lou Cvijanovich</PERSON> 
his 10th Southern Section title. When the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section</ORGANIZATION> offered teams the 
chance to move up to a higher playoff division in <DATE>January</DATE>, several 2-A teams 
fled to the 2-AA. Avoiding the prospect of facing the Saints might have been a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> (20-3) has lost only once on the court, a 39-38 loss to <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION> in 
the <LOCATION>Estancia</LOCATION> tournament last <DATE>December</DATE>. The Saints, upset over what they felt 
was poor officiating, declined to return to the tournament and were assessed 
two forfeit losses. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Shon Tarver</PERSON>, a junior transfer from Rim of the World High, has provided <LOCATION>Santa 
Clara</LOCATION> with consistent scoring, averaging 23 points a game. The Saints also have 
a rugged inside game behind <PERSON>Bubba Burrage</PERSON> (17 points, eight rebounds) and <PERSON>John 
McGill</PERSON> (nine points, eight rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most improved part of <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>'s game is the play of its guards. 
The Saints' ability to break a press, in fact, is a work of art -- point guard 
<PERSON>Art Santana</PERSON>, who also averages nine points, five rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Channel League champion Rio <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION> (20-4), the third-seeded 4-A team, also boasts 
a top-flight flyer at point guard. Speedy <PERSON>Lester Smith</PERSON> has improved steadily as 
a ball handler and has become an excellent defensive player, according to Coach 
<PERSON>Steve Wolf</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"He handles all the pressure bringing the ball upcourt," <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> said, "and he 
always guards the opponents' No. 1 player. He's our most consistent player and 
has legitimate Division I quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Forwards <PERSON>Jeff Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eric Thomas</PERSON> give <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> two excellent scorers to feed. 
Garner is the Spartans' leading scorer, averaging 23 points a game, and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> 
is a two-time All-County player who finished the league season with strong 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Harbortown may be a financially troubled Ventura resort, but Harbour-town in 
<LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> is thriving as a school gymnasium. At <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, Coach <PERSON>John Harbour</PERSON> 
gives sophomore son <PERSON>David</PERSON> the green light to shoot from anywhere on the floor. 
Well, anywhere inside 25 feet. The younger <LOCATION>Harbour</LOCATION> is accurate, averaging 21 
points, and he also has found time to average six rebounds and lead <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> 
(17-6) with four assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward <PERSON>Frank Dews</PERSON>, who Coach Harbour calls "as consistent a player as 
I've coached," adds a 15-point scoring average. Dews, a returning starter, has 
responded well in several clutch situations. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (19-4) lost three times to <LOCATION>Rio Mesa</LOCATION> during the regular season, twice in 
league play and once in a tournament. But the Bulldogs are in a different 
playoff division than the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Bulldogs play at a fast tempo and are led by versatile forward 
<PERSON>Adan Valencia</PERSON> and sharp-shooting point guard <PERSON>Jeff Oliver</PERSON>, both starters on last 
year's league championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, a senior, averages 16 points and 11 rebounds. Oliver, a junior who 
made a transition from off-guard this season, averages 17 points and seven 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, one of 10 5-A teams with a first-round bye, hopes to stay close to home 
when it begins play. The Bulldogs have had more success running the break than 
negotiating through traffic. <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION> defeated Buena last season in the 
semifinals after the Bulldogs traveled 3 1/2 hours to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a while to limber up and we had only 21 points at the half," <ORGANIZATION>Buena</ORGANIZATION> 
Coach <PERSON>Glen Hannah</PERSON> said. "This year, the travel could be even worse because 
divisions aren't laid out geographically." 
</P>
<P>
This season, enrollment was the sole factor in deciding a team's playoff 
division. And the byes the structure created will be cursed or lauded, 
depending upon the outcomes of <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s games.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Business faces up to life with
a stronger dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK industrialists bemused by the continued upheaval in European
currencies yesterday, one fact stood out. The sterling-dollar rate is now at
Dollars 1.77. At the start of the month it was at Dollars 2. Sterling is
thus 12 per cent lower than it was a fortnight ago.
For reasons that are partly historic, the dollar remains the most important
single currency for UK manufacturers dealing with the outside world. In
terms of actual trading, as opposed to the translation of overseas earnings,
a stronger dollar cuts three ways.
It is good for exporters and those competing against dollar-based goods at
home or abroad. It is bad for importers. And it is decidedly mixed for small
companies that cannot afford sophisticated currency hedging, since a
switchback dollar adds to their trading risks.
An excellent example of an industry that benefits is aerospace. This is a
business denominated in dollars. For UK manufacturers, the weak dollar has
compounded the difficulties caused by the recession in civil aviation and
government cuts in military spending.
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> aero-engine and industrial power group, said <DATE>yesterday</DATE>
that a stronger dollar was better for the company. 'We build in pounds and
sell in dollars,' a <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> official said.
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> that the weak dollar had reduced its
first-half profits by Pounds 10m compared with last year. The weaker dollar
also benefited <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION>'s principal <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> competitors, <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Pratt &amp; Whitney</ORGANIZATION>.
A stronger dollar will also help UK aerospace companies such as British
Aerospace and components manufacturers such as <ORGANIZATION>Smiths Industries</ORGANIZATION>, TI-Dowty
and <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>.
Sterling's fluctuations will have less impact on UK airlines. British
Airways explained yesterday that it sold tickets on both sides of the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. A firmer dollar resulted in improved <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> traffic while a stronger
pound boosted UK travel across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> currently accounts for
about 30 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>BA</ORGANIZATION>'s passengers.
Another beneficiary is the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s oil sector, where sterling's devaluation was
warmly welcomed. 'It's tremendously good news from a sterling oil company's
point of view,' said <PERSON>Mr John Walmesley</PERSON>, the finance director of <ORGANIZATION>Enterprise
Oil</ORGANIZATION>, the independent oil company. 'It will provide relief for a hard-pressed
sector.'
The devaluation will raise the sterling price of oil close to Pounds 12,
widely regarded among <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> operators as a 'comfort' threshold.
In the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> motor industry, the effects are limited to specialist
manufacturers, since volume exports of cars from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to the UK and
continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> still play only a minor role in the European market.
Against that, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars</ORGANIZATION>, the two UK luxury
carmakers, will both reap benefits from lower sterling as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s main car
exporters to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> accounted for 44 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide turnover last
year of Pounds 693m, and the previous steep fall in the value of the dollar
has played a role in its mounting losses, totalling Pounds 226m last year.
For <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars</ORGANIZATION>, the loss-making subsidiary of the UK engineering
group <PERSON>Vickers</PERSON>, <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> accounts for about 28 per cent of worldwide
turnover.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> have both suffered badly in the recessions in the UK
and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, however, fierce competition has meant that there
has been little scope to raise prices to compensate for loss of revenue
caused by the prolonged fall in the value of the dollar.
Devaluation of the pound against the dollar and D-Mark will also give an
important edge to the competitiveness of the UK luxury carmakers in <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION> against their main rivals, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
Among losers from devaluation are companies that depend on
dollar-denominated raw materials.
The ambivalent effect of weaker sterling on smaller companies is illustrated
by The Rocking Horse Shop, a Yorkshire-based company that makes and
despatches rocking horse kits to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.'
The company's owner, <PERSON>Mr Tony Dew</PERSON>, said: 'It's knowing what prices to quote
at the time orders are taken which gives us the biggest headache.' <PERSON>Mr Dew</PERSON>
said miscalculating exchange rates between orders and despatch could have a
marked impact on a company with an annual turnover of around Pounds 250,000.
The latest dip in the value of the pound, he says, might give US export
business a boost. 'But then, we buy in some of our raw materials from
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, so that won't help.'

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two editors complained <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that
their First Amendment rights of free speech and religion were
violated when they were fired from a small <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> newspaper for
organizing an anti-abortion group.
   The newspaper defended its actions and a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa
Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> said the editors didn't have a First
Amendment case.
   ``I guess my religious convictions are what brought it about,''
<PERSON>Terri Lambertsen</PERSON>, former People Page editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Fairfield
Ledger</ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. ``I have to believe that
serving the <ORGANIZATION>Lord</ORGANIZATION> is more important than my job.''
   The Ledger is a 5,000-circulation, six-day-a-week afternoon
newspaper published about 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Lambertsen</PERSON> and News Editor <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON> were discharged
<DATE>Monday</DATE> when they refused to quit as leaders of the <LOCATION>Southeast Iowa</LOCATION>
Pro-Lifers, a newly-formed anti-abortion group. <PERSON>Ms. Lambertsen</PERSON> is
president and <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> is secretary of the group.
   Ledger Editor <PERSON>Jan Nierling</PERSON> said the newspaper was forced to fire
the two to protect its credibility, even though that left the paper
with only a managing editor, a reporter and sports editor.
   ``We take our business seriously. We just think it endangers
incredibly our perception of credibility and objectivity. A
newspaper's credibility is its most valuable asset,'' <PERSON>Ms. Nierling</PERSON>
said.
   The firings prompted a protest sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Refocus Ministries</ORGANIZATION>,
a non-denominational ministerial group. About 40 protestors walked
in a circle in front of the Ledger office <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   ``I have to agree with what <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON> said,'' said <PERSON>Larry
Rail</PERSON>, co-director of the group. ``He joined a group that is
pro-life. It doesn't mean his views as a newspaper reporter and
editor are going to change. So it's a blatant violation of his
rights.''
   The Ledger's policy is similar to many other news organizations,
according to <PERSON>William Hirschman</PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> chapter of
the Society of Professional Journalists and the group's Freedom of
Information representative for the region that includes <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>.
   A common compromise, he said, is to permit reporters to
participate in some groups, but not as spokesmen or leaders, and to
prevent writers from covering events in which they are personally
involved.
   ``I would have hoped that the two sides would have sat down and
discussed it,'' he said.
   Last <DATE>October</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Journal</ORGANIZATION> fired a receptionist, <PERSON>Diane
Dew</PERSON>, for her anti-abortion activities. In <DATE>December</DATE>, the paper said
it made a mistake and agreed to pay her a settlement. The Journal
said it had decided that its code of ethics for newsroom employees
did not apply to <PERSON>Ms. Dew</PERSON>.
   Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, reporters for The New York Times and The Washington
Post were criticized by their newspapers for participating in an
abortion rights march in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. No punitive action was taken
at either paper.
   Kennedy, an eight-year employee of the Ledger, said his
involvement with the anti-abortion group did not interfere with his
newspaper duties. He said the newspaper could send another reporter
to cover an abortion-related story if it felt his objectivity was
compromised.
   Neither <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Ms. Lambertsen</PERSON> would say if they planned to
pursue legal remedies.
   ``I've got three kids, aged 4, 6 and 7. My wife works part-time
as a church secretary for <MONEY>$37</MONEY> a week. I'm not sure yet what we'll
do, but the Lord will take care of us,'' <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Nierling</PERSON> said the newspaper has a longstanding policy of
prohibiting reporters from being officers of politically active
groups that receive news coverage.
   ``I'm disappointed that they didn't have a better attitude
toward their professional responsibilities,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mark Bennett</PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa Civil Liberties
Union</ORGANIZATION>, said the First Amendment was not at issue in the case. The
First Amendment, he said, applies only to governments that try to
infringe religious and speech rights, not to private enterprises,
such as a newspaper.
   An untested theory, he said, would be whether the paper violated
<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>'s civil rights laws, which prohibit discrimination on the
basis of creed.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: Karetnikov's 'Till Eulenspiegel' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few modern operas can claim a more tortuous genesis than <PERSON>Nikolai
Karetnikov</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Till Eulenspiegel</ORGANIZATION>, which has just received its stage premiere
at Bielefeld in <LOCATION>north Germany</LOCATION>. Karetnikov, born in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> in <DATE>1930</DATE>, comes
from the post-Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers who experimented
with new techniques and fell foul of the Communist authorities.
Till Eulenspiegel was hardly calculated to win official approval. A two-act
<ORGANIZATION>Singspiel</ORGANIZATION> completed in <DATE>1985</DATE>, it is a parable of Soviet repression and the
indomitable human spirit. The work first reached the West two years ago, in
a recording made piecemeal with help from off-duty members of the Soviet
Cinema Orchestra and scraps of tape from the cutting-room. Today, the only
obstacles to its performance in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> are financial. And so - with an irony
that suits <PERSON>Karetnikov</PERSON>'s style - <ORGANIZATION>Till Eulenspiegel</ORGANIZATION> has been premiered far
from the people to whom it would mean most.
Initial reactions to the recording were ecstatic. Gramophone went so far as
to hail it as 'one of the most powerful operas of recent times'. John Dew's
Bielefeld production hardly supports that verdict. Till Eulenspiegel comes
across as a good allegorical yarn - easy-to-follow, singable and
entertaining, but not strikingly original.
Karetnikov and his co-librettist, the film director <PERSON>Pavel Lungin</PERSON> (Taxi
Blues), used a novel by the <DATE>19th century</DATE> Belgian writer <PERSON>Charles de Coster</PERSON> as
their source. Till is more than the endearing prankster depicted in the
<PERSON>Strauss</PERSON> tone poem - he becomes an uncompromising fighter for justice and
freedom.
The setting is Flanders under the Hapsburg empire and the Spanish
inquisition. Till is exiled for making fun of a monk, his father is burned
as a heretic, his mother is murdered and he himself is nearly executed. From
first to last, death and freedom form two sides of the same coin - no more
so than in the final scene, when Till dies of poison and is mysteriously
resurrected.
Woven into the fabric of the story are bizarre clips of the Spanish court
and a role-call of stereotypes - a fishmonger who informs on his fellow
citizens, a fortune-teller, a quartet of prostitutes and Till's alter ego, a
vagabond named <PERSON>Lamme</PERSON>. All are wrapped into a polystilistic theatrical idiom
embracing mystery-play, pantomime, ballet, burlesque and satirical drama -
while running the musical gamut from renaissance song and baroque recitative
to Orthodox chant, Sprechgesang and 12-note variations. Karetnikov emerges
as a musical chameleon, a virtuoso impersonator, but lacking <PERSON>Schnittke</PERSON>'s
ability to mould his influences into something more personal.
Dew's production, designed by <PERSON>Thomas Gruber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jose Manuel Vazquez</PERSON>, matches
the parodistic quality of the score, without losing sight of the pain and
violence beneath the surface. The stage is a 20th century prison of wire
mesh, divided into three playing areas to keep pace with the quick changes
of setting. No scene outstays its welcome, though some would have benefited
from a more identifiable sense of place.
The biggest drawback is the positioning of the orchestra behind the stage,
from where - despite amplification - <PERSON>Karetnikov</PERSON>'s subtle accompagnato makes
a sketchy impression. Give or take some predictable lapses of coordination
with his cast, <PERSON>Geoffrey Moull</PERSON> conjures an idiomatic range of sound. In the
baritone title role, <PERSON>William Oberholtzer</PERSON> is more worthy than charismatic.
The Bielefeld ensemble provides versatile support, with excellent
contributions from <PERSON>Susan Maclean</PERSON> as Till's fiancee <PERSON>Nele</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ulrich Neuweiler</PERSON>
as <PERSON>Lamme</PERSON>.

   Something unexpected is lurking on Madison Avenue -- good
news.
   Ad spending is still sluggish, and the economy is still
sour, but Wall Street apparently believes the worst is over
for the ad agency business.
                                                                                                       

   Stocks of most of the publicly held major agencies have
begun a quiet ascent this year, prompted by a belief that the
long-awaited advertising recovery may finally begin in the
second half. Analysts point hopefully to anecdotal evidence,
such as ad gains at a few scattered newspapers and spending
increases by several big advertisers.
   "At the beginning of the year, I would have said I'm
concerned that we're going into a recession and these aren't
the stocks to hold," says Greg Ostroff, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "I'm more bullish now."
   Most of the ad stocks are handily outpacing the S&amp;P 500 so
far this year, a surprising and welcome sign for the
beleaguered industry. While the S&amp;P index was off 1.1% for
1992 as of Friday, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications
shares had climbed by 8.3% and Omnicom Group by 12.5%, says
James Dougherty, a County NatWest Securities analyst.
   Shares of Interpublic Group of Cos., generally the most
highly regarded agency of all, were off less than 1%, but had
been priced at a 52-week high at the beginning of the year.
Interpublic shares fell 12.5 cents to $56.625 in late New
York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, after the company
reported 1991 net income had climbed 18% to $94.6 million, or
$2.60 a share. Net for the fourth quarter jumped 25% to $40.5
million, or $1.10 a share. The figures were in line with
expectations.
   Analysts caution that there is no wholesale recovery in
sight yet, merely the glint of light at the end of an
exceedingly long tunnel. Alan Gottesman, a PaineWebber
analyst, likens it to having "the ingredients in the shopping
basket, but we haven't started cooking yet." He hasn't
upgraded his "neutral" appraisal of the agency stocks, though
some other analysts have "buy" recommendations for
Interpublic and Omnicom.
   Analysts and ad executives nevertheless are seizing on the
few good omens they can find. The Washington Post in January
saw an increase in help-wanted advertising for the first time
in 40 months. At this newspaper, published by Dow Jones &amp;
Co., ad linage was up for three of the past four months. And
several major advertisers, including Goodyear Tire, have
recently announced they are beefing up 1992 national ad
budgets.
   At the same time, ad agencies have been furiously slashing
costs in the past few lean years. When ad spending does
bounce back, even if only in a small way, it should go
straight to the bottom line, because agencies are so lean,
analysts say. While boom times may still be several years
off, "at some point over the next two to three years, all the
pieces are falling in place" for a "significant" recovery,
Goldman's Mr. Ostroff says.
   Showing the biggest gains among ad stocks this year --
admittedly from severely depressed levels -- are the two
troubled British giants, WPP Group and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Yet
analysts remain skeptical about their outlook for the near
future.
   WPP, which owns Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J. Walter Thompson,
has declined to comment on the recent runup of its American
depositary receipts, which jumped to $3 on Friday from
$1.6875 on the preceding Monday. Yesterday, the ADRs fell
back to $2.6875 in national over-the-counter trading.
Analysts discount rumors that a refinancing is imminent, and
they have no explanation for the jump. County NatWest's Mr.
Dougherty says WPP has #235 million ($416.3 million) in
revolving debt due next year, and "it will be hard for that
stock to do well until people see a resolution of the
uncertainty."
   Madison Avenue and Wall Street both have been dead wrong
in predicting an ad recovery too many times to count -- and
so this time around, analysts are being especially cautious.
None are confident enough to count on a recovery in the
second half, though all are hoping for one. But as Goldman's
Mr. Ostroff says, if that recovery does materialize, "then
these stocks have further {up} to go."

   Lintas Dismisses Report
                                                                                                       

   Interpublic Group's Lintas:New York dismissed as
"speculation" a published report that its estimated $60
million MasterCard International account was going into
review.
   In an internal staff memo, the agency's chairman and chief
executive officer, Tony Miller, dismissed the report in the
trade magazine Adweek and defended his agency's work for the
New York credit card association. A new ad campaign "hasn't
yet cleared the bankers," Mr. Miller explained, "and it's
because of this that the speculation has resumed."
   A MasterCard spokesman said the company wouldn't comment
on the report, but Adweek said it stands by its story that a
formal review would begin this week.
   MasterCard's estimated 1992 ad budget of $60 million
represents a 30% increase over last year, a move aimed at
stemming its loss of market share to Visa, according to the
Nilson Report newsletter.
   The Lintas memo said Peter Dimsey, president of
MasterCard's U.S. credit card group, "confirmed that no
review is planned at this time." "If and when it changes,
you'll be the first to know," the memo said.

   LOTTERY: Bozell's Southfield, Mich., office was awarded
the Michigan State Lottery's estimated $12 million account
under a one-year, interim contract. The lottery abruptly
terminated the five-year contract it had signed in 1988 with
W.B. Doner &amp; Co., Southfield, Mich., citing its need for
greater promotion expertise. Doner's chairman, Herbert Fried,
said the change resulted from a new political administration.
                                                                                                       

   ACCOUNTS: D'Arcy, Masius Benton &amp; Bowles held on to its
estimated $20 million Louis Rich meat account with Kraft
General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. . . . W.B. Doner
won the accounts of the Pittsburgh Metro and Pittsburgh

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Business faces up to stronger
Dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK industrialists bemused by the continued upheaval in European
currencies yesterday, one fact stood out like a beacon. The sterling-dollar
rate is now at Dollars 1.77. At the start of the month it was at Dollars 2.
Sterling is thus 12 per cent lower than it was a fortnight ago.
For reasons that are partly historic, the dollar remains the most important
single currency for UK manufacturers dealing with the outside world. In
terms of actual trading, as opposed to the translation of overseas earnings,
a stronger dollar cuts three ways.
It is good for exporters and those competing against dollar-based goods at
home or abroad. It is bad for importers. And it is decidedly mixed for small
companies that cannot afford sophisticated currency hedging, since a
switchback dollar adds to their trading risks.
An excellent example of an industry that benefits is aerospace. This is a
business denominated in dollars. For UK manufacturers, the weak dollar has
compounded the difficulties caused by the recession in civil aviation and
government cuts in military spending.
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> aero-engine and industrial power group, said <DATE>yesterday</DATE>
that a stronger dollar was better for the company. 'We build in pounds and
sell in dollars,' a <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> official said.
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> that the weak dollar had reduced its
first-half profits by Pounds 10m compared with last year. The weaker dollar
also benefited <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION>'s principal <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> competitors, <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Pratt &amp; Whitney</ORGANIZATION>.
A stronger dollar will also help UK aerospace companies such as British
Aerospace and components manufacturers such as <ORGANIZATION>Smiths Industries</ORGANIZATION>, TI-Dowty
and <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON>.
Sterling's fluctuations will have less impact on UK airlines. British
Airways explained yesterday that it sold tickets on both sides of the
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. A firmer dollar resulted in improved <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> traffic while a stronger
pound boosted UK travel across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> currently accounts for
about 30 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>BA</ORGANIZATION>'s passengers.
Another beneficiary is the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>'s oil sector, where sterling's devaluation was
warmly welcomed. 'It's tremendously good news from a sterling oil company's
point of view,' said <PERSON>Mr John Walmesley</PERSON>, the finance dirctor of <ORGANIZATION>Enterprise
Oil</ORGANIZATION>, the independent oil company. 'It will provide relief for a hard-pressed
sector.'
The devaluation will raise the sterling price of oil close to Pounds 12,
widely regarded among <LOCATION>North Sea</LOCATION> operators as a 'comfort' threshold.
In the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> motor industry, the effects are limited to specialist
manufacturers, since volume exports of cars from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to the UK and
continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> still play only a minor role in the European market.
Against that, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars</ORGANIZATION>, the two UK luxury
carmakers, will both reap benefits from lower sterling as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s main car
exporters to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> accounted for 44 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide turnover last
year of Pounds 693m, and the previous steep fall in the value of the dollar
has played a role in its mounting losses, totalling Pounds 226m last year.
For <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars</ORGANIZATION>, the loss-making subsidiary of the UK engineering
group <PERSON>Vickers</PERSON>, <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> accounts for about 28 per cent of worldwide
turnover.
<ORGANIZATION>Jaguar</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> have both suffered badly in the recessions in the UK
and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, however, fierce competition has meant that there
has been little scope to raise prices to compensate for loss of revenue
caused by the prolonged fall in the value of the dollar.
Devaluation of the pound against the dollar and D-Mark will also give an
important edge to the competitiveness of the UK luxury carmakers in <LOCATION>North
America</LOCATION> against their main rivals, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes-Benz</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
Among losers from devaluation are companies that depend on
dollar-denominated raw materials.
A good example is UK Corrugated, one of the country's largest producers of
cardboard boxes. The company's chief executive, <PERSON>Mr Pat Barrett</PERSON>, said
yesterday, 'Nobody can make any sensible decisions for the next 10 days. I
am going to play golf all day tomorrow.'
<PERSON>Mr Barrett</PERSON>'s dilemma is that UK Corrugated imports 30 per cent of its raw
materials from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. Earlier this year the company was paying Dollars 540
a tonne for kraftliner - its basic raw material - or Pounds 308 at the
exchange rate then prevailing. The supplier's price then went up by Dollars
40. But because of the rise in sterling, the company could absorb the rise
without trying to pass it on to customers.
Now, after sterling's fall, <ORGANIZATION>UK Corrugated</ORGANIZATION> is likely to pay about Pounds 331
a tonne, a 7.5 per cent rise.
<PERSON>Mr Barrett</PERSON> said yesterday: 'The government's policy of maintaining the pound
in the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> to control inflation was absolutely right for my industry. The
strong pound controlled the cost of imported raw materials. For us, the cost
of making cardboard boxes has gone up 2 1/2 per cent since <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.'
The ambivalent effect of weaker sterling on smaller companies is illustrated
by The Rocking Horse Shop, a Yorkshire-based company that makes and
despatches craftsman-built rocking horse kits to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.'
The company's owner, <PERSON>Mr Tony Dew</PERSON>, said: 'It's knowing what prices to quote
at the time orders are taken which gives us the biggest headache.' <PERSON>Mr Dew</PERSON>
said miscalculating exchange rates over the period between orders and
despatch for products averaging between Pounds 100 and Pounds 150 could have
a marked impact on a company with an annual turnover of around Pounds
250,000.
The latest dip in the value of the pound, he says, might give US export
business a boost. 'But then, we buy in some of our raw materials from
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, so that won't help.'

<P>
Jeannette DeWyze and <PERSON>Steve Wolfe</PERSON> have been married 16 years. They have two 
children, a house in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and two thriving careers. But every month, they 
sit down, add up their expenses and split them in half. They have never had a 
joint bank account. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sarah Williams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ron Thompson</PERSON> were married last year. They live in the 
condominium in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> that she bought before they married. She pays for 
their food and clothes. She put his name on her savings account. But his money 
goes into his business. 
</P>
<P>
"Household expenses? Not my problem, baby," mused <PERSON>Ron</PERSON>, an artist and general 
contractor who, like his wife, asked not to be identified by his real name. 
"This is a little early <DATE>1990s</DATE> male chauvinism." 
</P>
<P>
There are few rules left governing how couples handle their assets. The women's 
movement and the divorce rate have put an end to that. Some merge everything, a 
few merge nothing. And more and more, couples alight on some murky middle 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, it happens haphazardly. They marry in their thirties with a modern-day 
dowry of bank accounts, investments and careers. Out of habit, they may start 
off keeping things separate. But they soon mingle them, all too often with 
little or no thought. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of their non-decisions can be dire. If the marriage ends, a 
spouse can lose more than his shirt. Yet financial planners and marriage 
counselors say they are struck by a common theme: how much money matters and 
how little it is discussed or understood. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is critical in our marriages," said <PERSON>Jean Flannigan</PERSON>, a psychotherapist in 
<LOCATION>West Los Angeles</LOCATION>. "I think it is the single most important symbol of the 
underlying issues. We project our psyche, or our soul, onto money." 
</P>
<P>
"People will share intimate information about their sex life with their best 
friend, but they won't share their finances," said <PERSON>Rose Greene</PERSON>, a financial 
planner in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>. "It is the most private subject, and it has the most 
amount of shame associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when our hang-ups perhaps mattered less. Men made money and 
most women didn't. Couples married young, without houses, investments, children 
from previous marriages. They pooled everything. After all, hadn't they married 
for life? 
</P>
<P>
But these days, most women work. Some earn more than their husbands or derive 
self-esteem from being self-supporting. Many couples marry later, in their 
thirties and forties, bringing wealth from an earlier life. And half of all 
marriages end in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Contemplating breakup, therefore, has become a necessary evil. Otherwise, 
ex-partners can find themselves fleeced -- their hard-earned assets split 50-50 
under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving 
spouse's children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Under <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s community property system, money earned through either 
spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage 
ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as 
separate property -- not subject to division in a divorce -- as long as an 
absolute separation is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent 
"commingling" of assets. 
</P>
<P>
According to financial planners, more and more couples are keeping at least 
some property separate, especially in second marriages. Some do it because they 
have stopped believing that marriage is permanent; others do it to protect 
their children's inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
Many hold their house jointly, splitting the mortgage payments. Investments 
from before the marriage remain separate. They set up separate and joint bank 
accounts and credit cards. Only over time do they begin making joint 
investments and "merging." 
</P>
<P>
What is the best way? 
</P>
<P>
Most financial planners insist it is impossible to generalize; any financial 
arrangement must be tailored to the couple in question. If there is one rule, 
they say, it's that couples should talk about money in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do not necessarily with just protecting the assets but 
protecting the egos," said <PERSON>Alan Ungar</PERSON>, a certified financial planner in 
<LOCATION>Calabasas</LOCATION>. "It's much less a financial planning decision than it is an 
emotional one." 
</P>
<P>
Rose <PERSON>Greene</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carol Rabaut</PERSON> have been lovers for 12 years. Rose has kept her 
inherited assets in her own name. But the two women share a lot -- a house in 
<LOCATION>West Los Angeles</LOCATION>, a car, two dogs, a cat and an explicit agreement on how they 
would divide things if they split up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people mistake the way they hold assets with the degree of 
commitment," said <PERSON>Greene</PERSON>, a financial analyst, who sees in her job the damage 
wrought by what she calls indiscriminate merging. "I don't think I love <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> 
one iota less because I choose to hold assets in my own name." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are wary of such separateness. They fear it symbolizes bad 
faith. Some say they would never marry a man who asked that they sign a 
prenuptial agreement; indeed, weddings have been called off at the last minute 
over that issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly suspicious of people who really keep things separate," said 
<PERSON>Sarah Williams</PERSON>, the 41-year-old television executive who pays all of her 
husband's living expenses. "I mean, joining funds is like the least of the 
commitment to joining your lives together." 
</P>
<P>
And a few, like <PERSON>Jeannette DeWyze</PERSON>, prefer to keep everything totally separate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the early years of my marriage I was very concerned about 
preserving my own autonomy within the union," said DeWyze, a 37-year-old 
writer. "I guess it was always important for me to feel I could make it on my 
own outside of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"It just fit us, and our psychological makeup," she said. "It's only from other 
people's reactions that I get some idea of how weird people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS 
</P>
<P>
* Couples should talk about money in advance because the consequences of 
non-decisions can be dire. Ex-partners can find their hard-earned assets split 
50-50 under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving 
spouse's children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
* Under <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s community property system, money earned through either 
spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage 
ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
* Assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as seperate 
property-not subject to division in a divorce-as long as an absolute separation 
is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent "commingling" of 
assets.

FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lobbying for positions as MPs begin to take
an interest - The likely moves at Westminster / The Battle For Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Parliament stumbling back into life and the future of <ORGANIZATION>Midland Bank</ORGANIZATION>,
once the world's largest, lodged firmly in the hands of regulators, the
political lobbying process at <LOCATION>Westminster</LOCATION> is swinging into action.
All three of the main protagonists - <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Hongkong</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shanghai
Banking Corporation</ORGANIZATION> and their target <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION> - have retained political
consultants in addition to a clutch of financial and public relations
advisers. The consultants will play a key role in ensuring their clients'
messages get through to members of parliament.
But the process cuts both ways, providing parliamentarians with a channel
through which to broadcast their concerns to the leading companies.
The direct influence of the average backbencher on government
decision-makers might be slight or non-existent. But the recent problems of
the Lloyd's insurance market are a good illustration of the impact that a
relatively small number of aggrieved MPs can have if they feel they are not
getting a fair hearing.
Such is the geographic spread of the businesses involved in the battle for
<LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION> that a large number of MPs are likely to take a serious interest.
There can be few in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> who do not have some <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION> or Lloyds
employees among their constituents. Some are already receiving letters about
the possible consequences of any deal.
Early comments suggest that one of <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s toughest tasks will be to
set MPs' minds at rest as to the likely effect of its proposals on
employment levels and competition.
There is a quite widely held view at <LOCATION>Westminster</LOCATION> that the degree of
competition is already inadequate, especially in corporate banking. A
reduction from four to three in the number of clearers is hardly calculated
to improve matters.
Hongkong may have to counter claims that the current regulatory procedures
give foreign bidders an effective advantage at the expense of British
companies. The point was raised yesterday by <PERSON>Mr Keith Hampson</PERSON>, the
Conservative MP for <ORGANIZATION>Leeds North West</ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Commons select
committee on trade and industry, in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>.
In lobbying terms, it was Lloyds which set the ball rolling some 10 days
ago, sending a letter signed by Sir <PERSON>Jeremy Morse</PERSON>, its chairman, to all MPs.
He argued that its proposed offer was in the public interest and that the
<ORGANIZATION>Hongkong Bank</ORGANIZATION> proposals did not address 'any of the fundamental problems in
the UK banking sector'. The bank has hired GJW Government Relations as its
political lobbyist.
Hongkong, which has retained <ORGANIZATION>Lowe Bell Communications</ORGANIZATION> as its political
adviser, and <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>, which is using <ORGANIZATION>Ian Greer Associates</ORGANIZATION>, are both expected
to write to MPs. <ORGANIZATION>Bifu</ORGANIZATION>, the banking union, has already done so, sending a
dossier to MPs and <ORGANIZATION>British Euro</ORGANIZATION> MPs arguing that a Lloyds takeover would be
harmful to the UK economy.
Next week, the process will take a fresh turn when Conservative backbenchers
are expected to have an opportunity to meet senior executives from both
<ORGANIZATION>Hongkong Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds</ORGANIZATION>.
The usual format for such gatherings, which generally last about an hour, is
for a brief presentation followed by a question and answer session. <PERSON>Mr Tim
Smith</PERSON>, the Conservative MP for <ORGANIZATION>Beaconsfield</ORGANIZATION>, who served as vice-chairman of
the Tory backbench finance committee in the last parliament, played a
leading role in arranging the meetings.
If lobbying efforts then proceed according to type, selected MPs can expect
to be invited to lunch or dinner to discuss the situation further.
Typically, one representative from the client organisation would be present
for each MP who attended.
Subsequently, guests displaying a particular interest will often be
consulted further by an MP or another individual with close ties to the
client. MPs who perform such tasks on behalf of companies or other
interested parties are known colloquially as 'gophers'.
Several MPs have links of one kind or another with the main protagonists and
their advisers. But few expect to play a significant role as the contest
develops.
<PERSON>Mr Hugh Dykes</PERSON>, the Conservative MP for <LOCATION>Harrow East</LOCATION>, said he would not get
involved unless asked, and that would be unusual. <PERSON>Mr Dykes</PERSON> is a shareholder
in <PERSON>Dewe Rogerson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds</ORGANIZATION>' public relations adviser.
<PERSON>Mr Jeremy Bray</PERSON>, the Labour MP for <ORGANIZATION>Motherwell South</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bifu</ORGANIZATION> consultant, said
that anything he wrote or said on the subject would be in the public domain.
<PERSON>Mr Hampson</PERSON>, who was retained by <ORGANIZATION>GJW</ORGANIZATION> until last <DATE>summer</DATE> and has close
political links with <PERSON>Mr Heseltine</PERSON>, has emphasised that he has had no
discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Lloyds</ORGANIZATION> about its proposed offer and has no financial
interest in the outcome.
Other MPs with current or former ties include <PERSON>Mr Quentin Davies</PERSON>, the Tory MP
for <LOCATION>Stamford</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Spalding</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>Dewe Rogerson Consultants</ORGANIZATION> and Sir
<PERSON>Peter Tapsell</PERSON> (C Lindsey East), who played a significant part in negotiating
the purchase of <PERSON>James Capel</PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION>Hongkong Bank</ORGANIZATION> but no longer has any
connection with the stockbroker.
One ex-MP who will be closely involved is <PERSON>Mr Francis Maude</PERSON>, the former
<ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> minister who has become an adviser to <PERSON>Mr William Purves</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Hongkong Bank</ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON>Mr Maude</PERSON>'s appointment was partly at the behest of
<PERSON>Mr Alastair Ross Goobey</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> adviser who recently returned to
<PERSON>James Capel</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Stephen Sherbourne</PERSON>, whose career includes spells as both political
secretary to <PERSON>Mrs Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> and head of office to <PERSON>Mr Edward Heath</PERSON>, is
in charge of the <LOCATION>Hongkong</LOCATION> account at <ORGANIZATION>Lowe Bell</ORGANIZATION>.

<HL> Britain Uses a Hard Sell on BP Offering

Ubiquitous Ads Urge
Public to Seek Shares

<TEXT>
   The advertising blitz for the huge <ORGANIZATION>British Petroleum Co.</ORGANIZATION> share offer doesn't actually promise profit and joy. 
That would be against the rules. 

   But the subliminal hints seem awfully enticing. 
The music is upbeat. 
The faces are smiling. 
The fireworks are inspiring. 
The green and yellow colors of <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION>'s shield logo are everywhere. 

   "You get this fantastic folderol," <PERSON>Frank Watts</PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Sheppards</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stockbroker, says. 
"It just gets in the subconscious." 

   The folderol goes far beyond what would be acceptable under <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regulations. 
It makes <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> an easy buy recommendation for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> analysts, even though some of them think other major oil companies might make better long-term investments. 

   This morning, a huge banner on the facade of <ORGANIZATION>Britannic House</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> headquarters, will announce the price that <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION> individual investors will pay in the <MONEY>#7.5 billion</MONEY> (<MONEY>$12.35 billion</MONEY>) <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> share offering. 
Trading of the shares, which are being sold by the British government, is scheduled to begin <DATE>Oct. 30</DATE>. 

   As the ads say, it is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s biggest share offer yet -- and the world's, although that record probably will be broken next month by the second issue of shares in <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s phone company. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> offer's biggest attraction is its installment-payment structure. 
But the avalanche of publicity helps its chances of success. 
A British trade publication called Marketing says consumer awareness of <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> shares currently is higher than for any other advertised product -- beating out such household names as <ORGANIZATION>Guinness</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nescafe</ORGANIZATION>. 
About six million Britons have requested share applications. 
It looks like another triumph for Prime Minister <PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s vision of a shareholding democracy. 

   "The advertising is designed to create an atmosphere in which people feel it is the thing to do" to apply for shares, <PERSON>Robert Willott</PERSON>, a partner at the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION>Spicer &amp; Pegler</ORGANIZATION>, says. 

   Such advertising increasingly is in vogue here. 
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Life Holdings Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> recently promoted a new unit trust, or mutual fund, as the "Royal Event" and ran <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s first national television advertisements for unit trusts. 
Rivals grumbled, but the company drew <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> more applicants than expected and raised <MONEY>#250 million</MONEY>. 

   Last year, <ORGANIZATION>Thames Television PLC</ORGANIZATION> used ads on its <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> TV station to promote its share offering. 

   "We got an overwhelming public response," <PERSON>Robert Dutton</PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION>County NatWest Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the broadcaster's financial adviser, says. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Eurotunnel</ORGANIZATION>, the Anglo-French consortium that is planning a tunnel under the English Channel, hired <ORGANIZATION>Dewe Rogerson Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, the agency orchestrating the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> offer, to promote its equity offering. 
TV ads already are on the air. 

   Critics say such campaigns contain plenty of potential for abuse. 

   "I personally believe in a fair amount of promotional activity," <ORGANIZATION>Spicer &amp; Pegler</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Willott</PERSON> says. 
But, he says, "I equally worry about Joe Public being invited to subscribe to what is an entirely new business with no track record." 

   In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> rules require companies to stick to the contents of propsectuses in any public discussions of an offering. 
Lawyers usually advise companies to keep very quiet. 
Here, the rules allow more leeway. 
In fact, it was the government that began making all the noise, as part of its effort to build share ownership and stamp out socialism. 

   In international offerings -- <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> or more of the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> shares are being sold overseas -- underwriters play by different rules in different countries. 
BP officials and advisers repeatedly have declined to discuss any aspect of the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> issue with The Wall Street Journal or with any other U.S.-based news organization, citing <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> rules. 
Their refusals have continued even though an <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> official said last year that non-U.S. companies can't remove themselves from the scope of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regulations simply by banning contact with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> news organizations. 

   As in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, offerings in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> can't be made without dull documents crammed with financial statements and carefully worded caveats. 
The difference lies in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s use of ads to urge people to apply for shares. 
The ads aren't allowed to say much, but creative presentation, a big budget and a favorable press nonetheless drum up feverish interest. 

   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> began honing its promotional skills with the <DATE>1984</DATE> offering of British Telecommunications. 
Last year's offering of British Gas featured a <MONEY>#40 million</MONEY> advertising campaign centered on a mythical investor named <PERSON>Sid</PERSON>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>British Treasury</ORGANIZATION> says about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of British adults now own shares, compared with <PERCENT>7%</PERCENT> eight years ago, and even <ORGANIZATION>Labor Party</ORGANIZATION> leaders are softening their opposition to wider share ownership. 

   The budget for the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> campaign hasn't been disclosed. 
Critics find the ads -- built around the slogan "Be part of it" -- even cornier than the British Gas effort. 
But the message apparently works. 

   One TV ad associates the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> offer with the previous <ORGANIZATION>British Telecom</ORGANIZATION>, British Gas and <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> offers, all of which made investors fat initial profits. 
The government added a twist to the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> offer, giving investors who signed up for applications by last <DATE>Friday</DATE> a guaranteed allotment of shares. 
By <DATE>last week</DATE>, 5.5 million people had signed up, and tens of thousands more couldn't get through a lastminute switchboard jam. 

   The frenzy of publicity almost obscures the fact that <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> stock has been available on the open market for years. 
In this sale, the government is simply getting rid of its remaining <PERCENT>31.5%</PERCENT> stake in the oil company as well as offering <MONEY>#1.5 billion</MONEY> of new shares to raise capital for <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Homa Motamen</PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION>CIBC Securities Europe Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION>Shell Transport &amp; Trading Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the British arm of <ORGANIZATION>Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ORGANIZATION>, is a better buy on fundamentals, and many other analysts agree. 

   Most of them nonetheless recommend the <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> offer because of its structure. 
The three-part payment plan allows the government to state a high nominal total price while still promising investors a big gain on the initial installment. 

   Backers of the campaign say <ORGANIZATION>BP</ORGANIZATION> and the previous government share offerings have pointed the way to better marketing of financial services. 

   "There is a huge potential investment marketplace," <PERSON>Anthony Carlisle</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dewe Rogerson</PERSON>'s managing director, says. 
But most investment advertising is complicated and puts off the public, he says. 

   "Privatizations have proved the point," he says. 
"Here is something that has been presented as simple, appropriate, good value, accessible and exciting."

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (8): An exclusive club -
Pressures on regional power suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUHR region boasts the headquarters of two leading electricity
utilities, <ORGANIZATION>RWE Energie</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Essen</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dortmund</LOCATION>. Both companies belong
to an exclusive club for utilities owning the high voltage grid, the
<ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Verbundgesellschaft</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>RWE Energie</ORGANIZATION> is the most powerful of the nine club members, with a high
voltage grid four times the length of <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION>'s. <ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION> was founded in <LOCATION>Essen</LOCATION> in the
heart of the Ruhr region in <DATE>1898</DATE> by <PERSON>Hugo Stinnes</PERSON>, the famous industrialist
known to competitors as 'the black-bearded Assyrian,' who emerged after
World War I as <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s 'Business <PERSON>Kaiser</PERSON>,' controlling coal mines, steel
mills, banks, newspapers, hotels, shipping lines - and electrical plants.
<ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION>, partially communally-owned, steadily expanded and evolved over the
decades to become <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s largest electricity utility. In <DATE>1990</DATE>, the
company was restructured to form the <ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION> Holding in which utility <ORGANIZATION>RWE
Energie</ORGANIZATION> constitutes just one of six sectors.
The other big electricity utility in the Ruhr was set up in the <DATE>1920s</DATE>: the
<ORGANIZATION>Vereinigte Elektrizitaetswerke Westfalen</ORGANIZATION> (VEW), based in <LOCATION>Dortmund</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> was
formed by the fusion of several communally owned regional supply companies.
Shortly afterwards, <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION> signed an 'electro-peace treaty' - a
demarcation contract - agreeing not to trespass upon each others' territory.
Such contracts, allowed as exceptions under German competition law, now
exist between all nine '<ORGANIZATION>Verbund</ORGANIZATION>' utilities.
Today, <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> is west <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s fourth largest utility in terms of electricity
sales. It has rapidly expanding gas distribution and waste disposal sectors.
Both <ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> are partly publicly owned, with anachronistic multiple
voting rights giving the communal shareholders an influence
disproportionately large in view of their minority capital shares.
With electricity sales falling - <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> sales were down <MONEY>1.6 oer cent</MONEY> in <DATE>1992</DATE>,
RWE-Energie sales down by 3 per cent in <DATE>1992-93</DATE> - the utilities have a
growth problem. Potential in east <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> exists, but it
is developing very slowly.
Strong talk by the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>German Federal Cartel Office</ORGANIZATION>
(FCO) over the introduction of more competition in the electricity sector
have added impetus to a trend in which smaller utilities seek to hitch
themselves up with larger ones.
The 'minnows' hope that if and when the free-for-all for electricity
customers begins, this overlapping of interests will prevent the large
utilities from snapping up all their lucrative customers. The pattern does
not stop here - even the larger utilities are consolidating their positions.
And the <ORGANIZATION>FCO</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> appears to have only limited power to stop this trend.
A warning came from the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Friedhelm Gieske</PERSON> this <DATE>April</DATE>:
'Competition within the energy sectors, bound by cable or pipeline
transmission, will inevitably lead to concentration so that the large
companies will become ever bigger. This would ultimately help us, but would
be a political mistake and therefore is not something we want.'
Recent developments in the Ruhr illustrate the creeping concentration in the
electricity sector. The city of Dortmund has a concession contract, expiring
in <DATE>1994</DATE>, under which <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> is its exclusive electricity supplier. Initially,
the Dortmund municipal Stadtwerke dreamed of taking over the city
electricity supply. However, sobered by <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION>'s demands for a payment of
around DM1bn for the Dortmund transmission grid, the Stadtwerke agreed to a
compromise. <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Stadtwerke</ORGANIZATION> will found a joint supply company,
<ORGANIZATION>Dortmunder Energie</ORGANIZATION> und Wasserverorgung (DEW) for the electricity, gas,
district heating and water supply to the city.
The <ORGANIZATION>FCO</ORGANIZATION> has approved the deal but imposed two conditions. First, the
contract is valid for only 20 years. Second, <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> is not allowed to use its
minority voting rights to influence Stadtwerke Dortmund decisions over the
source of DEW electricity supplies. In fact, the choice of supplier is very
limited anyway. The only alternative to <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> is the regional utility
Elektromark, in <LOCATION>Hagen</LOCATION>. And the <PERSON>Stadtwerke</PERSON> has already decided to continue
taking electricity from <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>FCO</ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to preserve an element of competition is weak. Observers
wonder if Dortmund is likely to change suppliers after 20 years of
co-operating with <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> - and if Elektromark still be around in 20 years, in
any case. Elektromark's supervisory and executive boards have strongly
recommended linking up with <ORGANIZATION>RWE Energie</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> by selling each of them a 10
per cent block of shares. The link with RWE-Energie is designed to intensify
co-operation in the electricity sector, the connection with <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> serving
links in the waste disposal sector. Elektromark is also selling its 300MW
share in the <LOCATION>Emsland</LOCATION> nuclear power station in equal shares to RWE-Energie
and second largest German utility, <ORGANIZATION>Preussenelektra</ORGANIZATION>, to the discomfort of <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION>
which owns the other 75 per cent.
Such manoeuvres are by no means limited to the Ruhr. Elsewhere in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>
the larger utilities are also consolidating their positions. The <ORGANIZATION>Bavarian
Bayernwerk</ORGANIZATION> is moving rapidly closer to a merger with the <ORGANIZATION>Viag Group</ORGANIZATION>.
IN <LOCATION>Baden-Wuerttemberg</LOCATION>, utilities <ORGANIZATION>Badenwerk</ORGANIZATION> and Energie-Versorgung Schwaben
have been permitted by the <ORGANIZATION>FCO</ORGANIZATION> to merge on the grounds that there was no
competition between the two anyway. Other smaller electricity companies want
to join, too. They fear that if the electricity sector were liberalised
there would otherwise be little to stop Badenwerk/EVS taking their best
customers.
Hannover has decided to sell 40 per cent of its municipal utility. Twenty
per cent goes to German gas giant, <ORGANIZATION>Ruhrgas</ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION>Essen</LOCATION>. Thuega, a
subsidiary of the giant <ORGANIZATION>Veba</ORGANIZATION> which also owns utility <ORGANIZATION>Preussenelektra</ORGANIZATION>, is
taking the other 20 per cent. The link with Thuega could help stave off
potential future threats from <ORGANIZATION>Preussenelektra</ORGANIZATION> to win the <LOCATION>Hannover</LOCATION> utility's
big customers, such as <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>.
In the Ruhr, the <ORGANIZATION>FCO</ORGANIZATION> would undoubtedly fight hard to prevent a <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> merger
with another utility. But as <ORGANIZATION>VEW</ORGANIZATION> slips down the pecking order of '<ORGANIZATION>Verbund</ORGANIZATION>'
companies and is sandwiched between the supply areas of <ORGANIZATION>RWE</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Preussenelektra</ORGANIZATION>, observers wonder how long will it be before it, too,
decides the electricity business is best carried out 'in co-operation' with
a stronger partner.

TEACHER TURNS STUDENT TO MAKE THE GRADE AS A RUNNER AT LBCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dew glittered on the graceful contours of <ORGANIZATION>La Mirada Regional Park</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME> as <PERSON>Patrick McKean</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Long Beach City College</LOCATION> teacher, broke from the 
starting line as a member of the school's cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
In his uniform of black shorts and a red tank top bearing the initials <ORGANIZATION>LBCC</ORGANIZATION>, he 
would run four miles, hopefully in 22 1/2 minutes, past pines, eucalyptuses, a 
shining lake and, to make the paradise complete, his proud father. 
</P>
<P>
McKean is in his second season with the Vikings, the only school athletic team 
he has ever made. "I made one bad attempt at C basketball," <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> said, 
recalling the disappointment he and his parents felt when he was 5 feet 4 and 
failed to make the 10th-grade team at <ORGANIZATION>Ventura High School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 5-10 and 140 pounds, he possesses the same lean frame as many of his 
teammates who are 15 years younger. He is 34, but his narrow face, accented by 
pale blue eyes and a prominent nose, is smooth, and the gray flecks in his dark 
hair are not easily noticed. 
</P>
<P>
This appearance and an easygoing nature allow <PERSON>McKean</PERSON>, though nicknamed 
"Teacher," to blend in with his teammates. "We don't consider him a teacher or 
an old person," sophomore <PERSON>Clarence Allums</PERSON> said as he and <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> stretched 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> before the <ORGANIZATION>Cerritos College Invitational</ORGANIZATION> meet. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Andrew Tansley</PERSON>, another teammate who once had been a student in <PERSON>McKean</PERSON>'s class, 
said, "I thought it was weird at first, having someone so old. But he's just 
one of the guys. He adds life to the team. He's kind of our leader, in a 
different way than a running leader. A lot of people ask him for advice." 
</P>
<P>
That is how <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> likes to be perceived. "They respect me for what I know, but 
I can also go out and run and shoot the bull with them," he said. "I try not to 
be the authority figure out there because I want to relax, too." 
</P>
<P>
He has driven the team van but prefers to let coaches do that. "If we have a 
flat tire they take care of it, I'm just a runner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McKean, a <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> graduate, has taught journalism since <DATE>1988</DATE> at the community 
college at <LOCATION>Clark Avenue</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Carson Street</ORGANIZATION>. He had been a copy editor at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Orange County Register</ORGANIZATION> and then, until it went out of business, at the <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at <LOCATION>Long Beach City College</LOCATION> he was a veteran runner, having 
trained seriously since watching <PERSON>Carlos Lopes</PERSON>, 36, win the marathon in the <DATE>1984</DATE> 
Olympics. Aware that distance runners tend to reach their prime in their 30s, 
<PERSON>McKean</PERSON> figured he was a candidate for the Viking cross-country and track teams. 
</P>
<P>
"And I hadn't used up my eligibility before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Viking Coach <PERSON>Ron Allice</PERSON>, whose principles include never cutting 
anyone who tries out. Allice assured <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> that other older runners, even some 
with full-time jobs, had been on the team in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Soon came the thrilling day when <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> received a school uniform for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like a little kid," he said, the memory still fresh and exciting. "I 
thought, 'Wow, I made the team,' even though everybody in cross-country makes 
the team. I went up to my dad's (in <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION>) that weekend, showed the shorts, 
the shirt and the sweats off to him and my sister and three brothers. They were 
all proud. I was like, 'Gosh, I feel like sleeping in them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Any student is allowed to compete two seasons in a community college sport, and 
<PERSON>McKean</PERSON> had to become one again to be eligible. He takes the required 12 credits 
a semester, mostly in physical education, and also teaches newswriting and 
serves as faculty adviser for the student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the toughest academic schedule, but it's legal and official," said 
<PERSON>McKean</PERSON>, who has straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
Each day at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME>, his classes over, <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> practices with his teammates, 
trying to keep up with them. "He's totally involved," said <PERSON>Allice</PERSON>, who in 11 
seasons has eight state track titles, but none in cross-country. "He has a very 
positive influence on the guys. He's really a joy to have as part of the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Under <PERSON>Allice</PERSON> and graduate assistant Tyrus Deminter, an All-American at the 
school in <DATE>1982-83</DATE>, <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> has improved greatly. Before coming to <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> he 
had completed each of the first four <LOCATION>Los Angeles Marathons</LOCATION> in about 4 1/2 
hours. He ran the fifth in <DATE>March</DATE> in 3:26. 
</P>
<P>
Also last <DATE>spring</DATE> he finished eighth in the 10,000-meter run to record a point 
for the Viking track team in the <ORGANIZATION>South Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> championship meet. "We 
won by 8 or 10 points and we joked that mine was the turning point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-country, <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> can generally be found in the middle of the pack in 
weekly competition against the top runners in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. He said 
opponents do not seem to mind passing someone almost old enough to be their 
father, nor do they complain when he passes them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've moved almost up to the top <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of big (meets), usually about 70th out of 
135 runners," <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> said <DATE>last Friday</DATE> in his office at the school newspaper. 
"I'm hoping tomorrow, with a weaker field, that I will break into the top <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>." 
</P>
<P>
McKean has found team competition much more demanding than "huffing along" in 
5-Ks and 10-Ks in <LOCATION>Downey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cerritos</LOCATION>. "There have been many times when I 
churned up a hill in 105-degree heat, chewing my teammates' dust, wondering why 
in the world I'm doing this," he said. "I could be in the air-conditioned 
office grading papers or out playing a leisurely round of golf." 
</P>
<P>
What has hooked him is team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to be state champions," he said. "I'm glad to be 
ninth-string and part of that." 
</P>
<P>
The realization that his belated but brief college career is nearing an end 
seemed to sadden <PERSON>McKean</PERSON>. "I have tomorrow and next week (at the conference 
championships)," he said. "Then I'm going to run track next <DATE>spring</DATE>, and I'm 
hoping to qualify in the 10,000 in the state meet." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher got off to a good start in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s race for runners eighth and 
lower on their teams. At the halfway mark, he and teammate <PERSON>Andy Dale</PERSON> noticed 
something unusual -- they could still see the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>McKean</PERSON> soon started to tire and dropped to his customary position in the 
middle of the pack, if, with the small field, it could be called a pack. But he 
finished strong, sprinting up a little hill to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
In a field of 26, he was 15th with a time of 23:36. He was still not in the top 
<PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> but he had bettered his time over the same course last year by 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Sweat glistened on him like the dew had on the grass. "I ran as hard as I 
could," he said. "My left foot kind of cramped. I dream of 22:30, but it's 
always tougher than it looks on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
His father, <PERSON>Mack McKean</PERSON>, who had driven from <LOCATION>Ventura</LOCATION> and joined the few other 
spectators, shook his son's hand. As they stood there under a tree, the older 
man in his jeans and the runner in his cherished uniform, the disappointment 
both had felt so long ago when <PERSON>Mack</PERSON>'s boy had been cut from the basketball team 
had vanished.

<TEXT>
<P>
You can enjoy a sip of Irish whiskey almost anywhere in the world, but for a 
lesson in it, as well as a taste or five, try <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There, in an old, restored warehouse on Bow Street in the <ORGANIZATION>Smithfield</ORGANIZATION> section of 
the Irish capital, visitors can sample a selection of Irish whiskey for the 
modest price of <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> per person. 
</P>
<P>
At this quaint retreat, showplace and museum, which once belonged to <PERSON>John 
Jameson Distillery</PERSON>, guests are entertained with tales of Irish whiskey, 
wonderful old photographs and drawings, informative displays and a film showing 
how Irish whiskey is fashioned from barley grain, crystal-clear water and 
yeast. 
</P>
<P>
And when they've tired of history, visitors may taste the best and most popular 
Irish whiskeys -- many of which are not available in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> -- 
before selecting a bottle to take back home. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION> tastings, five shot glasses are filled with different 
kinds of Irish whiskey and are set out for sampling. 
</P>
<P>
Each label has its own character. There's light and mellow <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON>, the world's 
largest selling Irish whiskey, often served on the rocks; mild and malty 
Bushmills, often sipped straight up; <LOCATION>Paddy</LOCATION>, smooth and light with a hint of 
maltiness, popular in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>John Power &amp; Son</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>'s most popular 
label, which has a rich flavor enhanced by malt undertones, usually served 
half-and-half with water, and <ORGANIZATION>Tullamore Dew</ORGANIZATION>, light and delicate with a 
well-balanced flavor, usually served with ice and water. 
</P>
<P>
Tasters sip each to select a favorite, which they then compare to their 
favorite labels of Scotch whiskey, and with American-made bourbon. Needless to 
say, discussion is lively. 
</P>
<P>
Although there's serious debate in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> about whether whiskey was discovered 
or invented, nobody doubts that Christian missionary monks brought with them a 
device called the alembic, a small still invented in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> that was 
used to make alcohol for perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish soon learned how to use it to distill alcohol from a fermented mash 
of barley and water. They called the beverage uisce beatha (pronounced 
ish-ke-ba-ha) -- Gaelic for "water of life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, we know that beverage as Irish whiskey. Although the anniversary of its 
invention has not been commemorated with annual celebrations, the "water of 
life" has been an integral part of celebrations and anniversaries since it was 
first sipped in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, way back when. 
</P>
<P>
The drink has an historical following that reads like Who's Who. It was a 
favorite of Queen Elizabeth I and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the Great. Sir <PERSON>Walter Raleigh</PERSON> once 
stopped off in <ORGANIZATION>Cork</ORGANIZATION> on his way to the New World to pick up, in his words, "a 
supreme present of a 32-gallon cask of the <ORGANIZATION>Earl of Cork</ORGANIZATION>'s home-distilled uisce 
beatha." 
</P>
<P>
Historians say the word "whiskey" was first used in about <DATE>1171</DATE>, when the 
soldiers of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Henry II</ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
While these uninvited guests were greatly taken with Irish whiskey, they 
couldn't get their tongues to negotiate the words, which were anglicized to 
"fuisce" and finally to "whiskey." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Irish and Americans spell that name "whiskey," while Scots and 
Canadians spell it "whisky," without the "e." 
</P>
<P>
However it's spelled, Irish whiskey is made of both fresh and malted barley 
used in varying amounts to create single and double malts. Government 
regulations define Irish whiskey: how it is made, from which materials and for 
how long it is to be matured. 
</P>
<P>
Malted barley is made by steeping in water. It then is allowed to sprout. The 
germination produces diastase, an enzyme that converts starch in the barley to 
fermentable sugars. 
</P>
<P>
It then is dried in in closed kilns, a method that gives Irish whiskey a clean, 
barley taste unlike the smokey flavor that results when malted barley is dried 
over open peat fires, as it is in making Scotch whiskey. A mixture of fresh and 
malted barley is combined with liquid yeast and allowed to ferment. 
</P>
<P>
Irish whiskey requires a triple distillation process in a series of stills to 
refine and strengthen the flavors. It is then placed in oak casks and kept in 
dark, cool warehouses for at least three, and possibly as long as 12, years 
while the whiskey matures. 
</P>
<P>
Each oak cask has its own character and adds a different flavor to the maturing 
whiskey. Ultimately the contents of the casks are blended in huge vats from 
which bottles of whiskey are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> had dozens of small, independent whiskey-making 
distilleries but there has been considerable consolidation in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are about a dozen brands of Irish whiskey, each of which produces 
several grades, from low-priced to super-premium in quality. And all of it is 
made at just two locations. 
</P>
<P>
Bushmills, the oldest licensed whiskey distillery in the world, with a license 
dating back to <DATE>1608</DATE>, is still in operation in <LOCATION>Northern Ireland</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>County 
Antrim</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The other brands are made at <LOCATION>Midleton</LOCATION>, a modern distillery opened in <DATE>1975</DATE> in 
<LOCATION>County Cork</LOCATION> in the Republic of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>. All are associates of the <ORGANIZATION>Irish 
Distillers Group</ORGANIZATION>, which owns and runs <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the 12 kinds of Irish whiskey are available in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Those 
that are include high-priced premiums (<PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> and Bushmills), super-premium 
(Black <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> 1780) and super-super-premium (<ORGANIZATION>Midleton Very Rare</ORGANIZATION>, 
available in only limited supply). 
</P>
<P>
Other Irish whiskeys, including <LOCATION>Paddy</LOCATION>, Power, <PERSON>Dunphy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>, were 
distributed in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and some stock still remains on liquor store shelves, 
until about two years ago when exportation was discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
That makes all the more reason for sampling the real thing at <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey 
Corner</ORGANIZATION>. In addition, Irish whiskey is sold there at very good prices. 
</P>
<P>
Numbered bottles of <ORGANIZATION>Midleton Very Rare</ORGANIZATION>, considered to be best in quality among 
the Irish whiskeys, costs about <MONEY>$60</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION>. Dublin high street 
prices for Midleton Very Rare -- if it can be found -- are about <MONEY>$75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$83</MONEY>, 
while it costs <MONEY>$90</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100</MONEY> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION> sells Jamesons <DATE>1780</DATE> and Bushmills single malt for <MONEY>$26</MONEY> per 
liter, Black <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for about <MONEY>$22</MONEY> per liter (compared with a U.S.-price of about 
<MONEY>$25</MONEY> for a smaller fifth) and <LOCATION>Paddy</LOCATION>, Power, <LOCATION>Tullamore Dew</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> for about 
<MONEY>$20</MONEY> per liter. 
</P>
<P>
Those more interested in the history than the drinking of Irish whiskey can 
drop by the <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION> shop to buy T-shirts (<MONEY>$10</MONEY>), sweatshirts (<MONEY>$18</MONEY>), 
ice buckets (<MONEY>$10</MONEY>) and jugs (<MONEY>$10</MONEY>), as well as handsome crystal decanters and 
sets of drinking glasses (up to <MONEY>$300</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Shannon Airport Duty Free Shop</ORGANIZATION> sells a variety of Irish whiskeys at prices 
similar to those at <ORGANIZATION>Irish Whiskey Corner</ORGANIZATION>, but the selection isn't as complete, 
nor are there any free tastings. 
</P>
<P>
For those who wait until the very last minute to stock up on uisce beatha, <ORGANIZATION>Aer 
Lingus</ORGANIZATION> offers half-liter bottles of Paddys and <PERSON>Jameson</PERSON> for about <MONEY>$7</MONEY> in its 
in-flight shop.

FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: How the endless rise of Harland Simon ran
out of fuel - The questionable methods behind the group's collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON <DATE>TUESDAY February 11</DATE> <PERSON>Mr Roy Ashman</PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON>Harland Simon</PERSON>, the control
systems and imaging group, finally admitted his run of luck was over.
At a board meeting that day it became clear that the company's years of
profits growth, built on successful products, but some highly questionable
financial procedures, were past. Harland issued a warning which spoke of an
expected 'significant fall in profits'. Its shares collapsed from 590p to
253p and <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> resigned.
Faced with a crisis of confidence among customers and shareholders, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>
fell deeper into trouble and by this <DATE>September</DATE> its shares were suspended.
One month later receivers were appointed. The extraordinary rise of <PERSON>Harland
Simon</PERSON> was over.
Harland's main business was manufacture of process control equipment,
especially for the newspaper industry. Its products were well regarded and
sold to several national newspapers, including the <ORGANIZATION>Telegraph</ORGANIZATION> group, <ORGANIZATION>News
International and Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.5m in the year to <DATE>March 31, 1989</DATE> to
Pounds 8.3m in <DATE>1990</DATE> and Pounds 10.5m in <DATE>1991</DATE>. In the weeks leading up to the
profits warning, analysts expected <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> to make profits of Pounds 12.5m
for the year to <DATE>March 1992</DATE>. But it announced losses of Pounds 6.3m.
<PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON>, who did not return telephone calls seeking interviews for this
article, co-founded the company and is described by former colleagues as a
dealmaker who left details to others. He gained the confidence of the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>,
which was impressed by his ability to explain technology in simple terms.
Harland won a stock market premium and outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index
by 200 per cent between <DATE>1988</DATE> and the profit warning.
According to former employees, he was an optimist who believed the plaudits
awarded him in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>. But in the quest for yet higher profits, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>
became dependent on orders from major shareholders. When these sold out,
<PERSON>Harland</PERSON> was unable to sustain orders and turned to questionable financial
practices.
'He got absorbed by his own aura and got deeper and deeper in trouble,' a
former colleague said.
Documents in the possession of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> provide evidence that:
Harland altered a large customer order so profits could be taken earlier
than allowed by accounting regulations.
executives misled investors about <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s relationship with Perfect
Information Limited (PIL), a loss-making information company.
Harland overcharged for equipment sold to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> which was then sold and leased
back from banks at the inflated value.
two executives lodged the accounts of a subsidiary at <ORGANIZATION>Companies House</ORGANIZATION>
against the wishes of the subsidiary's managing director, who said a board
meeting was not validly convened, as required by the Companies Act.
Harland was floated in <DATE>1987</DATE>. In the mid <DATE>1980s</DATE> a major source of business was
<ORGANIZATION>Mirror Group Newspapers</ORGANIZATION>, then controlled by <PERSON>Mr Robert Maxwell</PERSON>. At the same
time, <PERSON>Mr Maxwell</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Pergamon</LOCATION> was a Harland shareholder, after gaining an
option in <DATE>1986</DATE> to buy into the company. On <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s flotation, <LOCATION>Pergamon</LOCATION>
made a profit of nearly Pounds 900,000 on its shares.
Mountain Dew, a family trust controlled by <PERSON>Mr Asil Nadir</PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION>Polly
Peck International</ORGANIZATION>, the failed fruits and electronics group, then emerged as
<LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s major shareholder, owning 28 per cent by <DATE>August 1989</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Nadir</PERSON> was again one of <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s main customers. Newspapers such as <PERSON>Mr
Nadir</PERSON>'s Istanbul-based Gunaydin placed substantial orders with <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> for
process control and imaging systems.
In <DATE>1990</DATE> Mountain Dew and <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> set up <ORGANIZATION>News Cuttings Bureau</ORGANIZATION> (NCB), a
company that later changed its name to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>. Mountain Dew owned 80 per cent
of <ORGANIZATION>NCB</ORGANIZATION> while <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> each owned 10 per cent.
In late <DATE>March 1990</DATE>, just before <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s year end, <ORGANIZATION>NCB</ORGANIZATION> ordered Pounds 3.8m
of equipment from <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>. The transaction was booked in <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1990</DATE>
accounts, generating operating profits of Pounds 2.5m.
Helped by this profit boost, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> successfully completed a rights issue
in <DATE>July</DATE> to raise Pounds 13.8m. Mountain Dew used the opportunity to sell its
stake in <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> in <DATE>September 1990</DATE> for a profit of nearly Pounds 5m. Its
shares in <ORGANIZATION>NCB</ORGANIZATION> were sold to <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>, so that each owned 50 per
cent.
Harland's links with <PERSON>Mr Maxwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Nadir</PERSON> were well known but their
importance was not fully appreciated by shareholders.
'Harland kept beating our profit estimates. Looking back, the deals with
<PERSON>Maxwell</PERSON> and Nadir were either fortunate coincidences or extremely clever
forward planning,' one shareholder said.
By <DATE>March 1991</DATE>, with no large shareholder to place orders, recession began to
take its toll. With its financial year drawing to a close, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> told its
subsidiaries to find orders. According to a former employee, 'there was
always a problem at the year end, but Roy (<PERSON>Ashman</PERSON>) always seemed to pull a
rabbit out of his hat'.
On <DATE>March 25</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Mr Neil Smart</PERSON> wrote to <PERSON>Harland Simon</PERSON> Library
Systems ordering Pounds 2.4m of equipment. <PERSON>Mr Smart</PERSON>'s order was doctored by
<LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>. A second letter, written subsequently but backdated to <DATE>March 25</DATE>,
removed a paragraph that mentioned timings for delivery, and changed <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s
payment terms. The letter, found in <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s files some months later, was
purportedly signed by <PERSON>Evelyn Child</PERSON>, on behalf of <PERSON>Mr Smart</PERSON>. Ms Child was <PERSON>Mr
Ashman</PERSON>'s personal assistant, and had no responsibility for PIL or <PERSON>Mr Smart</PERSON>.
According to former <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> employees, this second letter was to help
convince <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s auditors, <ORGANIZATION>Price Waterhouse</ORGANIZATION>, that profit from the order
could be taken in <DATE>1991</DATE>. These employees said taking profits early happened
on other occasions.
Harland booked about Pounds 1.6m profit from the deal, even though none of
the equipment could have been prepared, delivered and invoiced in the <DATE>six
days before the year end</DATE>. Equipment sold to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> was also overpriced,
sometimes by up to 50 per cent. Earlier this year a group creditor asked a
specialist computer company to value a system supplied by <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>.
The company's conclusion was: 'The system was grossly overpriced.'
In <DATE>1990</DATE> and <DATE>1991</DATE> Harland sold equipment to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> for Pounds 7.8m. According to
a bank involved, the list price was Pounds 3.5m. <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> therefore booked at
least Pounds 4m of clear operating profit - a 50 per cent margin compared
with about 14 per cent for the business overall.
On one occasion in <DATE>1991</DATE>, a computer with a list price of Pounds 250,000 was
sold by <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> for Pounds 400,000. The equipment was then sold to
and leased back from a leading bank. The bank only checked on the value of
the equipment once <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s problems became public.
Harland did not consolidate PIL, even when it increased its stake to 50 per
cent, because the stake was classified as a short-term holding in its
accounts. In <DATE>summer 1991</DATE>, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> told shareholders it had disposed of the
investment.
Harland paid the Swiss company <ORGANIZATION>Oerlikon</ORGANIZATION> Buhrle a nominal SFr5 for <ORGANIZATION>Contraves</ORGANIZATION>,
a loss-making drives company. According to <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oerlikon</ORGANIZATION> agreed in
return to invest Pounds 2.45m in <LOCATION>Sandford</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Liechtenstein</LOCATION> trust, which in
turn invested the money in <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> for a 54 per cent stake.
But <ORGANIZATION>Oerlikon</ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly said it made no money available. Price
Waterhouse qualified <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s <DATE>1992</DATE> accounts because it could not establish
ownership of <ORGANIZATION>Sandford</ORGANIZATION>. Sandford's trustee, <PERSON>Prince Michael</PERSON> von <LOCATION>Liechtenstein</LOCATION>,
refused to comment.
Sandford held the 54 per cent stake in <LOCATION>PIL</LOCATION>, but documents with the <ORGANIZATION>FT</ORGANIZATION>
suggest <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> retained control of <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> throughout. Until <DATE>January this year</DATE>,
five months after <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> claimed to have relinquished control of <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mr
Ashman</PERSON> stepped down as a director of <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> was the sole signatory
on <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s bank account.
After <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> resigned from <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s bank mandate was
changed to allow any two signatures from <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s three directors. But two
directors, <PERSON>Mr George Neophitou</PERSON> - appointed in <DATE>February</DATE> - and <PERSON>Mr John
Stobart</PERSON>, were Harland executives. Harland also remained sole guarantor for
two equipment leases, worth more than Pounds 4m, taken out by <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Contraves</ORGANIZATION> was to play a large part in <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s downfall. It continued to
lose money and by last <DATE>December</DATE> <PERSON>Mr John Redshaw</PERSON>, managing director, admitted
privately that <ORGANIZATION>Contraves</ORGANIZATION> had much higher borrowings than previously thought.
Following <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s profits warning, and more rigorous accounting policies,
<PERSON>Harland</PERSON> made provisions of Pounds 5.23m to cover <ORGANIZATION>Contraves</ORGANIZATION>.
By <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> had order and cashflow problems. <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr
Redshaw</PERSON> met with other executives and discussed wage freezes and
redundancies. In one meeting, <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> said: 'I don't think Christmas will
come this year.' On <DATE>December 12</DATE> Harland released an optimistic interim
statement with a 16 per cent profits increase. The company said it was
weathering recession well and had secured good orders.
Problems mounted through <DATE>January</DATE> as cash drained out into <ORGANIZATION>Contraves</ORGANIZATION> and
orders were scarce. Yet <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> continued to give upbeat briefings.
On <DATE>February 10</DATE>, the day before the board met to agree on a profits warning,
<PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> met with one institution, <PERSON>John Govett</PERSON>. After the meeting, it
bought 125,000 Harland shares for more than Pounds 700,000. When the profits
warning was released <DATE>two days later</DATE>, analysts and shareholders were stunned.
<PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> was quickly succeeded by <PERSON>Mr David Mahony</PERSON>, the deputy chairman of
<PERSON>Harland</PERSON> and an industrial adviser to <ORGANIZATION>Hambros</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s merchant bank. But
<PERSON>Mr Mahony</PERSON> failed to restore confidence and <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s shares continued to
slide. Morale, dented since the Christmas pay freeze, plunged. Customers and
suppliers started asking questions.
Harland discovered it had a new problem. Systems supplied to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> were
working poorly and despite <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s effective control over the company,
<ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s managing director <PERSON>Mr Charles Warner-Allen</PERSON> started to complain.
Because of <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s poor trading position, he wanted a statement in <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>March
1991</DATE> accounts - which had still not been finalised - that <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s
ultimate holding company. <PERSON>Mr Warner-Allen</PERSON> argued that a <DATE>March 1991</DATE>
information memorandum seeking subscribers for shares in PIL - subsequently
aborted - contained such a clause.
Harland refused. If it had agreed, it would have been forced to consolidate
PIL's accounts. Instead, <PERSON>Mr Stobart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Neophitou</PERSON> signed off the accounts
in <DATE>June</DATE> with only a statement of support from <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>.
According to <PERSON>Mr Warner-Allen</PERSON>, he was not notified of a board meeting to
clear the accounts, as is required under the Companies Act.
In a letter to <PERSON>Mr Neophitou</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mr Warner-Allen</PERSON> said he was 'staggered' to find
out the accounts had been signed off without the approval of the company's
managing director.
By <DATE>September</DATE>, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s decline looked terminal. Proceeds from the disposal
of a subsidiary were withheld by <ORGANIZATION>Barclays</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s main banker, and the
shares were suspended on the stock exchange at 20p.
Harland did not go into receivership immediately. Instead, its financial
adviser, <ORGANIZATION>Hambros</ORGANIZATION>, put forward two company doctors, Sir <PERSON>Ian Morrow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr
Tony McCann</PERSON>, to join the company's executive committee, but not as
directors. <PERSON>Mr McCann</PERSON> was paid more than Pounds 6,000 a week during his short
tenure.
On <DATE>September 15</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Hambros</ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> it was switching to weekly invoicing
for its advice. In the <DATE>last few weeks of September</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Hambros</ORGANIZATION> charged Harland
up to Pounds 19,000 a week for its services.
On <DATE>September 11</DATE> Harland wrote to <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION> saying it was withdrawing support. PIL
went into liquidation and triggered the guarantee of more than Pounds 4m
granted by <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> over <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>'s leased equipment. The guarantee was worthless
once receivers were appointed at <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION> on <DATE>October 23</DATE>.
Several hundred employees are unsure if they will recover all their
pensions. The pension fund's trustees, <PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Mahony</PERSON>, approved the
investment of Pounds 500,000 of the fund's money in <ORGANIZATION>PIL</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Harland</PERSON> said in
<DATE>July</DATE> that the money would be returned, but it has not been repaid. When <PERSON>Mr
Ashman</PERSON> left the company in <DATE>February</DATE> he received a Pounds 365,000 pay off,
together with his full entitlement of Pounds 960,000 from <LOCATION>Harland</LOCATION>'s Pounds
6m pension fund.
<PERSON>Mr Ashman</PERSON>, meanwhile, is attempting a comeback. Working out of an office in
<PERSON>Milton Keynes</PERSON>, he and two other directors have bought <PERSON>Harland</PERSON>'s control
systems division from the receiver. The company is being renamed <PERSON>Harland
Simon</PERSON> Limited. A former colleague said: 'Roy thinks he can start all over
again. He still thinks the <ORGANIZATION>City</ORGANIZATION> loves him.'

FOR somewhat more down-to-earth and less nostalgic picnicking there is the
Huzar table (right). No more lolling on rugs damp with dew - this picnic
table seats four in comfort and folds into a flattish carrying case so that
it can be stowed in boot or boat.
Made from plastic with a strong aluminium frame, it is easy to clean and
robust as well as light. It could go happily to pool or polo, to riverside
or point-to-point, to <LOCATION>Badminton</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Glyndebourne</LOCATION>. It weighs 21 lb, pulls out
to measure 33 1/2 in by 26 in and it comes in blue, green, red or yellow. It
can only be bought by post and costs Pounds 69 from <ORGANIZATION>Huzar Co</ORGANIZATION>, PO Box 12,
<LOCATION>Knebworth</LOCATION>, Herts SG3 6QQ. Tel: 0438-811018.

LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN; THE DUTY OF GENIUS BY RAY MONK (THE FREE PRESS, A DIVISION 
OF MACMILLAN: $29.95; 654 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Gingold, Gingold, a journalist, has studied philosophy with students 
of Wittgenstein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The philosopher <PERSON>Ludwig Wittgenstein</PERSON> may be the most famous obscure intellectual 
of the century. It's hard to imagine a more unwilling celebrity than this 
profoundly serious man who shunned publicity and devoted his life to the 
pursuit of clarity. Since his death in <DATE>1951</DATE>, however, he has emerged as one of 
the best known and least comprehended contemporary thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
He's the "Mad Genius" as sent by <ORGANIZATION>Central</ORGANIZATION> (European) Casting, the savior of 
British philosophy or its trivializer. He is passionate, tormented, 
misunderstood, a man so singular that virtually everyone who ever knew him, 
from <PERSON>Bertrand Russell</PERSON> to the man who delivered peat to his cottage in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, 
remembered and wrote about him. He reminded one student of "the <ORGANIZATION>Norse God 
Baldur</ORGANIZATION>, blue-eyed and fair-haired, with a beauty that had nothing sensual about 
it." Others were less enthusiastic. One young boy told his diary: "Witkinstein 
(sic) is an impossible person everytime you say anything he says 'No No that's 
not the point.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was equally hard on himself, a master of self-laceration who often 
contemplated suicide. Though baptized a Catholic, he was of Jewish descent, a 
heritage he sometimes blamed for his moral and mental inadequacies in language 
reminiscent of "Mein Kampf." (Curiously, <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> attended the 
same school for a year; there's no evidence that they met.) 
</P>
<P>
Though he wrote constantly, he revised constantly too; most of his work has 
been posthumously published, and generates hundreds of scholarly books and 
articles each year. A recent bibliography lists nearly 6,000 items. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the academy, <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> is a cultural presence to many who know him 
only as a name, or the inspiration for a sizable body of music, art and 
writing. His words have been rendered in dance and neon; there's even a poem 
about his lecturing style. He's a character in several novels and is mentioned 
in plays, on public television and by <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to learn more about his fascinating figure, <PERSON>Ray Monk</PERSON>'s 
thoughtful and accessible biography, intended for the general reader, 
encompasses the life and work in a single narrative, illuminating the values 
implicit in both. 
</P>
<P>
The book's subtitle, "The Duty of Genius," is taken from <PERSON>Otto Weininger</PERSON>'s "Sex 
and Character," which Monk believes is the source of many of <LOCATION>Wittgenstein</LOCATION>'s 
attitudes toward life and love. Weininger, a misogynist and anti-Semite, 
believed it was man's duty to conquer the flesh and to discover and realize his 
genius -- or to kill himself. A Jew and a homosexual, <PERSON>Weininger</PERSON> shot himself at 
23, in the house where <PERSON>Beethoven</PERSON>, his hero, died. Suicide greatly increased 
both <PERSON>Weininger</PERSON>'s moral prestige and the sales of his book, which <ORGANIZATION>Wittgenstein</ORGANIZATION> 
read as an adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
Though Monk's is not the authorized biography, he enjoyed the complete 
cooperation of <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON>'s literary executors, who permitted him to quote 
from previously unpublished material, including diary entries written by 
<PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> in code about his homosexuality, which has been the subject of an 
unseemly, irresistible debate. Much of <ORGANIZATION>Monk</ORGANIZATION>'s research will be new to even avid 
readers of <LOCATION>Wittgensteiniana</LOCATION>; those unacquainted with <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON>'s philosophy 
will find Monk's explanations helpful and unforbidding, if not exactly a piece 
of Sacher torte. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittgenstein was born in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> in <DATE>1889</DATE>, the eighth child of an extremely 
rich, cultivated and ill-fated family. His father was a steel magnate on the 
order of <PERSON>Andrew Carnegie</PERSON>, his mother a musically gifted patron of the arts. 
Three of the brothers committed suicide; the fourth, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>, continued his career 
as a concert pianist despite the loss of an arm in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The world is fin de siecle <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, the city <PERSON>Karl Kraus</PERSON> called "the research 
laboratory for world destruction"; the birthplace of Nazism and Zionism; the 
<LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> of <PERSON>Sigmund Freud</PERSON>, <PERSON>Arnold Shoenberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Adolph Loos</PERSON>. Like these 
contemporaries, <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> broke away from the historical outlook in his 
field: His linguistic analysis is a radical departure in philosophy, analogous 
to psychoanalysis in psychiatry, atonality in music and functionalism in 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Wittgenstein's originality seemed especially pronounced in the alien culture of 
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, where he spent much of his working life. He went to <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION> as a 
young man to study engineering, then took up aeronautics and, finally, 
mathematical logic at <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Bertrand Russell</PERSON>, who introduced him to <PERSON>G. 
E. Moore</PERSON>, <PERSON>John Maynard Keynes</PERSON> and other Apostles of Bloomsbury. 
</P>
<P>
At the outbreak of World War I, <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> enlisted in the Austrian 
artillery, hoping to die or to change his life. He fought on the Russian front, 
was decorated for bravery and taken prisoner in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. When he was captured, he 
had with him the manuscript of the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," the only 
one of his books published in his lifetime, a work as magisterial as its title 
suggests, and best understood (if at all) in the context of <LOCATION>Wittgenstein</LOCATION>'s war 
experience. Here Monk's approach is particularly apt, revealing, as 
<PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> insisted, that "the point of the book is ethical." 
</P>
<P>
So was the point of <LOCATION>Wittgenstein</LOCATION>'s life, which shows the strong ethical views 
that the "Tractatus" says cannot be spoken of, only made manifest. He sought a 
life of Christian virtue as conceived by <ORGANIZATION>Tolstoy</ORGANIZATION>, and seems to have taken the 
ideals of poverty, chastity and duty more seriously than his mentor. He 
relinquished his fortune to his sisters and brother and lived very simply, in 
barely furnished rooms, once telling a friend: "I don't care what I eat as long 
as it's the same thing every day." Since sex and love were incompatible, he was 
tortured by sexual guilt over even fantasized transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
He grew to see philosophy as his duty, and devoted his life to it after he 
returned to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in <DATE>1929</DATE> and began the work which culminated in the 
"Philosophical Investigations," the most polished and influential of the later 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Here <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> rejects the classical view of philosophy as the attempt to 
answer ultimate questions. Philosophical problems, he writes, are not about 
matters of ultimate (or any kind of) fact; they arise from linguistic 
misunderstandings, from mistakes in logical grammar. The job of the 
philosopher, as he sees it, is to "command a clear view of the use of our 
words." Philosophy is not a theory, but an activity, "a battle against the 
bewitchment of our intelligence by language." 
</P>
<P>
Consider a question like "What is time?" Because it is similar in form to "What 
is dew?," it misleads us into looking for something we can point to or 
describe, as we would the dew. Thus the endless philosophical theories about 
the nature of time. The Wittgensteinian philosopher resists the "craving of 
generality." Instead of theorizing about time, he minutely examines how the 
word is used (how we teach it to children, for example), and is no longer 
puzzled. He can teach it, he can measure it, he can be on it. The meaning of 
time is not some mysterious metaphysical something, it is, roughly, its use in 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophy is a therapeutic enterprise, <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> believed, a set of related 
techniques for dispelling linguistic confusions. This approach seemed 
exhilarating and effective to many philosophers; others, including <PERSON>Bertrand 
Russell</PERSON>, condemned it as a cop-out, a refusal to think seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy persists. In "The Legacy of <LOCATION>Wittgenstein</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Anthony Kenny</PERSON> 
suggests that "Wittgensteinian philosophy as opposed to Wittgensteinian 
scholarship has not made progress, and some of the philosophical gains we owe 
to (him) seem in danger of being lost." 
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, <PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> was a cult figure in philosophy. In his 
lectures, he struggled visibly with his thoughts, which often were expressed in 
imaginative questions and aphorisms. His gestures and intonations were 
distinctive and much imitated; he feared, perhaps rightly, that his influence 
was destructive to his students. To him, the profession of philosophy was "a 
living death," but all he was fit for; he urged his students to take up 
something useful, like medicine or manual labor, especially if they were 
serious philosophers. (He himself worked as a gardener in a monastery, and as a 
hospital orderly in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> during World War II.) Philosophy was worthless 
unless it helped you to live a morally better life. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wittgenstein</PERSON> did not permit "tourists" at his lectures, and the chances are, 
that's you. Monk is considerably more hospitable, yet travelers should expect a 
fairly rigorous journey. Nevertheless, the book is engrossing, especially if 
read in conjunction with <LOCATION>Wittgenstein</LOCATION> himself. In Monk's comprehensive account, 
certain features of <LOCATION>Wittgenstein</LOCATION>'s thought seem remarkably current. He is 
deeply suspicious of science and scientism, more interested in differences than 
in similarities, against abstraction and for contextual interpretation. And 
always, spirit prevails. 
</P>
<P>
So what if he's tough. There are worse ways to spend the fin de siecle.

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> broke his own speed
record on the <ORGANIZATION>Cape Arundel Golf Course</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, teeing it up at <TIME>6:54 a.m.</TIME>, hustled around the par-69 links
course in 1:42, clipping nine minutes off his previous best.
   ``I understand he set a new aerobic golf record,'' said <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>.
   There were only three in the presidential party: club pro <PERSON>Ken
Raynor Jr.</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>, part-owner of the
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We could set a record today,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> predicted as he set out on
the dew-soaked, deserted course. He even provided a sports
monologue for the reporters out to watch him.
   ``Silence on the first tee,'' decreed the president as he
stepped up to address the ball. ``<PERSON>Mr. Smooth</PERSON> is back. They're all
wondering how this one will go.''
   Whack!
   ``... And he's not happy. Or is it up, Kenny?'' said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>,
turning to his pro for a second opinion on the drive.
   By the time he got out of his golf cart on the 18th green, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
was not a happy man, speed record or no.
   ``I'm out of it. I did lousy,'' he confessed.
   It was his fourth golf outing since arriving in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> on
a vacation interrupted repeatedly by the gulf crisis.

MARCIANO'S 28 VAULT SIMI VALLEY INTO FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that no matter what happens, who wins, who loses, there is always a 
streak hanging in the balance with the <ORGANIZATION>Simi Valley High</ORGANIZATION> basketball team. When 
last heard from, the Pioneers had dropped their first <ORGANIZATION>Marmonte League</ORGANIZATION> game in 
their past 32, to <LOCATION>Westlake</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But, as <ORGANIZATION>Simi Valley</ORGANIZATION> turned the corner <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and looked ahead to its 
second loop around the league, first-year Coach <PERSON>Dean Bradshaw</PERSON> and his Pioneers 
still have a rally cry. Trite, but to the point, it's "one more for four." 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to focus in on every game," <PERSON>Bradshaw</PERSON> said after the 
Pioneers beat <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, 70-63, at <LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION> to win their fifth league game 
in 6 tries and regain possession of first place. "We still talk about one more 
for four every day." 
</P>
<P>
And you thought it was getting tedious reading once in a while about the fact 
that the Pioneers are chasing their fourth consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Every day? 
</P>
<P>
"We're in first place by ourselves right now," he added. "I hope we can say 
that at the end of the second round." 
</P>
<P>
A few more games for senior guard <PERSON>Jeff Marciano</PERSON> like the one he had against 
<LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Bradshaw</ORGANIZATION>'s wishes will be <ORGANIZATION>Marciano</ORGANIZATION>'s command. 
</P>
<P>
After making all 5 of his first-half field-goal attempts, <PERSON>Marciano</PERSON> was good on 
his first 4 in the second and finished with a game-high 28 points. They 
included 2 free throws with 16 seconds left that finished off a tenacious but 
depleted <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> team that entered the game 4-0 in league play. <LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION> 
is 5-1 in league play and in front by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Marciano appeared to be the only player who remained focused in a wildly 
emotional game that saw 50 fouls called, 1 technical and 3 Scorpion starters 
foul out. 
</P>
<P>
"God, we were playing for first, it kind of means a lot," <PERSON>Marciano</PERSON> said of the 
intensity level. "You kind of get ticked off pretty easily." 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else got mad, <PERSON>Marciano</PERSON> kept <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> from getting even. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions, however, were in something of a hole from the start. <PERSON>David 
Harbour</PERSON>, who leads the team in scoring and assists and is second in rebounding, 
missed the game because of an injured left ankle. He probably will not play 
against <ORGANIZATION>Newbury Park</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Add to <LOCATION>Harbour</LOCATION>'s absence point guard <PERSON>Rick Schnell</PERSON>'s bruised knee in the <DATE>third 
quarter</DATE> that forced him to sit out most of the fourth and the foul troubles of 
forwards <PERSON>Frank Dews</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scott Foster</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously <PERSON>David</PERSON> adds a lot for their team from the perimeter," <PERSON>Bradshaw</PERSON> said. 
"That gives them one less bullet to fire with." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo responded with balanced scoring that brought it back from a <DATE>58-50 
fourth-quarter</DATE> deficit to within 62-60 with 2:10 remaining. However, <LOCATION>Simi 
Valley</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Steve Carnes</PERSON> hit 4 consecutive free throws followed by 2 from 
<LOCATION>Marciano</LOCATION>. The Pioneers made 25 of 30 free throws, compared to 17 of 33 for 
<LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We never really executed well," <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>John Harbour</PERSON> said. "We did 
some good things individually, but we never did execute well." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION>, streaky as ever, ended up making 21 of 37 field-goal attempts. 
Camarillo made just 21 of 54.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Eyeing up 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be no such thing as bad publicity but 3i, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s largest venture
capital company, has decided that enough is enough. Battered by reports of
its on-off flotation and bruised by comment about its inability to keep a
chairman, it has decided that its image needs management.
<PERSON>Charles Richardson</PERSON>, 39, who has worked for 3i for 12 years and is currently
regional director for the north and <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, has been appointed 3i's first
director of corporate affairs.
Hard to know whether this is a promotion or a sideways move for <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON>.
But there is rather less ambiguity about the role of <LOCATION>Shandwick</LOCATION>, whose
long-term relationship with 3i has been one of the few fixtures in the
fickle pr world. <PERSON>Dewe Rogerson</PERSON>, brought in to handle 3i's much delayed
flotation, seems to be emerging as the senior media adviser, which must be
all rather humiliating for what used to be the world's biggest pr company.
After all it was 3i which gave <PERSON>Shandwick</PERSON> its first big break in business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual <ORGANIZATION>Trades Union Congress</ORGANIZATION> has long been a dispiriting affair; this
year's in <LOCATION>Brighton</LOCATION> is no exception. The proceedings are passionless and
rigidly stage-managed. The conference has had its moments though, including
one memorably poetic exchange yesterday.
Summing up a debate about labour legislation, <PERSON>Jimmy Airlie</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>AEEU</ORGANIZATION>'s
national officer in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, ended by quoting from the Mask of Anarchy by
<PERSON>Percy Bysshe Shelley</PERSON>:
'Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number -
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you.'
But <PERSON>Arthur Scargill</PERSON>, the miners' leader, arguing for more militant
opposition to the government's employment legislation, politely pointed out
that <ORGANIZATION>Airlie</ORGANIZATION> had missed the final line of the verse: 'Ye are many - they are
few.'
It is no coincidence that the two men know that verse from the revolutionary
old Etonian poet so well. It once adorned the membership card of the <ORGANIZATION>Young
Communist League</ORGANIZATION> - of which both were members.

   An <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent shot and killed an off-duty
firefighter after the firefighter refused to drop an AK-47 assault
rifle while struggling with another agent, authorities said.
   The firefighter and three <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents were among a group
preparing to go scuba diving, police said.
   <PERSON>Steven Lopez</PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION>Staten Island</LOCATION>, was pronounced dead at the
scene of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s shooting, said Officer <PERSON>Hugh Barry</PERSON>, a police
spokesman.
   Agent <PERSON>Richard Tait</PERSON>, who fired the fatal shot, remained on duty,
and the bureau began an investigation, as is routine in such cases,
said <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Joseph Valiquette</PERSON>.
   Tait was to receive scuba training on the dive, <PERSON>Valiquette</PERSON> said.
   As the men prepared to dive, <PERSON>Lopez</PERSON> got into a struggle with
Agent <PERSON>John R. Dew</PERSON>, <PERSON>Valiquette</PERSON> said. Lopez was holding the rifle
during the struggle and it discharged once without hurting anyone,
the spokesman said.
   Tait drew his service revolver and ordered <PERSON>Lopez</PERSON> to drop his
gun, then shot him in the chest, <PERSON>Valiquette</PERSON> said. The spokesman
didn't offer a motive for the confrontation.
   Asked if the shooting was deemed justified, <PERSON>Valiquette</PERSON> said,
``There is nothing that would indicate anything to the contrary at
this point.''

<HEAD>Pepsi, Nintendo Link To Promote What Could Be Holiday Contender</HEAD>

   <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo of America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> will get a hand from
<ORGANIZATION>Pepsi-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> in promoting its portable video ``Game Boy'' that
analysts say could be one of the most popular presents under
Christmas trees this year.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> says the transistor radio-sized, handheld device
has such blockbuster potential that the company won't have enough
of them this <DATE>Christmas</DATE> to meet even half of the projected demand.
   ``We expect to sell out,'' said <PERSON>Bill White</PERSON>, director of
advertising and public relations for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> subsidiary of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Nintendo Co</ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.
   White said <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> forecasts the holiday demand for Game Boy at
<MONEY>2 million</MONEY> to 2.5 million units. <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> will ship just over 1
million units, and another 4 million to 5 million next year, he
said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> they would team up in a
two-month promotion starting <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> during which <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> will award
more than 4,000 Game Boys to consumers.
   For <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>, the campaign could be a bonanza if it encourages many
more consumers to buy <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> beverages for a chance to obtain what
could become a hard-to-find holiday gift.
   ``We hope to be in the forefront of consumers' minds during the
holidays,'' <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi-Cola</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tod MacKenzie</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``We
hope to make the <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> brand name synonymous with the hottest toy
of the holiday season.''
   Toy industry analysts agree that <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> appears to have
another big hit on its hands with Game Boy, which retails for
<MONEY>$89.95</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION>'s entertainment system that turns a television
into a game screen dominates the home-computer-game business.
   <PERSON>Angela Bourdon</PERSON>, spokeswoman for retailer <ORGANIZATION>Toys R Us</ORGANIZATION>, said Game
Boy has been a strong seller since its release in <DATE>August</DATE>.
   ``It's the No. 1 best seller for Christmas,'' she said. ``Hands
down.''
   <PERSON>Kathy Ellis</PERSON>, a retail analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION>, had a similar view. ``The Game Boy is going to have a
tremendous <DATE>Christmas</DATE>,'' she said.
   Added <PERSON>Frank Reysen</PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION>Playthings Magazine</ORGANIZATION>, ``People are
asking if this is the next Cabbage Patch,'' referring to the dolls
that were a toy industry sensation in the mid-1980s.
   <PERSON>Reysen</PERSON> said he doubts Game Boy will achieve megahit status in
the same league as the Cabbage Patch dolls. With such a hefty
pricetag, Game Boy won't be for everyone.
   But <PERSON>Reysen</PERSON> said Game Boy could trigger a turnaround in the
handheld video game category, which has been in the doldrums for
several years. Game Boy uses interchangeable cartridges _ but not
the same ones as used on <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION>'s regular TV-based system.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> promotion with <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> will be supported by
radio and television advertisements plus in-store,
point-of-purchase displays. <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> said it would create special TV
and radio ads for network and local broadcasts.
   Customers will have a chance at winning a Game Boy or certain
other items through an instant-win, under-the-cap giveaway on
specially marked packages of <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> products. The other prizes
include <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> Action Sets, U-Force Remotes for use with the
<ORGANIZATION>Nintendo Entertainment System</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo Game Paks</ORGANIZATION>, <MONEY>$5</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION>
vouchers and free coupons for two-liter <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> products.
   The contest will be featured on 16-oz. non-returnable,
one-liter, two-liter and three-liter packages of <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>, Diet <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>,
both diet and regular Caffeine Free <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Moutain Dew</ORGANIZATION> and
Lemon-Lime Slice.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> is hoping this year's holiday promotion will have results
similar to last year's, when <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> sponsored the home video release
of MCA-Universal's ``E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial'' and offered
special <MONEY>$5</MONEY> rebates.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION>, the <DATE>1988</DATE> promotion generated a record 1.6
million rebates and helped ``E.T.'' become the highest-selling home
video in history.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Receiver called in at Allied Partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>Allied Partnership Group</ORGANIZATION>, the environmental contractor and fork lift truck
distributor, said yesterday that a receiver had been appointed to the group
holding company following an application from <ORGANIZATION>Humberclyde Industrial
Finance</ORGANIZATION>, a leasing company.
Shares in <ORGANIZATION>Allied Partnership</ORGANIZATION> were suspended <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> at 9 3/4 p and on
<DATE>Friday</DATE> the company unsuccessfully tried to set aside <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s appointment
of <ORGANIZATION>Touche Ross</ORGANIZATION> as the receiver.
Humberclyde said that the receiver had been appointed <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> at
12.15pm.
<ORGANIZATION>Dew Group</ORGANIZATION>, which is the main construction company within APG, is currently
trading profitably and continues to have the support of its bankers, <ORGANIZATION>APG</ORGANIZATION>
said.
Humberclyde had taken the step of appointing the receiver to protect its
security interests which it believed were in danger of being undermined by
the granting of additional security to other parties.
