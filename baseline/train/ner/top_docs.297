<HEAD>University Team Discovers `Whale Dinosaur' And Late-Surviving
Brontosaurus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expedition has discovered remains of a
gigantic ``whale dinosaur'' and a brontosaurus that lived more
recently than other known dinosaurs of its type, scientists
announced.
   <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado Paleontologist Robert Bakker</ORGANIZATION> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the two finds in the fertile dinosaur fields of
southern <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> are providing important clues about dinosaur
extinction.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said the remains of a 70-foot-long Haplocanthosaurus, a
member of the cetiosaur or ``whale dinosaur'' family, were found in
the Como Bluffs area near <PERSON>McFadden</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, last <DATE>July</DATE>.
   The team also is excavating a brontosaurus that is the only one
of its kind known to have survived the Cretaceous Period that began
about 135 million years ago. The excavation is under way near <LOCATION>Rock
River</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, in a fossil deposit known as the <ORGANIZATION>Breakfast Bench</ORGANIZATION>. Rock
River is just a few miles north of <ORGANIZATION>Como Bluff</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said that before this discovery, no brontosaurus had ever
been unearthed that was less than about 137 million years old.
   ``This means the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Book of Dinosaurs</ORGANIZATION> will need a slight
footnote, since this particular animal apparently managed to slide
just under the tag into the Cretaceous,'' he said.
   The brontosaurus bones were found last <DATE>May</DATE> by <PERSON>Don Kralis</PERSON>, a high
school science teacher from <LOCATION>Leadville</LOCATION> who has been assisting <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>
with his <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> fieldwork.
   ``Finding this brontosaurus was a big surprise,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
``Our initial reaction was that the animal was stuck in the wrong
time zone.''
   The whale dinosaur or cetiosaur, dubbed the ``<PERSON>Carlin Giant</PERSON>,''
was found by <PERSON>James Filla</PERSON>, an expedition volunteer and physicist at
the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Science and Technology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>. The
find included a shoulder, thigh, tailbone, hand, forearm, shin and
several vertebrae from both the <ORGANIZATION>Carlin Giant</ORGANIZATION> and another small
specimen.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Carlin Giant</ORGANIZATION> is the largest member of cetiosaur family ever
unearthed, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   ``It's not surprising that this particular animal was so big
because it appears to be the last in its line,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. ``As
a rule, the large dinosaurs tended to get larger before they went
extinct, and we seem to have caught the last gasp of the
cetiosaur.''
   Cetiosaurs, large plant-eaters that were common during the late
<ORGANIZATION>Jurassic Period</ORGANIZATION> about 150 million years ago, apparently were the
victim of a worldwide catastrophe that struck about that time, said
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>.
   ``One after another, the giant dinosaur families died out, and
the cetiosaurs were the first to go,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. ``As far as we
know, this was the first major extinction of a large dinosaur
family during the late Jurassic.''
   He said his paleontology team's work at <ORGANIZATION>Como Bluff</ORGANIZATION> has
determined the cetiosaurs were the first dinosaur family to die off
in a one-by-one, ``stepwise'' extinction sequence. It spanned a
period beginning 150 million years ago and ending 66 million years
ago.
   ``Stepwise patterns just don't agree with the popular theory
that a cataclysmic disaster suddenly wiped out the dinosaurs,''
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. ``The fossil record clearly indicates that these mass
extinctions were not the result of one <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> of cosmic
mayhem.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's paleontologists, who know a
dinosaur when they see one, are upset over the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Postal
Service</ORGANIZATION>'s latest block of dinosaur stamps.
   One of the stamps uses an out-of-date name and another actually
shows a flying reptile, complain the scientists who study ancient
forms of life.
   In its own defense the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> produced a letter from a
<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> seven-year-old to whom the identity of the animals was
perfectly clear.
   And as for calling the set ``dinosaur'' stamps, officials say
that term is simply the easiest for people to understand.
   The stamps were selected in an effort to join in the current
interest in dinosaurs among young people, and they are being
featured as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION>'s annual ``Stamp Collecting
Month'' promotion.
   The four 25-cent stamps include a tyrannosaurus, a large fierce
reptile, and a stegosaurus, or plated lizard, with a row of large
plates on its back. Neither of those raised any complaints from the
paleontologists.
   But the other two show a brontosaurus, a large-bodied lizard
with long neck and tiny head, and a pteranodon, a flying reptile,
   That means that one of the stamps, the pteranodon, doesn't
picture a dinosaur at all, complained the paleontologists.
   And the brontosaurus actually is an apatosaurus, they said.
   While promoting the dinosaur stamps in their advertising, postal
officials admit that the pteranodon isn't technically a dinosaur.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION>'s book ``Introduction to Stamp Collecting,''
which is being used in the stamp promotion, refers to the stamps as
the ``prehistoric animals series'' and notes that the group of
stamps portrays ``three dinosaurs and a pteranodon, a winged
creature that ruled the skies while dinosaurs ruled the land.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Paleontological Society</ORGANIZATION> is more upset about the brontosaurus
stamp, however, having gone so far as to issue a statement
detailing the correct name for the animal.
   The brontosaurus never existed, having actually been the result
of a <DATE>19th century</DATE> researcher mixing up the skull of one prehistoric
animal with the body bones of another, the paleontologists say. The
body skeleton had already been named apatosaurus, the scientists
noted.
   In the past 15 years or so museums have corrected the problem,
joined the correct skulls with the skeletons of the animals, and
changed the designation to apatosaurus.
   By scientific convention, the paleontologists state, ``when more
than one name is given to a species only the oldest name is
scientifically valid. As a consequence, use of the name
brontosaurus must be discontinued.''
   In its defense, the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> noted that its booklet on
stamps uses both names, and the agency produced a letter from
7-year-old <PERSON>Brandon Dennis</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Laurel</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, who had read about the
controversy in a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> newspaper.
   ``I like the name brontosaurus because it means thunder lizard,
not deceptive lizard like apatosaurus,'' wrote <PERSON>Brandon</PERSON>.
   After citing a several books using the term brontosaurus, he
concluded that ``it's all right to use brontosaurus because most
kids, including my sister, know that brontosaurus and apatosaurus
are the same creature.''

<HEAD>Dinosaur Remains Stir More Debate Over Cause of Dinosaur
Extinction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of two giant dinosaurs in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> is
reigniting debate over why the huge beasts became extinct.
   <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> paleontologist <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON>, who led the team that
found the dinosaur remains, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the discoveries reinforce
his theory that dinosaurs became extinct gradually.
   A scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution who supports the
theory that dinosaurs met their end suddenly, in a cosmic
collision, says the latest finds prove nothing of the sort.
   The extinction of dinosaurs is ``a big area of controversy right
now in science,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Richard Stucky</PERSON>, paleontologist at the
<ORGANIZATION>Denver Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists offer dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinctions, including a change in the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s motion, famine,
parasites, poisons, climatic changes, meteorites and even
extraterrestrial hunters.
   The debate is on again since <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>'s team of <ORGANIZATION>University of
Colorado</ORGANIZATION> scientists unearthed a 70-foot-long, 25-foot-high
Haplocanthosaurus. A member of the cetiosaur or ``whale dinosaur''
family. The ``Carlin Giant'' found near <PERSON>McFadden</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, was the
largest cetiosaur ever located, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   The second find is the only brontosaurus scientists have placed
in the <LOCATION>Cretaceous Period</LOCATION>, which began 135 million years ago.
   Before that discovery, near <LOCATION>Rock River</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, in a fossil
deposit known as <ORGANIZATION>Breakfast Bench</ORGANIZATION>, no brontosaur had been found that
was less than 137 million years old.
   Bakker announced the discoveries <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. The remains were
found last <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   ``The fossil record clearly indicates that these mass
extinctions were not the result of a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> of cosmic
mayhem,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. ``The last remains of different (dinosaur)
families are strewn through millions of years of rock,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Nicholaus Hotton</PERSON>, a curator of paleobiology at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian
Institution</ORGANIZATION>, disagrees. He still subscribes to a collision theory,
which he said is evidenced by iridium-rich sediments in the
deposits marking the end of the <ORGANIZATION>Cretaceous Period</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Iridium</ORGANIZATION> is a
heavy metal found in platinum ores.
   ``The crustal rocks in the top kilometers of the earth are very
poor in iridium, but meteors and things are very rich in iridium.
So why do you find that in that zone?'' <PERSON>Hotton</PERSON> said.
   ``The argument is that they were brought in from the outside ...
an asteroid, comet, or one hell of a big meteorite that struck the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. And in doing so it disrupted the ecology,'' he said.
   Bakker believes extensive migration and subsequent disease
epidemics may have wiped out dinosaurs. He said <PERSON>Hotton</PERSON> is missing
the ``frog facts.''
   ``If a comet or asteroid hit the earth and killed all the
dinosaurs, how then were the deaths so selective?'' he asked. ``The
fact (is) that the little delicate animals - like frogs - survived
and the large aggressive animals didn't.''
   According to <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>, dinosaurs became extinct because of
worldwide diseases.
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he said.
   The cetiosaur bones eventually will be displayed at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Wyoming</ORGANIZATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>North Carolina State University</ORGANIZATION>, which
assisted the fieldwork. The brontosaurus is still being unearthed.

<TEXT>
   Small land animals _ including the
ferocious 6-ounce ``Mutant Ninja Chipmunk'' _ thrived while an
environmental crisis killed off most giant dinosaurs more than 100
million years ago, a researcher found.
   Dr. <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> paleontologist, said
fossils recently unearthed from a 130-million-year-old deposit in a
rock quarry in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> showed small dinosaurs, mammals, turtles and
other animals flourished in the early Cretaceous period a few
million years after the giant dinosaurs that lived in the <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION>
period became extinct.
   ``The new fossils are the remains of animals that lived in a
crisis interval during the early Cretaceous Period, and this is the
first rock layer that seems to record just what happened and why,''
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   His preliminary findings were published <DATE>April 15</DATE> in the
proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth North American Paleontological Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   With several colleagues, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>, who first identified the fossil
beds in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, unearthed a wide array of ``fossil miniatures''
from the 10- to 12-foot thick deposit known as ``Breakfast Bench''
near the town of Rock River.
   The specimens date to the earliest part of the Cretaceous
period, a transitional period following the demise of long-necked,
giant dinosaurs such as brontosaurus, supersaurus and diplodocus.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said the deposit provides evidence of a classic case of
``<PERSON>David</PERSON> and Goliath'' _ a variety of diminutive creatures
overshadowed the great dinosaurs for a time.
   After the dinosaurs evolved into a new line of giants, again
eclipsing small animals, the same scenario apparently was played
out about 65 million years later at the end of the Cretaceous
period, when another catastrophe of some kind killed off all
dinosaurs.
   New species unearthed at the site include a 20-pound herbivorous
dinosaur, a pair of fierce rodent-like mammals weighing less than a
pound each and a neurologically sophisticated turtle, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
Numerous crocodilian remains also were found, he said.
   The sudden appearance of Zofiabaatar, a 6-ounce furry meat-eater
that <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> nicknamed the ``Mutant Ninja Chipmunk,'' illustrates
small mammals were taking evolutionary advantage of the swampy
environment during the crisis, he said.
   Scientists have long been puzzled by the mass extinctions at the
end of the Jurassic period, and theories focus on such factors as
movements of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes in
climate and meteorites.
   But according to <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>, dinosaurs became extinct because of
worldwide diseases that turned into an ``epidemiological
nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he said.
   Big animals travel and are extremely vulnerable to disease,
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the
animals spread hundreds of diseases throughout all continents _
eventually killing the lot.
   ``If you're a species one of the most dangerous things you can
do is to invade a continent or have a foreign species move in,'' he
said. ``So the stay-at-homes have an automatic immunity to this
tourist trap of exotic disease.''
   The newly identified creatures apparently thrived in the swampy,
fern-choked environment that marked the end of the Jurassic and the
beginning of the Cretaceous periods, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   Since fern-choked swamps also were present at the end of the
Cretaceous and during times of other mass die-offs, they may help
explain why dinosaurs and other large land animals suffered
repeated extinctions.
   ``Scientists studying mass extinction are like criminologists
tracking a serial killer _ the clues that finally catch the killer
usually come from the repeated pattern in the way the crimes were
committed,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.

FOSSILS OF NEW SPECIES ADD TO MYSTERY OF DEMISE OF DINOSAURS

Fossils of at least four new species of animals discovered in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> cast 
doubt on the theory that comets colliding with the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> killed off some 
dinosaurs 130 million years ago and all dinosaurs 65 million years later, a 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> paleontologist said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The new species include a 20-pound herbivorous dinosaur, a bizarre mammal that 
the researchers have nicknamed a "mutant ninja chipmunk" and a "high-tech" 
turtle. They flourished after the large dinosaurs that preceded them were 
exterminated 130 million years ago by an unknown environmental catastrophe, 
said <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers believe that cometary collisions produced highly acidic 
rainfall and cold temperatures that led to the dinosaurs' decline. But 
discoveries at the new site cast doubt on that proposal because other reptiles 
and fish, which should have been affected by the cold and acid, proliferated 
while the dinosaurs died out. 
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism (of extinction) obviously needs to be rethought," said <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>, 
who is considered by many paleontologists to be a maverick in the profession. 
</P>
<P>
It is not widely appreciated that dinosaurs went through two distinct periods 
of dominance. During the late <ORGANIZATION>Jurassic Period</ORGANIZATION>, which extended up to 130 million 
years ago, the largest dinosaurs were well-known varieties such as the 
long-necked brontosaurus, the spike-backed stegosaurus and the fierce, 
carnivorous allosaurus. 
</P>
<P>
These species died off at the end of the <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION>, to be replaced by small 
dinosaurs that evolved into the iguana-like iguanodons, the dome-headed 
dinosaurs and the largest land-based predator ever to exist, Tyrannosaurus rex 
-- all of which were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This dramatic change in the evolutionary cast of characters (between the 
<LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION> and Cretaceous) is one of the most profound crises in dinosaur 
development," <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. "The new fossils are the remains of animals that 
lived in a crisis interval during the early Cretaceous period, and this is the 
first rock layer (containing the fossils) that seems to record just what 
happened and why." 
</P>
<P>
That rock layer, known as the <ORGANIZATION>Breakfast Bench</ORGANIZATION>, lies in <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Albany County</LOCATION>, 
near the town of <LOCATION>Rock River</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> has been studying the site since <DATE>1974</DATE>, but 
the bones obtained there, he said, "are so small that I misidentified them at 
first." It was only when he and his colleagues found an almost complete 
skeleton of a 20-pound dinosaur now called Drinker nisti "that I realized what 
we had been getting and the new species kind of jelled." 
</P>
<P>
The fossil bed indicates that the region was swampy and fern-choked at the end 
of the <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION>. Similar conditions prevailed at the end of the Cretaceous and 
at the end of the Permian period 250 million years ago, when another extinction 
occurred before dinosaurs existed. Swamps have also been associated with other, 
smaller extinctions, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we have a 'serial killer' here that has something to do with 
swamps," he said. "We're not ready for convictions yet, but we certainly have 
enough evidence for an indictment." He speculates that the dinosaurs were 
killed by disease as they moved into new environments in response to climate 
change. 
</P>
<P>
But, noted geologist <PERSON>Walter Alvarez</PERSON> of UC <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, there is "overwhelming 
evidence" that a cometary impact did occur at the end of the Cretaceous period. 
"We may never know precisely what the killing mechanisms were, but it would 
require a breathtaking coincidence to say that a gigantic impact had nothing to 
do with a gigantic extinction," said <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON>, a long-time proponent of the 
impact theory of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Paleobiologist <PERSON>Hans Sues</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of 
Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> called <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>'s claim about a serial killer 
"wild," but noted that <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> "does have a very interesting new dinosaur and 
little animals there." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> has been criticized in the past for making strong claims in the media 
and for not publishing his results in refereed journals. The current findings 
were published recently in the Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth North American 
Paleontological Congress</ORGANIZATION>, a non-refereed journal. The fact that a paper is 
unrefereed means that other scientists have not subjected it to critical 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The fossil strata also show that while large land animals died off, smaller 
aquatic species and reptiles did not. "If a meteorite hit, it would cause a 
sudden chill and acid rain that would kill off turtles and frogs right away," 
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. "But the frogs didn't disappear. Neither did the turtles. In fact, 
the whole aquatic ecosystem bloomed and did fine. That's a very powerful clue 
about what happened." Bakker is not sure, however, what caused the swamps to 
form. 
</P>
<P>
The most common dinosaur to be found at <ORGANIZATION>Breakfast Bench</ORGANIZATION> was the new D. nisti, 
he said. It was equipped with the most complicated leaf-cutting teeth ever to 
evolve among dinosaurs. The animal's large, spreadable hind feet were adapted 
to walking on soggy ground. 
</P>
<P>
Baby D. nisti specimens, with body and leg bones as small as pigeons', are 
among the smallest dinosaurs ever found, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. "You can put a pile of 
their bones on a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Zofiabaatar, a ferocious eight-ounce mammal, has been nicknamed the "mutant 
ninja chipmunk" by <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>. The animal apparently killed lizards and other small 
prey with its mouse-like front teeth, then sliced up the bodies with its long, 
saw-edged rear teeth. 
</P>
<P>
It was a member of a group of mammals known as multituberculates -- primarily 
insect eaters and herbivores that have no relatives living today. "The mutant 
ninja chipmunk apparently made an evolutionary hard right turn" to become a 
carnivore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foxraptor was a furry, even smaller animal with a bulldog snout designed for 
attacking large bugs and small vertebrates. The fourth new species, <PERSON>Uluops</PERSON>, was 
a "high-tech" turtle boasting a skull architecture far more advanced that its 
contemporary cousins. 
</P>
<P>
The largest common animal in the Breakfast Bench strata was the "giant 
crushing-tooth lungfish," a half-ton predator with huge, flat teeth shaped like 
mittens for cracking hard-shelled prey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW SPECIES FOUND 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> paleontologist <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON> has discovered four new species that date 
from 130 million years ago. Two -- the Foxraptor and the Zofiabaatar -- are 
small but ferocious mammals. One -- the Uluops -- is a neurologically 
sophisticated turtle. The fourth -- the Drinker -- is a 20-pound plant-eating 
dinosaur.

<TEXT>
   Scientists from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> said <DATE>today</DATE> that
they unearthed a mass grave of sheep-sized baby dinosaurs who were
apparently buried during a sandstorm 75 million years ago.
   Dr. <PERSON>Philip Currie</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, said the joint team excavated the skulls of five baby
Pinacosaurus in the wastelands of southern Inner <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION>.
   He said they found a sixth baby on the last day of their <DATE>summer</DATE>
expedition, ``and it appears likely there are a number of other
specimens.''
   One adult, which in life was ``about the size of an extremely
heavy bull,'' was also discovered nearby, he said.
   ``We feel that the five babies were congregating together behind
a sand dune in a sandstorm,'' <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> said. Either they were buried
by sand or killed by the collapsing dune, he said.
   <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> said it was first time the plant-eating reptile had been
found to be ``gregarious,'' or living and moving in groups.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Canada-China Dinosaur Project</ORGANIZATION>, working together for the
second straight <DATE>summer</DATE> in the fertile and largely untouched
dinosaur fields of Inner <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s far west,
found the remains of about 50 other dinosaurs and their nests, and
40 other mammals, turtles and lizards.
   The <PERSON>Bayan Manduhau</PERSON> area of southern Inner <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> where the
babies were dug up was first explored by American and Swedish
paleontologists in <DATE>1928</DATE> and <DATE>1931</DATE>. This year's find was in a spot
that was inaccessible at that time because of lack of roads.
   Hou Lianhai of the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology</ORGANIZATION> and Paleoanthropology, said the team in
<LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> had excavated a meat-eating theropod but needed another
year to dig up a brontosaurus-like sauropod.
   Both beasts were discovered in <LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> during the first
expedition last year. The sauropod, about 160 million years old and
estimated to have been 100 feet long, is one of the largest of its
kind to have been found in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hou</PERSON> said.
   At a news conference, <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Hou</ORGANIZATION> also revealed one nearly
intact oblong-shaped egg, about eight inches long, and several
broken egg shells of the Protoceratops, a pig-sized horned dinosaur.
   <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> said the year's finds will help understand the histories
of dinosaurs in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. He said the fossils
discovered in <LOCATION>Inner Mongolia</LOCATION> were the same age as those found in
<LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, another great repository of dinosaurs, and that many of
the same kinds of reptiles were turning up.
   He said it was still not clear whether the dinosaurs migrated
from either the dry, dune-coursed Asian deserts or the wetter lands
of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, or whether they may have developed independently.
   The dinosaur project is to return to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> again next year and
in the future may carry out further research in either <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> or
northern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Noble said there are also plans to stage a world
tour of dinosaur fossils from around <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   The project is coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION>Ex-Terra Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and
supported by the Canadian government.

   A 70-foot dinosaur known as ``Happy'' stood
prominently on display at the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>
for nearly 25 years before researchers discovered it was a new
species.
   Four months before it announced that finding in <DATE>July</DATE>, the museum
said it had discovered a new dinosaur, Nanotyrannus _ based on a
skull that had been in the basement for decades.
   This <DATE>spring</DATE>, a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> researcher found the fossil remains of
a marine reptile called a Masasaur, so well-preserved that the 75
million-year-old animal still had scales on its skin and food in
its stomach. It was in a <ORGANIZATION>Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County</ORGANIZATION> warehouse.
   Paleontologists say the finds aren't surprising. Museum
storerooms have become rich hunting grounds for new species because
a lack of money and staff has delayed the identification of bones
excavated up to 60 years ago.
   ``In general, paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it
can be prepared,'' said <PERSON>Michael E. Williams</PERSON>, who helped identify
``Happy,'' a 140-million-year-old relative of the Brontosaurus.
``There are museums ... which have skeletons still in plaster
jackets going back to the turn of the century.''
   Researchers at the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> museum had determined that
``Happy'' was a Haplocanthosaurus, but didn't realize it
represented a new and larger species _ and named it ``delfsi''
after the researcher who found the bones 30 years ago _ until they
recently had time to study it more closely.
   ``Literally there is so much material to collect and save from
weathering and erosion that we are just decades behind,'' said
<PERSON>Lawrence G. Barnes</PERSON>, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
<ORGANIZATION>Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</ORGANIZATION>. ``I could walk in to
the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> or any museum and find 80 or 90 new species of
whales or dolphins, which is my specialty.''
   Barnes estimated that the museum had 300 to 400 plaster jackets
in storage, encasing everything from dinosaurs to mammoths, and
that <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the museum's collection has not been examined
closely.
   Even at the well-funded <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION>, it took half a
century to study and identify fossils excavated by <DATE>19th century</DATE>
dinosaur researcher <PERSON>O.C. Marsh</PERSON> that form the bulk of the museum's
collection, according to research curator <PERSON>Nicholas Hotton</PERSON>.
   ``When <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> died, we got seven big, big train carloads of
dinosaur bones,'' <PERSON>Hotton</PERSON> said. Researcher <PERSON>C.W. Gilmor</PERSON> worked on
<PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>'s fossils for nearly 50 years, and ``there is a bunch of
stuff <PERSON>Gilmor</PERSON> didn't get to.''
   Fossils stored at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> have almost all been
identified, he said. ``We don't anticipate any surprises, but
that's silly because we can always get surprised.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Field Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> researchers in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> have
spent 10 years working through the collection of unstudied fossils,
some of them in storage for decades, said <PERSON>John Bolt</PERSON>, chairman of
the geology department.
   ``We've made quite a bit of progress at reducing that backlog,''
<PERSON>Bolt</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Mary Dawson</PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, said some of the fossils still stored in plaster
jackets at the museum date to <DATE>1922</DATE>. With only five paleontologists
on the staff, many of those blocks will have to remain in storage.
   Four years ago, a <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION> grant let <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie</ORGANIZATION>
researchers open an old plaster block. They found the only known
complete hind foot of a stegosaurus.
   ``We liken our collection to an iceberg, with one-tenth above
the surface and the rest waiting for study,'' <PERSON>Miss Dawson</PERSON> said.
   Most of the work done at the museum is based on specimens the
researchers collect themselves, so much of the collection in
storage will remain unstudied, she said. ``We know we should stay
home and study the collections we already have, but it's such a
challenge to get out in the field.
   ``We're really putting apples back on the tree when we do this.''

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Claude K. Bell</PERSON>, whose dinosaur creations
became a landmark to millions of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> desert
travelers, has died at 91, but his family vowed that his fanciful
``dinosaur garden'' would live on.
   Bell died <DATE>Monday</DATE> of pneumonia at <ORGANIZATION>Humana Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Anaheim</LOCATION>.
   Bell and his dinosaurs have been featured in People magazine,
the film ``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' and a book titled ``The
Well-Built Elephant and Other Roadside Attractions _ A Tribute to
American Eccentricity.''
   The retired amusement park sculptor spent more than two decades
and <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> creating the giant creatures _ a 150-ton, concrete
brontosaurus named Dinney and a 100-ton tyrannosaurus named Rex _
on an otherwise desolate stretch of Interstate 10 near <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>.
   The towering dinosaurs can be seen for miles by travelers
approaching the tiny community of Cabazon on the desert route
between <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   ``The dinosaurs aren't dead and they never will be,'' <PERSON>Bell</PERSON>'s
daughter, <PERSON>Wendy Murphy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, said. ``He wanted to build a
monument that would withstand the sands of time, and he has done
that.''
   Bell, a retired sculptor for <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION>'s popular <PERSON>Knott</PERSON>'s
<PERSON>Berry</PERSON> Farm amusement park, was in his mid-60s when he first began
building the steel-framed, 150-foot-long brontosaurus on 60 acres
of desert land he owned at Cabazon.
   It was meant to be the first of several figures in his Dinosaur
Garden theme park. Plans to add a giant mastodon and a sabre-tooth
tiger are on the drawing board.
   The park, which includes a museum and gift shop, is run by
<PERSON>Bell</PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON>Denny Rowing</PERSON>.
   Bell is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Anna Marie</PERSON>, a son, five daughters,
14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

   Fossils of some of the dinosaurs that have been
found in the <ORGANIZATION>Morrison Formation</ORGANIZATION> include:
   _Apatosaurus: Popularly known as the brontosaurus, one of the
best-known dinosaurs. The 70-foot-long creature had a heavy body
and legs and a long neck and tail.
   _Diplodocus: Ninety feet long with most of the length from the
long, thin neck and long, whip-like tail. Its name, which means
``double beam,'' describes a special feature of the backbone, a
piece of small bone that pointed forward as well as the normal
piece that pointed back.
   _Stegosaurus: Had a tiny, tubular skull with a brain the size of
a walnut. It had small, flat plates on its neck and bigger
diamond-shaped plates on its back and the first part of its tail.
It grew up to 30 feet long.
   _Allosaurus: The largest carnivore in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> in the late
<LOCATION>Jurassic Period</LOCATION>. It may have fed on other well-known dinosaurs. It
was different from other meat-eating dinosaurs in the shape of its
skull, which had a ridge along the top that ran from between the
eyes to the tip of the snout. It was 35 feet long.
   _Camarasaurus: A heavily built suaropod with a shorter tail and
neck than the apatosaurus or diplodocus. Its head was short with a
blunt snout, and its nostrils were on the top of its head. Those
features have led scientists to believe it could have lived in
water. It generally grew to 60 feet long.

<LEADPARA>  WHAT if the dinosaurs really didn't mysteriously die out but just continued

been around at least 200 years and still has wide currency.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  TV Magazine  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DOES DINOSAUR THEORY FLY?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Public Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The possible link between the dinosaurs of 140 million years ago and
today's birds is explored on PBS <DATE>this week</DATE> in a fascinating edition of the
"Nova" series called "The Case of the Flying Dinosaur." The show, second of
three "Nova" episodes about dinosaurs, plays <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> on Channel 9.; 
  The dinosaur/bird theories <DATE>spring</DATE> from scientific attempts to search out the
origin of birds by studying fossils from the Mesozoic Era.;    Scientists can
see links between existing birds and reptiles -- such as the presence of
scales and births from hard-shelled eggs -- but there are many differences,
too, between cold-blooded reptiles and warm-blooded birds.;    Yet
well-preserved fossils of bird-like reptiles first found in German limestone
quarries in the 18th century inspired some renowned scientists, including
<PERSON>Thomas Huxley</PERSON>, to believe they were evidence of an evolutionary turn taken by
dinosaurs.;    Most of the "flying dinosaur" partisans believe that
prehistoric reptiles that ran or leaped to grab prey gradually acquired the
ability to fly. Others think it's more likely the dinosaur ancestors of birds
were tree-climbing reptiles that developed wings to "sail" after prey.;    The
fossils that were central to the theory were those of creatures known as
archaeopteryx -- small, bird-like reptiles with wings. They promised to be the
"missing link" between dinosaurs and birds.;    Debate over the theory has
divided the scientific world for years, and the "Nova" episode explores both
sides of the controversy.;    "It's an enormously attractive idea," said bird
fossil expert <PERSON>Larry Martin</PERSON> about the dinosaur theory. "If I have a cage with a
parakeet in it, it's certainly a lot more fun to think that it's a small
tyrannosaurus." Martin is among those who believe birds originated
independently and probably existed side by side with dinosaurs. He thinks the
"flying dinosaur" theory is the result of inadequate study of the fossil
records.;    Latest challenge to the theory is the <DATE>1985</DATE> discovery of a new
bird-like fossil creature, tentatively dubbed "protoavis," which predates
archaeopteryx by millions of years, making it a contemporary of the dinosaurs
from which birds are supposed to have evolved. The first scientific papers
describing this creature are due this spring.;    Still, "Nova" stirs the
imagination with some carefully photographed scenes of contemporary birds that
do resemble dinosaurs when seen from the proper angle. Example: ostriches
browsing on a plain, looking like brontosauruses with feathers.;    This
edition of "Nova" replays the scene in "King Kong" where Kong beats up a
pterodactyl trying to make off with <PERSON>Fay Wray</PERSON>. But it warns against any leap to
the conclusion that pterodactyls were related to modern birds. The world of
science is unanimously of the opinion that birds didn't evolve from those
particular bat-winged reptiles. So when <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> starts filming
<PERSON>Michael Crichton</PERSON>'s novel "Jurassic Park," a fanciful story about dinosaurs
being cloned on an island off the coast of <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, he probably should
omit the part about pterodactyls being kept in a giant aviary. (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Scientists Use `Dinobusting' Method to Help Dig Up Huge Dinosaur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A method developed to find buried toxic
waste is helping scientists dig up what may be the longest
fossilized dinosaur ever found, a 120-foot seismosaurus who died in
a river 145 million years ago.
   ``Something big in your neighborhood? Who ya gonna call?
Dinobusters!'' is the slogan inscribed on the T-shirt of <ORGANIZATION>Oak Ridge
National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON>Alan Witten</PERSON>, who developed the
``dinobusting'' technique with about <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Department of Energy</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> excavation is under way at a secret site
northwest of <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Witten</PERSON>'s technique is used to
locate buried bones by making fuzzy pictures of them with sound
waves.
   ``What Alan is going to do is bring paleontology out of the <DATE>19th
century</DATE>'' by making it faster, easier and cheaper to excavate large
fossils, said <PERSON>J. Wilson Bechtel</PERSON>, who supervises the dig with his
wife, <PERSON>Peggy</PERSON>. They direct the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest Paleontology Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>.
   The Tennessee-based <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> discussed the dig and his technique
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> during the <ORGANIZATION>American Geophysical Union</ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting.
   <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Energy Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s toxic materials
agency paid to develop the method so it could be used to find
buried toxic waste for cleanup, check the integrity of potential
toxic or nuclear waste dumps, and perhaps explore for coal seams.
   The method is similar to medical CT scans, which use X-rays and
detectors to make images of internal organs.
   To make images of buried seismosaurus bones, <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said he
sends sound waves through the ground using ``an 8-gauge shotgun on
wheels, pointed down. It fires a soft metal slug that hits the
ground and flattens.''
   The sound waves are detected by a set of 29 microphones in a
nearby hole. The sound travels at different rates through rock and
bone. To make an image of one part of the dinosaur, the gun is
moved around and fired repeatedly, producing a two-dimensional
image of a bone's ``sound shadows.''
   The method is similar to that used to make holographs, <PERSON>Witten</PERSON>
said. The sound gun is a commercial kind used to search for oil by
studying the speed of sound waves bouncing off various underground
rocks, not by making an image, he added.
   Several tail vertebrae from the seismosaurus, a relative of
brontosaurus and diplodocus, were discovered by two hikers in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
The exposed bones were excavated in <DATE>June 1985</DATE> by <PERSON>David Gillette</PERSON>,
then paleontology curator at the <ORGANIZATION>New Mexico Museum of Natural
History</ORGANIZATION> and now <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>'s state paleontologist.
   <ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> announced the find in <DATE>August 1986</DATE>, coining the name
seismosaurus, or ``earth shaker.''
   The seismosaurus lived in a hot, humid river <ORGANIZATION>delta</ORGANIZATION> much like
today's <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, and ``probably laid down on a river sandbar
and was covered by sand rather rapidly'' after damming water
upstream, <ORGANIZATION>Bechtel</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The dinosaur's bones are still in the position where they were
when the animal died.
   Debate continues over whether the seismosaurus or a fossil
dinosaur found near <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, is the biggest ever discovered.
<ORGANIZATION>Gillette</ORGANIZATION> said seismosaurus was at least 120 feet long and probably
longer, and <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young University</ORGANIZATION> scientists have said their
dinosaur was at least 100 feet long and possibly 130 feet.
   Until the dinosaurs are excavated, ``it's all speculation,''
said <PERSON>Witten</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Bechtel</PERSON> said it will take at least one more year to
excavate the seismosaurus. So far, the team has removed the base of
the tail, vertebrae, pelvis and several ribs from beneath 8 feet of
sandstone.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: PREHISTORIC DREAM IN NEW ZEALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACQUES-YVES COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s Breaksea Sound, one of the longest fjords in the world, the 
coasts are steep, covered with forests and dripping with water. Calypso's stern 
dug into the bushy tree branches. It was raining, unrelentingly. Halfway to the 
top of the high mountains above us, patches of fog clung to the slopes. 
Vertiginous waterfalls cascaded down drenched mountain peaks that merged with 
the sky. Water was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It fell in raindrops. It hung in layers of fog. It soaked the forest, oozing 
out of the moss-covered ground, swallowing sap and rot. Then over the surface 
of the sound, it regurgitated a layer of yellowish and murky vegetal freshwater 
goo that floated on top of the deep and crystalline salt water. 
</P>
<P>
I took our small seaplane to land and walked through the deep, vertical forest. 
I maneuvered through the mud, proceeding with caution in a silence broken only 
by the patter of rain, the crackling of rotting branches and the melodic songs 
of bellbirds. 
</P>
<P>
There were evergreen beeches, shrubs with clustered leaves, and ferns 
everywhere -- the dwarf kind, the creeping kind, but also the very tall and 
arborescent kind. Networks of moss covered the ground, the tree trunks and the 
rocks. Everything was spongy. 
</P>
<P>
This welcoming forest, mild and soft to the touch, was defenseless against such 
animals as goats and deer. But scarcely two centuries have passed since humans 
brought goats, sheep, deer, rats and other mammals to <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, that had 
otherwise evolved free of all mammalian life, free of the need of defense. 
</P>
<P>
I removed my gloves and found that, in contrast to the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> forest, here 
nothing prickled, nothing stung, nothing irritated the skin. There were no 
scorpions, no snakes, no tarantulas, no biting ants. And, except for perhaps an 
occasional tiny white orchid, obviously of recent date, even as I searched, all 
around me, I saw no flowers. 
</P>
<P>
I leaned on a forked tree limb and fell under the spell, escaping from the 
present world and traveling back in time, relying on daydreams as fragile as 
the half-rotten branch that supported me. Mystery, like the water, flowed 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I traveled back some 70 million years, when <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> broke away from the 
supercontinent of <LOCATION>Gondwanaland</LOCATION> that eventually divided into the continents of 
our time. I pictured <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> as a ship that broke loose from its parent, 
drifting, lashed by tremendous volcanic storms, constantly reshaped by the whim 
of shifting tectonic plates. The dinosaurs never invaded the region that would 
become this vessel, and so the castaway forests had not developed defenses 
against the formidable plant-eaters that most dinosaurs were. 
</P>
<P>
Then I travel back perhaps 130 million years, just before the appearance of the 
first flowers. This time I set foot on <LOCATION>Gondwanaland</LOCATION> itself to witness the havoc 
the dinosaurs wreaked on plants of all kinds. The vegetation had armed itself 
to no avail with ridiculous prickles to ward off the teeth of the 
brontosauruses and other diplodocuses. When the flowering plants did appear, 
they managed to survive because of their rapid reproduction. And these plants 
not only produced perfumes, but alkaloids and tannins -- odors and bitter 
chemicals capable of discouraging most herbivores. 
</P>
<P>
With that, I then fantasize that flowers could have caused dinosaurs to starve 
and vanish. I picture, with a smile, a giant brontosaurus spitting out a tender 
flower.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> has
decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to
dinosaurs.
   The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an
apatosaurus _ commonly known as a brontosaurus _ looked like.
   But because the museum's 17-foot-tall, 66-foot-long apatosaurus
skeleton was assembled in <DATE>1905</DATE> and contains bones that are 140
million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.
   So the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads. One
is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton, another is a
model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the
apatosaurus' real head, and the third is the head of a close
relative of the extinct beast.
   ``We may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton

   No one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull
attached. The skull created for the <DATE>1905</DATE> model skeleton was based on
that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin, a camarasaurus.
   Since then, paleontologists have changed their minds about the
apatosaurus' likely relatives. A paper published in <DATE>1978</DATE> argued that
the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus, implying the
apatosaurus had a longer, sleeker head than had been believed.

of the ribs fell off and broke,'' <PERSON>Dingus</PERSON> said.

   The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an

skeleton was assembled in <DATE>1905</DATE> and contains bones that are 140
million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.

   COMO BLUFF, WYO. -- According to Robert Bakker, much of
what you think you know about dinosaurs is wrong. And he has
devoted his life to setting it right.
   Dinosaurs, insists the 46-year-old paleontologist and
museum curator at the University of Colorado, weren't
coldblooded, lizard-like behemoths that lumbered across the
land and wallowed in swamps. Contrary to popular belief, many
were warm-blooded creatures with colorful skins, and they ran
like cheetahs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If that isn't radical enough for you, consider <PERSON>Mr.
Bakker</PERSON>'s reason for crawling around on a wind-swept, treeless
bluff here in the high plains of southern <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>: He is
searching for clues to disprove one of science's most
currently popular theories -- that dinosaurs were wiped out
en masse after an asteroid fell, suddenly changing the
earth's climate for the colder.
   <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>'s theory? They were done in because they liked
to travel too much.
   It's just another day at the office for the enfant
terrible of paleontology, whose whole life seems bent on
irking the scientific establishment. Most scientists speak
cautiously, in terms like "the evidence suggests." The brash
<PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> proclaims his theories with an air of certainty.
Other archaeological expeditions are larded with Ph.D.s and
graduate students from prestigious institutions; <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>
mans his with amateurs he refers to as "Mesozoic
bird-watchers." (<PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>, himself, is equipped with all
the usual, impressive credentials, including a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>
doctorate.) While most paleontologists ship their discoveries
to far-off <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> universities for study and storage, <PERSON>Mr.
Bakker</PERSON> helps local towns build museums to house fossils found
close at hand.
   But though some of his peers dismiss his theories -- and
many abhor his style -- few deny that he is roiling the
prehistoric waters. <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>'s theories are discussed in
college classes, in textbooks and encyclopedias as
alternative views of Mesozoic life. "Before <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> came
along, dinosaurs looked like extinct old bones," says <PERSON>Sankar
Chatterjee</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Tech University</ORGANIZATION>. "With <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>, dinosaurs
became vibrant, living beings." Well, in a manner of
speaking.
   How he accomplished that is a sore subject in the science
-- so sore, in fact, that some of his peers won't talk about
him. Others complain that he is a showboat, promoting his
notions in the popular press and on TV, not just before they
have been accepted by the paleontology establishment, but, in
some cases, even before they have been published in a
scientific journal.
   <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> is clearly annoyed by the criticism. "If I seem
aggressive," he says, "it's because sometimes one gets
impatient with orthodoxy."
   But <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> doesn't spend all his time romancing the
media. Mostly, he spends it trying to prove his extinction
theory, which means long hours painstakingly combing the dirt
here on <ORGANIZATION>Como Bluff</ORGANIZATION> for bones.
   On a current dig, the paleontologist is pushing dirt
around a gray mound with his fingers as his long, kinky hair
drags in the dust and his jeans get dirtier. A few hundred
yards away, <PERSON>James Siegwarth</PERSON>, a physicist with the
government's <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Standards and Technology</ORGANIZATION>,
is digging out the vertebra of a huge allosaur, a two-ton
meat-eater of the Jurassic era, after two days of carefully
prodding the dirt with tiny ice picks and paintbrushes. His
work isn't over: It can take up to 200 hours in the lab just
to clean the big bone. "I don't mind," he says. "I guess I
like playing in the dirt."
   In the <DATE>summer of 1990</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Siegwarth</PERSON> and another dinosaur
buff, <PERSON>Jim Filla</PERSON>, spotted some tiny bones sticking out of the
mudstone here. And, though at least one paleontologist they
approached wasn't interested, when they took the bones to <PERSON>Mr.
Bakker</PERSON>, he promptly declared the find a new species of
dinosaur, named it Drinker (after the early paleontologist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Drinker Cope</ORGANIZATION>), and recruited Messrs. <PERSON>Siegwarth</PERSON> and
Filla for a new dig at <ORGANIZATION>Como</ORGANIZATION>, which had been considered a
played-out site. Since then, the "Como Irregulars," as <PERSON>Mr.
Bakker</PERSON> calls them, have unearthed more than half a dozen
heretofore-undiscovered dinosaurs, with, he hopes, more to
come. "I want to find a voracious, small-minded predator and
name it after the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION>," <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> says.
   <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> wishes more amateurs would join the hunt. "We
need 10 times, 100 times more weekenders," he says. "The
reason the world knows so much about birds is because there
are thousands of amateur bird-watchers. The reason we know so
little about dinosaurs is there are too few people looking
for them."
   He blames the shortage on pretentious paleontologists who
insist on calling an eye socket "the fossa orbital" and who
generally look down at enthusiastic amateurs. "My science is
low-tech, and it requires sharp eyes and delicate fingers,"
not a knowledge of Latin, says <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>. "Ph.D.s are a dead
loss," he adds. "They break things."
   With his weekenders, <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> hopes to prove that
dinosaurs didn't die from an asteroid collision. Supporters
of the much-in-vogue asteroid theory argue that a layer of
iridium separating rocks of the Cretaceous and Tertiary
periods was left by an asteroid whose impact created a
nuclear winter-like climatic disaster. That wiped out many
species, including the dinosaurs, says physicist <PERSON>Walter
Alvarez</PERSON>, whose theory this is. His argument: Dinosaurs are
found in rocks laid down before the iridium was deposited,
but not afterward.
   But that doesn't make sense to <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>, who contends
that bones would have been found on top of the iridium if the
dinosaurs died after the asteroid collision. And why did the
small and delicate frogs and toads survive the cold and
drought while bigger beasts didn't? Frogs should have bit the
dust first, he says.
   <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON>'s theory is based on the ebb and flow of early
seas. Paleontologists have documented several dinosaur
extinctions in the Mesozoic Era that coincide with periods of
shrinking seas. When the seas ebbed between the <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION> and
Cretaceous periods, for example, most dinosaurs, including
the brontosaurs, were wiped out. <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> calls that
extinction the "dinosaur midlife crisis."
   <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> points out that each time the seas receded,
land bridges appeared. Over those bridges, the largest and
most mobile dinosaurs wandered into new territory searching
for food. They also found exotic and deadly new diseases, <PERSON>Mr.
Bakker</PERSON> argues. Itinerant dinosaurs carried new diseases to
alien lands, causing epidemics.
   The bones of the Drinker dinosaur in the rocks at <ORGANIZATION>Como
Bluff</ORGANIZATION> helped him form this theory. The Drinker apparently was
one of the few species to survive the <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION>. "The old
money crowd, the brontosaurs, are damn rare here," says <PERSON>Mr.
Bakker</PERSON>, waving his arm over the layer where Drinker bones
have been found. Drinker survived, he believes, because it
was small -- about the size of a turkey -- and thus couldn't
wander far. Neither could frogs and toads.
   In an effort to win skeptical colleagues over to his
notions, <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> plans a blitz of papers, which he
illustrates himself. But no matter how his extinction theory
is received, he plans to continue his quest to alter the
world's vision of the prehistoric world. Dinosaur orthodoxy,
he says, was "<PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> wrong when I was growing up. Now it's only
half wrong."

JURASSIC PARK BY MICHAEL CRICHTON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 413 PP.)

Service.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Michael Crichton</PERSON>, the doctor (<ORGANIZATION>Harvard Medical</ORGANIZATION>) turned novelist ("The Andromeda 
Strain") turned moviemaker ("Coma"), is a worry wart, and like most excessively 
anxious people he feels duty-bound to make the rest of us as edgy as he is. His 
many novels and movies form an extended brief explaining why we, as a nation, 
race and planet, should have a serious case of the willies. 
</P>
<P>
The theme that preoccupies him is nothing less than the hubris of man and the 
heedlessness of science. Our capacity for technological innovation, in his 
view, has outstripped our capacity to deal maturely with the power it affords, 
carrying us inexorably to the yawning abyss of annihilation. Crichton's first 
novel, "The Andromeda Strain," told the story of a 
life-as-we-know-it-destroying bacterium uncorked by money-grubbing scientists; 
likewise, his movie "Westworld" featured a rampaging amusement-park automaton 
(played by <ORGANIZATION>Yul Brynner</ORGANIZATION>) who turns on his feckless human creators and, Yul 
Brynner-like, pumps them full of hot lead. 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether <PERSON>Crichton</PERSON>'s worries about rampaging bacilli and 
deranged automatons are justified -- even now, after all, an irritable Third 
World dictator is hoarding untold stashes of bacteria, and you never can tell 
when the talking <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Disneyland</LOCATION> might go berserk during some 
matinee, lifting skirts and making rude noises with his armpits. But so far the 
<PERSON>Crichton</PERSON> prognostication average has not been good -- zero, in fact. We should 
hope it stays that way. Otherwise, having read <PERSON>Crichton</PERSON>'s fat new novel, 
"Jurassic Park," I have a word of advice for anyone owning real estate within 
10 miles of La Brea tar pits: Sell. 
</P>
<P>
What sets <PERSON>Crichton</PERSON>'s teeth to chattering these days is biotechnology, the 
manipulation of DNA to create new forms of life or -- the premise of "Jurassic 
Park" -- re-create old ones. The novel opens with a documentary-like sketch of 
how this new technology has come to be corrupted by slithery commerce. Once 
scientists were pure, disinterested; now they -- unlike, say, the directors of 
sci-fi movies and the authors of pulp fiction -- have lowered themselves to 
making a buck. "Suddenly," <PERSON>Mr. Crichton</PERSON> writes, "it seemed as if everyone 
wanted to become rich." 
</P>
<P>
"Jurassic Park" is the story of how this ignoble ambition, married to 
biotechnology, results in the beginning of the end of the world as we know it, 
or at least of <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. That hapless Central American country is the site of 
the eponymous park, developed by one <PERSON>John Hammond</PERSON>, a money-grubbing and devious 
American entrepreneur, on an island off the coast. There money-grubbing 
scientists, working in secret, have managed to cull dinosaur DNA from ancient 
amber and re-construct living versions of the beasts, so that they might serve 
as tourist attractions for wonder-struck Americanos. 
</P>
<P>
Things, as you can imagine, quickly go awry. A few months before the park is to 
open, an unspecified number of the smaller dinosaurs escape to the mainland, 
where, on a deserted beach, they maul the vacationing family of a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> 
real-estate developer -- a tragedy all the more horrifying because the 
real-estate developer escapes unharmed. The authorities remain unaware of the 
danger through a series of amazingly convenient botches, giving <PERSON>Hammond</PERSON> the 
chance to summon a handful of experts to set matters in order. 
</P>
<P>
This is a risky plot device for <PERSON>Mr. Crichton</PERSON>, since it requires him to 
introduce characters into his elaborate fictional architecture, and the 
creation of plausible characters is not, to speak generously, his strength. Our 
hero is a paleontologist called Grant; we are signalled his hero status early 
on when <PERSON>Mr. Crichton</PERSON> informs us that <ORGANIZATION>Grant</ORGANIZATION> eschews the stuffy tweeds of the 
common prof in favor of jeans and sneakers -- even when he lectures! He is 
joined on the island by a mathematician named <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON>; a sexy assistant called 
<PERSON>Sattler</PERSON>; a candy-bar-scarfing computer jockey, Nedry by name, who designed the 
island's labyrinthine security systems, and two insufferably precocious 
grandchildren of the evil <PERSON>Hammond</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The mutilations begin in earnest not long after this group arrives at <LOCATION>Jurassic 
Park</LOCATION>. The computer expert (note that a single letter's transposition makes 
Nedry nerdy -- a typical <PERSON>Crichton</PERSON> subtlety) neutralizes the island's electronic 
fences for his own devious purposes, mostly of the money-grubbing kind. His 
comeuppance follows shortly after, for with the fences down the dinosaurs roam 
freely, and before long they've put on the old feed bag and are dining on 
<ORGANIZATION>Nedry</ORGANIZATION>'s innards. Hungry creatures, dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
Nedry's intestines are neither the first nor the last to be spilled and gnawed 
in <LOCATION>Jurassic Park</LOCATION>. In these scenes, <PERSON>Crichton</PERSON>'s prose, usually rough-hewn and 
business-like, takes on an almost sensual vividness. "Nedry stumbled, reaching 
blindly down to touch the ragged edge of his shirt, and then a thick, slippery 
mass that was surprisingly warm, and with horror he suddenly knew . . . his 
guts had fallen out." The vividness increases when you remember that <PERSON>Nedry</PERSON> has 
spent the afternoon eating Mars Bars. 
</P>
<P>
As unattractive as these passages are, they're almost Johnsonian compared with 
the dithering of the mathematician <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON>, who serves as <PERSON>Crichton</PERSON>'s Greek 
chorus. Hubris-of-man and heedlessness-of-science soliloquys flow from him like 
intestines from a computer nerd. Our "Western training" saps our appreciation 
of nature, Crichton-Malcolm announces ponderously, and encourages us to conquer 
nature rather than live harmoniously with it -- a tired if once again 
fashionable idea that has been far more cogently expressed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
My pre-publication copy of "Jurassic Park" bears the ominous phrase "Soon to be 
a major motion picture," raising the suspicion that this fat novel is really a 
screenplay larded up with a few tons of exposition. A movie would have the 
advantage of being without <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON>'s dime-store philosophizing, but it would 
lack too the book's only real virtue: its genuinely interesting discussions of 
dinosaurs, DNA research, paleontology and chaos theory. 
</P>
<P>
Crichton could have performed a service by using this material to write books 
of popular science. Instead, he's written a ponderous novel soon to be a major, 
and undoubtedly trashy, motion picture. Suddenly it seems as if everybody wants 
to become rich.

<TEXT>
   The skull of a prehistoric animal has been identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact, meat-eating dinosaur, scientists announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 

   The skull was misidentified after its discovery in <DATE>1942</DATE> in eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> by an expedition from the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, officials said. 
It was in storage in the museum's basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year. 

   The museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of the ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago. 
Because of its relatively small size, the new dinosaur has been named Nanotyrannus or "pygmy tyrant" by the identifying scientists. 

   <PERSON>Robert T. Bakker</PERSON>, adjunct curator of paleontology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, grew suspicious of the skull's initial identification as a Gorgosaurus, a primitive and very common meat-eater, during a visit to the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> museum last <DATE>spring</DATE>. 
He worked with two other scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was reported this month in a paleontology publication. 

   The Nanotyrannus resembled the giant Tyrannosaurus rex but was only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy, the scientists said. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bakker</PERSON> blamed the 40-year misidentification on a lack of scientists. 

   "There are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs, or crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter you're talking about," he said.

identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact,
meat-eating dinosaur, scientists announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The skull was misidentified after its discovery in <DATE>1942</DATE> in
eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> by an expedition from the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Museum of
Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, officials said. It was in storage in the museum's
basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year.
   The museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of
the Tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs, a ferocious meat-eating
animal that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago.
   Because of its relatively small size, the new dinosaur has been
named Nanotyrannus or ``pygmy tyrant'' by the scientists who
identified it. The <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> skull is believed to be the only such
specimen of the Nanotyrannus, although teeth have been found in
<LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>.
   ``This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said <PERSON>Robert
T. Bakker</PERSON>, adjunct curator of paleontology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Colorado</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> grew suspicious of the skull's initial identification as
a Gorgosaurus, a primitive and very common meat-eater, during a
visit to the <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> museum last <DATE>spring</DATE>. He worked with two other
scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was
disclosed in a paleontology publication this month.
   The Nanotyrannus resembled the giant Tyrannosaurus rex but was
only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy, the
scientists said. <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said the Nanotyrannus probably weighed less
than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail.
   Bakker compared the skull, which is about 22 inches long and 10
inches high, to the size of a brown bear's head.
   He said the Nanotyrannus had the same level of advancement in
anatomical features as the Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets
that faced forward instead of sideways, a wider skull base and a
neck joint that bent downwards.
   The Nanotyrannus head was discovered during a museum field trip
to a farm in <LOCATION>Carter County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. The expedition yielded other
dinosaur skeletons in the museum's collection but no other parts of
the Nanotyrannus.
   ``It's very rare to find just the head, very rare. And I hope
the rest of it is out there,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said after a news conference
to announce the discovery.
   <PERSON>Michael E. Williams</PERSON>, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
museum, said there are no plans to excavate the site again.
   Bakker blamed the 40-year misidentification on a lack of
scientists.
   ``There are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs, or
crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter you're talking
about,'' he said.
   The third scientist involved in the discovery with <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was <PERSON>Philip Currie</PERSON>, assistant direector of the <ORGANIZATION>Tyrrell
Museum of Paleontology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.

   The discovery of the fossilized bones of a giant
meat-eating dinosaur predating the fearsome tyrannosaurus rex
strengthens the theory that dinosaurs evolved rapidly before
becoming extinct, a scientist said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The bones of an Epanterias were found at the top of the <ORGANIZATION>Morrison
Formation</ORGANIZATION> deposit, an ancient saline lakebed near <LOCATION>Fort Collins</LOCATION>, by
a paleontology team from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado Museum</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>.
   The discovery a year and a half ago was only the third of an
Epanterias, according to <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON>, a research associate at the
museum, who announced the find <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Bakker identified the giant member of the allosaur family from a
jawbone and parts of the neck and tail vertebrate.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said the discover strengthens the theory that dinosaurs
entombed in the <ORGANIZATION>Morrison Formation</ORGANIZATION>, which dates to 130 million
years ago, and elsewhere in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> evolved rapidly.
   ``On average, the rule is that big animals tend to get bigger
until they go extinct. The incredible size of Epanterias indicates
there was some sort of an evolutionary arms race going on,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>
said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>.
   The Epanterias, which weighed about four tons and was 50 feet
long, could have eaten about 40 tons of meat annually, and its
ability to expand its enormous jaws _ much like modern-day snakes _
would have allowed Epanterias to gulp huge bites of prey easily.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Morrison Formation</ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, contains
up to six distinct dinosaur fauna from successive time periods,
<PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   The formation is only about 300 feet deep, he said, ``but every
50 feet or so you have a different species. This one was only in
the last 20 feet and the earlier ones also were short-lived. Things
were really moving at that time.''
   The other two discoveries of Epanterias fossils were in <DATE>1877</DATE>
near <LOCATION>Canon City</LOCATION>, 80 miles south of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, and in <DATE>1934</DATE> in the
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> panhandle.
   Epanterias apparently was the last and largest species in the
evolutionary line of allosaurs, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked
on their hind legs, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   Epanterias' great size confused early paleontologists, he said.
The bones of the <ORGANIZATION>Canon City</ORGANIZATION> specimen were so large they were
initially misidentified as brontosaur bones.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> speculated the size increase of many dinosaur species
over time may have been due to sexual selection, predation success
or disease resistance.
   He subscribes to the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded
like modern birds and that dinosaur mass extinctions about 66
million years ago may have been brought on by extensive migrations
and outbreaks of disease.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said he and other researchers will study all three
Epanterias specimens and they hope to assemble a complete model
pieced together from portions of each dinosaur.

<UNK>Fossils 220 Million Years Old, Researcher Says</UNK>

<TEXT>
   About 30 fossilized dinosaur teeth
found near <LOCATION>Tucumcari</LOCATION> are estimated to be 220 million years old,
meaning the creature was one of the first of its kind to inhabit
the earth.
   ``This is of worldwide importance because it is so rare,'' said
<PERSON>Adrian Hunt</PERSON>, a doctoral candidate at the <ORGANIZATION>University of New Mexico</ORGANIZATION>.
   Hunt, who made the discoveries during four years of explorations
for the <ORGANIZATION>New Mexico Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the
shape of the animal's teeth indicate it was one of the first
dinosaurs on earth.
   He named the animal Revueltosaurus callenderi, after the <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION> museum's director, <PERSON>Jon Callender</PERSON>. The first part of the name
referred to a Spanish word for revolution, `revuelta.'
   The discoveries are discussed in a book published this week
titled ``Dawn of the Age of Dinosaurs in the <ORGANIZATION>American Southwest</ORGANIZATION>,''
edited by Hunt and museum paleontologist <PERSON>Spencer Lucas</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> said it was the first new genus of dinosaur discovered in
<LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> since <DATE>1923</DATE> and the first new dinosaur species found in
the state in nearly 30 years. ``We're breaking a lot of new ground
after a long dry spell,'' he said.
   Found with the teeth were fossils of many early ancestors to
mammals, turtles, crocodiles, flying reptiles and birds, several of
which have yet to be identified, <PERSON>Hunt</PERSON> said.
   <LOCATION>Tucumcari</LOCATION> is in eastern <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> about 30 miles from the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
border.
   ``The area is an incredible graveyard of ancient animals,''
<PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> said.
   The authors' conclusions have yet to be reviewed by scientific
peers.
   Their theory is that <PERSON>Revueltosaurus</PERSON> was the ancestor of all the
plant-eating dinosaurs, including stegosaurus. It resembles a
10-foot-long lizard with 3-foot hind legs that permitted it to walk
nearly upright. It had much smaller forelegs.
   The oldest previous <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> fossil, also dating back some
220 million years, was unearthed several years ago in west <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Dinosaur fossils from the same period have been found in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>.

Scientists have found fossil remains of a previously unknown eight-foot lizard 
that may have attacked baby dinosaurs, a researcher reported last week. A 
well-preserved skull and a forelimb of the beast, about 80 million years old, 
were unearthed in <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Gobi Desert</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Michael Novacek</PERSON>, vice president 
and dean of science at the <ORGANIZATION>American Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The creature apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon -- the largest living 
lizard, reaching lengths of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles, 
<PERSON>Novacek</PERSON> said. The present-day animal has been known to attack and consume human 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient lizard, perhaps a juvenile, may have eaten young dinosaurs or 
dinosaur eggs. Its bones were found near a dinosaur nesting site that contained 
eight eggs, <PERSON>Novacek</PERSON> said. The find occurred during an expedition Novacek called 
the first to <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> by Western paleontologists in 65 years.

<TEXT>
   A misidentified dinosaur skull found in the
<ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>'s basement came from a
previously unknown meat-eating reptile that was a pygmy cousin of
Tyrannosaurus rex, scientists say.
   The skull was found on a southeast <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> farm 46 years ago by
a museum expedition, but was misidentified as a gorgosaur, a
relatively primitive, common carnivore, scientists said at a news
conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The new genus has been named Nanotyrannus, or ``pygmy tyrant,''
by the three scientists who discovered it.
   ``This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said <PERSON>Robert
T. Bakker</PERSON>, adjunct curator of paleontology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Colorado</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said he found the skull, believed to be the only
Nanotyrannus specimen, while rummaging around the museum's basement
last <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   ``The best place in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> to find new (kinds) of
dinosaurs ...is to look in basements, he said. ``There are never
enough scientists to study specimens as soon as they come out of
the crate. This came out of the crate in <DATE>1942</DATE>. But no one did a
detailed study.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> some 60 million years ago.
Nanotyrannus resembled the bigger dinosaur, but was only about
one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy. It probably weighed less
than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   The skull, about 22 inches long and 10 inches high, is about the
size of a brown bear's head, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   Nanotyrannus had the same advanced anatomical features as
Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets that faced forward instead
of sideways and a neck joint that bent downwards.
   The expedition that found the skull yielded other dinosaur
skeletons in the musuem's collection, but no other Nanotyrannus
parts.
   ``It's very rare to find a perfect head and no backbone or no
hind leg or tail or ribs,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said. ``It's not impossible that
the body is still out there entombed in very hard sandstone.''
   There are no plans to excavate the site again, said <PERSON>Michael
Williams</PERSON>, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the musuem. The
third scientist involved in the discovery was <PERSON>Philip Currie</PERSON>,
assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION>Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> said the skull had been on display, but not for at
least the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said Tyrannosaurus rex is the most popular dinosaur among
children he gives talks to.
   ``I think Tyrannosaurus rex wil continue to be the favorite
dinosaur, but I bet you the pygmy tyrant becomes the second most
popular,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The first known remains of a giant lizard that
may have dined on baby dinosaurs have been found in <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION>, a
researcher says.
   The 80-million-year-old skull and forelimb were a highlight of
the first expedition to that country by Western paleontologists in
65 years, said <PERSON>Michael Novacek</PERSON>.
   The lizard, which apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon,
was perhaps 8 feet long and may have been a juvenile, <PERSON>Novacek</PERSON> said.
It may have eaten young dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs, he said.
   Its fossil remains were found in the <LOCATION>Gobi Desert</LOCATION>, near a
dinosaur nesting site that contained eight eggs, he said.
   The Komodo dragon is the largest living lizard, reaching a
length of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles. Novacek
said the animal has been known to attack and consume adult humans.
   Novacek is vice president and dean of science at the <ORGANIZATION>American
Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. He and museum colleagues
<PERSON>Malcolm McKenna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Norell</PERSON> recently undertook the month-long
expedition at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION>Mongolian Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
   The American researchers and Mongolian counterparts also found
100-million-year-old remains of shrew-sized mammals, which may shed
light on the spread of the ancestors of modern mammals, he said.
   They also found two unusually well-preserved skeletons of
protoceratops, a beaked dinosaur that grew 4 to 5 feet long, and
one of an armored dinosaur called an ankylosaur, which grew 15 to
20 feet long, <PERSON>Novacek</PERSON> said. The fossils were about 80 million years
old.
   The wealth of discoveries from the relatively brief expedition
gives hope that further work will turn up much more material, he
said. The museum and the Mongolian academy signed an agreement for
three more expeditions over the next three years, he said.
   <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> contains ``a tremendous potential for exploration that
you don't see in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>,'' with areas the size of <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>
that have not been explored, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Kelley Roberts</PERSON>, a 21-year-old <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> resident, spent a recent afternoon working 
on a small papier-mache dinosaur that will slide along the tail of its towering 
mother on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robert Kelsey</PERSON>, 21, spoke about piloting a float down the streets of <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> 
his first time as a driver. "This thing's a pain in the butt to parallel park," 
the <LOCATION>Bellflower</LOCATION> resident joked. 
</P>
<P>
The young men are among scores of volunteers who work each year to bring <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> 
to the world's attention for a fleeting moment, when network television cameras 
focus on the community's float during the Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
This year's entry, called "Fun 'n' Play in Ol' <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>," features dinosaurs that 
roamed millions of years ago near what is now <LOCATION>Wilshire Boulevard</LOCATION> and La Brea 
Avenue in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. The mother brontosaurus will lift and move her head and 
tail, and a baby dinosaur will slide up and down the tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people worldwide at least once a year know <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION> is on the map," 
said longtime volunteer <PERSON>Doris Patterson</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the nonprofit <ORGANIZATION>Downey 
Rose Float Assn.</ORGANIZATION> "It's prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a city tradition. The first float was entered in <DATE>1920</DATE>, long before 
<PERSON>Downey</PERSON> became a city. The next entry didn't come until <DATE>1955</DATE>, the year before 
<PERSON>Downey</PERSON> incorporated. Patterson figures that city founders, in part, resurrected 
the float project to help whip up support for cityhood. There has been a <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION> 
float in the Rose Parade ever since. 
</P>
<P>
City workers used to build the frame of the float, and association volunteers 
handled the decorating, said <PERSON>Cel Kimberly</PERSON>, who has helped build the floats for 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But after the passage of the tax-slashing Proposition 13 in <DATE>1978</DATE>, city 
officials decided they couldn't afford to pay workers to build floats. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Downey Rose Float Assn.</ORGANIZATION> picked up the slack by raising more money and 
recruiting more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> float is now a member of a nearly extinct species. In a parade of 
corporate floats that cost as much as <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION> entry is one of just 
six floats that are built entirely by volunteers, a Rose Parade official said. 
"It's a tradition that the tournament likes to hang on to," said Rose Parade 
spokeswoman <PERSON>Kristin Tranquada</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is the only other city in the Southeast area that will have a float 
in the parade. But the city pays for the float, which is professionally built. 
The city will spend <MONEY>$95,000</MONEY> on the float this year, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> float rambles down <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Colorado Boulevard</LOCATION>, more 
than 200 volunteers will have pitched in, from welding the metal skeleton and 
installing the hydraulic lifts to affixing thousands of roses, mums, 
carnations, orchids and other flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The association chooses a float design through an annual contest. This year, 
there were about 50 entries suggesting characters ranging from bears to alley 
cats, <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said. The chief builder is <PERSON>Roy Long</PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> resident 
and steam fitter at the county's <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>. The rest of 
the volunteers are adults and students from <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> and surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
Long says he has been putting in 15 to 20 hours a week since <DATE>last May</DATE> -- "to 
give something back to the community. It's just a labor of love." Roberts and 
Kelsey say they volunteered because it's just plain fun -- and they might meet 
a pretty girl or two amid the roses. 
</P>
<P>
The materials for the float cost the association about <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>, which was 
raised through numerous community fund-raisers during the past year. The city 
of <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION> provided a <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> grant to the float association. 
</P>
<P>
Association members prefer to raise money for materials and build the float 
themselves, rather than having the city or a corporate sponsor foot the bill or 
do most of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"Pride is taken away when things are done for you," <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers also have countless memories, some of harried and poignant 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
A welder's torch sparked a fire that devoured the grass mane of a unicorn on 
the <DATE>1984</DATE> entry. The fire broke out on the eve of the parade, after the flower 
markets had closed, <PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON> recalled. Association members scoured planted 
areas along local freeways and gathered the pampas grass they needed to replace 
the mane. 
</P>
<P>
"Some police officers came by and asked what they were doing," <PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON> said. 
"When they found out it was for the float, they said 'Go ahead.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the <DATE>1987</DATE> entry, which featured an animated replica of the space 
shuttle. It was a natural because the shuttle is the most famous product to 
come out of <ORGANIZATION>Downey</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell International</ORGANIZATION>, the shuttle's primary builder, has 
operated a plant in <LOCATION>Downey</LOCATION> for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials settled on the float design in late <DATE>January, 1986</DATE>. A few 
days later, on <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE>, the space shuttle Challenger exploded, killing seven 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Parade officials questioned whether the entry should be dropped, said 
<PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON>, who was the association's president at the time. "It was a strange 
fluke," <PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON> said. "Our intention was not to play it up (the shuttle 
disaster) but to salute the space program." 
</P>
<P>
The float proceeded as planned and won the Founders' Trophy -- "Most beautiful 
entry built and decorated by volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Work on this year's float has moved along smoothly so far, <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said. 
Volunteers planned to begin applying the flowers <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the warehouse. At 
about <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> on New Years Eve, the float will be towed along surface streets to 
<LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. A local motorcycle club will provide escort for the trip, which could 
take as long as five hours, <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
And the association will start preparing for the next float in late <DATE>January</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But the volunteers face an additional challenge in <DATE>1991</DATE> -- finding a new home 
for their float. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the float has been stored in a warehouse at the county's 
<ORGANIZATION>Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center on Downey</ORGANIZATION>'s western border. Association 
officials have been given notice that the warehouse will be demolished next 
<DATE>summer</DATE> to make way for a business park. 
</P>
<P>
So far, association officials have raised about <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> of the <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY> they 
need to build a new hangar on city property. They are determined that the show 
must go on. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a way of life," <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Tyrannosaurus Skeleton Emerging From Montana Badlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JORDAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest carnivore ever to roam the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is emerging from the badlands of eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> _ after
being buried for 65 million years.
   A museum crew's careful digging has uncovered most of an intact
skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex, only the eighth ever found. The
remains exposed so far include the skull, tail, pelvis area, arm
and back.
   The lower arm bones are the first ever found for any T-rex.
   The Tyrannosaurus is perhaps the most fabled of all dinosaurs
because of its size _ nearly 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet
high _ and its meat-eating diet.
   ``If you like ferocity ... ferocious things, the T-rex has got
to be at the top of the list,'' said <PERSON>Jack Horner</PERSON> of the Museum of
the Rockies in <LOCATION>Bozeman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION> ``It has a whole mouth full of steak
knives, which it almost exclusively used to eat meat.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex teeth were up to 6 inches long. The skull
being unearthed is 4 feet long, with eye sockets 4 to 5 inches in
diameter. The socket hole in the pelvis where the leg attached is
10 inches across.
   <PERSON>Horner</PERSON>, head of paleontology at the museum, said the scientific
value of the T-rex skeleton is limited, but it will be a big
drawing card for the museum.
   ``It's a real showy thing,'' he said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``Then we'll show
them things they might not have driven so far to see, but I think
are better.''
   Horner is known internationally for his discoveries of dinosaur
fossils in the <LOCATION>northern Plains</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Rocky Mountain</LOCATION> foothills, as
well as his theories on dinosaur behavior.
   His work has shown that dinosaurs tended to care for their
young, more like birds than modern-day reptiles. Among the museum
displays is a dinosaur nest, with fossilized baby dinosaurs just
emerging from their fossilized eggs.
   <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> said the Tyrannosaurus rex will be studied and a
scientific description written.
   <PERSON>Nicholas Hotton</PERSON>, a curator of paleontology at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>
Institution in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, said any new knowledge about the
giant carnivore would help.
   Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered early this century.
   ``It was described in a paper three pages long and that's all
there is. Nobody has ever described it in detail,'' <PERSON>Hotton</PERSON> said.
   The newly discovered skeleton still has all the vertebrae from
the back and tail fused together. The skull broke off at the neck,
but is only several feet away from the neck and back. Leg bones
have been found near the skull and more are thought to be buried
beneath the other bones.
   It will take a dozen people several more weeks to finish the
painstaking task of exposing the bones, which will then be put in
plaster casts and loaded on trucks to be hauled to the museum.

   Big Al Unearthed

   Greybull, Wyo. -- Big Al died 150 million years ago, but
his future was decided in a few days last fall. Discovered by
Swiss commercial collectors who thought they were working on
private land, he turned out to be the first complete dinosaur
found in Wyoming and, with at least 90% of him there, the
most complete allosaurus ever found. Like its larger, later
cousin Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis walked upright
and had short arms.
   Big Al's discovery caused an upheaval in more than rock.
It unearthed the fact that the U.S. has no laws protecting
paleontological finds from export. If the Swiss had indeed
been on private land, Big Al probably would have been taken
out of the country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He is staying home by chance. A <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION>
spotter on a routine fire-check flight noticed a primitive
road had been improved. <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION> officials checked it out, found
the Swiss, consulted maps and sent out surveyors, who
determined that the dinosaur was on federal land.
   The Swiss ceased excavating while the <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION> moved at what is
surely record speed for any federal agency, calling in a
group of experts to figure out what should happen next: <PERSON>Pat
Lieggi</PERSON>, chief preparator of paleontology at <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>'s Museum
of the <LOCATION>Rockies</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Brent Breithaupt</PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Wyoming's Geological Museum</ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON>Brooks Britt</PERSON>, a
specialist in <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION> carnivorous dinosaurs at <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology</ORGANIZATION>. (The <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION>, the
usual repository for fossils found on public land, was also
called, but it elected not to send a representative.)
   The consensus of those present was that the Museum of the
Rockies and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Wyoming</ORGANIZATION> should collaborate on
research and that <ORGANIZATION>Big Al</ORGANIZATION> should go to the Museum of the
<ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bozeman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, with casts going to the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Wyoming</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Lieggi</PERSON> called the project "a real
morale boost for everyone in paleo research. It's like a
payback to see something like this in the ground and get it
back home and work on it."
   Big Al was found in the <ORGANIZATION>Morrison Formation</ORGANIZATION>, representing
the late Jurassic period. The landscape is one of rounded
badland hills built of layers of color -- red, sand, orange
-- some covered by sage and dotted with juniper, some nothing
but the earth stripped down to color. Beyond the site, the
<ORGANIZATION>Big Horn Mountains</ORGANIZATION> rise up in red cliffs and sharp-peaked
gray triangles of rock split from the mountains, like
chiseled forecasts of mountains. In the distance, long ridges
of buttes extend to the horizon, folded and wrinkled like
monumental waves that crested and were frozen in time. It is
a landscape of immense silence.
   Or was. Within a few days of the discovery by the <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION>, a
line of sightseers waited to drive the one-lane road to the
site. At the site itself, a team from the Museum of the
Rockies, headed by <PERSON>Mr. Lieggi</PERSON> and fellow fossil preparator
<PERSON>Bob Harmon</PERSON>, was at work, along with <PERSON>Mr. Breithaupt</PERSON>. With snow
predicted for the end of the week, it was important to get
<ORGANIZATION>Big Al</ORGANIZATION> out quickly. Part of his skull, a tibia and some
vertebrae were partially exposed when the team arrived. One
of the team's first priorities was to spray the bones with
polyvinyl acetate to protect them from the elementsand from
pack rats (they apparently liked the taste of the temporary
preservative the Swiss had used).
   By the time I arrived, a few bones, already encased in
burlap and plaster, sat to one side. Big Al lay on his left
side, his neck thrown over his back, in the classic death
pose, the right side of his face exposed to light and autumn.
His nose pointed uphill, his large eye socket looked out at
sky. A subadult, he is about 25 feet long. While the
paleontologists know he was rapidly buried, they don't know
why. "One part of the story is why we find the animal as we
do," <PERSON>Mr. Breithaupt</PERSON> explained. "Why is it so well preserved?
What happened after it died? We're gathering the clues."
   As the paleontologists chipped gently away with chisels
and ice picks at the sandstone encasing <ORGANIZATION>Big Al</ORGANIZATION>, carefully
brushing away the dirt and rock, the dinosaur evolved out of
the rock as if it were crawling out of the earth, ready,
after all this time, to get going.
   I walked over to <ORGANIZATION>Howe Quarry</ORGANIZATION>, on private land, where the
Swiss had also been digging. Scoured-out terraces of gray
rock form a broad, deep, dry chasm, a sort of
end-of-the-world scene. The quarry has been prospected for
years, providing many bones for many natural history museums.
As I stood there, wondering at the extent of it, <PERSON>Jack Horner</PERSON>,
a native Montanan and curator of paleontology at the Museum
of the <ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION>, wandered in. We climbed out of the quarry and
sat down on a hill away from it, in clear view of a fair
amount of geologic time.
   "Those gray rocks are 300 million years old," <PERSON>Mr. Horner</PERSON>
said, pointing to the triangles of rock against the <ORGANIZATION>Big
Horns</ORGANIZATION>. "Those hills over there are Triassic, sitting on top
of limestone, and the <LOCATION>Jurassic</LOCATION> is on top of that. That purple
over there is Lower Cretaceous and the hills beyond are
Middle Cretaceous." If I could just follow him around for a
while, I thought, I might begin to understand time.
   I asked him why commercial collectors were a problem.
"Some collect good information," he answered, "but there's no
way for a museum to know who's good and who's not. You can
collect a skeleton and get money for it, so there's no reason
to collect information too. We could end up with dinosaurs
all over the world and they're worthless. What we're trying
to do . . . is save some of the good specimens. . . . It's
good for tourism, for the state, but we're also concerned for
the sciences."
   <PERSON>Mr. Breithaupt</PERSON> put it best: "When bones are sold as a
commodity," he said to me later, "the research story is never
told. People seeing a display of such an animal get, in a
sense, a dead animal. By establishing its environment,
scientists make it live."

<TEXT>
   Dinosaurs are a kiddie rage these days. There are
dinosaur toys, books, T-shirts, games, party favors.
   ``The Great Dinosaur Hunt,'' tonight on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``The Infinite
Voyage'' and next week in syndication, is not a kids' show, though
some dinosaur-crazy youngsters might find it interesting.
   This fascinating documentary is taken up not with childish
fantasies, but more adult considerations, such as the history of
dinosaur study and present-day scientific methods that have produced
remarkable new theories about the ex-critters.
   The new theories, rather than drying out the subject, give new
life to the dinosaurs of childhood imagination. According to various
scientists, the vast array of dinosaur species were active hunters,
aggressive fighters, nurturing mothers, sociable herd members,
scavengers and sophisticated communicators.
   ``Nature's special effects,'' they are called, by museum curator
<PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> Ph.D. scientist and author of ``The
Dinosaur Heresies,'' whose waist-length hair and a beard symbolize
his maverick ideas. <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> believes that, contrary to long-held
popular and scientific belief, dinosaurs were not stupid,
cold-blooded reptiles, but a unique, warm-blooded, active animal.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> supported his theory by studying dinosaur tracks
discovered in a riverbed near <PERSON>Glen Rose</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. By comparing the
estimated height of the animal's leg with the distance between the
tracks, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> concluded that it traveled at a brisk 8 mph or so,
faster than a pack of wolves, not at the sluggish speed of a
cold-blooded reptile lazily foraging for food.
   ``Their world was not one of the cold-blooded shuffle, but of the
hot-blooded cruise,'' he says.
   <PERSON>Phillip Currie</PERSON> studied mysterious ``bone beds'' in <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, and developed the theory that they were the remains of
members of a dinosaur herd who died trying to ford a river en masse,
as herding animals still sometimes do today. Later, another species
of dinosaur fed on the remains _ <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> found bite marks on the
bones _ and added more fossils to the bone beds.
   Paleontologist <PERSON>Jack Horner</PERSON>'s study of dinosaur eggs revealed that
some species emerged fully developed and ready to run off in search
of food, while others needed lengthy nurturing in the nest. They
later became predator and prey.
   <PERSON>David Weishampel</PERSON> studied the unexplained hollow crest that topped
the heads of some dinosaur species and concluded that it provided an
amplification tunnel between vocal box and snout. By reconstructing
the crest with plastic tubing, he produces a low-frequency bellow
that the animals probably used more than 70 million years ago to
communicate with each other. A low-frequency noise, not unlike the
bellow of an elephant, would have carried a long distance, but been
difficult for a predator, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, to locate.
   Bakker believes that rather than dying out completely, dinosaurs
were the predecessors of today's 8,400 species of birds. By studying
a species of dinosaur closely related to ``T. Rex,'' as he
affectionately calls the mega-lizard, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> concluded that the
structural similarities between dinosaurs and modern birds made them
obvious relatives.
   ``So when you look at your canary, you're seeing a bit of T.
Rex,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> says.
   The demise of the dinosaurs remains a mystery. They could have
died of a widespread virus, or they might have been the victims of a
sudden cataclysm, such as a collision between <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and a giant
meteor.
   Evolutionary biologist <PERSON>Stephen Jay Gould</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION>
says the dinosaurs ruled the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for 140 million years while
mammals were small creatures that occupied the nooks and crannies of
their world. So there's no reason that they might not have continued
their reign another 60 million years, leaving mammals to be inferior
and dominated.
   Lest we look back with pity on the poor, long-dead dinosaur,
<PERSON>Gould</PERSON> cheerfully points out, ``All species eventually become
extinct.''

<LEADPARA>  A Cretaceous Period insect, fossilized in amber, surrenders to scientists a

in eggs of modern amphibians. After weeks of incubation, out pops a tiny,
resuscitated dinosaur.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SCIENTISTS HOPE ANCIENT DNA WILL PROVIDE
WINDOW TO PAST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It sounds like a <PERSON>Stephen Spielberg</PERSON> movie -- and it will be -- but some
scientists believe the concept of regenerating long-dead animals from bits of
DNA is not so far-fetched.;    A major reason for their optimism is the recent
development of a laboratory technique called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), which was invented by <LOCATION>Emeryville</LOCATION> scientists.;    A method for
amplifying minute quantities of genetic material, even if old and fragmentary,
it has prompted a run by scientists on museum collections of extinct animals
and plants, as well as on ancient human remains, in the hope of extracting any
DNA, the basic genetic material, that has survived the centuries.;    One of
these scientists is <PERSON>Dr. George O. Poinar Jr.</PERSON>, a paleontologist at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. Based on his research, <PERSON>Poinar</PERSON> suggested
the dinosaur-resurrection scenario that became the basis of the best-selling
science-fiction novel "Jurassic Park," by <PERSON>Michael Crichton</PERSON> (<DATE>1990</DATE>, Knopf).;   
'Idea is quite plausible';  "I think the idea is quite plausible," <PERSON>Poinar</PERSON>
said, "and I feel the possibility for doing something like this will exist in
the future.";    Paleontologists and anthropologists have begun using the
technique as a window into the past, through which evolutionary paths,
migration patterns, kinship and other relationships can be brought to light.; 
  Some early fruits of this research will be reported at "Ancient DNA," the
first such international meeting, at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Nottingham</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
next month.;    How much of the distant past will prove visible through the
<ORGANIZATION>PCR</ORGANIZATION> window is still a matter of conjecture.;    No one can yet answer the most
basic questions, including how long DNA -- deoxyribonucleic acid -- can
survive, how much can be inferred from degraded sections of the huge DNA
molecules or how trustworthy the extraction processes may be.;    Scientists
wild about method;    Still, that has not stopped scientists at more than a
score of research institutions from enjoying themselves enormously in applying
the method to the DNA of objects as diverse as ancient Andean corn,
prehistoric <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Indian brains, flightless <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> birds, leaves
preserved in shale for 17 million years and living bacteria from the gut of a
12,000-year-old mastodon found in <LOCATION>Ohio.</LOCATION>;    PCR analysis was invented and
patented in <DATE>1985</DATE> by scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>Cetus Corp</ORGANIZATION>. The instrument that
amplifies trace quantities of DNA is about the size of a shoe box.;    By
cyclically changing the temperature of the contents and by supplying various
building-block chemicals, the device splits apart paired strands of
corkscrew-shape DNA molecules and uses each strand as a template to create a
new DNA segment.;    With each repetition of the procedure, the number of
identical DNA segments is doubled, and trillions of copies can be manufactured
rapidly. The result is that fragments of DNA formerly too small to analyze can
be amplified easily for study.;    A feature of the system is that scientists
can select any section of interest from a DNA molecule -- typically, a single
set of genes -- and amplify only that part.;    Other uses of the method;   
PCR, a vital technique for those involved in pure research, has already found
practical use in identifying criminals, diagnosing genetic diseases and
detecting predispositions to certain types of cancer. But it has created an
especially powerful tool for paleontologists and anthropologists.;    The
excitement about the resuscitation potential of PCR is not universal.;    <PERSON>Dr.
Svante Paabo</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Munich</ORGANIZATION>, a molecular geneticist formerly of
the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, worked with <PERSON>Dr. Allan Wilson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dr.
Russell G. Higuchi</PERSON> in <DATE>1984</DATE> on a landmark study of the DNA of the quagga, an
extinct South African animal related to the horse.;    From an analysis of DNA
extracted from a 140-year-old quagga skin preserved in a German museum, the
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> group determined that the quagga was a distant relative of the horse.
Paabo believes it would be impossible to re-create the quagga from its DNA,
much less recreate a dinosaur.;    But <PERSON>Poinar</PERSON> remains optimistic. In <DATE>1982</DATE>,
<PERSON>Poinar</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Dr. Roberta Hess</PERSON>, also of UC-Berkeley, obtained and
examined a 40 million-year-old chunk of amber -- fossilized resin -- in which
a female fungus gnat was embedded.;    Gnat was well-preserved;  The tissues
and cells of the gnat were so well-preserved that the scientists concluded
that DNA might have survived in insects of similar age.;    <PERSON>Poinar</PERSON> did not
look for DNA in the fungus gnat, because the search would have required
destroying a very rare and valuable specimen.;    But, he said, biting insects
undoubtedly consumed blood and accompanying DNA from contemporary animals,
including dinosaurs, and some of this blood and DNA could survive, trapped in
amber.;    "Obviously, we couldn't reconstruct an extinct animal today, even
if we had all its DNA," he said in an interview. "However, my belief is that
there are dinosaur cells inside biting flies trapped in amber of (the)
Cretaceous age and older. It's just a matter of finding the dinosaur DNA and
getting it out."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Scientist Reveals First Depiction of ``Oldest'' Dinosaur</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oldest dinosaur may have been shorter than
former basketball star <PERSON>Wilt Chamberlain</PERSON> and lighter than football
star <PERSON>William</PERSON> ``Refrigerator'' <PERSON>Perry</PERSON>.
   It was puny for a dinosaur. It scampered along on the toes of
its rear feet but had ``large claws on its forelimbs, used to grasp
prey,'' said <ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago</ORGANIZATION> paleontologist <PERSON>Paul Sereno</PERSON>.
   More importantly, <PERSON>Sereno</PERSON> and other scientists said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they
believe the first drawing of the ancient Herrerasaurus may reveal
important clues into the evolution of dinosaurs.
   ``Before, only a few bones of Herrerasaurus were known,'' said
<PERSON>Sereno</PERSON>. ``Now, we have everything.
   ``Basically we have the first relatively complete idea of what
the primitive form of the dinosaur looks like. This will help us in
trying to figure out the pathways of evolution that proceeded over
the course of many millions of years after that.''
   Scientists welcomed <PERSON>Sereno</PERSON>'s work, presented <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, at meetings of the <ORGANIZATION>Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I think it's extremely important to know what the thing looks
like in detail,'' said <PERSON>Nicholas Hotton</PERSON>, curator of fossils,
amphibians and reptiles at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History</ORGANIZATION>. ``If you've got that kind of information, you can
tell which way evolution is going.''
   <PERSON>Sereno</PERSON> said the artist's reconstruction of the dinosaur _ named
after an Argentine goat herder _ was based largely on the recent
discovery of a skull and two nearly complete skeletons in <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>.
   Working with South American colleagues <PERSON>Alfredo Monetta</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jose
Bonaparte</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sereno</PERSON> discovered the fossils in the foothills of the
<LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>.
   ``There is definitely a certain amount of good fortune in these
things,'' said <PERSON>Sereno</PERSON>, who last month won a <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Packard
Foundation Award</ORGANIZATION> that will allow him to continue work on the
Herrerasaurus and other research projects, including a study of
ancient birds.
   The Herrerasaurus, which scampered the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> some 230 million
years ago, was <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s first true dinosaur. ``Basically, you go
back further and you get dinosaur-type things but not a dinosaur,''
he said.
   Herrerasaurus weighed a mere 300 pounds and stood between 6 feet

   Sculptor <PERSON>Jim Gary</PERSON> looks at the rusting oil pan
from a junked automobile and he sees the gaping jaw of a dinosaur.
   Under his welding torch, the metallic bones and joints of
extinct automotive behemoths from <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> are reincarnated as
<PERSON>Gary</PERSON>'s artistic vision of the prehistoric giants that crawled from
the ooze to roam our planet millions of years ago.
   Gary, a self-taught sculptor from <LOCATION>Farmingdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, has built
more than 200 of his ``20th century dinosaurs'' from the brake
shoes, universal joints, leaf springs, drive shafts, hoods, front
ends and other parts of scrapped cars and trucks.
   Some of his larger creatures, he says, required more than 500
parts from as many as a dozen automobiles and took a year to
complete. He prefers the parts from older cars, dating back to
<DATE>1960</DATE>, because they have more character.
   One of his biggest dinosaurs, the 57-foot-long Diplodocus,
contains more than <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> worth of junk parts.
   The plates along the arched back of the evil-looking Stegosaurus
were a challenge. Gary finally took them from the inner walls of a
wrecked garbage compactor.
   Eighteen of <PERSON>Gary</PERSON>'s skeletal dinosaur sculptures in rich yellows,
greens, purples and blues or natural rust, plus four brightly
colored dragon flies, are making their <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> debut <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at
the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>.
   The works will be on display through <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> as part of a new
museum show titled ``Dinamation's Dinosaurs Alive and in Color,''
which features a collection of computer-controlled robotic
dinosaurs that roar and squeal, rip meat from carcasses, tend their
offspring and crane their necks toward spectators.
   The main show, now touring the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, was created by
<ORGANIZATION>Dinamation International Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and will be on view at
the museum through <DATE>Sept. 3</DATE> for an admission fee of <MONEY>$4</MONEY> for adults
and <MONEY>$2</MONEY> for children. Gary's exhibit will be free.
   His dinosaurs have toured museums in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> since <DATE>1979</DATE>. They have been pictured in school
textbooks, magazines and an encyclopedia, and made an appearance in
the <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> movie, ``Howard the Duck.''
   Gary learned about cars as a kid growing up in <LOCATION>Colts Neck</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>,
where he picked up enough junkyard parts to build and license two
homemade jalopies. Years later, as a sculptor searching for unusual
art supplies, he returned to his old childhood haunts.
   ``When I saw those heaps of junked cars,'' he said, ``it
reminded me of an elephant graveyard. Just as elephants went to the
graveyard to die, those old cars went to the junkyard to die.''
   Gary saw a parallel between old cars and dinosaurs, the
chrome-finned gas guzzlers and the prehistoric plant eaters. Both
died out and were replaced by smaller, more fuel-efficient species.
   ``The car really is an animal. It has its own metabolism and
needs fuel, air and water to exist,'' he said. ``To survive it had
to change, just like the dinosaurs. The evolution of the two is
obvious.''
   Gary envisions the junkyard as a burial ground for the discarded
artifacts of 20th century technology, where future scientists might
study the remains of scrapped cars just as paleontologists examine
fossils for clues about how dinosaurs lived and died.
   ``It's not my intention to suggest that the auto industry is
going the way of the dinosaur,'' <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> said hastily. ``I'm just
doing my work as a sculptor.''

and there is some evidence to suggest they weren't as dumb as they looked --
would pick (c), according to <PERSON>Jacques Gauthier</PERSON>, associate curator of
herpetology at the <ORGANIZATION>California Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Francisco.</LOCATION>;    That
same dinosaur could make the argument that he never really became extinct, he
just evolved.;    "Birds are living theropods," said <PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON>. "They retain
the ancestral characteristics of dinosaurs. . . . Birds are deeply embedded in
that group of theropod dinosaurs in the same way that humans are deeply
embedded in primates.";    The dinosaur or the egg?;  Although more emphatic
than many of his colleagues about the link between birds and certain kinds of
dinosaurs, <PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON>'s comments are symptomatic of a chicken-and-egg
relationship that may help explain a wealth of recently discovered evidence of
dinosaur behavior.;    This evidence suggests that some dinosaurs built nests
of vegetable matter and used them over and over, cared for their young by
protecting them from predators and regurgitating food, had endothermic
(warm-blooded) circulatory systems, and swallowed stones to help digest food.;
   Such discoveries have spurred a revolution in popular thinking about
dinosaurs. Books by paleontologists considered radical -- <PERSON>Jack Horner</PERSON> of
<ORGANIZATION>Montana State University</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION>, to
name a couple -- have dismissed dinosaurs' image as cold-blooded pea-brains or
overgrown iguanas and replaced it with an image of warm-blooded creatures
sophisticated enough to last 150 million years as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s leading
citizens.;    Nothing surprising;  To <PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON>, 42, who holds a doctorate from
the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, none of that should be too
surprising.;    "The evidence has always been there," he said, "but it was
obscured by a bunch of political and sociological reasons. It just stuck in
people's minds that dinosaurs were like lizards, and not birds, and for
decades, that's the way they were studied.";    <PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON> and others point an
accusing finger at the traditional methods of classification of creatures by a
few arbitrarily selected traits -- "if it swims, it's a fish; if it flies,
it's a bird; if it crawls on its belly, it's a reptile.";    "Classifications
don't mean much," said <PERSON>Kevin McGowan</PERSON>, an ornithologist at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. "For example, you're probably closer to a perch than a perch is
to a shark. And once you look at it that way, it's perfectly logical that a
crocodile would have more in common with a bird than it would with a turtle,
and a bird would have more things in common with a certain kind of dinosaur
than a lizard would.";    New possibilities;  Once you break away from
thinking of dinosaurs as nothing more than a collection of big lizards,
<PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON> contends, the door opens for thinking about some of them --
meat-eating theropods like the tyrannosaur, allosaurus and deinonychus, for
example -- as the ancestors of birds.;    Take, for example, the development
of wings.;    As these archosaurs -- or "ruling reptiles" -- evolved,
according to <PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON>'s theory, they developed the ability to control body
heat, in effect becoming warm-blooded.;    They got their forelimbs off the
ground. The limbs developed a muscular structure that allowed the animals to
use their "arms" to reach down and grab prey, then reach up with enough
strength to hold the struggling prey long enough to kill and eat it -- a
down-and-forward, up-and-back motion that is basically the same used by birds
to fly.;    Then came feathers, developed initially by some smaller archosaurs
as a way of keeping warm.;    "They already had the flight stroke down," said
<PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON>, "so the sky was no longer the limit in the development of theropod
dinosaurs.";    <PERSON>Gauthier</PERSON>'s ideas aren't universally accepted. For one thing,
some scientists contend that flight developed from creatures who swooped and
glided from trees, rather than those who took off from the ground up. And
there's no hard evidence to suggest how feathers were developed.;    What most
do agree on is that there is clear fossil evidence of at least a lineal link
between birds and dinosaurs. The most well-known is archaeoptryx, a feathered,
winged creature with a mouthful of sharp teeth that lived 145 million years
ago.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Scientists excavating an ancient lake shore in
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> say a concentration of fossils there dates from a time
when the area was a lush tropical forest and creatures resembling
armored monsters roamed the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hans-Dieter Sues</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> Institution paleobiologist, said
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the rich collection of fossil remains are from a
variety of animals that lived 225 million years ago and some are of
a type never before found.
   ``Many of these are not known because rocks from this particular
chunk of time are not found anywhere else in the world,'' said Sues
in an interview. ``This is the first time that we've got a really
diverse group of land animals from this part of geologic time.''
   Sues said the largest assembled fossil includes the body, but
not the head, of a five-foot-long reptile resembling an
armor-plated crocodile.
   ``This creature had two rows on its back of this very massive
bony plate and huge spines sticking out on the side,'' said Sues.
``It's like something from a Japanese monster movie. It is a
funny-looking creature and an entirely new type of animal.''
   Sues said the Triassic period fossils were found in a formation
of stone called mudrock about 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>.
   The assemblage includes many fossils from a group of animals
called cynodonts, the closest reptile ancestors of the mammal. Sues
said the fossils include parts for a cynodont about the size of a
small dog, and other parts from a mammal-like reptile measuring 5
to 10 inches long.
   Sues said fragments of fossils of this type have been found in
the northern hemisphere, but never in such a large group.
Individual cynodont fossils also have been found in <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   ``This is further evidence for the super continent of <LOCATION>Pangaea</LOCATION>,
when all of the continents were one large giant land mass,'' he
said, because fossils from the same species and the same era can be
found on continents that now are separated.
   It is thought that during the geologic period called <ORGANIZATION>Triassic</ORGANIZATION>,
between 240 to 205 million years ago, all of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s land area
was connected in one large mass called <LOCATION>Pangaea</LOCATION>. The land mass
slowly split apart, as massive plates drifted away from each other
over millions of years, and the continents and islands eventually
arranged themselves in their present positions.
   Sues said that when the cynodonts and other creatures lived in
what is now <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, the area was near the equator and the climate
was tropical and humid, with lush vegetation.
   ``You had these huge fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the
whole area,'' he said. ``You had an incredible variety of animals.
There were plant eaters and a whole variety of meat eaters.''
   Sues said the cynodont fossils found in the assemblage include
five very small jaw bones, apparently from hatchlings, six larger
jaw bones, and the back bone and head from a still-larger animal.
   ``The cynodonts were creatures that were the precursors for true
mammals,'' he said. ``They are not mammals themselves, but were
species that gave rise to mammals.''
   One of the small jaw fossils is attached to a detailed mold of
the brain, and Sues said this may enable scientists to learn more
about how the mammalian brain developed.
   Most of the Triassic period reptiles died out as dinosaurs began
to evolve into the dominant animal, around the time the first
mammal is thought to have evolved.
   ``This find gives further evidence that mammals and dinosaurs
probably evolved at the same time,'' <PERSON>Sues</PERSON> said. ``The dinosaur
became very successful and remained successful for the next 140
million years and mammals were sort of pushed over the side and
only became important and successful after the dinosaurs went
extinct.''
   Dinosaurs became extinct, for reasons still not understood,
about 65 million years ago, and mammals, such as mankind, evolved
into the dominant animal.
   The fossil deposit was found by <PERSON>Paul E. Olsen</PERSON>, a geologist with
the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Olsen</PERSON> was conducting a survey in the area in <DATE>1985</DATE>, Sues said,
and chanced onto a small fossil. Sues identified it as a cynodont
part and the <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic Society</ORGANIZATION> supported further
exploration leading to the discovery of the large fossil deposit.

one smaller brontosaur, and probably two, lie within a few feet of the 70-foot
dinosaur, he said. The brontosaurs are 145 million to 150 million years old,
which is about 50 million years older than any dinosaur found in <LOCATION>Montana.</LOCATION>;   
The find is unique because of the flat, semiarid plain habitat brontosaurs
dealt with during the <ORGANIZATION>Jurassic Age</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> said. There were a few reeds and
cattails, but no deciduous trees or grasses the dinosaurs probably preferred.;

didn't need a 30-foot neck to eat a cattail.";    For now, <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> is leaning

doesn't sit quite right with him, partly because he can't think of any modern
animal that could live on pine needles.;    Meanwhile, in <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>, two

quagga
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE QUAGGA is extinct
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or at least it was, until a team of international scientists began trying to
resurrect this zebra-like creature, native to the arid vastness of <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION>.
Coloured rich brown to blend in with the red dust of the <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION> - a huge,
infertile, sparsely populated area of the <LOCATION>Cape</LOCATION> - the quagga looked like a
zebra with less than half the normal stripes. Karoo farmers saw it as an
unwelcome competitor for grazing, and set out to exterminate it. The last
specimen died more than a hundred years ago in an <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> zoo.
Now scientists believe they can bring back the quagga, named by the original
Hottentot inhabitants of the <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION> for the distinctive sound it made. At a
nature reserve 200 kilometres north-east of <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, they have begun
selectively breeding plains zebras (the striped animals most familiar to
Europeans), hoping to restore the distinctive colouration of the quagga.
If they succeed, there is a chance that other long-dead animals could be
saved from extinction - but only if they are closely related to an extant
species which can be used as a breeding base. The dinosaur and the
brontosaurus will remain in oblivion; but scientists might, for example, be
able to recreate the extinct blue antelope.
In fact, the only hope for resurrecting the quagga is that it is not truly
'extinct'. Genetic research has shown that it was a sub-species of the
plains zebra; scientists believe its colouration may simply be diluted in
the extant population of such zebras, where isolated individuals (darker in
colour and faintly striped) already slightly resemble quaggas.
This resemblance is borne out by genetic evidence: DNA extracted from dried
tissue and blood of stuffed quaggas matches that of the plains Zebra,
proving that the quagga is a sub-species.
'If a species is gone, nothing can be done about it because the entire gene
pool is gone,' says <PERSON>Reinhold Rau</PERSON>, head of taxidermy at the South African
museum in <LOCATION>Cape Town</LOCATION>, and the father of the quagga project. But the gene pool
of the plains zebra is still available for re-breeding the quagga, by a
process similar to selective breeding of livestock.
Baby <PERSON>Reina</PERSON>, one of six foals who form the first generation of the quagga
breeding project, demonstrates how it is done. She was born of parents
specially selected in the wild for their faint striping, and her stripes are
fainter still. But scientists were not so lucky with the other foals: one
has distinctly more prominent stripes than either parent, and the others
show little progress toward quagga colouration. Scientists hope to see firm
results in 10 years - but it could take longer.
Some wildlife experts dispute the validity of the project: 'We can breed a
zebra which will look like a quagga but it will never, ever be a quagga. All
we know about the quagga was what it looked like and where it was found. We
know nothing about its behaviour, its habitat . . . ' says <PERSON>Zane Erasmus</PERSON>,
ranger at the <ORGANIZATION>Vrolijkheid Nature Reserve</ORGANIZATION> where the breeding is being done.
Scientists were not able to get a full genetic fingerprint of the quagga,
because none of the crucial 'nuclear DNA' survived in the stuffed specimens;
so they will never know whether a re-bred quagga is just a man-made
lookalike or a truly genetic recreation.
And after several generations in captivity the quagga may no longer be able
to survive in the wild. But if they can be released into <LOCATION>Karoo</LOCATION> nature
reserves, where there are no major predators, it would be a small step
towards rectifying the damage done by man to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>'s wildlife.

<HEAD>Dinosaur Bones Found In Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fossil bones of a plant-eating dinosaur found in
the Antarctic prove there was a mild climate there 70 million years
ago, a British scientist said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``We discovered jawbones, much of the vertebral column and the
fore limbs, which identify the animal as a bird-hipped dinosaur
similar to hypsilophodon, which has been found in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North
Amerca</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Michael Thomson</PERSON>, a
scientist who led an expedition to the area.
   ``There could not have been much ice or snow in the region in
those days because the dinosaur was a land animal and it wouldn't
have liked frosty nights.''
   He said the dinosaur was about 10 feet long and walked on its
hind legs.
   <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION>, 46, spoke in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, where
he is head of geology at the British Antarctic Survey.
   He said the expedition also found shells, especially ammonites;
fossilized leaves from conifers and broad-leaved trees, as well as
tree trunks and ferns, proving there was a food source for the
dinosaur.
   <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> said the fossils were found during a six-week geological
research cruise this year around the north and east of <LOCATION>James Ross
Island</LOCATION> in British Antarctic Territory, 700 miles from the tip of
<LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>.
   He said the dinosaur bones were picked up and given to him by
<PERSON>Peter Bengtson</PERSON>, a Swedish paleontologist who joined scientists from
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> for the voyage on the
survey ship <PERSON>John Biscoe</PERSON>.
   ``Three years ago, we found some bones of a marine reptile, the
plesiosaur, and as Argentine geologists had found fragments of an
armored dinosaur in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, I knew it was a likely place for
other finds,'' <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The bones were in shallow-water marine rocks and <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> said the
beast probably died on land and floated out to sea before becoming
buried and fossilized.
   ``There were active volcanoes nearby in those times and the area
would have been something like <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> is today,'' he added.
   <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> described the area as several square miles of bare rock
with only mosses and lichens _ ``and not many of those'' _ growing
there now.
   The continents in the <LOCATION>Southern Hemisphere</LOCATION> were once a single land
mass that has been named <LOCATION>Gondwanaland</LOCATION>. About 150 million years ago,
it began to split apart, eventually to form <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   The newly found dinosaur would have been one of the last of its
kind because the animals were starting to die out about that time,
when <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> was still close to <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> was
only starting to break away, <ORGANIZATION>Thomson</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The bones are now under study at the <ORGANIZATION>Natural History Museum</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, where they may eventually be put on display.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> describes his latest blockbuster film <LOCATION>Jurassic Park</LOCATION>, which
opened in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> <TIME>last night</TIME>, as 'not science fiction but science
eventuality'. The Hollywood publicity machine has made sure that most
Americans already know its plot: scientists use genetic engineering to
create a theme park with real dinosaurs which then run amok.
This week - with a sense of timing that the best Hollywood hype merchant
could not have matched - the venerable British research journal Nature
published evidence suggesting that the movie is slightly less far-fetched
than it may sound. A Californian research group including Dr <PERSON>George Poinar</PERSON>,
a scientific adviser to <LOCATION>Jurassic Park</LOCATION>, has extracted the first samples of
genetic material (DNA) from the dinosaur era.
Admittedly, the 120m-year-old DNA came from an extinct weevil rather than a
dinosaur. And the Californian scientists isolated just fragments of two
genes rather than the 100,000 or so complete genes that would provide full
instructions for anyone wanting to recreate the insect.
But they have demonstrated two propositions that would have seemed wildly
speculative less than 10 years ago. First, the DNA molecule is robust enough
to survive for millions of years under the right conditions. Second,
scientists can fish out microscopic quantities of DNA and then make billions
of copies for analysis (using gene-amplifying technology called polymerase
chain reaction).
The link between <LOCATION>Jurassic Park</LOCATION> and the <PERSON>Poinar</PERSON> group's real-life discovery is
amber, fossilised tree resin which has unique sealing and antiseptic
properties. It is a honey-coloured time capsule, transporting trapped
insects virtually intact from prehistoric forest to laboratory bench.
The Californian scientists worked on a tree-feeding weevil preserved in
amber from <LOCATION>Jezzine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Michael Crichton</PERSON>, who wrote the novel, <LOCATION>Jurassic
Park</LOCATION>, imagined extracting DNA from blood in the gut of a mosquito that had
fed on a dinosaur just before it was trapped in the resin.
Unfortunately for the story, the vast majority of insects in amber are
species that live or feed on trees, such as weevils, termites, ants and
bees. Only a handful of specimens of blood-sucking insects are known from
the dinosaur era (older than 65m years) - and scientists will be
fantastically lucky if they contain dinosaur DNA that had not been broken
down by digestive juices.
The greatest possible piece of luck would be to find a recently hatched baby
dinosaur in amber - extremely unlikely but not out of the question. After
all, lizards and frogs have been preserved in 40m-year-old amber from the
<LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.
However, amber is not the only potential source of dinosaur DNA. In
exceptional cases, the molecules may be robust enough to survive inside
dinosaur fossils. Professor <PERSON>Jack Horner</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Montana State University</ORGANIZATION> is
attempting to find genetic material in bones of the ferocious Tyrannosaurus
rex, which have been preserved in extremely dry sandstone beds.
Even if scientists do manage to extract dinosaur DNA from any source, it is
hard to see how this could include the whole genome - the blueprint that
would be the first requirement for resurrecting dinosaurs.
For the foreseeable future, any mad billionaire who really wants to create a
Jurassic Park would do better to forget genes and build on the technique <PERSON>Mr
Spielberg</PERSON> used for his movie: computer-controlled robotic dinosaurs. Over
the next decade or two, artificial intelligence and bio-materials
engineering will advance to the point at which it would be possible to
create a lifelike Tyrannosaurus rex that behaved with terrifying
unpredictability.
For the palaeogeneticist studying ancient DNA, the ultimate objective is not
to recreate any species - insect or dinosaur. The point is first to track
evolution at the molecular level by following genetic changes over millions
of years. The research may also reveal facts about an extinct creature and
its lifestyle that are impossible to discover from conventional fossils.
Knowledge of a few intact genes from dinosaurs could answer many
controversial questions about their evolution and relationship to today's
reptiles, birds and mammals. And discovering a gene for a digestive enzyme,
for example, would be a strong clue about what a particular dinosaur ate.
Although recreating a whole dinosaur is out of the question, anyone who
isolated an individual gene would find it relatively easy to insert this
into today's living creatures, employing methods already used routinely to
transfer genes between species. Human genes, for instance, have been
inserted into sheep, so that the human proteins required for medical
purposes can be extracted from the animals' milk.
If scientists managed to isolate one dinosaur gene and insert it into a
crocodile embryo, the creature would still grow up looking and behaving like
a croc because its development would be controlled by thousands of its own
genes. But it might produce some dinosaur protein.
An enterprising company could make a fortune breeding and promoting the
resulting crocodiles, even if just a millionth of their genetic material
came from a dinosaur. Imagine <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> restaurants serving crocodine steaks
or <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> department stores selling dinocroc shoes and handbags.
Biotechnologists, who are already nervous about the likely impact of
<LOCATION>Jurassic Park</LOCATION> on public attitudes to genetic engineering, dislike such
speculation. But it is a plausible scenario 20 years from now. <PERSON>Mr
Spielberg</PERSON>'s eventuality is unlikely to come to pass for 100 years, if at
all.

<HEAD>Farm Couple Finds Rare Tyrannosaurus Rex Skeleton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JORDAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton discovered by
a pair of amateur fossil hunters is yielding new insights on the
fearsome carnivore because it includes the only complete arm yet
found.
   Paleontologists unearthing the fossilized skeleton in the
badlands of eastern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> say it appears to be the most complete
yet found of the biggest species of predatory dinosaur.
   ``We're pretty excited,'' said <PERSON>Patrick Leiggi</PERSON>, one of those at
the site. ```T rex' may be a household name among dinosaurs, but no
one's ever found a complete one, and that's what we've done.''
   The skeleton was spotted a year ago by <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathy Wankel</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Angela</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, on a fossil-hunting trip. They picked up some bones
they found protruding from the ground and turned them over to
experts at the Museum of the <ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bozeman</LOCATION>.
   ``We decided that what we had didn't mean much to us and might
be important to someone else,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Wankel</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``At the
museum they were very excited. They knew immediately that it was
part of the shoulder blade and arm of a large carnivore.''
   The pieces brought to the museum by the Wankels proved to be the
most complete arm of a T-rex ever discovered, according to <PERSON>Jack
Horner</PERSON>, head of the museum's paleontology effort. It will help
researchers learn how the short but strong arms of the dinosaur
were used.
   The crew from the museum began digging up the fossils last
month. They're keeping the exact location of the find secret to
deter looting; generally, it's in the Hell's <LOCATION>Creek</LOCATION> area north of
<PERSON>Jordan</PERSON>, a rich area for dinosaur hunters.
   Working in a pit 20 feet long and up to 10 feet wide, workers
uncovered 24 connected vertebrae in a serpentine pattern, preserved
in spot where the dinosaur died 65 million years ago.
   T-rex skeletons are rare _ only nine nearly complete skeletons
have ever been discovered and all but two came from <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. Only
three complete skulls have been found.
   Although an adult T-rex could be to 35 feet long, 18 feet high
and weigh as much as an elephant at nearly 6.5 tons, the arms were
no longer than an adult man. Researchers had theorized that the
arms were either used only for mating, or perhaps were slowly
evolving away.
   <PERSON>Matt Smith</PERSON> of the museum's paleontology crew said that studying
the bones found by the Wankels show that the arm was very stout _
and very strong.
   Until now, all the T-rex skeletons found in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> have been
shipped to museums out of state, but this one will stay at the
Museum of the <ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION>.

   The best news for fans of animated movies came
with last week's box-office report which showed big grosses for
``The Land Before Time'' and ``Oliver and Company.''
   Revival of animation, the most tedious and expensive kind of
filmmaking, has been predicted every few years. Until recently,
though, economics made animation features risky. But in their first
weekend ``The Land Before Time'' topped all releases with <MONEY>$7.5
million</MONEY> in 1,395 theaters (<MONEY>$5,395</MONEY> average), and ``Oliver and
Company'' in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no. 4 with <MONEY>$4
million</MONEY> (<MONEY>$4,226</MONEY> average).
   Those are big numbers, and they're likely to grow through the
holiday season. That's encouraging for the animation trade, which
has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but
the nature of the audience.
   ``A large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission
price,'' said <PERSON>Don Bluth</PERSON>, who produced ``The Land before Time.''
   ``If we make a boffo with a picture, it's because we sold more
tickets.'' <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON>, who formerly worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Disney Co.</ORGANIZATION>, cautiously
predicts a renaissance of animation.
   Walt <ORGANIZATION>Disney Pictures</ORGANIZATION>, which produced ``Oliver and Company,'' has
pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional
facility at the Disney-MGM studio tour in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Roy E. Disney</PERSON>,
nephew of <ORGANIZATION>Walt</ORGANIZATION>, is largely responsible for the revival. Four years
ago when <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> helped create a new management at <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>, the outlook
was dismal.
   ``Animation was dying around here,'' he said in an interview at
his studio office. ``There had been 10 years of a kind of lack of
faith in it, and a lack of direction to it. There were an awful lot
of discouraged artists working here.
   ``We were finishing up `The Black Cauldron,' which had been an
enormous seven-year effort, with the kind of strange idea of doing
an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of
what the story was. There were a lot of people who thought we just
weren't going forward with the animation department. There was even
talk of getting out of the movie business entirely.''
   Disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads,
who were trained in live-action films, to the uniqueness of the
animation process.
   ``First of all, it's a matter of time; `<PERSON>Oliver</PERSON>,' for eample, took
four years to complete,'' he said. His campaign was aided by having
``The Great Mouse Detective'' in good story form. When the movie
proved a hit, all doubts were erased.
   ``Oliver and Company'' resulted from a ``Gong Show'' session in
which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas.
Most were shot down, but an updated ``Oliver Twist'' survived.
Members of <LOCATION>Fagin</LOCATION>'s gang became dogs, as was the newcomer, <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON>.
But during story development <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON> became a kitten.
   The young animators worked at a fast clip, inspired by the
casting of the voices, including <PERSON>Bette Midler</PERSON>, <PERSON>Billy Joel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dom
DeLuise</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Loggia</PERSON>. Many of the new artists have come from
the Disney-endowed <ORGANIZATION>California Institute</ORGANIZATION> of the Arts, but <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>
observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art.
   The studio won't reveal the cost of ``Oliver and Company,'' but
<PERSON>Disney</PERSON> said it was in the middle range for an animated feature
(estimate: <MONEY>$18 million</MONEY>). Computers will increasingly relieve some of
the tedium of inking and painting, he said, helping to bring down
expenses.
   ``But the animation of a character, hand-drawn in pencil I think
will never change,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON>, who produced ``The Land Before Time'' for <MONEY>$12 million</MONEY>,
found a way to reduce animation expense: He moved his entire studio
to <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> because of the labor cost of animation. The Irish
government offered a 10-year commitment for tax breaks, grants for
Irish artists who would be trained and access to bank loans, he said.
   ``It was like <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> leading the children of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> out of
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON>. ``The artists had to pull up all their stakes;
many of them sold their homes.
   ``Many of them have bought homes there, they all have Irish
accents, some have joined the Catholic church. It's a conversion to
another way of life. I don't think many plan to stay there forever.
But they have embraced the Irish society.''
   <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> led an earlier exodus of Disney animators during the
studio's low period and produced ``The Secret of <ORGANIZATION>NIMH</ORGANIZATION>,'' a failure.
Then he combined with <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> on ``An American Tail,'' a
rousing success. ``The Land Before Time'' also resulted from a
<PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> idea.
   ```I can't understand why no one has made a film about
dinosaurs,''' <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> recalled <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> telling him. ```It's a
natural. There is a great interest in dinosaurs. <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> and
myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times, but we didn't
want to do it with puppets; we tried that and it didn't work.'''
   With <PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lucas</PERSON> as executive producers, <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> could
hardly miss. He admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs, but he said
<PERSON>Spielberg</PERSON> told him: ```You can learn.'''
   <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating
dinosaurs: ``For instance, the brontosaurus with the long neck. It
has a little head, like a ball on a stick. It doesn't have the
shoulders and the hands to give you gestures. It all has to be done
with facial expressions.''
   But how to make the beasts move? <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> and company reasoned that
the prehistoric creatures were reptiles, and birds evolved from
reptilian forms. So the artists copied moves from films of chickens
and turkeys.
   After the opening of ``The Land Before Time,'' <PERSON>Bluth</PERSON> returned to
the <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> studio where production is under way on the next feature,
``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' which takes place in the hereafter.

<HEAD>Remains Of 60-Foot Sea Lizard Located In Lowndes County</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAGGS, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists plan to reassemble a 60-foot-long
``lord of the sea'' that is believed to be about 20 feet longer
than the discovered remains of other sea lizards.
   <PERSON>Robert T. Bakker</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado Museum Curator</ORGANIZATION>, said
fossilized mosasaurs have been found in other parts of the world.
But he said ``the largest we know of were in the 40-foot-long
range.''
   ``It was the lord of the sea and there is nothing like it
today,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said of the creature.
   He said the <LOCATION>Lowndes County</LOCATION> site, more than 100 miles from the
<LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>, was about 100 feet under water when mosasaurs ruled
the depths.
   ``Mosasaurs became extinct along with dinosaurs at the end of
the Mesozoic era,'' about 70 million years before the appearance of
humans, said <PERSON>Doug Jones</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Alabama
Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> visited <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the site of the dig, which
started about one month ago.
   The scientists said the lizard had a six-foot-long head and a
two-hinged jaw capable of swallowing a cow.
   ``If a tyrannosaurus rex ever ventured into the water around
where one of those was, it would have more than had its hands
full,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said as he scraped clay from part of the jawbone.
   ``It could swallow a <ORGANIZATION>Hereford</ORGANIZATION> steer whole and probably could go
through a herd one at a time _ it was that large,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   The discovery was made by <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Oldshue</PERSON>, the assistant
vice president for student affairs at <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>. University officials
said they hope to take the fossilized remains to <LOCATION>Tuscaloosa</LOCATION> to be
reassembled.
   Oyster shells and other evidence of sea life was found by the
paleontologists <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, including some that had become fossilized
on parts of the uncovered mosasaur.
   Jones said it would be ``many weeks'' before the dig is complete.
   ``We want to make sure we can preserve what we have here,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Rare Dinosaur's Bones Found in Northern Colorado</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fossil remains of a rare, meat-eating
dinosaur that predated the more famous Tyrannosaurus Rex but
rivaled it in size and ferocity have been discovered in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, a
scientist said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The dinosaur, named Epanterias amplexus, weighed about four tons
and measured about 50 feet long, and had a long, powerful tail that
probably allowed it to bounce along like a kangaroo, said
<ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> paleontologist <PERSON>Robert Bakker</PERSON>.
   The Epanterias could eat about 40 tons of meat a year and its
``claws seem to be the longest and the strongest of any meat-eating
dinosaur that ever lived,'' he said.
   ``Because of its jaw structure, Epanterias could have swallowed
a 1,400-pound <ORGANIZATION>Hereford</ORGANIZATION> cow with no trouble,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   The first bones of the latest Epanterias site were found west of
<LOCATION>Fort Collins</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> by a team headed by <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON>.
   Epanterias walked on its hind legs like <PERSON>Tyrannosaurus Rex</PERSON>, but
was built lower, or ``slinkier'' to the ground, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said, adding
that <PERSON>T. Rex</PERSON> came along some 66 million years after Epanterias.
   So far the dig has recovered a jawbone, neck and tail vertebrae
and chest bones, he said.
   ``There's more still in the ground but it's the hardest dig I've
ever made, like digging porcelain imbedded in concrete,'' he said.
   The site is mountainous and a transitional zone between sage and
pine. When Epantarias roamed the region 135 million years ago at
the end of the Jurassic period, it was a vast flat floodplain
stretching east and west from <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> and north and
south from <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Candad</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.
   The only other two known Epantarias sites were discovered in
<DATE>1877</DATE> near <LOCATION>Canon City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, and in <DATE>1934</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> panhandle.
   Bakker hopes that by assembling bones from all three sites, a
nearly complete composite Epanterias can be assembled.
   ``Since these discoveries only seem to come along about every 50
years, we still have a lot to learn about Epanterias. Even though
this animal was as long as Tyrannosaurus Rex and heavier than the
average circus elephant, it's rarely mentioned in standard dinosaur
textbooks,'' <PERSON>Bakker</PERSON> said.

By Terry Rather, Times Staff Writer: Tom Demere loves uncovering mysteries from 
the past as a paleontologist for the San Diego Natural History Museum. The 
42-year-old Demere studies animal and plant fossils and has participated with 
fellow museum paleontologists in several excavations throughout the county, 
including a dig that uncovered the remains of a dinosaur in Carlsbad. A few 
months ago, the paleontologists discovered a 3-million-year-old toothed whale 
fossil in Chula Vista. Demere graduated from San Diego State, earned a master's 
degree in geology from the University of Southern California, and is working on 
a doctorate at UCLA. He spoke with Times Staff Writer Terry Rather and was

I guess you could say paleontology was something I came across in my 
undergraduate studies at <ORGANIZATION>SDSU</ORGANIZATION>. While searching for something I was interested 
in doing, I took classes where I studied the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and ecosystems. This led me 
to paleontology, which is a bridge between geology and biology. 
</P>
<P>
I have colleagues who grew up collecting shells and loving dinosaurs. As a kid, 
I spent a lot of time looking at natural settings. I was amazed by the changes 
in seasons and how flood waters can carry off sediment, rocks, houses, and so 
on. In my teens and early 20s, I did a lot of surfing, and that introduced me 
to the ocean and the dynamic nature of beach. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most dramatic setting is out in the desert; to be about 1,500 feet 
above sea level and look at remains that were deposited 7 million years ago of 
ancient sea creatures -- like clams, snails, sea urchins, whales and sharks -- 
and see how really dramatic the changes that have gone on are. I've been a 
paleontologist for 16 years and with the museum for 11 years. Prior to coming 
to the museum, I didn't participate in excavations, but since coming, we have 
done lots of excavations, all local and in <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's vision of a paleontologist is that we're digging up dinosaurs. I've 
participated in plenty of excavations and found only one dinosaur, but it was 
exciting because it was a new kind of dinosaur for this area. About seven years 
ago we excavated a bone bed, which is a geologic layer that has a lot of bone 
in it, about a foot thick, in the <LOCATION>Mission Hills</LOCATION> area. We worked on that for 
about a month and a half, and we found a whole slew of bones of marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
What I enjoy most is the sense of discovery and digging into the past. I think 
every paleontologist has his own "wish list" of organisms he'd like to find. We 
have found bits and pieces of organisms that we'd like to find more of. Finding 
more would enable us to learn more, to unravel the evolution of this animal. 
The top of our wish list is the giant sea cow, which was probably 10 meters 
long. Over the years, we've found parts of this animal. It's always very 
exciting to uncover the remains of an organism no one has seen before and the 
fact that you can read about the past from the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
And the fossils, whether you are looking at ancient communities of herbivores 
or carnivores, bring to life how dynamic life is and how interesting and 
different and similar the processes are. 
</P>
<P>
Competition, life, death, have all been a part of life for hundreds of millions 
of years. The only change has been the players. You're able to look into the 
past and see how it relates to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Through paleontology you are able to time travel. One of the things I've tried 
to do at the museum is bring that sense of amazement to time travel to the 
general public through classes and, until recently, exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement of the kids who come to the museum is great. The youngest I 
remember had been a 3-year-old. He was so nuts on dinosaurs, he would just bowl 
you over on what he knew. He knew all the names and the stories the scientists 
have told about these animals. So to see his amazement at an actual dinosaur 
bone in the museum, when he actually got to hold the evidence of these stories, 
well, that's exciting. It's amazing how bright these kids are and how turned on 
they are to science. 
</P>
<P>
I really enjoy the people I meet and work with. It takes a certain personality 
to like to do tedious things, like crawling around on your hands and knees 
looking for remains of organisms.

<HEAD>Rare Dinosaur Embryo Discovery Supports Parenting Theory,
Scientist Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists said <DATE>today</DATE> they have found embryo
skeletons from two kinds of dinosaurs in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, and that the
bones give further evidence that some dinosaurs may have tended
their young like birds.
   The discovery, some 60 miles southeast of <ORGANIZATION>Glacier National Park</ORGANIZATION>,
is reported in the British journal Nature.
   The animals lived some 75 million to 80 million years ago, <PERSON>John
R. Horner</PERSON>, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in
<LOCATION>Bozeman</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview.
   Nineteen embryonic skeltons were found in a clutch of eggs laid
by a previously unnamed type of dinosaur, which <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> and <PERSON>David
Weishampel</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> propose calling Orodromeus makelai.
   That animal walked on its hind legs and grew perhaps eight feet
long. The embryos would be about eight or nine inches long when
stretched out, <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> said.
   Researchers also found parts of seven embryonic skeletons of the
duck-billed <ORGANIZATION>Maiasaura</ORGANIZATION> peeblesorum, which also walked walked on hind
legs and grew to be 30 feet long, he said. The embryos were about
one foot long, he said.
   Juvenile and adult specimens of each dinosaur were found with
the embryos.
   <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> said embryonic bones of the newly named dinosaur were
very well developed, while those of the duck-billed dinosaur had
not developed on the ends.
   That is consistent with the notion that hatchlings of the newly
named dinosaur could leave the nest soon after hatching, while
those of the other would have been bound to the nest, counting on
parents for care, <PERSON>Horner</PERSON> said.
   ``An animal that is nest-bound doesn't have to walk around''
right after birth, so its bones need not have developed as much by
that time, he said.
   <PERSON>Kevin Padian</PERSON>, associate professor of paleontology and biology at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, said the discovery was
``very important'' because few dinosaur embryos have been found.
   Last month, other researchers announced they had found a
dinosaur egg that may contain an embryo some 150 million years old.
Studies are continuing, but it does appear to contain an embryo,
said paleontologist <PERSON>Wade Miller</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young University</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Provo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>.

The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution by <PERSON>Dougal Dixon</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Salem House</ORGANIZATION>: 
<MONEY>$19.95</MONEY>; 120 pages; illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen much discussion in scholarly and popular circles about 
what happened to the dinosaurs. After ruling the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for 150 million years, 
those spectacular reptiles suddenly became extinct 65 million years ago. 
Current speculation centers on some cataclysmic event, such as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> being 
hit by a comet, to explain their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dougal Dixon</PERSON>, a British paleontologist and science writer, wonders about a 
different question altogether. What if the comet had missed? he muses. What if 
the dinosaurs had not become extinct but had continued to flourish, evolve and 
dominate the planet? What would today's dinosaurs be like? 
</P>
<P>
The result of this speculation is an engaging, thoroughly enjoyable, 
almost-believable book, "The New Dinosaurs," which strictly applies the 
principles of evolution to the creation of an imaginary zoo. Starting with the 
idea that climate and environment are the deciding factors in how living things 
evolve, <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> charts the changes on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s surface since the dinosaurs 
died out and then invents critters to fill all environmental niches. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wonderful idea wonderfully carried out, and the pictures of these 
would-have-been creatures are as good as the text. 
</P>
<P>
Here we meet the balaclav (whose name is almost an anagram of a Greek pastry), 
a ferocious-looking beast that inhabits mountain snowfields and ekes out a 
living on alpine plants. To protect itself from the cold, the balaclav contains 
layers of fat and is covered by hair. 
</P>
<P>
The megalosaur, on the other hand, lives in tropical rain forests and offshore 
islands. "Its sharp teeth and the powerful claws on the forelimbs are used for 
holding prey and tearing it up," <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> writes. "The actual killing is done with 
great talons on the hind feet. As it walks the heavy head is held out at the 
front, balanced by the long heavy tail behind." 
</P>
<P>
The dingum, meanwhile, is a meat-eating desert creature with a remarkable 
anatomical trait. When a predator appears, "A fin of skin supported by struts 
of bone springs up from its curved back and presents a gaudily colored sail to 
the attacker, a sudden burst of garish color against the drab grasses. The 
crest on the back of the head pops up a frill of spines, each one poisonous 
enough to kill a large attacker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beast of the Steppes 
</P>
<P>
And don't overlook the taranter, a grass-eating beast of the steppes whose back 
is covered with horny bone plates. This armor originally evolved for defense, 
but in the taranter, it serves the more important purpose of helping the animal 
conserve moisture. 
</P>
<P>
One of <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s assumptions is that because the dinosaurs didn't die out, there 
was no evolution of mammals from the small, rat-like creatures they were during 
the Age of the Reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
All science-fiction movies to the contrary, cavemen did not exist at the time 
of the dinosaurs. They came much, much later, after the dinosaurs had 
relinquished the planet. In <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s imagined evolution, neither cavemen nor 
anything close to them ever got started. The highest mammal in <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s world is 
a zwim, which is about a foot long, looks like a cross between a shrew and a 
beaver, lives in streams and rivers and dines on insects. There are no primates 
in <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s hypothetical world, and certainly no humans. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any sign of intelligence, at least in our understanding of that 
term. The animals that <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> envisions all live by instinct and evolutionary 
design. Might intelligence not have evolved in creatures other than humans? 
Just a thought. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alternative Zoology' 
</P>
<P>
"The New Dinosaurs" is <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>'s second book of "alternative zoology." The first 
was "After Man," which imagined how evolution was going to proceed in the 
future. "The New Dinosaurs" wonders how evolution would have occurred up to now 
with one large change along the way. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the books so compelling is that they are not mere flights of fancy 
cooked up in a dream. Starting with what is known about the dinosaurs that did 
exist and hewing to the rules of evolution, <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> comes up with plausible 
creatures that might actually be roaming around today in place of you and me. 
It's a pleasant and provocative way to learn about dinosaurs and about 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for us, the comet (or whatever it was) didn't miss, the great 
reptiles did die out, the mammals did evolve, and here we are thinking about 
all these things. But it could have been otherwise.

<HEAD>China Finds Dinosaur Fossils, Among World's Largest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese and Canadian scientists have found what
they believe may be the largest dinosaur fossils in the world, the
official <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua News Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The discovery last month of the remains of a dinosaur believed
to have been 99 feet long was made in <LOCATION>northwest China</LOCATION>'s Gobi desert
by members of the Sino-Canadian Dinosaur Project, the report said.
   The fossils, including a complete skull and 10 pieces of
cervical vertebrae, were found in the Junggar basin in the <LOCATION>Xinjiang
Autonomous Region</LOCATION>, it said.
   Chinese paleontologist <PERSON>Dong Zhiming</PERSON> said the remains date back
140 million years and are believed to be the largest found in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>
and possibly the world.
   The fossils have been shipped to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> for laboratory
analysis, <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua</ORGANIZATION> said. The report did not say what kind of dinosaur
it was believed to be.
   The Dinosaur Project, begun in <DATE>1986</DATE>, involves experts from the
two fossil-rich countries of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> who have made three
large expeditions into the Gobi desert.
   Their dinosaur and other fossil discoveries, including 12 major
dinosaur skeletons, will be part of a traveling exhibit to 12
cities around the world scheduled for <DATE>1992</DATE>.

<HEAD>Study Suggests `Greenhouse' Warming Of Atmosphere Killed Dinosaurs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An asteroid collision with Earth may
have released enough gas to heat the planet 65 million years ago,
causing gradual extinction of dinosaurs and other species by
destroying their food, researchers say.
   The study drew guarded praise from a critic of the theory,
because the findings attempt to explain why only certain creatures
became extinct and why the extinctions were gradual, not sudden.
   The asteroid impact theory differs from ones in which scientists
said such a collision caused mass extinction by kicking up enough
dust to block sunlight, plunging the planet into a freezing
darkness that killed plants, a source of food.
   <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON>John
O'Keefe</PERSON> and geophysicist <PERSON>Thomas Ahrens</PERSON> reached their conclusion by
analyzing experiments in which <PERSON>Ahrens</PERSON> and geophysicist <PERSON>Manfred
Lange</PERSON> shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph.
   Based on the amount of carbon dioxide released by the shattered
rocks, the scientists calculated that a 6-mile-diameter asteroid
hitting limestone or other carbon-rich rocks on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> would have
released enough carbon dioxide to increase the amount of the gas in
the atmosphere two to five times.
   Such an increase in the gas, which traps solar heat like glass
in a greenhouse, could have caused a ``greenhouse effect'' that
warmed the planet by 9 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit for 10,000 years
after the asteroid struck, <PERSON>Ahrens</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   ``The leafy plants which dinosaurs ate were selectively
destroyed'' by the heat while other plants survived, <PERSON>Ahrens</PERSON> said.
``So there was probably (increased) competition for available food,
and eventually food supplies declined to a point where different
species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct in a
less-than-sudden manner.''
   Fossils show dinosaurs and other creatures became extinct
gradually, while many species survived. Many biologists and
paleontologists argue the mass extinction 65 million years ago was
caused by gradual climate change, not an asteroid or other sudden
catastrophe.
   <PERSON>William Clemens</PERSON>, paleontology chairman at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, and a leading critic of asteroid theories,
said he was skeptical of the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory because the
dinosaurs started to die earlier than 65 million years ago.
   But he called their study ``clearly a positive step'' because it
is consistent with gradual, selective extinction.
   O'Keefe will present the study <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> at the <DATE>19th
Lunar</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Planetary Science Conference</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists debating the dinosaurs' extinction fall into two main
camps: those who blame gradual climate change and those who blame
catastrophe. Catastrophe theorists disagree on whether an asteroid
or gigantic volcanic eruption was to blame.
   Geophysicist <PERSON>Charles Officer</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> said he
believes the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory does not have merit because
geologic evidence supports the theory that volcanoes spewed enough
ash skyward to block sunlight and cause mass extinction.
   Geochemist <PERSON>Frank Kyte</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION>, disagreed, saying the theory that the asteroid triggered
greenhouse warming of the atmosphere is probably sound.
   While other scientists previously suggested the greenhouse
effect caused the extinctions, they said the carbon dioxide was
generated by volcanoes, changes in ocean circulation, or acid rain
that dissolved carbon-rich rocks.
   It is important to learn what killed the dinosaurs because ``it
behooves us to find out if we're just sort of sitting here awaiting
another (asteroid) impact to seal our doom, or if some of the
things we're doing to the environment might ... lead to the
extinction of many species,'' <PERSON>Clemens</PERSON> said.
   Scientists believe rising levels of carbon dixoide and other
greenhouse gases will warm Earth 3 to 5 degrees by the year <DATE>2050</DATE>,
possibly causing crop-threatening droughts and partly melting polar
ice caps to raise sea levels and threaten coastal cities.
   <PERSON>Ahrens</PERSON> said an asteroid impact not only may have triggered
greenhouse heating, but possibly caused chemical reactions that
formed intense acid rain, which either killed many creatures
directly or wiped out their food plants. Clemens, however, wondered
how birds and other surviving species could have hidden from the
corrosive downpour.
