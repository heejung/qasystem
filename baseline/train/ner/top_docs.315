Life hasn't been the same the last couple of years on the 1,800-acre Flying S 
Ranch in <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>'s sparsely populated <LOCATION>Colusa County</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Ray 
Williams</PERSON> runs a herd of Brahman cattle. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, 47, has been a cowboy all his life, all over the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION>, working many 
different breeds of cattle and even buffalo and sheep. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to this country nobody had Brahmans, but everybody's 
accustomed to them now. It's these damn birds that's changin' things around. 
Biggest birds on earth," allowed <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clowns of Bird World 
</P>
<P>
He was surrounded by the clowns of the bird world, enormous, eight-foot, 300- 
to 325-pound, flightless ostriches with skinny limber necks nearly half their 
length and funny, fuzzy small heads with duck-like bills, soft brown eyes and 
thick black eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever thought ranching would come to this," sighed the cowpoke as one of the 
ostriches began pecking at his jacket buttons. Williams raised his finger in 
the air, admonishing the bird to cut it out. 
</P>
<P>
Another big bird uncorked its neck and in a flash with its bill grabbed the cap 
off the cowboy's head. "Give that back," shouted <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> sternly, and the 
ostrich dropped his lid. "Playful critters aren't they?" mused the cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
The Flying S is one of a dozen ostrich farms and ranches in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, one of 
about 200 growers in the nation with a total of about 5,000 birds, mostly in 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>. Ostrich farms are an answer to trade sanctions against 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> imposed in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, this country had been importing upward of 90,000 ostrich hides a 
year from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. The soft grained leather is used to make purses, belts, 
shoes and boots. 
</P>
<P>
Now the big push among ostrich growers is to build up numbers. The birds 
command a lot of money: <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> for a chick, <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> for breeding 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Ostriches are going to be big business in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> within a few years, just you 
watch and see," said <PERSON>Svend Steffen</PERSON>, 54, owner of the Flying S who also owns and 
operates a steel company in <LOCATION>Redwood City</LOCATION>. "Not only for the hides, but for the 
meat and feathers as well," he added. 
</P>
<P>
An ostrich yields 90 pounds of cholesterol-free, beef-like meat. "Ostrich meat 
is a popular dinner item in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. I never tire of eating ostrich. It 
tastes great," insisted <PERSON>Steffen</PERSON>. He has 22 ostriches and plans to have as many 
as 200 within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"These birds are similar to chickens in many ways," chimed in <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>. "Males 
are called roosters, females, hens, babies, chicks. Like chickens they roost at 
night and males, like barnyard roosters, make a lot of noise at sunup. Male 
ostriches make a booming noise. It makes your hair stand on end. It's like 
something you've never heard before." 
</P>
<P>
The cowboy laughed and said, "Imagine eating an ostrich drumstick. One 
drumstick is enough to feed nearly a dozen people. One ostrich egg weighs three 
pounds and equals 26 chicken eggs." An ostrich hen lays an egg every other day 
with a total of 40 to 60 eggs in a laying season. Eggs hatch out in 42 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ostrich Runways 
</P>
<P>
The big birds on the Flying S Ranch are kept in two acres embraced by a 
six-foot high fence. Eight 200-foot-long runways are in the ostrich yard. The 
birds exercise by racing back and forth at speeds at times in excess of 40 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't cowboy ostriches. No way is anybody going to lasso one of those 
characters," observed <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, who begins his day at sunup feeding his birds 
corn, barley and alfalfa pellets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're waiting at the gate to greet me. I kind of take a shine to some of the 
friendlier birds like <ORGANIZATION>Big John</ORGANIZATION> over there and <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and this hen I call Lucy," 
said <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>, scratching <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> on her long neck. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the day, <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> is out on the ranch cowboying like most cowboys 
do -- with cows, not birds.

   The bad-tempered, high-kicking African
ostrich can run at 60 mph, but that's not fast enough to escape a
group of breeders who see the world's largest bird as a nonstop
profit machine.
   The breeders say there is increasing demand for their feathers,
skin and high-protein, low-cholesterol meat.
   Along with ostrich meat's newfound popularity among stressed
executives and health nuts in <LOCATION>Western</LOCATION> industrialized nations, the
Japanese have taken to preparing it sushi-style and eating it raw,
says breeder <PERSON>Kevin Grant</PERSON>.
   Unlike its domestic relative, the chicken, the ostrich yields
red meat with a distinctive flavor. About 55 pounds of top quality
meat worth about <MONEY>$500</MONEY> can be stripped from the average-size bird.
   But the 6-footer offers other values, says <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>, head of a
recently established organization representing about 40 <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>
breeders.
   Finely tooled ostrich skin cowboy boots fetch as much as <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>
a pair in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. The leather industry in that state alone demands
94,000 15-foot-square skins a year.
   Not much else of the ostrich goes to waste, either. The
feathers, a symbol of justice in ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and of wealth to
European royalty in the early <DATE>1900s</DATE>, made a comeback in the French
haute couture of top fashion designer <PERSON>Christian Lacroix</PERSON> earlier
this year.
   <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> wants the feathers to dust its cars, and already Japanese
dealers have been sent to inspect <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>'s fledgling ostrich
industry.
   According to <ORGANIZATION>Grant</ORGANIZATION>, an adult ostrich provides about three pounds
of feathers and, in all, meat, skin and other by-products account
for about <PERCENT>98 percent</PERCENT> of its body weight.
   Scientists are even studying whether ostrich corneas are
compatible with the human eye.
   The flightless bird is not susceptible to tick-borne diseases or
traditional livestock ailments covered by international quarantine
and transportation laws on animal products.
   ``It makes good practical sense,'' Grant says.
   Neighboring <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is the world's biggest supplier of
ostrich products. Some ranchers in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and other parts of the
American southwest also are dabbling with the birds.
   Grant says the fertile ostrich's giant egg is far too valuable
to scramble for breakfast and, contrary to popular belief, the
ostrich does not bury its head in the sand.
   As well as that formidable kick, the bird's rapier-like toe can
cut a person from chest to groin in a single swipe.
   ``The risk of being kicked is part of the business,'' says
<ORGANIZATION>Grant</ORGANIZATION>. ``I have a gambler's heart and this could be a big money
spinner.''

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Feathered herds give
heavyweight profits - The rapid growth of US ostrich ranching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVOLUTION DEALT the ostrich a mixed hand. The world's largest, presumably
oldest and certainly moodiest bird boasts a protective hide covered with
motley coloured feathers, carries around 300lb of red meat and lays
delicious eggs. Such impressive physical endowment has, unfortunately for
the earth-bound avian, great commercial value.
African farmers have long realised the birds' potential. But in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> only
recently have ostriches become a hot commodity. In fact, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> supply for
this alternative cash crop remains solely in the hands of breeders, who sell
the birds at inflated prices to satisfy demand.
Since ostriches were first introduced from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in the mid-1980s the
number of ranchers raising them has grown to about 3,000.
The ranches are usually small, but surprisingly profitable. An adult pair,
which can produce between 30 and 120 eggs per year, now carries a Dollars
60,000 price tag, which is still rising quickly. Two yearlings can be bought
for about Dollars 12,000 to Dollars 15,000 and chicks, which require much
care, are a bargain at Dollars 3,000 each. No wonder many Americans with a
backyard and a high fence have at least mulled over this investment.
<PERSON>Mr Howard W. 'Bud' Kerr Jr.</PERSON>, who runs the one-man (no window) small-scale
farming office at the sprawling <ORGANIZATION>US Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, says he gets
as many as 30 inquiries about ostriches each week.
At the <ORGANIZATION>Circle M Ranch</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>south-west Missouri</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Bob McKean</PERSON> has been raising
ostriches since <DATE>1986</DATE>, when he bought his first pair for only Dollars 8,000.
He now owns 35 birds, quite a lot by present standards, which are raised on
a 75ft by 120ft plot.
Many such breeding ranches are run across the country's farm belt,
especially in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>.
It is not clear when the demand will be satisfied, though estimates range
from five to ten years. Other large-scale agricultural commodities like
<PERSON>Angus</PERSON> cattle and the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> longhorn also were launched by a breeder's
market.
The ostriches' potential under normal market conditions has not been
questioned. The bird has many uses.
Ostrich flesh, already used to make jerky in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, caters to the demand
for low fat and low cholesterol meat. Large-scale slaughter has not begun,
but the meat, now taken from sterile birds, sells for Dollars 6 to Dollars
10 a pound. Health-conscious <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has been cited as a possibly fertile
future market.
The black, blue and white feathers, which on the European market bring
Dollars 50 to Dollars 1,000 a pound, are used in feather dusters, fashion
accessories, theatre costumes and pens. This is a renewable resource; an
ostrich can be deplumed twice a year.
But perhaps most coveted is the hide, used to make boots and brief cases.
Tanned hides bring Dollars 30 to Dollars 50 a sq ft while custom 'full
quill' boots can cost as much as Dollars 2,000.
Starting an ostrich farm is easy, farmers say. An estimated 2,000 birds are
needed to turn a profit under normal market conditions. For now, however, an
operation even smaller than <PERSON>Mr McKean</PERSON>'s can do the trick.
The birds, unlike cattle, need little space and eat little. They usually
live for around 70 years and most of them are fertile. 'They're just large
chickens,' says <PERSON>Mr Ronald Mascher</PERSON>, who publishes the Small Farm Today
magazine.
But they are probably not as smart. Owners warn that the birds must be
trained and handled carefully because, with a brain barely bigger than a
peanut, the ostrich has an impulsive character.
The birds do not stick their heads in the sand to avoid danger - a terribly
damning myth, ostrich owners lament - but they are prone to unrelenting
pecking, running around at speeds in excess of 45 mph and generating enough
force with their two-toed feet to, in the words of one expert, 'disembowel a
lion'.
There are other problems. Chicks often have a high mortality rate, usually a
consequence of indigestion or inclement weather; the market for many ostrich
products, particularly meat, remains untested; and prices are highly
volatile.
Volatility may not be such a drawback, however, as <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> farmers are well known
for having a strong speculative streak.

   A nine-foot-tall, male ostrich is a strange
sight in the <LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION> oil fields, especially when it's trying to
scare interlopers and attract females, but to <PERSON>Cooper Campbell</PERSON>,
there's gold in them there quills.
   ``Careful,'' he said, handing a visitor an off-white, pebbly
surfaced, 3{-pound ostrich egg the size of a human baby's head.
``That's worth <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>.''
   If the egg is fertile, and the embryo survives its 42-day
incubation, and the chick survives the critical first three months
_ the odds of everything going right are about <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> at best _
the 2-foot-tall baby bird can command more than <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>.
   A pair of fertile, productive adults can bring <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> to
<MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> is manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Yellow Rose Ostrich Ranch</ORGANIZATION> south of
<LOCATION>Odessa</LOCATION>, part of a business taking its first steps in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   Potential profits attract ranchers all over the country,
especially in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>, although
the hardy birds can be raised in almost every state and even above
the Arctic Circle in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
   Just a few years ago, ostriches in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could be
found only in zoos and in the pastures of exotic-animal collectors.
Now the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commercial ostrich population is 4,000 to 8,000, said
<PERSON>Tom Mantzel</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Fort Worth-based American
Ostrich Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's growing, growing, growing at a phenomenal clip,'' said
<PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON>, who promotes the ostrich industry with preacher zeal.
About 500 ranchers belong to the organization, three-quarters of
them in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Most of the rest are in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>.
   Mantzel estimated the country's adult ostrich population will
have to reach at least 75,000 before it makes economic sense to
slaughter them for their hide, feathers and meat. Until then, which
he estimates will be in the mid-1990s, the birds are more valuable
as breeders.
   The hide is used to make western boots, belts, other items of
clothing and luggage. The feathers are used in dusters. <LOCATION>South
Africans</LOCATION> and Europeans eat the meat, which looks, feels and tastes
like beef and is low in cholesterol and fat.
   Ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months, when they weigh
about 300 pounds and carry about 80 pounds of meat. The hide,
feathers and meat are worth <MONEY>$400</MONEY> to <MONEY>$500</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON> said.
   Ostrich ranchers are getting a boost from global politics since
virtually all ostrich products come from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>.
   Because of American economic sanctions aimed at protesting <LOCATION>South
Africa</LOCATION>'s apartheid racial segregation system, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> consumers can't
buy ostrich hides directly from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and must buy treated
skins from third countries.
   <PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON> believes American ostriches will mean big business, and
that Americans will develop an appetite for the meat just as they
have developed a taste for catfish and sushi.
   Americans already have developed a liking for ostrich leather.
Highest-grade, treated hide costs about <MONEY>$28</MONEY> a square foot, said <PERSON>Joe
Lama</PERSON>, buyer for the <ORGANIZATION>Tony Lama Boot Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>.
   The average ostrich will yield about five boots made from the
best-looking skin, called full quill, <ORGANIZATION>Lama</ORGANIZATION> said. About two pairs
can be made from the bird's lesser-quality hide, whose
characteristic bumps are smaller and less prominent than in
full-quill leather.
   Before a cowboy sticks his feet into a pair of ostrich-skin
boots, though, the bird has to hatch and grow up. That's <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s
business.
   The laying season lasts from about <DATE>March to October</DATE>, with hens
laying an egg about every other day. After 42 days in an incubator
and hatchery, the hatchling is ready, sometimes getting a little
human help to peck itself out of the eggshell, which is about as
thick as a nickel.
   A hatchling weighs about 1{ pounds and can stand up and walk
almost immediately. Its gray feathers look and feel like coarse
hair.
   Days after hatching, chicks already can run. They grow eight to
10 inches a month during their first few months. They can reproduce
at about 2 to 3 years of age. Ostriches in the wild can live to be
75.
   Because of their speed, they have few predators.
   ``They can sustain 35 to 40 miles an hour for five or six
miles,'' <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> said, adding that lions and even cheetahs have
trouble catching the birds in the wild and almost always go for
something more attainable.
   Contrary to popular belief, they don't stick their heads in the
sand. If they're cornered or don't feel like running, they can
kick. <PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON> said the birds have been known to kick coyotes to
death on the American range.
   A 20-acre tract of range can sustain 50 or 60 ostriches, which
forage and eat pellet feed.
   ``I tell ranchers, `Just set aside <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of your land, two
or three acres, and raise ostriches,''' <PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON> said. ``I say,
`Instead of spending a dollar and a dime to make a dollar, try
something you can make a profit on.' Someday, it will be a barnyard
industry like sheep, cattle and goats.''

<P>
Potential profits attract ranchers all over the country, especially in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>, although the hardy birds can be raised in 
almost every state and even above the Arctic Circle in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, ostriches in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could be found only in 
zoos and in the pastures of exotic-animal collectors. Now the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commercial 
ostrich population is 4,000 to 8,000, said <PERSON>Tom Mantzel</PERSON>, executive director of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Fort Worth-based American Ostrich Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's growing, growing, growing at a phenomenal clip," said <PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON>, who 
promotes the ostrich industry with a preacher's zeal. About 500 ranchers belong 
to the organization, three-quarters of them in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Most of the rest are in 
<LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Mantzel estimated the country's adult ostrich population will have to reach at 
least 75,000 before it makes economic sense to slaughter them for their hide, 
feathers and meat. Until then, which he estimates will be in the mid-1990s, the 
birds are more valuable as breeders. 
</P>
<P>
The hide is used to make western boots, belts, other items of clothing and 
luggage. The feathers are used in dusters. <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> and Europeans eat the 
meat, which looks, feels and tastes like beef and is low in cholesterol and 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
Ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months, when they weigh about 300 pounds 
and carry about 80 pounds of meat. The hide, feathers and meat are worth <MONEY>$400</MONEY> 
to <MONEY>$500</MONEY>, <PERSON>Mantzel</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Big Jim the ostrich hunkered down and, in what has become a daily ritual, 
curved his long neck into an S-shape and waved it from side to side. Sally, the 
focus of his attentions, batted her long eyelashes and looked away. 
</P>
<P>
The courtship of these ostriches isn't very private. When <ORGANIZATION>Big Jim</ORGANIZATION> performs his 
dramatic mating dance, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> farmer <PERSON>Dick Hugg</PERSON> watches and smiles. At <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> a 
chick, ostrich breeding is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
The birds deliver offspring promptly and punctually. Every other day between 
<TIME>4:30 p.m.</TIME> and <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME>, <PERSON>Sally</PERSON> lays an egg, and the Huggs -- between growing corn 
and soybeans and feeding hogs -- head out to the ostrich pen to pluck an egg 
and place it in an incubator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taller Than Cornstalks 
</P>
<P>
Ostriches in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>? At 8 and 9 feet tall, these 300-pound African birds stretch 
higher than cornstalks and cause double-takes among Hugg's neighbors in this 
conservative German farming community. 
</P>
<P>
But Hugg, along with an estimated 100 farmers in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> and 200 in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, see ostriches as the salvation of a distressed agricultural 
economy unable to support the more traditional soybean, grain, beef and pork 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the brightest picture on the agricultural scene <DATE>today</DATE>, and it's going to 
stay that way," said <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> rancher <PERSON>Dale Coody</PERSON>, who owns 60 ostriches and 
wrote "Ostriches, Your Great Opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, agriculture is in trouble, and this is the surest way out of 
trouble that I know of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enough Profit for a Pizza 
</P>
<P>
It was <DATE>1975</DATE> when <PERSON>Dick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Doris Hugg</PERSON> realized that they could not earn a living 
from cattle. After raising 180 head, marketing them and rushing the cash to the 
bank to pay off their note, "we had just enough left over to buy a pizza," <PERSON>Hugg</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So the Huggs, and others who survived a farm crisis that left many bankrupt, 
sought ways to diversify. Some got hooked on ostriches, and, according to many 
who invested, are making huge profits. <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> farmer <PERSON>LeRoy Kaufman</PERSON> said he earned 
more than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE> by raising and selling the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrich breeders are confident that they can carve a niche in American 
agriculture for the marketing of ostrich feathers, hide and meat. "We foresee 
it eventually being a commercial business, much like turkeys or chickens or 
hogs, where they'll be routinely raised for slaughter," <PERSON>Hugg</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Cholesterol Meat 
</P>
<P>
Ostrich meat, popular in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, is a red meat one-third lower in fat and 
cholesterol than beef. Ostrich promoters have dubbed it the health meat of the 
'90s. "We'll have ostrich burgers someday," <PERSON>Hugg</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But ostrich filets and ostrich-skin bucket seats are at least seven years away, 
according to <PERSON>Tom Mantzel</PERSON>, executive director of the Texas-based <ORGANIZATION>American 
Ostrich Assn</ORGANIZATION>. This country's ostrich population, estimated at 6,000 adults, is 
not big enough to support a slaughterhouse, so the current market is for 
breeders only. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are hard to come by and command a high price. An adult mating pair 
costs <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY>, and an unusually prolific pair can carry a <MONEY>$75,000</MONEY> 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Ostriches, particularly attractive to breeders because of their reproductive 
habits, lay 35 to 100 eggs annually for 40 of their 70 years of life. 
</P>
<P>
Even at high prices and with the birds' high reproductive rate, breeders say 
they cannot meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Profit in 85 Days 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kaufman</PERSON> said that 85 days after he bought a few birds in <DATE>1987</DATE>, he recouped his 
<MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> investment and pocketed a <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> profit. "I've made more dollars here 
than I ever did in farming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so optimistic. <PERSON>Fred Thornberry</PERSON>, a poultry specialist at <ORGANIZATION>Texas 
A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION>, called the enterprise speculative and warned prospective 
breeders not to jump in hastily. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, like so many once-promising ventures in agriculture, such as the 
failed rabbit-harvesting craze in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> several years ago, this one could fall 
dead in its tracks. "This is not an industry as yet, and I would be very 
cautious (about) investing money I could not afford to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornberry, who has received more than 600 ostrich-related queries from farmers 
across the country, said that profits probably peaked in <DATE>1987</DATE>. The farmers who 
bought birds at low prices in <DATE>1986</DATE> and earlier will pocket the highest profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Explosion Seen 
</P>
<P>
What makes the venture especially risky for incoming breeders is the likelihood 
of an ostrich population explosion this year, which could cause prices to 
plummet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of chicks hatched in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the year the ostrich movement picked up 
speed, will begin reproducing this year. "I think we're approaching the point 
where it's getting riskier and riskier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Huggs do not expect an imminent population explosion, because 
raising an egg to a full-grown ostrich is a difficult task that most breeders 
have yet to master. 
</P>
<P>
Baby ostriches are frail and die easily. And, because ostriches are a new 
agricultural frontier, farmers do not quite know how to raise birds that can 
run 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding them is not such a problem. Ostriches, said to eat anything, are 
usually raised on prepared alfalfa pellets with some grain and other 
ingredients mixed in. The Huggs feed them lettuce and cabbage also. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Male Turns Dangerous 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sally</PERSON> and <PERSON>Big Jim</PERSON>, which are kept inside a 5-foot wire fence, exhibit distinct 
personalities, the <PERSON>Huggs</PERSON> said. She is always docile. He is, too, unless it's 
mating season, when he turns cantankerous and downright dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
In mating season, males are reputed to be able to kill with a kick, and the 
Huggs stay out of the pen, using a cane to retrieve eggs from the nest. "He 
doesn't like people messing with his eggs or his girl," <PERSON>Hugg</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Most breeders are able to hatch <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of their eggs, and the <PERSON>Huggs</PERSON>' hatch rate 
runs about <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT>. They attribute their success to a labor-intensive operation and 
a willingness to do whatever it takes to hatch a chick and help it grow. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a chick has trouble cracking out of its egg, the Huggs help it 
along with pliers. 
</P>
<P>
Breeders expect <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ostrich prices to be buoyed should the <ORGANIZATION>Department of 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> permanently ban importation of the birds from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. The 
department temporarily embargoed ostriches in <DATE>June</DATE>, when ticks not indigenous 
to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> were found on incoming birds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breeders Back Import Ban 
</P>
<P>
Some breeders prefer an import ban, so they can build the ostrich population 
from birds already here. Once the pool is high enough to support a processing 
plant, breeders see a virtual fail-safe enterprise, because every part of the 
bird is usable: feathers for computer dusters, ceremonial plumes and fashion 
wear; leather for boots, purses, car seats, egg shells for jewelry and meat for 
health-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Richard Whitaker</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> banker and owner of 40 ostriches, said he has 
received letters from a Swiss company expressing interest in ostrich meat 
produced here, because <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> controls the industry and does not export 
enough to meet Swiss demand. "They can't get enough of it in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique's restaurant in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> used to offer ostrich meat but 
discontinued it, because "it was not appreciated."

   WEATHERFORD, Texas -- George and Andrew Williams are
looking for a nest egg.
   The father and son sell insurance in nearby Fort Worth,
but George is sure that there is no end to the money that can
be made from Red Necks, a variety of ostriches. Also from
Blue Necks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Williamses are thinking of putting up <MONEY>$80,000</MONEY> to join
all the Americans supposedly flocking to ostrich ranching.
   A three-month-old ostrich chick sells for as much as
<MONEY>$3,000</MONEY>. A mature breeding pair of three-year-old birds can
command <MONEY>$70,000</MONEY>. A fertile egg goes for <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY>. A
particularly fecund ostrich can lay up to 120 eggs a year,
<PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of them fertile, and go on laying for as long as 40
years.
   All of that explains the "rich" in ostrich to the
<LOCATION>Williamses</LOCATION> and others who are buying a piece of the action,
sometimes just part of an ostrich. Skeptics hear of this and
recall the folks in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> who thought they were going to
get rich raising chinchillas for fur coats but lost their
shirts instead.
   "You can regain your capital within the first year," says
<PERSON>Ronda Barton</PERSON>, who sells people on the idea for <ORGANIZATION>Bordelon
Breeders International</ORGANIZATION>, a big, high-tech ostrich ranch
outside <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>. The company sells birds outright and
syndicates one-half and one-third interests in ostriches that
<PERSON>Bordelon</PERSON> raises for clients. Bordelon pays dividends in
chicks. It holds "marketing seminars." You can buy or lease.
   One recent <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 50-odd would-be ostrich owners joined
the Williamses in hearing the <PERSON>Bordelon</PERSON> pitch. "With cattle,
you've just got the hides and the meat," says <PERSON>Craig
Longhurst</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bordelon</PERSON>'s marketing director. "But with ostriches
you've got hide and feathers, then you've got meat, and then
you've got eggs. So you've got two more profit centers."
   Profit centers? It is true that ostrich leather -- a
pimply skin -- is highly prized, certainly highly priced.
Mark Cross in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> has an ostrich handbag that sells for
<MONEY>$3,475</MONEY>, though it may not move as fast as an ostrich on the
hoof (40 mph). And at the <ORGANIZATION>Nocona Boot Company</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>,
ostrich-leather boots walk out the door at <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> a pair.
   Ostrich feathers -- the birds can be shorn like sheep --
sell to designers for as much as <MONEY>$150</MONEY> a pound. Feather
importer <PERSON>Anthony Trento Jr.</PERSON> says his AmCan <ORGANIZATION>Feather Co.</ORGANIZATION> sells
more than <MONEY>a million dollars</MONEY> in feathers annually to
designers. And he is really excited about the possibilities
the lesser feathers have in feather dusters. "Turkey-feather
dusters just move dust from one place to the next. An ostrich
duster will actually pick up dirt." Imagine if everybody had
one.
   "I'm so pleased to see proud plumage on the runways in
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>," says couturier <PERSON>Victor Costa</PERSON>, who claims to have spent
<MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> on feathers in <DATE>1990</DATE>. Designer <PERSON>Bob Mackie</PERSON>, who
specializes in sequins, agrees that "there's something
magical about ostrich feathers -- they're lighter than air
and very soft." <PERSON>Mr. Mackie</PERSON> says if thick white feathers from
the wing of a male could be obtained from domestic breeders,
the cost would certainly go down. "And that would be a help
since they're quite expensive."
   The ostrich (Struthio camelus) stands head and shoulders
above other birds, not just in profitability. It is the
world's biggest, heaviest bird, standing about eight feet
tall in stalking feet, and weighing in at about 325 to 375
pounds. Obviously, it can't get off the ground. The ostrich
also has only two toes on each foot, with which, says rancher
<PERSON>Patti Stickler</PERSON>, it "could split you totally in half." As
vegetarians go, ostriches are pretty powerful.
   Also, they are odd vegetarians. While they prefer plants
and eat six pounds of feed a day, they have been known to
swallow <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> bottles or anything else that piques their
interest, their eyes being bigger than their brains. Says
<PERSON>Mrs. Stickler</PERSON>: "Mine have eaten coins, rocks, sticks and
nails." Brilliant they aren't.
   Not only will they eat anything, they can survive in
virtually any climate and will flourish on the worst
rangeland. <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> was the first to ranch the birds and
is still the major producer. But the <DATE>1986</DATE> Anti-Apartheid Act
banned the importation of South African ostrich hides. So
many customers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> get the leather from countries
that get it from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. (Most ostrich leather is
processed and tanned in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.)
   Because of a tick that infests the big birds, the
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE> imposed further import
restrictions. "At present, we have a ban on the importation
of the {live} ostrich and its eggs," says <PERSON>Dr. Robert Whiting</PERSON>
at the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Animal Plant Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Does that spell opportunity for domestic breeders? Yes and
no. There are only 10,000 to 15,000 ostriches in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>,
and maybe only 1,500 breeding pairs. Chicks are back-ordered.
So it is a breeder's market. That is true in every sense.
Buyers are mainly breeders buying from other breeders.
   Nobody in this country is slaughtering ostriches yet in
any numbers; the birds are far more valuable as breeding
stock. The current slaughter value of an ostrich is only
about <MONEY>$1,250</MONEY>, rather less than the price of a live chick.
   Breeders say that when the ostrich population has
stabilized at more than 250,000 breeding pairs, about five to
eight years from now, ranchers can begin killing the birds
for leather and for meat, which tastes more like beef than
chicken, at least in meatballs. A <ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> report predicts that within 10 years ostriches
could be a <MONEY>$170 million</MONEY> business in the state. Others,
hearing that, chuckle and think of bars of gold held for
investors by third parties -- a boom of the past that went
bust.
   "It just can't be anything more than a pyramid scheme,"
says <PERSON>William Cawley</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> A&amp;M extension poultry specialist
emeritus, speaking of no abuse in particular. "The people who
get in early make all the money. A lot of poor people on the
bottom are going to get hurt." <PERSON>Mr. Cawley</PERSON> recalls something
similar happening once with <LOCATION>Shetland</LOCATION> ponies. He thinks the
ostrich business is birdbrained.
   Tell that to the folks who are investing in ostriches at
the <LOCATION>Bordelon</LOCATION> ranch. For <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Bordelon</ORGANIZATION> will sell you a
third interest in a breeding pair. Bordelon will care for
your birds, for a fee, and you get chicks as they are
hatched. Says <PERSON>Bordelon</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mr. Longhurst</PERSON>: "We do all the work.
Anybody can get involved this way." In the <DATE>last six months of
1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Bordelon</PERSON> says it sold <MONEY>$332,000</MONEY> in ostriches and ostrich
shares.
   In theory at least, when the ostrich population grows
large enough, prices will fall and Americans will start
eating ostrich meat. <PERSON>Susan Adkins</PERSON>, who presides over the
<ORGANIZATION>American Ostrich Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, says she
regularly gets calls from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> requesting ostrich meat,
"and of course it's not available here yet." She says the
meat, considered a delicacy on the Continent, is "lower in
calories, cholesterol and fat than turkey and chicken." <PERSON>Ms.
Adkins</PERSON> admits that it could be difficult to persuade <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
omnivores to switch to these big drumsticks despite the
nutritional percentage in it.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Stickler</PERSON> is among those who believe that ostriches
have truly great potential. She and her husband, <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>, have
raised ostriches in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> since <DATE>1986</DATE>. The Sticklers
originally raised cattle but have replaced their herd with
funny-looking birds. "My husband likes new exciting things,
and we make much more money with the ostriches," she says,
selling prospective broilers to breeders from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
   If by some chance the market for flightless birds fails to
get off the ground, there always is show business. The
Sticklers have a bird that was on "Late Night With <PERSON>David
Letterman</PERSON>."
   "His name is Chuck," says <PERSON>Mrs. Stickler</PERSON>. "He does tricks.
He dribbles a basketball, and he takes people's hats off."

<HEAD>Rancher Touts Ostrich Meat as Health Food of the '90s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Doug Stickler</PERSON> is sticking his neck out for
ostrich meat.
   Stickler, who with his older brother <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> have an ostrich spread
in the middle of <LOCATION>Oklahoma Panhandle</LOCATION> cattle country, predict meat
from the bareheaded bird will be the health food of the '90s.
   The Sticklers have brought four of their flightless flock to the
<LOCATION>Los Angeles County Fair</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION>.
   ``It won't be long until you see people eating <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> fried
ostrich,'' <PERSON>Stickler</PERSON> said in a telephone interview <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. ``It's
definitely the future.''
   The <PERSON>Turpin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, rancher said the meat is low in cholesterol,
high in protein and tastes like steak with the texture of veal.
Stickler said doctors and nutrition experts who have seen the
future are investing in ostriches.
   Cost per pound - <MONEY>$10</MONEY>, since there are so few of the birds in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. But <PERSON>Doug</PERSON> figures in 20 years, he'll be giving the
beef a run for its money.
   ``At first, we got a lot of teasing from the area ranchers. They
thought we were crazy,'' he said. ``Well, those same ones that
teased us have been coming down to see what we're doing.''
   Stickler got into the ostrich breeding business in <DATE>1986</DATE>. He
bought his first birds from ostrich-farming monks in <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>.
   Two years later, the Sticklers moved their 10,000 head of cattle
out and moved the birds in - about 175 of them now. The brothers
have sold more than 300 chicks nationwide. Prices range from <MONEY>$500</MONEY>
to <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> per chick.
   ``You just feed 'em, water 'em and leave 'em alone,'' he said.
``With cattle you worked from dark to dark. Back home it takes 30
minutes to do the ostrich chores.''
   Stickler said that according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Ostrich
Association</ORGANIZATION>, there are more than 5,000 ostriches being bred across
the country. The association predicts an ostrich population boom of
75,000 to 100,000 by mid-1990.

<HEAD>Ostrich Imports Banned Because of Tick Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> it
has stopped issuing import permits for live ostriches because
African ticks that can carry livestock disease were recently found
on some of the birds.
   <PERSON>James W. Glosser</PERSON>, administrator of the department's Animal and
<ORGANIZATION>Plant Health Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION>, said 18 ticks _ identified as
African Bont ticks and Bont-legged ticks _ were found on two
imported ostriches in <LOCATION>Andrews</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Quinlan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, in late <DATE>May</DATE>.
   Some of the ``exotic'' ticks also were found later on adult
ostriches in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, he said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> agency announced <DATE>June 19</DATE> that African ticks had been
detected on shipments of ostriches and told livestock producers to
be on the alert.
   Bont ticks are known to transmit heartwater, a disease of cattle,
sheep, goats and other ruminants. However, <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said the ticks
removed from the ostriches are not known to transmit any human
diseases.
   ``So far, there is no evidence that the ticks have spread to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
livestock,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said his agency ``is reviewing inspection methods and
quarantine facility standards to determine if other action is needed
to prevent additional pests from entering the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   He said the ostriches were in a shipment of 44 adult birds
imported from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 2</DATE>. Twenty-five survived and were
released <DATE>30 days later</DATE> from a privately owned, USDA-approved
quarantine facility in <LOCATION>Mundelein</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. Those were sent to cities in
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said 50 ostrich chicks from <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> also were imported
<DATE>Jan. 25</DATE> and that 45 survivors were released from a private
quarantine facility in <LOCATION>Schaumburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. They went to dealers in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   No ticks were found on the ostrich chicks.
   ``Animal health officials placed the infested premises under
state quarantine, identified all the ostriches and are treating the
birds and soil every 14 days with a pesticide used to control
livestock ticks,'' <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said.
   ``Other birds or animals that may have had contact with the
ostriches or those immediately adjacent to the birds are being
examined for ticks and treated,'' he said. ``If no ticks are found,
the state or federal veterinarian will lift the quarantine and
continue a tick surveillance for six months.''
   <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said rabbits, birds, steers and other ``sentinel''
animals are being placed on all farm premises with the adult
ostriches to see if the ticks are still a threat to domestic
animals. Agency health officials also are trapping wildlife on the
farms to check for ticks.
   Heartwater affects the heart, lymph nodes and brain of livestock,
causing muscle twitching, diarrhea, convulsions and death.
   <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said the ticks are reddish-orange or dark brown and
commonly attach themselves to the neck, udder, hoof or tail area of
livestock.

<P>
The entrepreneurial spirit thrives in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> livestock industry, with farmers 
and ranchers raising new and exotic livestock. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, domesticated deer are raised in a feedlot where cattle were once 
fed, and ostriches roam on a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> ranch next to quarter horses and 
Thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
"The ostrich industry is over 100 years old, but not in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>," 
said <PERSON>Cooper Campbell</PERSON>, who started raising the birds on his <LOCATION>Odessa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, horse 
ranch three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> expects in four to six years that there will be enough commercially 
raised ostriches to sustain markets for the meat, feathers and hide. Until 
then, the best market will be for breeding stock. 
</P>
<P>
Newborn and young ostriches are expensive, costing <MONEY>$6,000</MONEY> for a pair of 
3-month-old chicks and escalating to <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$75,000</MONEY> for a pair of 
3-year-olds, <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> said. However, prices should drop sharply once the 
industry matures and populations increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of economic hurdles face these fledgling livestock industries. Markets 
have to be developed for the meat, hides and breeding stock, and government 
standards for the meat must be established. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has a large commercial ostrich industry, and meat from the giant 
birds is marketed throughout <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON>, who is a 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Ostrich Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a lean, red meat that more closely resembles beef than anything else," 
he said. It is low in cholesterol and fat and can be processed into steaks and 
roasts. 
</P>
<P>
Better-established in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the market for ostrich hides, which 
are used for jackets, boots, belts and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dennis Gibson</PERSON>'s feedlots were empty for six years after he quit 
the cattle-feeding business in <DATE>1981</DATE>. Then in <DATE>1987</DATE> he began commercially raising 
fallow deer, a domesticated Asian deer that is more disease resistant than the 
white tail and mule deer indigenous to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
His herd of 250 deer is primarily for breeding purposes, and he regularly sells 
stags to other breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"The deer are flighty but have no trouble adapting to the northern climate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In five years, <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> hopes that supplies will be sufficient to develop and 
sustain marketing channels for venison. Local cattle slaughter plants presently 
process the small amount of commercial venison on the market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> extension service has supported deer farming with a 
symposium and educational material. Deer farming is successful in <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, 
where there is a commercial herd of 700,000 head, and the industry is growing 
by <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> a year, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, there isn't enough product (venison) available to establish a 
market, but we take <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> of the venison <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> exports," said <PERSON>R.M. Jordan</PERSON>, 
a <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> extension animal scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Venison contains <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> fat, compared to <PERCENT>35%</PERCENT> for high-quality beef, <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still in its infancy is the commercial raising of native American bison, 
commonly known as the American buffalo. The <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> extension 
service reports about 90,000 head in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, of which <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT> is under 
private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for bison meat has increased in some areas because of its leanness and 
perceived lower cholesterol content.

<HEAD>USDA Bans Other Ratites: Emus, Rheas and Cassowaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> it is
expanding its recent ban on ostrich imports to include related
flightless birds such as emus, rheas and cassowaries because they
may carry disease-bearing parasites.
   <PERSON>Larry B. Slagle</PERSON>, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and <ORGANIZATION>Plant Health Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION>, said the expanded import ban
was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely.
   ``We must curtail the entry of flightless birds into the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> until further notice to ensure that these birds do not
introduce disease-carrying parasites to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> livestock,'' he said.
   The flightless birds affected by the ban are known as ratites and
include ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries. These birds have
only small or rudimentary wings.
   An agency spokeswoman, <PERSON>Marlene Stinson</PERSON>, said the import ban does
not apply to penguins because those are of a different family.
Neither will the ban affect kiwis, because the bird's homeland, <LOCATION>New
Zealand</LOCATION>, does not permit exports, she said.
   Interest in ostrich farming has grown rapidly, and so have
imports. <PERSON>Stinson</PERSON> said no ostriches were imported in <DATE>1986</DATE> but that
348 entered the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, 537 in <DATE>1988</DATE>, and 825 through
<DATE>July 31</DATE> of this year.
   At present, sales of chicks and adult ostriches are confined
primarily to other breeders, who envision a potential market for
ostrich hide and meat.
   <PERSON>Slagle</PERSON> said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the
discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in
<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   The ticks were identified as African Bont and Bont-legged ticks,
which are known to transmit heartwater, an often fatal disease of
cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants. No further tick findings
have been reported.
   <PERSON>Slagle</PERSON> said the disease does not affect humans and does not exist
in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>July 5</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> agency announced it had stopped issuing
import permits for ostriches as a result of the tick threat and was
reviewing import inspection methods and quarantine standards.
   <PERSON>Slagle</PERSON> said the official rule-making publication of the new
import curbs will be <DATE>Aug. 21</DATE>. Public comments can be sent by <DATE>Oct. 20</DATE>
to: Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, <ORGANIZATION>PPD</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>APHIS</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>,

<HEAD>Ostriches Barred Entry After Ticks Found</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Live ostriches have been denied entry into the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> because African ticks
that can carry livestock disease recently were found on some of the
imported birds.
   <PERSON>James W. Glosser</PERSON>, administrator of the department's Animal and
<ORGANIZATION>Plant Health Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION>, said 18 ticks _ identified as
African Bont ticks and Bont-legged ticks _ were found on two
imported ostriches in <LOCATION>Andrews</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Quinlan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, in late <DATE>May</DATE>.
   Some of the exotic ticks also were found later on adult ostriches
in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, he said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>June 19</DATE> that African ticks had been detected
on shipments of ostriches and told livestock producers to be on the
alert.
   Bont ticks are known to transmit heartwater, a disease of cattle,
sheep, goats and other ruminants. However, <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said the ticks
removed from the ostriches are not known to transmit any human
diseases.
   ``So far, there is no evidence that the ticks have spread to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
livestock,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said his agency ``is reviewing inspection methods and
quarantine facility standards to determine if other action is needed
to prevent additional pests from entering the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.''
   He said the ostriches were in a shipment of 44 adult birds
imported from <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 2</DATE>. Twenty-five survived and were
released <DATE>30 days later</DATE> from a privately owned, USDA-approved
quarantine facility in <LOCATION>Mundelein</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. Those were sent to cities in
<LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said 50 ostrich chicks from <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> also were imported
<DATE>Jan. 25</DATE> and that 45 survivors were released from a private
quarantine facility in <LOCATION>Schaumburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION>. They went to dealers in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South
Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   No ticks were found on the ostrich chicks.
   ``Animal health officials placed the infested premises under
state quarantine, identified all the ostriches and are treating the
birds and soil every 14 days with a pesticide used to control
livestock ticks,'' <PERSON>Glosser</PERSON> said.
   ``Other birds or animals that may have had contact with the

   There's oil in them thar birds, and two
entrepreneurs are cashing in on the animal that's so despised in
its native land that the government once paid people to kill the
varmints.
   On a 65-acre tract in the <LOCATION>East Texas Piney Woods</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mark Solomon</PERSON>
and Dusty <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> are entering their second year as a new breed of
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> oilmen _ raising emus.
   ``It's just been unbelievable for us, beyond our wildest
dreams,'' said <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON>, 27, whose full-time job with the <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Department of Criminal Justice</ORGANIZATION> is designing furniture manufactured
for the state by inmates.
   ``We have to pinch ourselves to see if we're awake. It's still
hard to believe and we have to tell ourselves it's really
happening,'' added <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON>, 29, a tax consultant.
   Last <DATE>October</DATE>, the lifelong friends purchased a pair of emus for
<MONEY>$1,800</MONEY>. The Australian birds, which resemble ostriches, now fetch
more than <MONEY>$12,000</MONEY> per pair.
   They now have 31 birds, including 12 breeding pair. And profits
from sales of birds to people who buy them as an investment have
enabled <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> to purchase the 65-acre spread in
<LOCATION>Houston County</LOCATION>.
   ``People don't know what they are, but they've been good for
us,'' <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> said.
   Emus can grow to about 5{ feet tall and can weigh up to 120
pounds. The only bigger bird is the ostrich. Emus have
brownish-black feathers, long neck and long legs that can propel
them about 30 mph.
   The bird's meat, leather and feathers are marketable, but what
makes emus valuable is the oil they secrete.
   The oil _ about 5 quarts per processed bird _ is used as a
pharmaceutical for people suffering from arthritis. In cosmetics,
the oil is used in production of wrinkle-retarding emollient.
   <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> say the meat, although not readily
available, tastes like beef and has less cholesterol and fewer
calories. The leather is used like ostrich leather and the feathers
are used for fishing lures and feather dusters. Even the large
toenails _ three per foot _ are used for jewelry.
   ``Right now it's strictly a breeders' market,'' <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> said
recently. ``That's why prices are so high because there are not so
many around. But it's getting more common.''
   Emu prices are on the rise because of speculation about placing
a processing plant in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>American
Emu Association</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Harper</LOCATION>. One plant already operates in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and another in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, where thousands were killed and
bounties were placed on the emu because the bird trampled sheep
fences and ate crops.
   The association estimates about 1,500 breeding pair were in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as of last year, with the largest concentration in
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> have driven as far as <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state
and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to purchase birds.
   ``Whenever the processing stage comes into play we're going to
get less per bird,'' <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> said. ``But I'll be tickled to death
when it happens because you'll be looking at a definite place to
sell the bird and a definite income coming in.''
   Their first breeding pair, named <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clyde</PERSON>, laid 36 eggs
the first year. The eggs, which are dark green and resemble
avocados, hatch in 48 to 52 days. And once the birds get into a
cycle, they'll lay eggs every three days.
   <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> are expanding their farm and hope to
eventually have 90 pens in operation.
   Some people will purchase chicks at <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY> apiece,
keep them for three or four months and then sell for as much as
<MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> each. Feed costs are minimal, ranging from <MONEY>$150</MONEY> to <MONEY>$180</MONEY> per
year for each bird.
   Neighbors who raise cattle like to joke that <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is a land for
moo-moo, not emu.
   ``They are an ugly bird,'' <PERSON>Driskell</PERSON> acknowledged. ``But when
they sell for <MONEY>$12,000</MONEY>, they look pretty good.''

   A ostrich farmer thinks county
commissioners may have their heads in the sand for failing to agree
that an ostrich has as much value as a turkey.
   The dispute is over an <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> law that allows farmers to be
reimbursed by the county if dogs kill their farm animals.
   <PERSON>Michael Erwin</PERSON> of <PERSON>Morrow</PERSON> filed a <MONEY>$600</MONEY> claim for two ostriches
killed by dogs.
   But <ORGANIZATION>Warren County Commissioners</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> damages can be
collected only on animals that provide meat, eggs, or feathers, and
ostriches didn't.
   ``No one could think of any (agricultural value of the
ostrich),'' said commission President <PERSON>George Terwilleger</PERSON>.
   He invited <PERSON>Erwin</PERSON> to appeal, and <PERSON>Erwin</PERSON> said he would.
   ``I think that ostrich farming has as much credibility as cattle
farming or sheep farming,'' said <PERSON>Erwin</PERSON>, 32.
   He said ostrich hides and feathers are sold in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and he
plans to breed ostriches for meat. He said the meat is more of a
bargain than turkey.
   ``You get a lot more bird for your money.''

<HEADLINE>  CUSTOMS AGENTS SCRAMBLE TO ROUND UP OSTRICHES,
EGGS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     This week, <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON> went on his first ostrich raid.;    He and other agents
from Customs and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> were called in <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
to seize more than 300 ostrich eggs and four ostrich chicks from a home in <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Almaden Valley</LOCATION>. And, oh yes, there was the matter of chasing down five
6-foot-tall ostriches in the back yard when agents returned Thursday.;   
Customs officials believe the 300 eggs -- valued at more than <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY> -- were
imported from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> <DATE>less than 10 days ago</DATE>. Customs officials say the
importation of the eggs is prohibited by federal law because they may carry
Newcastle disease, a contagious, highly lethal virus that affects birds'
respiratory and nervous systems and can spread through a flock quickly.;   
The eggs -- and birds -- will be quarantined for 45 days.;    The owner of the
<PERSON>McKean</PERSON> Road house, <PERSON>Stacey Siegert-McGowen</PERSON>, has not been charged but remains
under investigation, <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON> said.;    He would not say whether these
ostriches are part of a larger, illegal wildlife importation ring.;   
According to <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON>, ostrich importing is a very lucrative business.
Unhatched fertilized eggs can go for more than <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> each, newborn chicks can
bring in more than <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY>, and a full-grown mating pair can be sold for more
than <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>.;    According to <PERSON>Patti Stickler</PERSON>, owner of Stickler Premium
Ostriches of <LOCATION>Turpin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, their value is so high because there is a lot of
money to be made in ostrich meat.;    "It's because the meat tastes like beef
but has less calories and fat than chicken," said <PERSON>Stickler</PERSON>. "All the ostriches
being sold now are going to grow up to be breeders.";    Right now, she said,
large-scale processing of ostriches is about eight years away so that ostrich
"farmers" can build a breeding base of more than 180,000 birds.;    A single
ostrich can lay up to 80 eggs per year and, when slaughtered, provide 125
pounds of red meat.;    <PERSON>Stickler</PERSON> said she has been offered <MONEY>$225,000</MONEY> for a
mating pair.;    The investigation into the <LOCATION>Almaden Valley</LOCATION> home was initiated
with the <DATE>October 1990</DATE> arrest of <PERSON>Roger Jacobson</PERSON>, who allegedly attempted to
smuggle 327 eggs into the <LOCATION>United States.</LOCATION>;    Also confiscated from the home's
garage were one huge incubator and several smaller ones and various related
documents discovered upon execution of the search warrants.;    The
confiscated items -- including the full-grown birds -- will be taken to the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION>San Ysidro</LOCATION> for quarantine, <ORGANIZATION>Van Dyke</ORGANIZATION>
said. If they are found to be healthy, they will be sold at auction.;    If
Customs officials determine that the eggs and the birds were imported
illegally, Siegert-McGowen and others involved in the case could face felony
charges of smuggling of merchandise contrary to the law, and smuggling of
wildlife contrary to the law, which both carry -- at the minimum -- stiff
fines, <PERSON>Van Dyke</PERSON> said.;    But it wasn't the desire to "get their man" that
drove Van Dyke and other Customs and <ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> agents
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. It was the desire to get those birds, which were left in a two-acre
grazing pen behind the home.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE> PLENTYWOOD, Mont.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This rural outpost, 400 miles northeast of <ORGANIZATION>Helena</ORGANIZATION>, has one stoplight and five ostriches. 

   Other inhabitants include mountain lions, Nubian ibexes, African sheep, Asian goats, and llamas. 

   There are 2,500 people here, too, a number of whom -- 10 maybe -- have turned to exotic-animal husbandry as a way around drought and persistent rural recession. 
To make money, in other words. 
Nobody knows why people are taking up this sideline -- here particularly -- but they are. 
At least, says <PERSON>Steven Howard</PERSON>, county attorney and ostrich rancher: "It's more interesting than cattle or sheep." 

   So when breakfast conversation down at <ORGANIZATION>Randy's Cafe</ORGANIZATION> turns to the subject of eggs, it might just be a local banker and <PERSON>Mr. Howard</PERSON> discussing ostrich fertility rates -- and counting their <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> chicks before they are hatched. 

   Sometimes, the talk concerns elk velvet -- another Plentywood export. 
The fuzz-covered immature antlers that sprout each year from elk heads are, in powdered form, a popular aphrodisiac in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. 
People here figure the rising price of antlers has to do with the <DATE>1986</DATE> nuclear-reactor disaster in <LOCATION>Chernobyl</LOCATION>. 
Radioactive fallout from the plant contaminated the reindeer feeding grounds in northern <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION>. 
Hence, <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION>, who also have a lot of discretionary income these days, are shopping for elk antlers in <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>. 

   Local grain-store operator <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> "Tubby" Hilyard, meanwhile, has only to display his huge red welts to prove he is telling the truth about the time one of his 150-pound mountain lions bit through his arm. 

   "If you act afraid, they won't let go," he says, speaking from experience, adding that he had to talk reassuringly to the big cat for several seconds before it let him loose and went back to its customary dinner of beef tartare. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hilyard</PERSON> bought his first mountain lion, <ORGANIZATION>Hobo</ORGANIZATION>, from a zoo in southern <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> and tried keeping it as a pet. 
But "he didn't take to my wife, and cost me a couple of drapes," he says. 
Now Hobo guards the feed store. 

   Not everyone here is an exotic-animal enthusiast, far from it. 
<PERSON>Robert Kane</PERSON>, a local veterinarian for 24 years, says there is little established demand, except from other breeders, for many of the animals people here are raising. 
He expects the prices some exotic animals and their byproducts fetch will go down as more producers jump in. 
"This looks a lot to me like what we had with chinchillas 20 years ago," he says. 
"We had at least three breeders here who lost all their investment." 

   But exotic-animal entrepreneurs don't look back just to be dissuaded by history. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hilyard</PERSON>'s scheme is to build a hunters' paradise. 
He plans to fence in about 100 acres of his ranch five miles north of town and hold lion hunts in the hills and gullies. 
Customers will pay (he hopes) up to <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> to stalk and shoot a male lion. 
An additional few thousand acres of land he owns eventually could be used for bighorn sheep shoots, at a fee something more like <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> a head. 

   But for the moment, the food bill is mounting for his pride of lions. 
"They go through a cow a week," says the portly 50-year-old, who has helped clean out many a local deep freezer. 
People give him pastits -- prime meat they are throwing out, also their sick cattle. 

   Meanwhile, back at the <ORGANIZATION>Big Sky Ostrich Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Howard</PERSON>, the county attorney, and <PERSON>Jerry Wiedebush</PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION>Security State Bank</ORGANIZATION>, are eagerly awaiting the birth of their first ostrich chick. 
Eggs the size of grapefruit, weighing four pounds each and gleaming like porcelain, rotate once an hour in their small wooden incubator. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Wiedebush</PERSON> got the idea to raise ostriches after reading a magazine article last year about the money to be made in breeding the big birds. 
He brought <PERSON>Mr. Howard</PERSON> in on the plan. 

   Their two ostrich hens, <PERSON>Sally</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lonnie</PERSON>, have laid more than 50 infertile eggs, much to the consternation of Plentywood's after-hours ostrich ranchers. 
Of course, even unhatched eggs aren't a total loss: Some people are willing to pay <MONEY>$35</MONEY> for one they can paint and resell as art. 

   The real potential payoff is in chicks, which can fetch <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> at the age of 10 weeks. 
The ranchers hope eventually to build a troop of 20 to 24 birds, some of which they might sell as leather and feathers. 
<PERSON>Mr. Howard</PERSON>, dodging an attempt by <PERSON>Lonnie</PERSON> to peck the glasses off his face, is among those who have noticed that the current market for chicks is almost exclusively other breeders. 

   Ostriches normally go for the warmer climates of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Near East</LOCATION>. 
Plentywood is just 18 miles south of the Canadian border. 
Nevertheless, the eight-foot-tall birds didn't appear to suffer during their first <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> winter last year, when outdoor temperatures dropped to 30 below zero. 
"We didn't even turn the heat on in the barn," he says. 
The ostrich ranchers lost one bird, however, after it swallowed a piece of ice and bled to death from the throat. 

   Plentywood got its start in animal exotica partly because of <ORGANIZATION>Walt Arion</ORGANIZATION>. 
The lean, weather-beaten rancher took up exotic game ranching eight years ago, raising small numbers of Nubian ibexes, fallow deer, yaks, bezoar goats, mouflons, buffaloes and elk. 
His ranch is named Elk Haven, but he recently sold 15 of his 26 elk to Canadian buyers as breeding stock. 
He made the sale to pay off some of what he had borrowed from banker <PERSON>Wiedebush</PERSON>, the latter-day ostrich breeder. 

   His success at finding buyers for his most exotic breeds has been mixed. 
"Everybody thinks I'm making a mint," <PERSON>Mr. Arion</PERSON> says. 
"But you don't move this stuff in a minute." 

   One of the area's largest offbeat animal outfits is south of town, where <PERSON>Robert Spokley</PERSON> and his son-in-law, <PERSON>Bill Nyby</PERSON>, tend a herd of about 100 elk. 
In the past several weeks, they have been tranquilizing their two-year-old bulls. 
The elk then are blindfolded and their velvet-covered antlers, which will sprout again next year, are sawed off. (Ranchers must take care to cut above the pedicel, the growth bud at the base of each antler; otherwise, next year's output could be seriously deformed.) 

   Buyers from <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> swing through this time of year to buy the 10- to 14-pound antlers, which ranchers keep fresh in their freezers. 
Buyers pay <MONEY>$70</MONEY> to <MONEY>$75</MONEY> a pound. 
Although in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> the antlers are ground up and used as aphrodisiacs, <PERSON>Mr. Spokley</PERSON> says, "Let's not forget they use them for medicinal purposes, too." 
He doesn't know of any in particular, but he is sure there are some. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Spokley</PERSON> said that certain elk raisers also have hunts on their property. 
He isn't interested, but not for humane reasons. 
"There's no point," he says, "in shooting an animal that will produce <MONEY>$700</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> a year for 20 years."

   In regard to your Jan. 3 page-one article "Poultry in
Motion: Breeders Sell Shares in Ostrich Market": When one
raises ostriches, as I do, you get used to people kidding
you. But you've gone way beyond humor when you compare the
ostrich to the chinchilla.
   The ostrich industry has been successful in South Africa
for a hundred years, and currently ostriches are in demand
around the world -- there are about 3,000 ranchers who raise
ostriches, emu or rhea, or all three. Those same people have
donated generously to the Ostrich/Ratite Research Foundation,
which has funded research programs at both Texas A&amp;M
University and Oklahoma State University.

arrested Thursday morning by U.S. Customs officers, a few hours before he was
allegedly due to fly out of the country on business.;    Dimitris Chaniotis,

<TEXT>     Chaniotis was charged in a complaint issued in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with
smuggling, aiding and abetting smuggling, and illegally importing wildlife
into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON>Michael Wheat.</PERSON>;    <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>
agent <PERSON>Matt Van Dyke</PERSON> called the 34-year-old Chaniotis an "orchestrator" of an
operation designed to bring valuable live ostriches and their eggs into the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>South Africa.</LOCATION>;    The arrest of Chaniotis followed two
raids last week on a farm in the <LOCATION>Almaden Valley</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, where
officers said they seized 300 eggs -- with a total value of more than <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY>
-- in addition to four ostrich chicks and five six-foot-tall adult birds.;   
The importation of foreign-raised eggs is banned by the federal government
because they can carry contagious and lethal <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION>'s disease, which,
according to Wheat, can devastate the native poultry industry.;    Chaniotis
told officers he had been involved in the legitimate ostrich business for more
than two years, exporting eggs to various countries from breeding grounds in
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, according to Van Dyke.;    Ostrich importing is
said to be a lucrative enterprise, with unhatched fertilized eggs selling for
more than <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> each, newborn chicks bringing as much as <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY>, and a
full-grown pair of mating ostriches commanding a price of <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>.;    The
government began investigating Chaniotis and the <LOCATION>Almaden Valley</LOCATION> home where
last week's seizures were made after an alleged confederate -- <PERSON>Roger Jacobson</PERSON>
-- was arrested last <DATE>October</DATE> while trying to cross the Mexican border at <LOCATION>San
Ysidro</LOCATION> with a truckload of eggs.;    According to court documents, <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON>
told officials Chaniotis had hired him to transport the eggs but instructed
him not to disclose the cargo to border officials. Chaniotis allegedly told
him that even if the contraband were discovered, officials would simply
confiscate the eggs and there would be "no criminal problem.";    If
convicted, Chaniotis could spend five years in prison and be fined up to
<MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> for each charge, said Deputy <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Atty. <PERSON>Robert Crowe</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;  
 The investigation is continuing, said Wheat.  </TEXT>

  [Text] [words indistinct] <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>'s head game warden, <PERSON>Ted 
Reilly</PERSON>, for help. <PERSON>Tom Holloway</PERSON> has the story: 
  The South African Police investigations concern flocks of 
ostriches from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> which (?smugglers) are swopping with 
ostrich flocks in <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>, but illegally exporting to <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> 
and then reexporting to lucrative markets overseas. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Reilly</PERSON> explained that as <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has the largest 
population of the most productive ostriches left in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, it 
has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted 
overseas, in order to conserve and build up <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s 
ostrich population. The fact that <LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION>'s ostrich industry has 
been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting 
and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the 
birds) by <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, have increased the value and demand for 
ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and 
racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry. 
  <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION>, however, said <PERSON>Mr. Reilly</PERSON>, does not want to be 
used 
in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well

He said he had therefore agreed to assist the <ORGANIZATION>South African

engaged in exporting ostriches to overseas markets.

<TEXT>
   Farmers seem to always be looking for ways of
adding to family income, sometimes by moonlighting in town, driving
a school bus, or by setting up roadside stands to peddle seasonal
produce.
   Sometimes a sideline can become a full-time business, one of the
alternatives to traditional crops-and-livestock farming. These days
it can include llamas, water buffalos, deer and ostriches.
   A two-day conference last week at the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>
concentrated on <ORGANIZATION>LISA</ORGANIZATION>, the acronym invented to describe ``low-input,
sustainable agriculture.'' It means producing food by using more
sense and less chemicals.
   Mostly, the meetings included case histories of farmers who have
learned or are trying to learn how to reduce expenses by using less
fertilizer, pesticides and other ``inputs'' while making a living
and improving their land.
   The LISA program is part of an overall thrust by the government,
including legislation and <MONEY>$3.9 million</MONEY> provided by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, to help
farmers _ large and small _ look at alternative systems for
producing crops and livestock.
   One of the components is the Office for Small-Scale Agriculture,
which is operated by <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Cooperative State Research Service</ORGANIZATION>. For
some time, the office has been grinding out one-sheet reports about
the alternatives available to small producers.
   Some of the previous topics include sheep, goats, mushrooms,
foliage plants, herbs, wildflowers and specialty vegetables.
   The latest one-sheeter, prepared by editor <PERSON>George B. Holcomb</PERSON>, is
``Exotic Livestock.'' And the report begins by asking about beefalo,
the crossbred critter of beef and buffalo origins that stirred
imaginations a few years back.
   ``Where's the beefalo? It's still around, but the excitement is
gone,'' the report said. ``Such a query arises because introduction
of exotic types of creatures into a country where they are scarce
encourages speculators to bid prices extremely high.''
   In that case, breeding stock becomes the focus rather than the
basic use of the animal for meat, work, hide, fur or feathers.
   But American consumers, affluent and with sometimes incredible
appetites for exotic menu items, can exert powerful influence.
   For example, the <ORGANIZATION>Food Safety and Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s
agency that oversees inspection of meat and poultry, has changed its
rules to include reindeer, elk, antelope, water buffalo and deer as
``exotic'' animals.
   Previously, the agency's exotic list included only American
bison, or buffalo, and cattalo or beefalo.
   Officials say fewer than 2,000 ``exotic'' animals are slaughtered
annually in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, compared with more than 32 million
cattle each year.
   But because of rising demand from restaurants, small-scale
producers of exotic animals are finding it profitable to market
federally inspected meat from certain species, the report said.
   Meanwhile, there has been a growing demand for other exotic
animals, and sometimes the prices are sky-high.
   ``For the moment, the biggest dollar demand is for such exotics
as ostriches and South American humpless camels such as llamas,
alpacas, guanacos and vicunas,'' the report said. ``Little demand is
noted for <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>'s yaks or musk oxen.''
   According to a quarterly publication, <ORGANIZATION>Llama Life</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>1987</DATE> a
company called <ORGANIZATION>Camelids Inc.</ORGANIZATION> sold 52 male and female llamas at an
estimated cost of more than <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>. One buyer paid <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> each
for two breeding males.
   ``Some people predict that 3,500 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> owners of 12,000 llamas
will begin to price themselves out of the market, even if camelid
wool is sought by handspinners and weavers, and the pack animals are
used in sorts of fund-raising events,'' the report said.
   Llamas, fabled pack animals in the Andes of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, are
often used for that purpose by the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> when
venturing into wilderness areas because they are less intrusive on
the environment than horses and mules.
   Unlike llamas, water buffalos aren't in great demand, the report
said. But there has been commercial herd development in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> since <DATE>1978</DATE>. There are two types, both used for work and meat:
the swamp buffalo, or carabao, which is rarely used for milk, and
the river buffalo, which is noted for its milk.
   Breeds of the river buffalo are commonly found in the temperate
climates of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>, some areas
of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and in cold, mountainous areas of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>.
   ``<LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> countries are beginning to catch on to their
value,'' the report said. ``About 18 different breeds of both types
can work in tropical mud that can bog down a tractor. One of these
animals can work as many as 20 years.''
   The European fallow deer is another farming possibility on the
exotic side. Currently, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> restaurants import 500 to 1,000 tons of
venison annually, mostly from <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>. But a problem with deer
and elk is that a fence about seven feet high is needed to keep the
animals under control, a major expense in getting started.
   <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, which has about 2,000 deer farms, still imports
more than 20,000 tons of venison annually, the report said.
   If large poultry is preferred, try ostriches. There are several
ostrich ranches in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, dating back to <DATE>1981</DATE>, the report said.
Pairs of breeding size adults bring <MONEY>$12,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> each,
depending on age and quality. Chicks at last report cost <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> each
at eight weeks, when sex can be distinguished.

<HEAD>Federal Wildlife Officials to Split Whooping Crane Colony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUREL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wildlife officials plan to split the world's
only captive colony of whooping cranes in <DATE>November</DATE> to reduce the
chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural disaster.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> said 22 of the 54 birds at
the <ORGANIZATION>Patuxent Wildlife Research Center</ORGANIZATION> would be shipped to the
<ORGANIZATION>International Crane Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baraboo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis</LOCATION>. Whooping cranes are
an endangered species.
   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs
in one basket, literally,'' said <PERSON>David Trauger</PERSON>, the center's deputy
director. ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to
separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do
that.''
   The center started in <DATE>1987</DATE> to breed the birds, known for their
elaborate courtship dance, under a joint program with Canadian
wildlife officials.
   The foundation was selected as the home of the new flock after
considering several groups around the nation. Although it has not
bred whooping cranes, it has successfully bred 13 of the 14 other
crane species.
   Scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in
captivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the
wild. An attempt to do that failed in <DATE>1975</DATE> when a flock at the
<ORGANIZATION>Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> failed to produce
enough eggs to sustain the colony.

<TEXT>
<P>
One sells ostrich eggs while another tantalizes passers-by with live <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> 
lobster. 
</P>
<P>
One hawks gourmet vegetables to the rich and famous throughout <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION>, while another practically gives away whatever produce its owner, a 
happy retiree, feels like picking that day -- if he feels like picking at all. 
</P>
<P>
Still another offers to repair your shoes while you browse among the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
From the sublime to the, well, unusual, these are <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION>'s roadside 
stands. Where the countryside beckons from ubiquitous orange and green signs. 
Where freshness can sometimes be measured in hours, not days or weeks. Where 
you can get to know the people behind the produce. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the roadside stand thing is getting popular because it's good for both 
the farmer and the customer," says <PERSON>Mike Hillebrecht</PERSON>, who, with his sisters and 
parents, runs and supplies The Farm Stand off <LOCATION>San Pasqual Valley Road</LOCATION> on the 
way to the Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers get better quality -- at least fresher than grocery stores. Plus, 
people like to get a little drive out in the country. But you gotta sell good 
stuff or they won't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Produce stands run the gamut, from open-air shacks that loyal customers have 
frequented for decades to corn-filled trucks you flag down. Some stands attract 
their clientele with exotic arrays of <ORGANIZATION>Mother Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s bounty. Things like purple 
"green beans," golden or striped beets, yellow cherry tomatoes, countless 
varieties of squash and lettuce and Israeli breakfast melons. 
</P>
<P>
Others rely on good locations, such as the stands on the way to the Wild Animal 
Park. <ORGANIZATION>Echigo Farms</ORGANIZATION>, at <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 78 and <LOCATION>San Pasqual Road</LOCATION>, relies on that 
traffic for its consistent crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Still other stands count on that one scrumptious product to inspire such fierce 
loyalty among its tasters that they will drive miles to buy it. Every stand 
wants a customer like <PERSON>Ray Anderson</PERSON>, 60, who drives from <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION> 
nearly twice a week. His wife, it seems, has a hankering for strawberries from 
<ORGANIZATION>Uchimura Farms</ORGANIZATION>, known as the "Airport Strawberry Stand," for its proximity to 
the <LOCATION>Fallbrook Airport</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only place we'll buy strawberries," says <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, an equipment 
operator who worked in <LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION> years ago. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, freshness is the biggest draw to roadside stands, customers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to have fresh vegetables," says <PERSON>You Young</PERSON>, who helps his father 
with the family farm in <LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION> while on <DATE>summer</DATE> break from college. 
</P>
<P>
You's commitment to freshness is so strong that when friends and customers 
suggested putting a stand in front of their Oriental vegetable farm on Mission 
Road, he nixed the idea. Instead, he put a sign up notifying customers what 
produce is available. They drive in, tell You or his father what they want, and 
wait while the two men pull the vegetables from the ground, wash and bag them. 
</P>
<P>
"If I (put in a stand) and pick it all in the <TIME>morning</TIME>, it's not that fresh," 
You says. "So why don't you come in and wait 15 minutes?" 
</P>
<P>
La Costa resident <PERSON>Tricia Cerda</PERSON> says freshness, whether the produce is picked 
that moment or that day, makes a world of difference to the taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's picked when it's ready to eat, so it tastes so much better," says <PERSON>Cerda</PERSON>, 
who stops at Gourmet Gardens in <LOCATION>San Marcos</LOCATION> whenever she visits a friend in 
<LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION>. "In the supermarkets, who knows how long it's been in storage. With 
this, you know it's fresh, and that's the No. 1 thing." 
</P>
<P>
Gourmet Gardens picks daily from the family-operated farm directly behind the 
stand on <ORGANIZATION>Sycamore Drive</ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON>Mary Borevitz</PERSON>, who runs the family stand. When 
they sell out, that's it for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Borevitzes don't sell anything they don't grow, and that's the way it's 
supposed to work for those with "free farmer" permits from the <ORGANIZATION>Consumer Food 
Protection</ORGANIZATION> division of the county <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health Services</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Environmental 
Health Services</ORGANIZATION>. That's the designation of most roadside stands, says <PERSON>Tim 
Tillyer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> district supervisor. Others buy permits from the county 
that allow them to sell goods grown by other farmers. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of stands with "free farmer" designation (meaning their permits 
cost nothing) sell more than their own produce, Tillyer says. The clerk at one 
stand, for example, boasted about the asparagus from <LOCATION>Walla Walla</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, while 
others offer bananas with stickers from <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"The public health concern is we don't have an idea of where the produce has 
come from, and we don't know who has handled it or how," <PERSON>Tillyer</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
The produce could come from back yards sprayed with excessive doses of 
pesticides; it could come from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and carry fruit flies; it 
could have been handled in an unclean way or near sewage. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be good, or it might not be," he says. "We don't have a way of 
knowing. And that's our biggest problem." 
</P>
<P>
On their inspection rounds, Tillyer and his inspectors have discovered some of 
the more unusual offerings at <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION>'s roadside stands. For example, 
you'll find Girl Scout cookies out of season at <ORGANIZATION>Valley Produce</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>3400</DATE> 
block of <LOCATION>East Valley Parkway</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Perrydise Farms, <DATE>1920</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>S. El Camino Real</ORGANIZATION>, used to offer live <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> lobster every 
weekend to go with its assortment of vegetables and fruits. But proprietor <PERSON>Dave 
Perry</PERSON> said the arrangement became too burdensome and took away from the farm 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what we were doing," he says. "We're farmers." 
</P>
<P>
Once, overestimating his market, he ordered 200 lobsters. Only half of them 
sold. "We got tired of eating them," he says. "We had to throw a party just to 
get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
But Perrydise Farms still will special order from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> for customers who 
request it. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're the efficient type who likes one-stop shopping, take a trip to 
<ORGANIZATION>Veltri Shoe Repair and Fruit Stand in Valley Center</ORGANIZATION>. You can even get keys made 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad retired from (the shoe repair business in) Orange County 20 years ago," 
says <PERSON>Carmine Veltri</PERSON>. It just so happened that the land onto which he moved his 
house and all his shoe repair equipment came with 11 acres of orange trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 20 years, we've planted all kinds of trees. So it basically evolved into 
a fruit stand." 
</P>
<P>
The prize for most unusual roadside stand would have to go to the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
Ostrich Farm's stand off <LOCATION>San Pasqual Road</LOCATION> on the way to the Wild Animal Park. 
As you drive into the stand, ostriches on either side of the road gather to 
look at you curiously. Don't get too friendly with these birds, though. Signs 
all around warn: "Beware, we bite." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, you'll find, among other things, arrays of plain and painted ostrich 
eggshells. They're about 7 inches high with exteriors as tough and brittle as 
ceramic. Owners <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> and <PERSON>Phil Sargent</PERSON> enjoy plying their customers with fun 
facts about the huge birds. 
</P>
<P>
For example: one ostrich egg is equivalent to two dozen chicken eggs, though at 
<MONEY>$30</MONEY>, it costs 10 times as much; an ostrich will lay about 100 eggs a year, with 
about a <PERCENT>50 %</PERCENT> survival rate; males and females take turns sitting on the egg; 
and, soft boiling one ostrich egg would take an hour, plus you need an ax to 
open it. 
</P>
<P>
The Sargents also will tell you that before too long, ostrich meat will rival 
beef. Ostriches, the largest birds in the world, aren't endangered, and they 
breed rapidly, <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> says. The meat is soft, tender and red like a filet, 
and it's low in cholesterol and fat. "They're going to be farmed like cattle," 
she predicts. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not ready for ostrich omelets or bird beef, you can always purchase 
ostrich plume pens, feather dusters, <MONEY>$300</MONEY> ostrich skin purses or feather boas. 
</P>
<P>
Then you can wear them to the swankest roadside stand in the county: The 
Vegetable Shop, known simply as "Chino's." 
</P>
<P>
Located in an unassuming mustard-colored shed outside of <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> (at 
<ORGANIZATION>Via de Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Calzada del Bosque</ORGANIZATION>), Chino's has been a household name 
among the well to do since <DATE>1969</DATE>. On any given morning, a consistent flow of 
<ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jaguars</ORGANIZATION> and the occasional Rolls <PERSON>Royce</PERSON> line up to select from gourmet 
vegetables plucked that very morning from the fields beyond the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gourmet Gardens in <LOCATION>San Marcos</LOCATION>, Chino's is constantly trying new varieties 
of vegetables. This year, for example, the farm will produce more than 20 
varieties of lettuce. Customers sometimes even bring seeds for the farm to try 
out. <PERSON>Gil Smith</PERSON>, a 68-year-old designer from <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, once brought a 
seed from a large Italian pepper that he tasted and loved in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a lot of special stuff once in a while that you can't find anywhere 
else," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants such as the star-studded <ORGANIZATION>Spago</ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and others also buy 
from Chino's. 
</P>
<P>
Success, however, has forced the family to cut back on some of its intimacy. 
One <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> regular remembered a time when he and other longtime 
customers received a Christmas gift package with homemade jams, pickles and 
other goodies. There's just no time for that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Time is one commodity (<LOCATION>Grandpa</LOCATION>) <PERSON>Bob Edwards</PERSON> has aplenty. And the 63-year-old 
proprietor of <LOCATION>Grandpa</LOCATION>'s Organic Grown roadside stand in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> is not about to 
let go of it. 
</P>
<P>
He raises crops on the 2 acres surrounding his Vista home, selling only what he 
and his wife don't eat. There's no telling what you'll find on any given day. 
Could be rhubarb, or okra, or lima beans or giant sweet onions. 
</P>
<P>
To "make math easy" and get around the need for a government-certified scale, 
<PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> packages his vegetables into <MONEY>$1</MONEY> bags. The bags go out onto a small, 
shaded cart outside his house on <ORGANIZATION>Monte Vista Road</ORGANIZATION>. He trusts his customers to 
abide by the honor system and deposit their money into the slot marked "Pay 
here. Thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> enjoys his retirement from a tattered chair in his cluttered 
garage within eyesight of the stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I put it out when I feel like it, and I take it in when I feel like it," says 
<PERSON>Edwards</PERSON>, who sports ragged red suspenders and a belt with a huge buckle made of 
buffalo nickels. "Sometimes I leave it out all night when I forget." 
</P>
<P>
Those nights are the only times <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> has been stiffed. Of course, he does 
get a few IOUs and other strange forms of payment. Like food stamps, or the 
note last year from someone who signed "Love, Stacey." 
</P>
<P>
"Here is 5,000 pesos," <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> reads from the note, which he has tacked to the 
bulletin board in his garage. "It's all that I have, but it's worth a little 
over <MONEY>$2.50</MONEY> in American dollars. Here is also a cartoon for your refrigerator. 
Thank you!" Business certainly isn't brisk at <LOCATION>Grandpa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Organic Grown</ORGANIZATION>. Nor is 
it at the majority of <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> vegetable stands. <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> has pondered the 
reasons and thinks he knows why more people don't take advantage of the 
freshness available at stands. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace is too fast," he says. "It's more convenient to go to a (grocery 
store) produce counter. This is a little more trouble for some to drive around 
and get what they're after." 
</P>
<P>
But if freshness, down-home hospitality and perhaps a drive in the country is 
what you're after, <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION>'s roadside stands are waiting for you.

<HEAD>States Cutting Food Program for Women and Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State governments, squeezed hard by rising
milk, orange juice and cereal prices, are making cuts in a
federally funded program that furnishes food to needy women,
infants and children.
   Thirty-six of 44 state governments responding to a recent survey
said they were cutting their portions of the <MONEY>$2.1 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Special
Supplemental Food Program for Women</ORGANIZATION>, Infants and Children, also
known as <LOCATION>WIC</LOCATION>.
   The survey was taken by the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of WIC</ORGANIZATION>
directors.
   Rep. <PERSON>Tony P. Hall</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House Select
Committee on Hunger</ORGANIZATION>, said a survey by his panel came up with
virtually the same results.
   ``It means we won't have as many healthy children and mothers as
we wanted because all of these people are medically at risk for
malnutrition and anemia,'' said <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>.
   The program provides poor women and their youngsters with
vouchers redeemable at the grocery store for specific kinds of food
in stated amounts. Included are milk, cheese, cereal, juice and
infant formula.
   It provided food to a record high 4.55 million individuals in
<DATE>February</DATE>.
   The program has been a favorite with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, which has
increased its funding every year despite demands for cutbacks in
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> era. Hall is seeking a <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> increase annually
for the next five years, with the first installment coming <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE>.
   The extra funds once were envisioned as a way of expanding the
program but supporters now are doubtful. ``If we stay even, we'll
be lucky,'' <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said.
   Rising prices for milk, and to a lesser degree, orange juice and
cereal, have been pinpointed as the prime sources of the budgetary
strain.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION>'s food and nutrition service had
figured on inflation in food prices this year of a little over <PERCENT>4
percent</PERCENT>. Authorities said the cost of basic items have risen at
about double the expected rate. Thus, grants to the states have not
been enough to maintain benefit levels.
   States have found varying ways to economize.
   ``We've talked to the states about the first measure being to
find less expensive ways to provide the same nutrition without
cutting volume of food or nutritional value of food,'' said <PERSON>F.
Philip Shanholtzer</PERSON>, a spokesman for the food and nutritional
service.
   <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> has cut the cereal allowance for 1-year-olds and
2-year-olds from 36 ounces a month to 24 ounces a month and will
drop 27,000 program participants. Those receiving benefits reached
a peak of 357,000 in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   ``When prices go up on food items, that means our budget won't
go as far and we have to serve fewer people,'' said <PERSON>Ray Krzesniak</PERSON>,
chief of staff services for the <ORGANIZATION>Health Department</ORGANIZATION>'s bureau of
women, infants and children.
   Texas gets <MONEY>$148 million</MONEY> from <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> under the program as well as
<MONEY>$5.5 million</MONEY> in state funds plus a hefty rebate on each can of
infant formula.
   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> is planning to end benefits for post-partum
women who are not breast-feeding. That would drop an estimated
4,000 participants and reduce the total of individuals receiving
benefits to 45,000 for a <MONEY>$400,000</MONEY> savings.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> plans to cut the monthly juice allotment for children
3 years old to 5 years old for an expected savings of <MONEY>$1.2 million</MONEY>.
It also hopes to save <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> by eliminating vouchers for cheese.
   Currently only about half of those eligible are receiving
benefits, according to <PERSON>Bach</PERSON>. Many states are not able to provide
food to individuals who fall into the lowest priority categories.
   ``There are literally millions of young children who would
qualify for <ORGANIZATION>WIC</ORGANIZATION> who are not getting served,'' <PERSON>Bach</PERSON> said.

EGGSHELLS MAY HELP CRACK MYSTERIES OF HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: A NEW TECHNIQUE USING SHELLS CAN DETERMINE THE AGE OF A SITE UNDER 
STUDY. THE METHOD HAS ALREADY DETERMINED MODERN HUMANS EXISTED IN AFRICA FAR 
EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED.

<P>
Ostrich eggshells are among the most commonly found objects at archeological 
sites in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. Primitive humans used the eggs as food and the shells for 
water containers, bowls and beads. 
</P>
<P>
Now, archeologists may find them even more valuable for understanding the 
history of early humans. 
</P>
<P>
A team of researchers headed by paleoanthropologist <PERSON>Allison S. Brooks</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>George 
Washington University</ORGANIZATION> and geophysicist <PERSON>P. Edward Hare</PERSON> of the Carnegie 
Institution of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> reported recently in the journal Science that the 
slow decomposition of proteins in the eggshells can be used to date 
archeological sites, particularly in the range of 40,000 to 100,000 years ago 
-- a period for which there are few usable dating techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies with ostrich-eggshell dating at two African sites indicate 
that modern humans were present earlier than had previously been believed. 
</P>
<P>
One particular advantage of the new technique is that it is inexpensive, so 
that a large number of objects at a site can be dated to determine if artifacts 
from different time periods have been jumbled together by weather, flooding or 
excavations -- a problem that occurs frequently. "That is one of the things I 
am most excited about," <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggshell dating relies on a physical process called amino acid racemization. 
Amino acids are the individual molecules from which proteins are formed. In 
nature, virtually all amino acids are present in only one of two possible 
spatial configurations, called D and L, that have a three-dimensional 
relationship to each other, similar to the relationship of the right hand to 
the left. 
</P>
<P>
After an animal's death, the L amino acids will slowly undergo a chemical 
change to the D-form until a 50-50 mixture of the two forms is present. The 
rate of this change is constant at any temperature, so by measuring the ratio 
of D and L amino acids, researchers can determine how long ago the organism 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers such as <PERSON>Jeffrey Bada</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Oceanographic Institution</ORGANIZATION> in La 
Jolla originally tried to use this technique to date human and animal bones, 
but they encountered great difficulties. Indigenous amino acids are readily 
leached out of the bones by water, and the bones are easily contaminated by 
amino acids from other sources. Hence, the technique produces unreliable dates 
and it has been largely discredited. 
</P>
<P>
The Science paper thus represents a rebirth of sorts for the technique. 
</P>
<P>
The chief advantage of the eggshells is that the protein they contained is 
locked into position by the mineral portion of the shell, so it does not easily 
leach out and contaminants do not easily get in. 
</P>
<P>
Hare and his colleagues have done a series of tests with contemporary ostrich 
eggshells, heating them in the absence of water and determining the rate at 
which one amino acid, called L-isoleucine, is converted into its D analog. They 
found that this racemization reaction proceeds at a steady, predictable rate 
that can be used for dating as long as it is compared to materials of known age 
at a given site. 
</P>
<P>
In the tropics, <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> and Hare report, the technique can be used to date 
objects as old as 200,000 years. In cooler climates, such as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, it can be 
used on objects 1 million years old. 
</P>
<P>
The team has already been using the technique at African sites. At Ashango in 
<LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION>, for example, researchers have excavated skeletal fragments "which are 
essentially similar to skeletons of modern <LOCATION>East Africans</LOCATION>, so they were thought 
to be fairly recent," <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said. Dating of eggshells found with them, 
however, shows that the bones are at least 25,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologist <PERSON>Gifford H. Miller</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, who 
is also a member of the team, has been studying the remains of unquestionably 
modern humans taken from the Border Cave on the east coast of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. He 
found that the eggshells from the site were about 77,000 years old, providing 
strong additional evidence that modern humans originated in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, not on some 
other continent as some researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Although ostriches are most common in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, ostrich eggs have also been found 
in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> and would be useful for dating there. Moreover, the 
research team has found that every other type of bird egg they have studied 
gives similar results, so those types of shells can be used as well. They are 
now beginning to study owl eggs, which are found at many archeological sites in 
<LOCATION>Northern Europe</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Other archeologists are beginning to recognize the importance of the eggshells, 
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said. "When I started talking to archeologists, I learned that the 
damned stuff's everywhere," but that people were in the habit of tossing it 
aside as uninteresting. Now, he said, "they are getting keyed in and saving 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DATING TECHNIQUES FOR ARTIFACTS 
</P>
<P>
Carbon-14 dating is good for assesing the age of items from the present to 
40,000 years ago. Another commonly used technique, potassium-argon dating, is 
good for artifacts 300,000 years old or older. Dating of ostrich eggshells can 
fill the gap between and is important because that is a period when modern 
humans were first emerging. It is particularly useful in the range of 40,000 to 
100,000 years ago -- a period for which there are few usable dating techniques. 
In tropic climates, it can be used to date objects as old as 200,000 years. In 
cooler climates, it can be used on objects 1 million years old.

Vegetarians Need Not Apply

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Nairobi, Kenya  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few years back an <ORGANIZATION>Overseas Press Club</ORGANIZATION> parody of <ORGANIZATION>Playboy Magazine</ORGANIZATION> offered the following response to a mythical foreign correspondent's query about what beverage to serve with wildebeest: "Any good brown wine will do." 

   Unmindful of that nostrum, a recent photo-safari party settling down for dinner at <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>'s aptly named and celebrated meat restaurant Carnivore, washed down their exotic cuts of game with large quantities of Tusker beer. 
This is <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s native brew and it does have a carnivorous past. 
By legend, <ORGANIZATION>Tusker</ORGANIZATION>'s much-despised founder was gored by an elephant much like the prancing pachyderm on the label. 

   Shortly after the beer arrives comes a plate, not of elephant, but nearly. 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>, resplendent in a red-and-blue apron labeled "Carver," brings a gigantic spearlike skewer over to the table, plunks its point down on a plate, and asks: "Ostrich?" 
He carves a charbroiled hunk, deftly removes his spear without further loss of life, and announces "ostrich" gaily at each place before shaving some off with a fierce-looking blade. 
Barely has the big bird been digested -- it tastes like a cross between lamb and turkey, and is greatly helped by a little mint sauce -- than <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> is back, with another spear and the announcement: "Zebra." 

   The Carnivore, like several other restaurants here, is the place for gourmands seeking what might be called gnu-velle cuisine, people likely to ask "where's the beast?" 

   Actually, most of the game meats served with some regularity in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> are farmed for that purpose, with some supplementing from animals culled from overpopulated herds. 
Some of the meat on <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>'s skewer may also have come from poachers, although these days most poaching isn't done for food, but rather for commodities like elephant tusks or rhino horns. 

   Such fancy food is naturally a sensitive subject in places where there often isn't any food of any kind. 
But like most of the rest of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> has recovered from the 1982-1984 drought, and markets in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION> now abound with home-grown corn, pineapple and oranges. 
Fields and meadows seem full of sheep and cows, which some tribesmen keep in order to drink the animals' blood, and others consume in more-familiar ways. 

   The state-influenced newspapers abound with arguments about whether it's better to grow more cash crops like coffee and sisal or more food crops, with food usually winning. 
There is also a debate on the merits of raising camels for milk and meat, rather than grass-chomping cows and sheep, as a way of keeping back the encroaching desert. 

   One of the problems the government here is having, however, is that so many Kenyans have acquired a taste for hamburger that they won't switch to humpburger. 
Indeed, these days most munching of exotic species is left to us tourists and Western expatriates who crowd the Carnivore and its ilk most nights. 

   The Carnivore gets its roast beast from neighboring farms, though not, the owners hasten to say, from the neighboring <ORGANIZATION>Nairobi National Park</ORGANIZATION> game reserve. 
Entrepreneurs have begun cultivating such exotica as crocodile croquettes, which South African exporter <ORGANIZATION>Magnus Penny</ORGANIZATION> swears tastes "a little like lobster," and giraffe pate, which doesn't. 

   But it's not so much the taste of these things that distinguishes one from the other, since the Carnivore's vast, open-pit fire, over which the meat is cooked, imparts an overpowering charcoal taste to everything. 
It's more a matter of consistency, with the meats roughly divisible into those that can be cut with a very sharp knife and those that require a chainsaw. 

   In the former category fall both ostrich and zebra. 
In the latter falls hartebeest, which is really more appropriate for shoes than for stews. 
In a category all its own is what <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> calls "rabbit" but that may be hare, and whatever it is resists being dented by any known cutting implement. 
Richard, a nine-year-old from <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, wrestles gamely with his rabbit for a while, and then slips it under the outdoor table to the restaurant's massive gray cat, which doesn't seem to have much luck with it either. 

   Joseph brings over the next spear and declares: "Kidney." 
By this time, beginning to catch on, the table asks as one: "of what?" (Of ox, it turns out, and <PERSON>Bob</PERSON>, a banker from <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> and father of <LOCATION>Richard</LOCATION>, eats four.) 

   For a fixed price of <MONEY>$11.50</MONEY>, the <ORGANIZATION>Carnivore</ORGANIZATION>'s menu also contains such prosaic offerings as beef, lamb and pork, all of which get the roasting and spear treatment, too, and which keep coming until you beg <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> to stop. 
There is a <PERSON>Lazy Susan</PERSON> of a dozen sauces, fresh-baked loaves of bread and assorted salads. 

   And there is a wine list. 
Nothing in brown, but there is a <MONEY>$10</MONEY> bottle of something called Papaya Wine. 
They say it marries beautifully with the saddle of jackal. 
Another Tusker, please.

EMU KEY TO MILLION-DOLLAR EXPORT VISION

"Emus are the dumbest animals put on this planet, but never stand in front of 
them or they'll rip you open," said <PERSON>Steven Hawker</PERSON>, sporting the scars to prove 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Hawker, who manages the <ORGANIZATION>Kalaya Emu</ORGANIZATION> Farm nine miles out of remote Cue in the 
middle of <LOCATION>Western Australia</LOCATION>, said farming the tall, ungainly, native birds is 
normally easy work -- except during mating season. 
</P>
<P>
"They get quite aggressive during mating season and often kill each other," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have to pair them you've got to make sure you're standing behind them 
or they'll try to kick you -- and they can open you up from head to toe." 
</P>
<P>
But Hawker is hoping that what the flightless emu may lack in intelligence, it 
will make up for in other ways on the export market. 
</P>
<P>
For the <DATE>last two years Hawker</DATE> and a group of local Aborigines have been raising 
the 6-foot-6 emus with the intention of selling their meat overseas as a 
delicacy, their leather hides for fashion garments or book binding, and their 
oil for use in cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the first emu steak graces the plate of an upscale restaurant in 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>, <MONEY>$150,000</MONEY> will have been injected into the farm. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on land above a vast artesian spring system, <ORGANIZATION>Kalaya</ORGANIZATION>'s 1,000 acres are 
a plush green oasis in this arid and dusty land, boasting date trees and grape 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
"You can grow anything here provided you have the water, and we have the 
water," said <PERSON>Hawker</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Kalaya's unique natural resources have placed it at the vanguard of the 
embryonic emu farming industry in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are involved in a major expansion operation here. We hope to have 2,000 
birds by the end of the year thanks to two incubators we've ordered," <PERSON>Hawker</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 17 licensed emu farms across <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> supporting an 
estimated 4,000 birds. 
</P>
<P>
This year about 1,000 emus will be slaughtered purely for market research. The 
industry's first commercial cull will come in <DATE>1992</DATE>, when an estimated 11,000 to 
15,000 birds will be killed for domestic and export consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is at a critical stage," said <PERSON>Noel Fallon</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Emu 
Farmers' Assn.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got great potential but it needs to be carefully managed to avoid 
overproduction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> said an initial overproduction and fall in prices is inevitable, but he 
hoped prices, now currently <MONEY>$150</MONEY> a bird, will not fall much below <MONEY>$98</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it (the industry) gets up on its feet I think it will survive quite well, 
but we must first overcome that trough that besets any sunrise industry," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>1997</DATE> the industry hopes to be exporting 80,000 birds annually and earning 
just under <MONEY>$12 million</MONEY> in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> have all expressed interest with the industry, but the 
Asian market remains largely untapped," <PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Fallon</PERSON> said the industry is being modeled on the ostrich industry in <LOCATION>South 
Africa</LOCATION>, where a farmers co-operative issues quotas to both producers and buyers 
and monitors quality control. 
</P>
<P>
Farming emus is not hard work -- like sheep, the long-legged emus are docile 
creatures and can be easily worked. 
</P>
<P>
Pairs of mature birds are kept in small pens while mating. Once the eggs have 
been laid they are taken to incubators and the mature emus herded into larger 
paddocks containing a few dozen birds. 
</P>
<P>
Emu chicks are nursed in separate pens as the mature birds leave them to their 
own devices once they are old enough to walk and leave the nest. 
</P>
<P>
Fully grown birds, their bulbous bodies weighing between 99 and 110 pounds, 
will yield 33 pounds of meat, 10.7 square feet of leather and 1.3 gallons of 
oil.

   Wildlife conservationists here have been hawking a board game devised by the "Save the Rhino" campaign. 
Next year they may well be urging us to buy elephant-ivory necklaces and crocodile-skin handbags. 
For when <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION> are allowed to make souvenirs and money out of wild animals legally, they become keen to protect them. 
And conventional conservationist tactics are not working; many large African mammals remain endangered. 
In <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, a country long respected for its well-run national parks, 13 rhinoceroses on average are being taken out each week. 
Why? 

   The simple answer is: money. 
Poaching continues because park officials in most African countries haven't the resources to adequately police their reserves, and because those in some countries are bribable. 
Africa's safari/tourism community is still enraged over events in the <LOCATION>Masai Mara</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> when Kenyan officials allowed a hunting party of influential <ORGANIZATION>Middle Easterners</ORGANIZATION> to shoot dozens of buffalo, antelope and elephant in an obscene recreation of the days of the great white hunters -- right down to the group photograph with carcasses. 

   The more profound answer behind the simple one is also money. 
For the great mass of <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION>, simple rural people, protecting wild animals doesn't pay. 
Never mind about long-term benefits and priceless ecosystems. 
Wild animals are simply a nuisance, eating up crops and occasionally small children, and competing with cattle for grazing space. 
Poachers often pay off local people to warn them when park rangers are about, so if protecting wild animals doesn't pay, endangering them sure does. 
And for chronically undernourished people, knocking off the odd impala seems a justifiable (and delicious) way to avoid hunger. 

   The wildlife industry is reckoned to be worth between <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> and <MONEY>$200 million</MONEY> annually in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>. 
Tourism and related souvenir industries keep <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> ticking over. 
Hunting safaris in particular earn whopping revenues for African governments. 
One can shop around -- a license to shoot an elephant costs <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, almost <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> -- but the combined costs of safari, fees and "trophy" processing usually come to more than <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> for a two-week jaunt. 

   Most African governments pay lip service but not much else to the principle of plowing those hunting revenues back into the rural communities. 
In <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, where records are actually kept, from <DATE>1982</DATE> to <DATE>1987</DATE> the central government handed back only <PERCENT>49.5%</PERCENT> of the revenue generated from wildlife to a fairly representative district, <LOCATION>Nyaminyami</LOCATION>, along <LOCATION>Lake Kariba</LOCATION> in the northwestern corner of the country. 

   A group of local councilors and residents called the <ORGANIZATION>Nyaminyami Wildlife Trust</ORGANIZATION> -- with more than a little help from the Save the Children Fund and other aid groups -- are trying to return the benefits of wildlife "to those who directly bear the costs," i.e. themselves. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Zimbabwe Trust</ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of foreign firms with blocked funds to spend, is helping them. 

   The <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> trust is proposing local management of the area's wildlife resources. 
Not just hunting revenues are desired, but also game-ranching projects, locally based cooperative tanneries, meat-processing facilities and souvenir workshops. 
Intensive farming of fish, crocodiles and ostriches is envisaged. 
For example, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of National Parks</ORGANIZATION> recently estimated ostrich farming alone could become a <MONEY>$20 million</MONEY> export business. 

   There are naysayers on grounds of principle. 
Wildlife film maker <PERSON>Hugo van Lawick</PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION>Serengeti</LOCATION>, says licensed hunting has provided a cover for poachers in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>. 
Others object to crocodile and ostrich farms, saying that the animals are penned up, overcrowded and badly treated. 

   The Nyaminyami trust is pitted against a formidable opponent, the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>. 
In <DATE>1985</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> began a <MONEY>$170 million</MONEY>, 10-year program to eradicate the tsetse fly in southern <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. 
Though many <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION> are beginning to question the wisdom of producing and exporting beef to a <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with a beef mountain, high investments in cattle ranching must be protected from re-infestation by the pest. 

   It is impossible to eradicate the tsetse fly from ranching areas and not from adjacent lands. 
As more and more tracts of marginal bushland are relieved of the fly they are also being relieved of their wildlife, trees, ground cover and topsoil. 
One simply can't prevent rural Africans from moving, with their ravenous cattle, onto lands too poor to support heavy grazing once the threat of bovine sleeping sickness is removed. 
The zooming population growth of most African countries ensures a constant pressure on land already yielding to the processes of desertification. 

   The noisy protests of the trust and other conservation groups seem finally to have reached the ears of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials, who recently earmarked <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY> to support efforts to keep cattle out, and wildlife in, some parts of the areas involving tsetse eradication. 

   Wild animals are more efficient producers of protein on poor lands, says the trust -- not that the fine balance between wildlife grazing and the carrying capacity of the land is always maintained. 
In northern <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>, where the poor quality of their ivory protects elephants from poachers, the elephant population is out of control and has eaten and knocked down many square miles of scrubby forest. 

   On an increasingly crowded and impoverished continent, clearly, wildlife has to be "managed" if it is to be saved. 
By at least thinking about giving incentives to local people to conserve wildlife, the Nyaminyami trust is moving in the right direction. 
Yet so far the trust seems plagued, like many development projects, with rather woolly ideas about the mechanics of making wildlife pay and contains rather too much talk of cooperatives. 

   Of course, the trust would not want to increase inequalities in wealth by putting resources into any private individual's hands (though it is working to secure tenure over land and the natural resources on it for local chiefs for the benefit of their communities). 
However, to date the most successful "harvesting" of wildlife has been in the private sector, such as at the crocodile farm at <ORGANIZATION>Victoria Falls</ORGANIZATION>. 

   People in other wild parts of the world are realizing conservation can pay. 
Fishermen on the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>St. Lucia</LOCATION> have set aside land for a nature reserve and agreed among themselves on new fishing practices to save endangered reptiles and fish -- and the fishermen's livelihoods. 
In <LOCATION>Annapurna</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>, villagers have regained control over local woodlands after 30 years of government mismanagement left them with tragically depleted forests and a shortage of firewood. 

   "Managing" wildlife for the common good rather than "protecting" it for government ministers' pockets seems the only hope. 
One hopes the common good is up to the job. 
In the <LOCATION>Okavango</LOCATION>, a team of government rangers sent out for the common good to destroy a sick and dangerous elephant spent two weeks accomplishing nothing. 
The night I was there, poachers working only for their own good and the tusks, neatly did away with the poor creature with one shot.

<TEXT>     But don't think everyday hen eggs -- they break too easily. Instead, egg
artists like <PERSON>Carlene Voss</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Union City</LOCATION> use ostrich eggs, goose eggs, emu
eggs, rhea eggs, mallard eggs.;    The largest one she owns is a hefty green,
pebbly cassowary egg. "The cassowary (from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>) is the meanest bird in
captivity," <PERSON>Voss</PERSON> notes. "It stomps on its egg after it lays it." That probably
explains the cost of eggs that are saved -- <MONEY>$150</MONEY>. <PERSON>Voss</PERSON>' tiniest egg is a snail
egg, so minuscule that she keeps it in a gelatin capsule. She buys some eggs
from local ranchers and pet store owners, others she orders by mail.;    <PERSON>Voss</PERSON>'
most elaborate project started as an ostrich egg and ended as a mauve and
burgundy carrousel that turns while music plays. Glittering with crystals, the
carrousel retails at <MONEY>$425</MONEY>. Another is a black-and-white clown, fashioned from
an emu egg, that took first prize at the <LOCATION>Alameda County Fair.</LOCATION>;    These are a
far cry from the first eggs <PERSON>Voss</PERSON> decorated with dried flowers and rickrack
eight years ago. When her daughter Shawnie, then 9, broke her elbow in a
gymnastics accident, doctors advised activities to keep her hand busy. The two
of them decorated eggs together. When <PERSON>Carlene</PERSON> sold her first eggs for <MONEY>$2</MONEY>, she
was thrilled.;    <ORGANIZATION>Shawnie</ORGANIZATION>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Logan High School</ORGANIZATION>, long since moved on
to other activities. But <PERSON>Carlene</PERSON> has taken lessons from <PERSON>Dorothy Husokowski</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Hayward</LOCATION> for five years. She has refined her skills and upgraded her equipment.
She suits up like a welder with her jeweler's glasses and floorboards the

   Breeders, dealers and exotic animal
lovers flocked to a dairy barn to place their bids on everything
from emu and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs to zebu.
   About 1,000 exotic birds and animals were for sale at the
two-day auction that began <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``It's a form of insanity,'' animal trader <PERSON>Jim Scott</PERSON> said of the
public's desire to own unique animals.
   Among the animals being auctioned were pygmy goats, cougars,
miniature donkeys, llamas, boa constrictors, bear cubs, blue-neck
ostriches and foxes.
   There were emu, which resemble ostriches, and zebu, domestic,
oxlike animals. You can even pick up a binturong, a catlike animal
from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, or a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig for about <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>.
   Scott runs one of the largest exotic animal auctions in the
country in <LOCATION>Cape Girardeau</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION>.
   Auction organizer <PERSON>Paul Ressler</PERSON>, who says his interest in exotic
animals began as a child, decided to begin his own auction when he
discovered the nearest place to buy exotic animals was in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>.
   His first auction in <DATE>October</DATE> brought in close to <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY>. He
said he expected this auction to generate more than <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>.

<TEXT>
   Operation Desert Shield, along with
holding off Iraqi soldiers, is also shielding the desert from
another force that each year devastates Saudi rangeland: millions
of Iraqi sheep.
   An inadvertent side effect of impending war, conservationists
say, is that Iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration
across the border to find pasture for sheep, goats and camels.
   That, they say, is no small windfall to <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>, where a
loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into
wasteland across much of the country.
   ``Tanks and jeeps running around up there are nothing compared
to what happens from overgrazing,'' said <PERSON>Graham Child</PERSON>, senior
consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and
Development</ORGANIZATION>.
   Crisis or not, the commission is pressing ahead with a 10-year
plan to protect endangered habitats and restock them with
disease-free gazelle, ostrich and native birds.
   The measures have already brought the Arabian oryx back from
extinction in the wild. Two species of gazelle are being bred by
the hundreds.
   There are also some new houbara bustards, large birds beloved by
Saudis who hunt them with falcons.
   Arabian rangelands, slowly degrading for a thousand years, now
suffer badly from <LOCATION>Saudi Bedouin</LOCATION> now able to use water trucks to
graze their animals on fragile land they could not reach before.
   Under historic accords, Iraqi and Jordanian nomads have crossed
regularly into northern <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> to find fresh range. They have
benefited from the same generous subsidies allowed the Saudis.
   At the same time, swift rural development in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION>
brought new roads, irrigated farming and other incursions on
natural habitats.
   Saudi leaders realized they faced a crisis in the mid-1980s when
hunters consistently camehome empty-handed. In <DATE>1986</DATE>, the
commission was set up to do something about it.
   Within four years, 57,692 square miles were designated protected
areas. Specialists came in to shape a wildlife research center from
a neglected private zoo on the late <LOCATION>King Khalid</LOCATION>'s farm north of
here.
   At a second center, scientists experimented with ways to breed
enough houbara bustard chicks to save the threatened wild
population.
   ``They've achieved an enormous amount in three years,'' said
<PERSON>Doug Williamson</PERSON>, an English-based biologist who runs the <ORGANIZATION>King
Khalid Wildlife Research Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Things are far from perfect, but there is goodwill and money
is being committed,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Abdul Aziz abu Zinada</PERSON>, the commision's secretary-general, said
his priorities were protecting habitats, seeking environmental
legislation, restocking wildlife and building public awareness.
   Conflict with <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> has stalled plans for regional cooperation,
he said, but international organizations have continued to help
with data and advice.
   ``Now in the north you can see idmi (sand gazelle) where they
had almost disappeared,'' Abu <PERSON>Zinada</PERSON> said. ``It is thrilling.''
   At the <ORGANIZATION>King Khalid Center</ORGANIZATION>, scientists have all but eliminated
the tuberculosis which, traced back to a gift deer from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, had
crippled herds left for years in a single enclosure.
   Soon the 600 to 700 gazelles now thriving as a result of the
program will be breeding hundreds of kids a year to be released
into the wild, <PERSON>Williamson</PERSON> said.
   The center has two pairs of afri, or Saudi dorcas gazelles,
among the <DATE>last 27</DATE> believed left in the world.
   Altogether, there are 20 species from five continents.
   The animals thrive in separate pens and paddocks and include a
mix of indigenous species and gifts from visitors. There are idmi,
rheem (mountain gazelle), other rare gazelles, Arabian oryx,
zebras, ostriches and assorted extras, including a mad half-goat,
half-ibex that thinks it's a deer.
   Williamson, an antelope specialist who worked in <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s
<LOCATION>Kalahari Desert</LOCATION>, is also conducting research on how gazelle cope
with roasting desert temperatures.
   ``We haven't been affected much by the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> crisis,'' he said,
echoing remarks by scientists conducting other commission projects.
   ``There is a lot to do still, but we're doing it.''

ARABIAN FAIR AND FANTASY;

A DATE WITH THE INDIO FESTIVAL MEANS CAMEL RACES, PAGEANTRY, PARADES AND A 
PANCAKE BREAKFAST

<P>
There are hundreds of county fairs across the nation, but none is quite like 
the annual exposition that began <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Indio</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The main attractions at <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Date Festival</ORGANIZATION> are ostrich 
and camel races, followed by the showy musical pageant that's billed as an 
"Arabian Nights Fantasy." Even the fairground is one of a kind, with oases of 
palm trees and Moorish-style buildings decked out with domes, minarets and 
keyhole-shaped doorways. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 43rd consecutive <ORGANIZATION>Date Festival</ORGANIZATION>, which now has a 10-day run and 
draws more than a quarter-million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Gates open daily at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> (through <DATE>Feb. 26</DATE>) and most fair-goers arrive in 
time for the afternoon ostrich and camel races. Never mind that these 
dromedaries and long-necked birds are shipped in from <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> instead of the 
<LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>; they put on a hilarious show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Degrees Below Zero in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"My camels and ostriches are looking forward to the warm weather in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, 
and so am I," <PERSON>Joe Hedrick</PERSON> said in a telephone interview a week before the 
festival opened. He was speaking from <ORGANIZATION>Hedrick</ORGANIZATION>'s Exotic Animal Farm in <LOCATION>central 
Kansas</LOCATION>, where the temperature was 10 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
This is <PERSON>Hedrick</PERSON>'s fourth year as organizer of the fair's novel races. His 
one-hour shows begin with Roman-style chariots pulled by unpredictable 
ostriches. Not all the drivers are gladiators; look for Bugs Bunny and even a 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Raisin character. Jockeys later mount the ostriches for 
"feather-back" races around the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Riders in Arabian costumes also rock around the course on the humps of camels, 
who seem to have minds of their own once they leave the starting gates. In 
between races, a llama, zebra and an Arabian horse show some tricks they've 
been taught by <PERSON>Hedrick</PERSON> and his animal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring 90 or so exotic and domestic animals to the festival," <PERSON>Hedrick</PERSON> said. 
"Kids really go for the kangaroo in the fair's petting zoo." He also offers 
camel and elephant rides. 
</P>
<P>
Some of <ORGANIZATION>Hedrick</ORGANIZATION>'s animals will be in the date festival parade along <LOCATION>Indio</LOCATION>'s 
streets <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, and every night one of his elephants, a llama, three 
camels and an Arabian horse appear on stage in the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
That hourlong musical is another favorite of festival visitors, who watch the 
fairy tale performed on an outdoor stage built to resemble a marketplace in old 
<LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>. More than 75 area residents are in the cast and choir, including <PERSON>Gwen 
Harlowe</PERSON>, a convalescent-home social director. She's been part of the show for 
29 years and now is a soloist who plays a leading role as the queen, <ORGANIZATION>Calipha 
Nuzhet</ORGANIZATION> al Fuad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Authentic Arabian Dances' 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago we had authentic Arabian dances," <PERSON>Harlowe</PERSON> says, "but the audience 
got restless, so now the production has become more flamboyant." 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of action in this year's tale. It's about a pretender trying to 
take over the throne by marrying <PERSON>Princess Shalimar</PERSON>, who's in love with a slave. 
A smoke bomb announces the appearance of the great genie, and he tips the 
princess off that the slave is really Aladdin, the true prince. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never see anything like this on the stage in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>," says 
<PERSON>Harlowe</PERSON>, who adds that the "Arabian Nights Fantasy" draws an audience of 6,000 
almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds also gather to see the professional entertainers, who appear twice daily 
on the Arabian Nights stage. 
</P>
<P>
Today's headliner is <PERSON>Cristy Lane</PERSON>, whose gospel album, "One Day at a Time," had 
more than 4 million sales. In <DATE>1979</DATE>, she was named the <ORGANIZATION>Academy of Country 
Music</ORGANIZATION>'s top new female artist of the year, and has since recorded 20 gold and 
platinum albums. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s stage show is billed as a Fiestacade, featuring mariachis, folkloric 
dancers and comic <PERSON>Jose Gonzalez Gonzalez</PERSON>, who plays bottles and frying pans 
while dancing, singing and telling jokes. 
</P>
<P>
The All-American Boys Chorus is scheduled for <DATE>Monday</DATE>, and on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Jerry Jeff Walker</PERSON>, who wrote "<PERSON>Mr. Bojangles</PERSON>," presents his one-man 
show of songs and stories. 
</P>
<P>
"The <PERSON>Rajun</PERSON>' Cajun," as songwriter <PERSON>Doug Kershaw</PERSON> is known, takes the spotlight 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE>. He can play 29 different instruments, including the 
violin, an audience favorite. At times, the <PERSON>Rajun</PERSON>' Cajun fiddles so hard that 
the hairs of his bow begin smoking and then disintegrate. (Luckily, there's 
always an extra supply of bows on stage.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Johnny Lee</PERSON> to Perform 
</P>
<P>
Next <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, country singer <PERSON>Johnny Lee</PERSON>, who gained notoriety from the movie 
"Urban Cowboy," will perform hits from his best-selling albums, including 
"Looking for Love." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be treated to other entertainment as they wander the fairground. 
Returning this year is the <ORGANIZATION>All-American High Diving Team</ORGANIZATION>, which climaxes its 
spectacular show with an 85-foot dive into a pool that's only 9 feet deep.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painters and Shutterbugs 
</P>
<P>
The creations of local painters and shutterbugs are featured in the Fine Art

<FP=106> }[Article by <PERSON>Charles Kabera</PERSON>] </F>
  [Excerpt] A severe outbreak of <LOCATION>Newcastle</LOCATION>, a most dangerous 
contagious poultry disease capable of eradicating entire flocks 
within days, has been reported in <LOCATION>Masvingo</LOCATION>'s Sengwe and Matibi 
districts. The outbreak is a potential threat to the 
multi-million-dollar poultry and ostrich export trade, if left 
uncontrolled. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Veterinary Services</ORGANIZATION> has mounted roadblocks 
on all roads out of Sengwe and Matibi Two and vehicles are being 
searched to ensure they are not carrying chickens, chicken meat, 
eggs or chicken cages. 
  Dr. <PERSON>Stuart Hargreaves</PERSON>, the director of veterinary services, 
said in an interview yesterday that the outbreak, the first in 
eight years, was reported on Christmas Eve and roadblocks were 
mounted immediately. 
  A veterinary team, comprising 50 vaccinators, had been 
deployed and had so far vaccinated over 70,000 chickens in the 
communal areas. 
  The exercise is expected to be completed this week in the 
most affected areas and could last for a month in the 
surrounding areas, where surveillance had been intensified. 
  The outbreak is still confined to the estimated 200,000 
village birds in the two districts which are very far from 
commercial poultry production areas. <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> has an estimated 
population of between 15 and 30 million village birds. 
  The disease is believed to have spread from <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, 
which had reported large numbers of outbreaks recently. People 
crossing into <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION>, from <LOCATION>Vendaland</LOCATION>, which is adjacent to 
Sengwe, could have brought chickens affected with the disease. 
  <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> outbreak covered most of the 
<LOCATION>Transvaal</LOCATION> in <DATE>December last year</DATE>, and later moved into parts of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Orange Free State and Northern Natal</ORGANIZATION>, with some mortalities 
in some incorrectly vaccinated flocks as high as <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>. 
  Large-scale poultry producers, due to these developments in 
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>, had since formulated an effective monitoring 
programme for day-old chick producers to enable them, if 
necessary, to accurately assess the disease status of their 
flocks and prevent the spread.

<LEADPARA>  WHAT if the dinosaurs really didn't mysteriously die out but just continued
evolving until they turned into something else, such as ostriches or swans?;  
 Goofy as it may sound, that's a broad interpretation of a popular scientific
theory that says birds and reptiles have a common ancestor. The notion has
been around at least 200 years and still has wide currency.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  TV Magazine  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DOES DINOSAUR THEORY FLY?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Public Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The possible link between the dinosaurs of 140 million years ago and
today's birds is explored on PBS <DATE>this week</DATE> in a fascinating edition of the
"Nova" series called "The Case of the Flying Dinosaur." The show, second of
three "Nova" episodes about dinosaurs, plays <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> on Channel 9.; 
  The dinosaur/bird theories <DATE>spring</DATE> from scientific attempts to search out the
origin of birds by studying fossils from the Mesozoic Era.;    Scientists can
see links between existing birds and reptiles -- such as the presence of
scales and births from hard-shelled eggs -- but there are many differences,
too, between cold-blooded reptiles and warm-blooded birds.;    Yet
well-preserved fossils of bird-like reptiles first found in German limestone
quarries in the 18th century inspired some renowned scientists, including
<PERSON>Thomas Huxley</PERSON>, to believe they were evidence of an evolutionary turn taken by
dinosaurs.;    Most of the "flying dinosaur" partisans believe that
prehistoric reptiles that ran or leaped to grab prey gradually acquired the
ability to fly. Others think it's more likely the dinosaur ancestors of birds
were tree-climbing reptiles that developed wings to "sail" after prey.;    The
fossils that were central to the theory were those of creatures known as
archaeopteryx -- small, bird-like reptiles with wings. They promised to be the
"missing link" between dinosaurs and birds.;    Debate over the theory has
divided the scientific world for years, and the "Nova" episode explores both
sides of the controversy.;    "It's an enormously attractive idea," said bird
fossil expert <PERSON>Larry Martin</PERSON> about the dinosaur theory. "If I have a cage with a
parakeet in it, it's certainly a lot more fun to think that it's a small
tyrannosaurus." Martin is among those who believe birds originated
independently and probably existed side by side with dinosaurs. He thinks the
"flying dinosaur" theory is the result of inadequate study of the fossil
records.;    Latest challenge to the theory is the <DATE>1985</DATE> discovery of a new
bird-like fossil creature, tentatively dubbed "protoavis," which predates
archaeopteryx by millions of years, making it a contemporary of the dinosaurs
from which birds are supposed to have evolved. The first scientific papers
describing this creature are due this spring.;    Still, "Nova" stirs the
imagination with some carefully photographed scenes of contemporary birds that
do resemble dinosaurs when seen from the proper angle. Example: ostriches
browsing on a plain, looking like brontosauruses with feathers.;    This
edition of "Nova" replays the scene in "King Kong" where Kong beats up a
pterodactyl trying to make off with <PERSON>Fay Wray</PERSON>. But it warns against any leap to
the conclusion that pterodactyls were related to modern birds. The world of
science is unanimously of the opinion that birds didn't evolve from those
particular bat-winged reptiles. So when <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON> starts filming
<PERSON>Michael Crichton</PERSON>'s novel "Jurassic Park," a fanciful story about dinosaurs
being cloned on an island off the coast of <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, he probably should
omit the part about pterodactyls being kept in a giant aviary. (box)  </TEXT>

FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: The buckle of Florida's bible belt / A look at life
on the Redneck Riviera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SCHUBERT Miles is frightened of ostriches. Sitting on the porch of his
ramshackle farm, he pushes back his baseball cap and warns: 'Never trust an
ostrich. Their toes can kill - rip a man wide open.' At 80 years old,
<ORGANIZATION>Schubert</ORGANIZATION> is not as light on his feet as he was, so he makes sure his wife
Daisy is ready with a stick when he feeds his big African birds.
Feeding time at <ORGANIZATION>Miles Feather Farm</ORGANIZATION>, a private aviary deep in the forests of
<LOCATION>north-west Florida</LOCATION>, is done by the book - the good book. Daisy always says
grace before breaking the bread and pushing it into the bird cages.
Her greatest conversion is Tinker, an ageing parrot who lives in a <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>
whiskey barrel. He screeches 'Praise the <ORGANIZATION>Lord</ORGANIZATION>' and 'Amen' when he is fed.
Schubert rarely plucks Tinker these days; he prefers to teach him the gospel
instead.
Reciting the <ORGANIZATION>Lord</ORGANIZATION>'s Prayer to a parrot may seem eccentric in a state better
known for <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Everglades</LOCATION>, but it barely raises an eyebrow
in <LOCATION>DeFuniak Springs</LOCATION>, the old lumber capital of the south. This town is the
buckle of the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> bible belt, and religious pets are nothing new.
Stretching from <LOCATION>Pensacola</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> border to <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION>, the state
capital, the bible belt boasts churches in all shapes and sizes - <ORGANIZATION>First
Baptists</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>United Methodists</ORGANIZATION>, Assemblies of God, Abundant Life Pentecostals
and Seventh Day Adventists. Roads across the region, nicknamed the
<LOCATION>Panhandle</LOCATION>, are lined with evangelical billboards exhorting motorists to pull
over for a service. 'Trust in God,' says one; 'Have you been saved?' asks
another.
Schubert Miles thinks he has been saved already - saved from tourism,
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s largest industry. State regulations protect the forests of the
<ORGANIZATION>Panhandle</ORGANIZATION> and ensure that farming and the local chicken processing plant
remain more important to DeFuniak than holidaymakers. Giving thanks,
<PERSON>Schubert</PERSON> says: 'This is God's country. Let's keep it that way.'
Even Adventures Unlimited, the only company allowed to rent canoes and
kayaks in the <ORGANIZATION>Blackwater Forest</ORGANIZATION>, gets most of its business from the Lord.
Church groups like nothing better than to canoe downriver for a weekend
retreat on a deserted sandbar.
Paddling gently through avenues of pine and cedar, you hear the church
groups before you see them. It is unnerving to recognise a chorus from
<ORGANIZATION>Onward Christian Soldiers</ORGANIZATION> wafting round a U-bend in the river; it is even
more scary to feel the eyes of a dozen devotees regarding your kayak with
horror as they spy the Budweisers weighing it down.
God, however, has lost his grip on one part of the Panhandle: the coast.
Several towns lining the seashore have put their faith in tourism and their
devotion has spawned a string of brash resorts and amusement parks. This is
the <ORGANIZATION>Redneck Riviera</ORGANIZATION>, a popular haunt for holidaymakers from <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>.
The riviera has alarmed residents in the Panhandle who fear the coastline
could disappear beneath high-rise hotels and gaming arcades. Even Seaside, a
new holiday village praised by Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> for its traditional
architecture, has failed to impress them. Its pastel-coloured cottages and
fine white beach may be pretty 'but where are the churches?', asks one
visitor from <LOCATION>DeFuniak Springs</LOCATION>.
There is no shortage of altars in the lumber town 25 miles north of Seaside.
The Baptists alone have 10 churches and their congregations command enough
votes to persuade the town council to adopt teetotal policies, such as
banning all alcohol advertising. The town's most famous baptist took the
whole state by storm. <PERSON>Sidney Catts</PERSON>, a local minister, ran for governor in
<DATE>1916</DATE> as the champion of the <ORGANIZATION>Panhandle</ORGANIZATION>'s farmers, nicknamed the crackers.
Campaigning with two loaded pistols, he proclaimed: 'There are only three
things you can trust in life: <ORGANIZATION>Sears Roebuck</ORGANIZATION>, the Lord Jesus and <PERSON>Sidney J
Catts</PERSON>.' He was duly elected as the 'cracker messiah'.
His individual brand of conservatism survives in <LOCATION>DeFuniak</LOCATION>, where he died in
<DATE>1936</DATE>. <PERSON>Sunbright Manor</PERSON>, his former home, has been converted to a B&amp;B but
still serves the food <PERSON>Sidney</PERSON> enjoyed: grits, ground corn in hot water and
melted butter.
Sleeping in the governor's bedroom, it is easy to understand why he always
slept with his pistols beside him. At 2am each morning an artillery barrage
opens up outside - far away at first but steadily louder until it sounds as
though war has broken out.
The cause is the adjacent <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> Railroad. Its nightly
freight train rumbles across the state like a mobile cannon. The noise is
terrific and the locomotive's horn sounds like an air raid siren.
The thunder dies slowly as the train heads eastward but it is often followed
by a genuine thunderclap. In the <ORGANIZATION>Panhandle</ORGANIZATION> electric storms are almost as
regular as train services. And across <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> more people are killed or
injured by lightning than in any other <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> state.
Towns like DeFuniak, however, have a natural storm warning - lovebugs. These
hairy insects congregate in droves before a storm but not everyone welcomes
their arrival. Their bodies are so acidic that they eat right through metal
and they have been blamed for corroding cars.
Residents in the <LOCATION>Panhandle</LOCATION> try all sorts of weird practises to deter them.
They fit 'car-bras' over their radiators and it is not unusual to see a
motorist massaging baby oil into his <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>. Lovebugs skid right off your
bonnet if it is greasy with moisturiser.
Frequent storms and the insects preceding them are not mentioned by
campaigners hoping to kickstart tourism in <LOCATION>DeFuniak Springs</LOCATION>. They
concentrate, instead, on the town's history as the <DATE>19th century</DATE> cultural
centre of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> when it hosted the Chautauqua arts festival.
The annual festival, held to attract <DATE>Sunday</DATE> school teachers, filled a
4,000-seat auditorium beside DeFuniak's perfectly round lake. But the
festival died in <DATE>1925</DATE> and with it the town's association with the arts.
The auditorium, once the largest in the South, has been demolished, but the
lake is largely unchanged and the lack of new development has left most of
the old mansions around it intact. Tourism campaigners want to open these
houses to tour groups but Father <PERSON>John Fowler</PERSON>, DeFuniak's elderly
episcopalian pastor, says 'they don't have a Chinaman's chance'.
Father <PERSON>Fowler</PERSON> blames the town council for resisting moves to attract
holidaymakers. 'This town has been taken over by a bunch of southern boobs
who haven't the faintest idea about tourism. They don't want change, they
just want religious salvation. It's a shame. Places like this will die out.'
Schubert Miles, meanwhile, shakes his head at the idea of tour buses
struggling up the rutted track to his farm. He says his faith will prepare
him for such an onslaught. Tending his confederate roses, which flower white
each morning and turn red as the day passes, he quotes his favourite psalm:
'I say to myself: 'The <ORGANIZATION>Lord</ORGANIZATION> is my light and my salvation, of whom then shall
I be afraid?' . . . only my ostriches.'
<PERSON>Tim Burt</PERSON> travelled with <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Airlines</ORGANIZATION> (tel: 0345-747800), which serves
the Panhandle with flights to <LOCATION>Fort Walton Beach</LOCATION>.
Further information is available from the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> bureau of international
tourism (0101-904 488 7592); Adventures Unlimited (0101-904 623 6197); and
Seaside (0101-904 231 1320).

in the world spotlight, Weekend FT looks at how food and drink has played a
part in the country's culture

<TEXT>
It augured well. Opposite me on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Underground were three young
<LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION>. The men were speaking <LOCATION>Afrikaans</LOCATION>, but clearly the woman was
less happy in this language: 'Where do we get off?' she asked in English.
'<ORGANIZATION>Shepherd</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>', said one of the men. Perhaps they too were dining at <ORGANIZATION>The
Rotisserie</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s South African restaurant. Like the duc des Esseintes in
<PERSON>Joris Karl Huysman</PERSON>'s A Rebours (Against Nature), who learned all he wanted
to know about <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> from visiting an English tavern in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, I aimed to
glean the maximum amount about South African food from a restaurant in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
The Rotisserie did not give an overwhelmingly South African impression. I
asked the patient and good-natured manager what I should eat.
'Have the tiger prawns and the peri-peri (chilli sauce)'. He said. 'Do I get
<PERSON>Mrs Ball</PERSON>'s chutney with that?' 'No, you eat that with your steak'. Steak, he
said, was a typical South African dish, which did not make <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>
sound very different to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
'You have great meat here', he said, 'but you don't know how to cook it. In
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> we know how to treat good meat.' The meat arrived. It had
indeed been treated; bathed in a sweet marinade which not everyone at my
table liked. <PERSON>Mrs Ball</PERSON>'s chutney was also rather sweet.
The atmosphere was young and fun. There were South African wines and good,
juicy steaks; but I was going to have to look elsewhere if I was to discover
real South African food. One excellent tip I received was to call <ORGANIZATION>Emory St
Marcus</ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>St Marcus Fine Foods</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Putney</LOCATION>, south <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. St <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> is
the man who supplies homesick <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> with their needs, from biltong
to chocolate bars.
Biltong is dried meat in the manner of viande des grisons bresaola or
Bundnerfleisch. The meat is salted, marinated and dried. The word derives
from 'buttock-tongue' because it was cut from the buttock, and looked like a
tongue.
Biltong can be made from any animal. There is currently some speculation as
to whether we will see ostrich biltong in the UK once the new British
ostrich farm is up and running. Game of all sorts is used and both <PERSON>St
Marcus</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Susman</PERSON>'s Best Beef Biltong in <LOCATION>Sussex</LOCATION> makes a venison version.
The difference between biltong and the Swiss and Italian versions seems to
lie in the marinades. Basic <PERSON>St Marcus</PERSON> biltong has a lot of coriander in the
marinade. Pre-cut, it tends to dry out. I much enjoyed the <PERSON>Susman</PERSON> 'wild
venison' - gaminess seems to add a dimension to biltong.
Also on the dry side is Droewors, which <ORGANIZATION>St Marcus</ORGANIZATION> compares to the German
Landjager.
Sosaties are South African kebabs. St Marcus makes versions from beef, lamb
and pork. The highly-spiced meat is alternated with pieces of fruit:
apricots and pineapple. More to my taste was boerewors, the finely-minced
beef sausage which comes in a coil like a <LOCATION>Cumberland</LOCATION> sausage. The basic
mixture of 87 per cent beef and rusk is marinated in vinegar before being
filled into runners.
Susman's supplies a good many of the top shops in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. St Marcus offers
anything from South African fruit juices and wines to some of the more
important staples of the <LOCATION>Capetown</LOCATION> table such as monkey gland sauce and
peri-peri.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Want to buy a lion? A zebra. A rhea bird? A trio
of bear cubs. No problem. Demand for wilder wildlife is sizeable
and the suppliers ever ready. That pleases animal dealers and
customers who, for benign and not so benign reasons, go for exotic
animals, even on a dinner plate. The trend bothers the increasingly
active animal rights groups and others who are disposed to raise
moral as well as ecological issues.

<HEAD>Protesters Picket Over Offbeat Meats _ `Lion's Tongue is No Fun'</HEAD>

   The meat was offbeat, the diners chic, but
picketers outside the New Deal Restaurant were in a pique.
   It was the place to be <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. Where else in town could
you find sweet and sour ostrich, kangaroo yakitori and beaver
empanada on the menu, with animal rights activists chanting,
``Lion's tongue is no fun'' in the street?
   The restaurant's <ORGANIZATION>Eighth Annual Wildlife Game Festival</ORGANIZATION> attracted
customers who wanted to savor a rare taste treat. It also drew the
attention of an animal rights group that protested in front of the
restaurant, shouting slogans such as, ``Wild game is not a treat.''
   ``This is symbolic of the really decadent, disrespectful
attitude that, unfortunately, our society exhibits,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Siegel</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Trans-Species Unlimited</ORGANIZATION>. ``Some of them are endangered
animals. They're making a game out of it, making a fun experience
out of the suffering of these animals.''
   The kangaroo meat served by New Deal is marinated in soy sauce
and grilled with scallions. The ``Drunken Diamondback Rattlesnake''
is pan-roasted with cilantro (coriander) and bell peppers and then
baked in tequila and lime.
   Barbara and <PERSON>Bill Hinton</PERSON>, regulars at the eatery in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s
SoHo area, were seated at the bar <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``We had zebra once, which was quite delicious,'' said <PERSON>Hinton</PERSON>.
``They have some things here that you can't get in other places in
the city and it's very tasty and very well prepared.''
   As the protestors continued their chanting , chef <PERSON>Jeffrey Nathan</PERSON>
and restaurant partner <PERSON>Harvey Riezenman</PERSON> lamented that the
demonstrators were misinformed.
   ``They think we're doing something illegal,'' said <PERSON>Riezenman</PERSON>.
``Everything is sanctioned by the government. No one drives up here
in a truck with three deer on the back of the truck and dumps it
out on the street.''
   Added Nathan: ``We too, are concerned with the protection of our
wildlife. We do not feature endangered species. ... Our exotic
meats come from preserves whose sole purpose is to raise these
animals for consumption.''
   But protester <PERSON>Sari Bailer</PERSON> was unimpressed.
   ``Those animals don't belong on a plate. They belong on the open
fields or the jungle,'' she said, as she took up a new chant,
``Beaver, moose and ostrich, too. New Deal Restaurant shame on
you.''
   Game will be on the menu until <DATE>January</DATE> and chef <PERSON>Nathan</PERSON> intends
to hold the festival again next year _ especially with the
popularity of high-protein, low-cholesterol food.
   ``It's a healthier product than the meat you get in most
restaurants,'' he said. ``In here, you're not eating animals that
are all pumped up with hormones or antibiotics.''
   But how can anyone eat kangaroo? a visitor asked.
   ``It's like filet mignon,'' <PERSON>Nathan</PERSON> said.
   But every taste bud has its limits.
   ``I particularly have a morbid fear of snakes and I've never
eaten it and I probably never will,'' <PERSON>Bill Hinton</PERSON> said.

WILDLIFE -- UP CLOSE 'N' PERSONAL

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, oh best beloved, there was a summer school for all the wild 
animals of the field and forest, veldt and savanna, water hole and river 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The school was at the <LOCATION>San Diego Wild Animal Park</LOCATION> east of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, where 250 
animal species, 47 of them endangered, roam over 700 spacious acres in the dry, 
sunny <LOCATION>San Pasqual Valley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <DATE>summer</DATE> school was for the birds -- and for the tigers, gorillas, 
wildebeests, rhinos and, yes, even for weak and puny man cubs. And for their 
parents, too. But at this school, the animals were the teachers and the 
students were the humans. 
</P>
<P>
The school was such a success and the humans learned so quickly that the 
animals got together and voted to continue the program. (Let the record show 
that the giraffes had to be bribed with carrots and that <PERSON>Gainda</PERSON>, the Indian 
rhinoceros, demanded more quality petting time.) 
</P>
<P>
So once again this <DATE>summer</DATE>, from now through <DATE>August</DATE>, the Wild Animal Park is 
offering one-, two-, three- and five-morning classes for youngsters from Grade 
1 through high school. The emphasis is on hands-on learning. Students join 
teachers, staff biologists and keepers to pet, feed, count, look at, listen to 
and -- most important -- learn about the creatures whose world we share. 
</P>
<P>
And for adults? They haven't been forgotten. From now through <DATE>September</DATE>, animal 
admirers and wildlife photographers ages 12 and up can sign up for special 
family and photo caravan safaris into the huge exhibits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These open-air, bumpy expeditions, with 10 guests and two guides standing in 
the back of a truck, spend a couple of hours driving on the dirt roads through 
four of the park's five major habitats, the East and South African, and the 
<LOCATION>Asian Plains</LOCATION> and Asian Waterhole, about 320 acres in all. The guides stop the 
truck at various places to talk about the different animals and hand out 
carrots and apples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Taste of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
"The caravans are a little taste of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>," says <PERSON>Larry Killmar</PERSON>, curator of 
mammals. "They're not so rugged or stressful as a safari in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, but they 
get the people down close." 
</P>
<P>
Right! One minute you're adjusting your sunglasses, the next you're looking up 
to see three tons of beady-eyed rhino barreling up to the truck. Then he -- or 
she -- stops and thrusts that huge wrinkled face and rubbery lips right next to 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to shriek or faint. Yech -- kissed by a rhino! Instead, hand over 
an apple and grab your camera. This is a rare chance to shoot wildlife photos 
from a distance of six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your telephoto lens too, to snap candids of this year's crop of shy 
babies. Says <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON>, who has been with the park since it opened in <DATE>1972</DATE>: 
"<DATE>April</DATE> to <DATE>August</DATE> is the heavy calving season. We can have as many as eight 
births in a day -- they happen right out there in the exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
If feeding fruit to rhinos seems unnatural when the park's goal is to create an 
authentic living setting for the animals, you are right. And when excessive 
contact with humans does interfere with the animals' social group behavior, 
park biologists eschew it. 
</P>
<P>
But, <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON> says, offering treats to unpredictable and easily spooked Indian 
rhinos is the safest way to manage these 6,000-pound creatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiarity Breeds Friendship 
</P>
<P>
"From day one we get the rhino calves used to touching by the keepers," <PERSON>Killmar</PERSON> 
says. "If you give them apples and carrots and goodies, they'll do anything for 
you. This allows us to move them around -- even crate them -- without using any 
tranquilizers." 
</P>
<P>
Each caravan has its own surprises. On a recent outing, Wild Animal Park 
spokesman <PERSON>Tom Hanscom</PERSON> spotted a newly laid ostrich egg lying on the muddy river 
bank. The eggs are a favorite target for hawks, so he stopped to collect it. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors handed it around and agreed it felt large, heavy and very hard. 
Just the right size for an omelet, someone commented. "Do you know how to cook 
an ostrich egg?" Hanscom asked. "You put the egg and a rock in a pot of boiling 
water. When the rock's done, so is the egg." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters coming to the park from the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> area usually are dropped off 
by their parents or ride the bus from <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, but residents of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
probably will find that the park is too far for a daily drive. 
</P>
<P>
A solution is to enroll the child in a one-day class (held each <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME>) and combine it with an all-day family visit to the park. Human cubs, 
grades one through six, join a "Wild Walkabout," visiting koalas and kangaroos 
and all the other strange fauna and flora from the Down Under continent, while 
students in grades seven to 12 enroll in the class called "Close Enough to 
Touch," similar to the photo caravans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Budding Zoologists 
</P>
<P>
The older students actually accompany the keepers into the exhibits, through 
double-chain-link gates to help feed and count the zebras and gazelles and feel 
the giraffe's warm breath when it bends down for a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
If a budding zoologist begs for a three-day class, consider a mini-vacation for 
the family at one of the golf and leisure resorts east of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> or motel 
accommodations in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Start a day at the Wild Animal Park with a ride on the <PERSON>Wgasa Bush</PERSON> Line 
monorail. The monorail runs around the hills above the major habitats and 
provides an overview of the 2,500 animals that live behind special fencing 
called "inrigging." 
</P>
<P>
The fencing isn't all that tall, but it has a tremendous overhang at the top. 
As our monorail tour guide <PERSON>Becky Boomer</PERSON> announced: "The animals get up next to 
the fence and look up. When they see something over their heads, they think 
they can't jump out." 
</P>
<P>
On the ride, keep an eye out for a family of wild golden eagles circling 
overhead. The eagles are a few of the wild birds that have taken up residence 
in the surrounding hilltops and are getting fat on the gophers and mice that 
help themselves to animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
"We call them locals," <PERSON>Hanscom</PERSON> says, explaining that the Wild Animal Park 
spends between <MONEY>$41,000</MONEY> and <MONEY>$46,000</MONEY> monthly on animal food. The grocery bill 
would be higher, but the park actually grows some of its own browse food, such 
as eucalyptus, on the park's 1,800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
After the ride, visitors walk around the 1 1/4-mile <ORGANIZATION>Kilimanjaro Trail</ORGANIZATION> for a 
closer look into the special, smaller exhibits: the <LOCATION>Sumatran</LOCATION> tiger's woody 
hollow, the elephant enclosure, the lowland gorilla's lair and the cheetah's 
grassy plain. The animals are fascinating to watch, but their presence points 
to the Wild Animal Park's real purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Coloration 
</P>
<P>
The park's protective coloration -- the <LOCATION>Nairobi Village</LOCATION>'s thatched snack bar, 
outdoor cafe, T-shirt shop, souvenir store, live animal shows, the petting 
kraal -- is designed like a theme park to attract humans. But, <ORGANIZATION>Hanscom</ORGANIZATION> says, 
the park's real purpose is 'to breed endangered species, and to study breeding 
problems of animals in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says, researchers discovered that flamingos wouldn't lay 
fertilized eggs unless there were at least 100 birds in the flock. "It's the 
number that seems to click the hormones and make them go," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Southern White Rhino . . . for years, the two in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Zoo 
just ignored each other. Then they brought 20 females out here to the animal 
park and moved the male out here to retire, but all he needed was space and a 
harem. In 11 years, he sired 65 calves." 
</P>
<P>
However, numbers aren't always a determining factor. There are cheetahs in the 
wilds, but genetic studies reveal that they're very inbred, probably because 
they live in isolated family groups. As a result, many females are sterile or 
there's a high infant mortality. So the park is breeding cheetahs with better 
genes, then making them available to other zoos. 
</P>
<P>
The park's <DATE>summer</DATE> programs are scheduled almost every day of the week. Photo 
caravans run on <DATE>Wednesday, Thursday</DATE>, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE> afternoons from <DATE>May 
through September</DATE>. Groups of 10 booking together can go any day. Each caravan 
is 1 3/4 hours long; tickets are <MONEY>$50</MONEY> for adults 16 and older and <MONEY>$35</MONEY> for 
children 12-15 with an adult. Children under 12 are not permitted on this 
caravan. The East African and the Asian Plains caravan leaves at <TIME>2:30 p.m</TIME>. The 
caravan to the South African habitat and the Asian Waterhole leaves at <TIME>4:30 
p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
You can take both tours for a full 3 1/2-hour safari; <MONEY>$75</MONEY> for adults and <MONEY>$50</MONEY> 
for children. Because <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Zoological Society</ORGANIZATION> members get a big discount 
on all special tours, it may be possible to save money by joining the zoo at 
the time you enroll. The photo caravans always are sold out and must be booked 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Caravans are similar to photo caravans but emphasize learning about 
and visiting family groups of animals rather than photography. They run <DATE>Monday</DATE> 
evenings from 5:30 to <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> Tickets are <MONEY>$55</MONEY> for one adult with one child, and 
<MONEY>$80</MONEY> for one adult with two children. Children must be 8 or older and be with an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day <DATE>summer</DATE> school runs <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Friday</DATE> from 9 to <TIME>11:30 a.m.</TIME>, 
with a separate class for each grade level from 1 to 9. The three-day 
summer-school program runs <DATE>Monday, Tuesday</DATE> and <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>1 
p.m</TIME>. The fee is <MONEY>$50</MONEY> and five different classes serve different grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day program runs each <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from <TIME>8:30 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> and costs <MONEY>$22</MONEY> 
to <MONEY>$35</MONEY>. Different classes are designed for three age groups. 
</P>
<P>
The "Keeper Connection" is a two-session career exploration class for 
10th-to-12th graders who are considering animal-related careers. The fee is 
<MONEY>$50</MONEY>; the first session in <DATE>August</DATE> is on the 11th, and participants have a choice 
for the second second sesssion of any day between <DATE>Aug. 14</DATE> and 18. 
</P>
<P>
You can enroll by telephone and pay by credit card. Call the <ORGANIZATION>Summer School 
Hotline</ORGANIZATION> at (619) 740-9383, or the <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION> at (619) 236-0163. You also can 
write to the <ORGANIZATION>Summer School</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego Zoo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>P.O.</LOCATION> Box 551, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>. 
92112-0551, but expect a several-week processing delay. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Park hours are <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> through <DATE>Sept. 4</DATE> (Labor Day), and <TIME>9 
a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> after. The park is 30 miles north of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on Interstate 15, 
then east on Highway 78. From <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> take Interstate 5 south to <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>, 
then <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 78 east to the park. A ticket package (entrance, monorail ride, 
animal shows and exhibits) is <MONEY>$12.95</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$6.20</MONEY> for ages 3-15, ages 2 
and under free. Stroller and wheelchair rentals are available. No pets, please; 
the wild animals frown on it.

<HEAD>Pricey Birds Targeted for Theft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A red-violet eclectus parrot, a green-wing macaw
and an ostrichlike emu are among the missing _ victims in a rash of
40 exotic birds thefts in the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> area over the past five months.
   The popularity of the valuable tropical birds and federal limits
on imports have combined to produce a profitable black market in
birds, <PERSON>Ron Magill</PERSON>, assistant to the curator at <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s MetroZoo,
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``You see these birds that are stolen being sold everywhere from
classified advertising to flea markets,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be
surprised from what's going on now that some of these birds aren't
sold before they're stolen.''
   The 9-year-old zoo lost a female eclectus parrot valued at more
than <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> to someone who ducked into a screened breeding cage two
weeks ago while the staff member on duty was gone for about 20
minutes.
   ``The only other time that I know of that we had a theft of an
animal at <ORGANIZATION>MetroZoo</ORGANIZATION> since we opened was about five years ago at the
bird show area,'' said <PERSON>Magill</PERSON>.
   But the law of supply and demand is at work, even at the
criminal level.
   ``The population of these birds in the wild is becoming so
depleted that federal regulations are making it extremely difficult
to import them. Therefore the price is becoming very high on these
birds,'' he said. ``What's happening now is people are starting to
steal from the private owners and collectors in this country.''
   Warren and <PERSON>Jude Werner</PERSON>, stars of their <ORGANIZATION>Gold Coast Mime Co.</ORGANIZATION>, used
a macaw named <LOCATION>Miami Beak</LOCATION> in their act until the <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> bird was
stolen from their <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> home <DATE>March 3</DATE>.
   ``These were people who knew birds,'' <PERSON>Werner</PERSON> said. ``They didn't
take anything but the bird.''
   <PERSON>Susan Boyd</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Parrot Club</ORGANIZATION>, improved
security after two blind eclectus parrots, two lovebirds and a
cockatoo were taken from her home <DATE>Feb. 21</DATE>. Two days later,
birdnappers struck again, this time making off another cockatoo and
a blue and gold macaw.
   Bird dealer <PERSON>Joe Wasilewski</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Natural Selections</ORGANIZATION> lost four birds
in a break-in at his warehouse <DATE>Dec. 27</DATE> but recovered three in a
police sting that resulted in two arrests. But he still misses the
fourth bird, a 7-year-old African gray named Lola. African grays
are considered the best talkers, or mimics, among parrots.
   ``She used to talk and sing and whistle and drive around with
me,'' he said. ``It's part of my family.''
   Victims suspect a ring is behind the spate of thefts dating back
to late <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Wasilewski</PERSON> said.
   ``If you don't have the training to handle them, you're going to
get bit,'' he said. ``They have to have training to steal all the
wide variety that they are.''

<TEXT>
   It was bodacious <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> fun.
   With cattle lowing in the background and dust swirling through
the air, the leaders of the free world threw horseshoes, sampled
barbeque and watched cowboys at work <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> appeared to delight in showing his <ORGANIZATION>VIP</ORGANIZATION> guests a
country-style evening of entertainment before they turned their
attention to <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s economic summit opening.
   They tramped through sawdust-covered artificial turf to a
horseshoe pit and took a turn at <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s favorite pasttime. The
president out-pitched his guests, landing two ringers. Then they
trooped through a buffet line, plates awkwardly in hand, to sample
some of the 3{ tons of meat barbecued for the occasion.
   The president also lined up a rodeo and a rare out-of-town
performance by the Grand Ole Opry for his guests' amusement.
   The men were dressed casually: <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister
<PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> both sported the fancy ostrich cowboy boots made
especially for the economic summit. <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON>Toshiki Kaifu</PERSON>,
showed off an oversize western belt buckle. British Prime Minister
<PERSON>Margaret Thatcher</PERSON> picked her way through the sawdust in
white-and-black heels.
   Cowboys were competing in such events as bareback riding, bull
riding, barrel racing and calf scramble, said <PERSON>Dan Gaddis</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Houston Livestock Show &amp; Rodeo</ORGANIZATION>, an annual affair that draws more
than a million people each <DATE>winter</DATE>.
   ``What could be better than a rodeo, great country music and
`the taste as big as <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>,''' said <PERSON>Mike Jolley</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Houston-based Luther's Bar-B-Q Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which was providing the food
for the rodeo party, which was expected to draw several thousand
people.
   It took 140 workers more than four days to slow cook all that
barbecue, including brisket, sausage, chicken and ribs. Crews also
made more than 1{ tons of coleslaw, potato salad and beans.
   Naturally, there were also 1,250 gallons of barbecue sauce,
pickles and jalapenos, 500 pounds of onions, more than 5,000
servings of cobbler and carrot cake and 650 gallons of lemonade and
iced tea.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and the foreign leaders were dining on china made by
<LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, potter <PERSON>Teri Vance Hubbeling</PERSON>, who said she had worked
nearly non-stop since being asked to create the 63 festive plates
with a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> theme. She designed three different patterns _ a
centered longhorn with green cactus in the background and blue
trim, a race horse with boots in the background and a longhorn with
barbed wire in the background.
   <PERSON>Rocky Carroll</PERSON>, who has made numerous boots for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, said he
worked about 40 hours to create each pair of the full-quill ostrich
boots for the visiting leaders.
   The boots sport the seven flags of the participating nations
across the top. Each boot's center front has a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> flag and
``<LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'' stitched along the bottom. The leaders' initials are

<TEXT>  <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>;    A They dream in the senses they know, just like the rest of us.
People who have been blind from birth don't know what it is like to see, and
so can't see in their dreams. But people who went blind later in life may have
sight returned to them in their dreams.;    Sighted people often think of
dreams as just visual images, but that is a mistake, according to <PERSON>Stephen
LaBerge</PERSON>, a psychologist at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> who studies dreaming. We actually
experience all of our senses in our dreams, but because we humans are so
visually oriented, we remember the visual images most strongly, sometimes
forgetting the role played by the other senses.;    But for blind people, the
other senses are very important, in waking life and in dreams. <PERSON>Jim Stevenson</PERSON>,
an experimental psychologist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> who has been blind
since birth, says his dreams contain a lot of conversations. Also prominent,
he says, is the kinesthetic sense -- the sense of the position of one's body
in space -- and the sense of touch. "If I dream that I'm walking with
someone," <PERSON>Stevenson</PERSON> says, "holding onto their arm will be part of the dream.";
   People who lost their sight after some critical period usually thought to
be from 5 to 7 years of age can remember what it was like to see, and so may
see in their dreams, says <PERSON>LaBerge</PERSON>. But since dreams reflect the senses with
which we are most familiar, visual images may not be prominent in their
dreams. LaBerge says that through lucid dreaming -- a technique by which
dreamers can take control of their dreams -- these people can make vision a
bigger part of their dreams.;    Q How can they know that pterodactyls flew,
when there are birds alive today that have wings but don't fly?;    -- <LOCATION>Summer
Pina</LOCATION>,; <ORGANIZATION>Frost School</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    A Pterodactyls pass a test for flying
ability that compares their wings and bones to those of modern birds and bats.
Its a test that flightless birds such as ostriches or penguins would fail.;   
Pterodactyls belonged to the larger group of winged reptiles called
pterosaurs, that lived from <MONEY>200 million</MONEY> to 65 million years ago. Their wings
were sheets of skin, supported in front by the animal's arm and 4th finger,
and in back by attachment to the thigh or hip of the hind leg, according to
<PERSON>Kevin Padian</PERSON>, a paleontologist who studies pterosaurs at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley.</LOCATION>;    To tell whether pterosaurs flew, paleontologists
compare them to modern flying animals. Their wings were apparently large
enough to keep them aloft, and they also had very lightweight hollow bones, as
do today's birds.;    Birds and bats have strong flight muscles and large
breastbones and ridges on their arms or wing-bones to which the muscles
attach. Pterosaur skeletons share these features, and marks on the fossil
bones show where the muscles once attached. That says that pterosaurs not only
had large wings, but could flap them.;    And what would a creature do with
lightweight bones and giant flapping wings besides fly? Since pterosaurs were
so well adapted for flying, and there is no evidence to the contrary, <PERSON>Padian</PERSON>
says, the most likely explanation is that they flew.;    Today's flightless
birds wouldn't pass that test. Ostriches, for example, have wings that are too
small to keep them aloft, and penguins, which have adapted to swimming, have
dense bones that make good ballast, but would be too heavy for flight.  </TEXT>
