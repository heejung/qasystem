<PERSON>MR ROSS PEROT</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire, is refusing comment on a report that
he will pitch his political organisation, <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> We Stand, and his extensive
resources behind opposition to a <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round agreement, <PERSON>Nancy Dunne</PERSON> writes
from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>United We Stand</ORGANIZATION> said he has not yet taken a position on the
Round, in order to focus his energies on defeating the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free
Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> co-wrote a book detailing criticism of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> after
claiming, during the presidential debates, that 'a giant sucking sound'
would draw American jobs over the US-Mexican border.
His co-author, <PERSON>Mr Pat Choate</PERSON>, yesterday said he opposed <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round
provisions weakening US dumping laws and establish-ing a multilateral
trading organisation to oversee the world trading system.
Ms <PERSON>Lori Wallach</PERSON>, a prominent anti-Nafta organiser with <ORGANIZATION>Public Citizen</ORGANIZATION>, which
works closely with the <PERSON>Perot</PERSON> forces, said many of the same groups which
oppose the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will also fight a <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round pact.
'<PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON> feels about <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> the way a vampire feels about garlic,' she
said. '<PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON> feels about <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> the way a vampire feels about daylight.
One he regards with revulsion; the other means death.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Clinton hails Nafta vote by Congress - US

Uruguay Round

<TEXT>
A JUBILANT President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> flew off to his Asian summit in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>
yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and promising new
initiatives to liberalise word trade.
Approval on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> by the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives of the North
American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> was, he declared on the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> lawn, 'a
long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous
international competition.
The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote gave the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 'the economic, political and moral standing' to
make its case, he said, not only with the Asian leaders but also in the
final push successfully to conclude a new <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of global trading
talks. Vital Gatt talks are to be held next week in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> between <PERSON>Mr
Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> Trade Representative, and Sir <PERSON>Leon Brittan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
commissioner.
The <ORGANIZATION>US Senate</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> next week, as is its Mexican
counterpart. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said President <PERSON>Salinas</PERSON> had invited Vice President <PERSON>Al
Gore</PERSON> for the Mexican side of the ratification process.
The new trading bloc, which also includes <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, is to take effect on
<DATE>January 1</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had
appeared likely even as the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debated the agreement until late in the
<TIME>evening</TIME>. The majority was composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of
the 258 Democrats, with the sole independent voting against.
Before he went to bed, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> signed letters of thanks to all who had
voted in favour and hoped that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the
day could be applied to other great upcoming issues, such as health care
reform.
But the president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition
and to heal the open wounds in his own Democratic Party, especially with
organised labour. He promised new initiatives on education and worker
retraining, while <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> said the administration was 'uncomfortable in
being in disagreement with the folks we normally fight along with, side by
side.'
Trade union leaders, however, were unmollified. The full hierarchy of the
<ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to regret
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s passage.
'It has little to do with the national interest,' said <PERSON>Mr Lane Kirkland</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> president, but was 'a secure means of escape' from <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> laws for US
and multinational corporations. <PERSON>Mr Bill Bywater</PERSON>, head of the electricians,
warned those Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're gonna make sure we get
even at the polls.' <PERSON>Mr Owen Bieber</PERSON>, of the car workers, said <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> votes
next week would be duly noticed, too. <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, a loser in the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
debate, also threatened retaliation by his independent movement.
<PERSON>Mr Jim Jontz</PERSON>, director of the Citizens' Trade Campaign against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>,
promised similar scrutiny of a <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION> agreement. 'I feel we already
won because clearly <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> could not be sold on its merits and the president
had to start dealing to get votes.'
Republican leaders were generally pleased with the co-operation with the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> over an accord first negotiated by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. Several said
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would have failed without overwhelming Republican support and that,
therefore, the party could no longer be accused of perpetuating 'gridlock'
in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
But a <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> staff member predicted 'serious disagreements' with <PERSON>Mr
Clinton</PERSON> on health care and spending cuts.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Chicago back-room operator to sell Nafta -
Laurie Morse on a Daley drafted in to lead ratification drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> has chosen to head the task force to help get
his free trade pact with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> ratified may lack experience in
international trade arenas. But he comes to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> well prepared for the
kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a
divided <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to pass it.
<PERSON>William Daley</PERSON> is younger brother and chief adviser to <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s mayor
<PERSON>Richard M Daley</PERSON> and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine 'Boss',
the late <PERSON>Richard J Daley</PERSON>. Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,
45-year-old <PERSON>Bill Daley</PERSON> is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with
important connections in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and long-standing ties with organised
labour. He has never run for political office.
<PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> accepted the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> position after being passed over for a cabinet
position and turning down an offer to be <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s chief negotiator at
the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>.
He chaired <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s election campaign in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, where he delivered 48
per cent of the vote to <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, above the national average, and continues
as a tangible supporter. Most recently, he arranged a posh <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> dinner
for the president that raised Dollars 1m (Pounds 670,000).
However, <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON>'s appointment to chair the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>'s task force on the
<LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff. Recent
polls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not support
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> himself reserved his support for the deal, negotiated under
<PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s administration, until side agreements dealing with
environmental and labour issues were reached last month. Many Democrats in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, including some in the powerful <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> delegation, are
uncommitted. With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by
<DATE>January 1</DATE>, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and
visible.
<PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> was chosen for the job, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> observers say, because he has
proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a
controversial battle. '<PERSON>Bill Daley</PERSON> is no <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> neophyte. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> needs
someone with political sense to move this thing through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Daley</PERSON>
has the connections,' says a fellow <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lobbyist.
Opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a
potential political pothole for <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON>'s talents have been
summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the
agreement.
The president needs 218 votes in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> to ratify <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. The
administration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>
ally and fellow <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Democrat, <PERSON>Mr Dan Rostenkowski</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
ways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 Democrats on his
committee. However, <PERSON>Mr Rostenkowski</PERSON> is under investigation for improper use
of his post office perks and faces an uneasy future.
By rough count, <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic
representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement:
those along the border with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and those with big agricultural, consumer
product, or manufacturing export interests.
His Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to the
public tactics of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s most prominent opponent, <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s
populist anti-Nafta campaign touts the 'giant sucking sound' that will be
heard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> border.
'It is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles,' says <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> political
commentator <PERSON>Mr Bruce DuMont</PERSON>. '<PERSON>Bill Daley</PERSON> is like a Stealth bomber. You may
not see him, but you'll see the results.'
<PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> has taken four months out from his <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> law firm to lead the
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> push. He recently rejoined the firm after a three-year stint as
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Amalgamated Bank of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, which was founded by the
<ORGANIZATION>Amalgamated Textile Workers</ORGANIZATION> union in <DATE>1922</DATE>. Although it passed into private
ownership in <DATE>1966</DATE>, its board is still dominated by high-profile union
officials.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> may be banking on <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON>'s union ties to help the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> effort.
However, <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON>, by pushing <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, runs the risk of alienating his union
supporters. <PERSON>Mr Jim Jontz</PERSON>, former congressman from <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> and director of
the anti-Nafta Citizen's Trade Campaign, said: 'I don't know why <PERSON>Bill Daley</PERSON>
would want to be in a position like that. It's just wrong.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: Congress gears up for vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDESPREAD assumption is that if the North American Free Trade Agreement
is defeated in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> tonight the cause of liberalised
world trade is in deep trouble.
There is little doubt, for example, that an even bigger cloud will promptly
gather over the head of the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>, itself due to be completed by the
congressionally mandated deadline of <DATE>December 15</DATE>.
Yet there is one element in this equation which may not stand up to scrutiny
 -that a defeat for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> denotes such a depth of protectionism in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
that even if the Round is concluded it, too, would face certain rejection on
<LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>.
The pro-Nafta forces, led with exceptional intensity as the vote approaches
by President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, understandably prefer to confine public
connections between the two to warnings of the fearful consequences for the
wider agreement and for the damage a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> defeat would inflict on <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
leadership as it pursues a more open global trading regime.
In private, however, <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s supporters, and even some of its opponents,
will even go so far as to argue that a cathartic rejection of the
hemispheric pact would, if anything, reinforce prospects of the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
Round getting through. But to admit this openly would, for the
administration, have the effect of lowering the stakes and thus raising
chances of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s rejection.
Everything, of course, initially depends on there being a <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> agreement at
all, the hopes for which will certainly not be improved if <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> goes down.
But US diplomats are quite encouraged by signals from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that French
resistance to agricultural concessions may be softening and that it will not
use a defeat for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> as a cover for its own refusal to reach agreement in
the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Edouard Balladur</PERSON>, prime minister, is understood to have been particularly
impressed by <DATE>last week</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION> report which concluded that a <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> agreement
could enrich the world by as much as Dollars 270bn by <DATE>2002</DATE>, the highest
independent estimate yet of the potential accrued benefits.
But the key to the more optimistic <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> private scenario is the sense that it
will be hard to duplicate in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> the sort of opposition to the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
Round that, win or lose, has characterised the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> debate.
Some elements of the anti-Nafta coalition, which includes the far right and
the progressive left, will remain dead set against the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr
Ralph Nader</PERSON>'s populist consumer movement, for example, sees it as yet
another plot by multinational corporations to extend their hegemony over the
international economy.
The '<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> First' lobby, associated with <PERSON>Mr Pat Buchanan</PERSON>, the conservative
ideologue-politician, is inherently suspicious of international
entanglements. <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, last year's independent presidential
candidate, is also making threatening noises against the Round. But the
clout of the populists in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> still does not even remotely approximate
that of organised labour.
And the trade union movement, which has made <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> into such an immediate
life-or-death jobs issue that it has entered into unholy alliances with the
populists of the right, has no record of entrenched opposition to global
trading accords as a matter of first principle.
Indeed, since President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> secured passage in <DATE>1962</DATE> of his Trade
Expansion Act, no global bill has faced a tough fight in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. This is
essentially because congressmen, including those on the left of the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, do not like being labelled protectionist. Vice president
<PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> knows this full well from his years in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
Gatt agreements, often imperfectly understood on Capitol Hill, rarely can be
construed to pose particular threats to the constituencies of individual
members. As one lobbyist observed this week, 'It is hard to get people in
<LOCATION>Evanston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, excited about competition from <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>.'
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, deals with two neighbours, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the
second of whom is demonstrably different from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> politically, socially,
and in its economic development. It is a very particular <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> policy
initiative, with no exact antecedents.
Any consolation that believers in free trade may take from the above
argument does not reduce the importance of tonight's vote. Even allowing for
the hyperboles being thrown by both sides, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> political bottom line is
that the authority of the president is at stake, as may be the political
future of this incumbent, <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>. This, in turn, has imponderable
international ramifications on issues way beyond free trade.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Trade pact vote hanging in the balance: Arm-twisting on
Nafta will go on to the last minute before the US Congress decides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE debating, cajoling and arm-twisting will continue up to the very last
minute this week as members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> prepare for <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s crucial vote
in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>
with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
The congressional votes have been counted, recounted and double-counted, and
still no-one can predict the outcome with real confidence.
'The undecided members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> still hold the balance,' Vice-President
<PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> said yesterday.
If <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> passes the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, it is expected to be approved more easily by the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. It would then come into effect on <DATE>January 1</DATE>, lowering tariffs and
dismantling trade barriers between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> said this <DATE>weekend</DATE> that he had won 27 members over to
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in the three days since <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> debated the issue with <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>
on television, and claimed to have the necessary momentum to win on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. One more member, <PERSON>Ms Maria Cantwell</PERSON>, was due to announce her
support yesterday, despite <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s anti-Nafta rally in her <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>
district.
But Congressman <PERSON>David Bonior</PERSON>, the Democratic whip who is leading the battle
in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, said he had topped the 218 needed to win in the
434-member <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
'We have about 222 votes going into <DATE>this weekend</DATE> and we think we are going
to hold our votes,' <PERSON>Mr Bonior</PERSON> said yesterday, though other anti-Nafta
campaigners said they wanted a cushion of at least eight or nine members to
counter last-minute defections.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>'s strategy for winning the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote is built on gaining
around 100 of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>'s 258 Democrats and around 120 of the 175
Republicans.
Some pro-Nafta campaigners believe they will have the Democratic votes they
are counting on, but worry that the Republicans are so far assured of only
105 members and will be hard pressed to find their 120-vote contribution.
In the <DATE>last month</DATE>, however, the administration has been hard at work on a
wider spread of side-deals to alloy the doubts of wavering members.
'The only deal that hasn't been made is for working families,' <PERSON>Mr Bonior</PERSON>
complained.
Votes have been hard to buy. Deals on citrus and sugar won fewer vote
commitments than the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> had hoped for, and the promise of a <ORGANIZATION>North
American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION> doubled its yield this week when Congressman <PERSON>Ed
Pastor</PERSON> cited it as a reason he would vote for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
Asparagus growers and airlines have also received a helping hand, but the
administration denied that it had promised to build sewers or bridges in the
districts of uncommitted members.
What many congressmen are looking for, however, is a political umbrella. <PERSON>Mr
Clinton</PERSON> offered one to hesitant Republicans by promising to help them in
next year's congressional elections if his fellow Democrats bring up their
vote for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> against them.
Congressional vote counters say that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to pass by more than
one or two votes, if it passes at all. Several members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> may have
promised the president that theirs will not be the vote that kills the trade
pact; if the Ayes top 218, there will be a rush of these provisional <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
supporters to vote No.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> yesterday raised the prospect of a broad free trade
zone in the western hemisphere by putting the whole of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> back at
the centre of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade policy.
Speaking at a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> press conference, he promised to build on the
<ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> by
expanding it to include free-market democracies such as <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.
The president, who has been fighting an uphill battle to win <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
approval for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, predicted that the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> would give
its backing in its deciding vote next week. 'I honestly believe we're going
to win it now,' he said.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said he did not want to exaggerate the potential job gains to be
derived from <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> alone, although he believed it was clear it would create
more jobs than it lost.
Much greater opportunities would come, however, when the pact could be
expanded to other market-oriented economies and with the successful
conclusion of the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of negotiations on the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade</ORGANIZATION>.
'The real job growth . . . will come when all the other Latin American
democracies and free-market economies also join in a great trade group with
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
'And it will come because, once this happens, we will have enormously
increased influence in the world community to argue that we ought to adopt a
worldwide trade agreement before the end of the year,' he added.
After <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> debate between vice-president <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr
Ross Perot</PERSON>, the former independent presidential candidate, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> sought
to portray next week's <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> vote as critical for the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>'s ability to
negotiate freer trade opportunities from its partners not only in <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION> but also in the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> warned in the debate that a defeat for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would make conclusion
of the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> round difficult.
An expansion of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> to include the rest of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> was promised by
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON>Mr George Bush</PERSON>. But little has been heard of such
talk in recent months as the prospects of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> accepting free trade even
with neighbouring <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> seemed so remote.
Mexican stocks soared 81.49 points to a record close at 2,035.33, and the
peso recovered because of optimism over the result of the Gore-Perot debate.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Clinton steps up campaign for backing over Nafta: President
accuses unions of 'roughshod' tactics on free trade agreement

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> turned up the political heat yesterday on opponents
of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> by accusing <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> organised labour
of using 'roughshod, muscle-bound' tactics to defeat the agreement in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
His attack on the labour movement, a traditional bastion of his own
Democratic party, underlined the importance he is attaching to the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
vote in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>November 17</DATE>.
The vote is widely seen as crucial not just to ratification of the accord
between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> but also to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade policy in general and
to the success of the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of world trade negotiations, due to be
completed by <DATE>December 15</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, whose comments came in a morning television interview, left the
impression that he was more concerned about pressure being exerted on
members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> by the trade unions - by threatening to withhold
financial support and to run candidates against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> supporters - than he
was by the publicity campaign waged against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire and last year's independent presidential candidate.
The president also criticised <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> business for not doing enough to support
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, at least compared with labour's grassroots campaign against the
agreement. But he was confident that Vice-President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> would acquit
himself well in his televised debate with <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>, scheduled for prime time
tomorrow night, because of his 'command of the facts'.
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>, warming up for the TV encounter, yesterday afternoon addressed
supporters in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, and claimed there was evidence that he was to
be the target of an assassination attempt by a pro-Nafta group either at
<LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> or at the debate with <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, in his interview, said <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> was adept at 'keeping things
stirred up'. He denied he was boosting <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s apparently declining
popularity by agreeing to the debate, noting that 'he has enough money to
elevate himself'. The president remained confident that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would have the
votes by <DATE>November 17</DATE>, even though they did not exist today. In particular,
he emphasised the safeguard clauses in <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s 'side agreements' protecting
against surges in imports from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
Only if these proved inadequate and there was overwhelming evidence that the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> was losing jobs would he contemplate renegotiating <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
But Congressman <PERSON>David Bonior</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, chief <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> opponent in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>,
claimed yesterday to be 'on the brink' of winning the 217 votes needed to
vote the agreement down.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> stressed the serious international consequences of rejecting the
agreement. It would, he said, send the wrong message to Asian leaders he was
to meet in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> the day after the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> vote - a view echoed yesterday by
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republican leader, <PERSON>Mr Robert Dole</PERSON>.
Passage, on the other hand, would constitute 'a clear statement' that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
was intent on 'competing and winning' in international markets and was
committed to global free trade. It would put additional pressure on <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to complete the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of trade talks by the mid-December
deadline.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's first big challenge: meet
Salinas and save Nafta - The two men have much in common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON his maiden foray into international diplomacy, President-elect <PERSON>Bill
Clinton</PERSON> is going only one state away - to <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, where he will today
meet Mexican President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas</PERSON>.
The two presidents will find they have much in common. Both attended
university abroad (<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Salinas</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>) and became
young government reformers with pro-business views. Both are 'policy wonks'
 -fascinated with the technicalities of making government work. They are
both 'baby boomers' and know that unless they 'bond' swiftly, the future of
the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> - involving the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> - is at risk.
However, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> assured <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON>Brian Mulroney</PERSON> by
telephone yesterday that he would not be left out of any serious discussions
with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. The meeting with <PERSON>Mr Salinas</PERSON> would only be a
'get-acquainted session'.
It was <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the independent presidential candidate, who fanned the
burning coals of public doubt about <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> into blazing opposition during the
televised campaign debates. The quirky <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire repeatedly claimed
to hear 'a sucking sound' to the south, drawing <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> manufacturing jobs out of
the country.
Those who opposed the agreement - carefully cultivated by grassroots
environmental, labour and citizen groups - had little difficulty in
extracting promises from numerous congressmen to oppose the treaty. It
stands in danger of defeat.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> should have already won favour with the Mexican president, by
agreeing not to demand a renegotiation. Instead he promised to negotiate
'supplemental' agreements to protect the environment and labour standards
and guard against import surges.
Among <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s Democratic supporters are three factions: business
groups, which care only that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> offers opportunity for new investment,
markets and cheap labour; the opponents, who believe the pact can be
improved with tough enforcement measures; and those - many in unions - who
will work to kill any deal.
There is also organised opposition in both <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and the
citizens from the three countries will marry their views in a common paper
to be delivered this month.
Although there are some differences in interpretation of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> text,
most opponents say the current version would depress wages and employment
levels, diminish labour rights and standards, degrade the environment and
promote massive migration and human rights violations.
'<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is by no stretch of the imagination free trade,' says <PERSON>Ms Thea Lee</PERSON> of
the labour-supported <ORGANIZATION>Economic Policy Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 'It is an investment
agreement and a sophisticated form of managed trade for the multinational
corporations.'
The <ORGANIZATION>Economic Strategy Institute</ORGANIZATION>, in a recent report called '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>: Making it
Better', concluded that the pact as it now stands would stimulate foreign
investment in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, but at the expense of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> industry.
The opposition has grown so strong that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lobbyists acknowledge the
necessity of negotiating the side agreements and presenting them as a 'new'
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, different from the one savaged by <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>.
'We have to reposition the issue to take the focus away from the loss of
manufacturing jobs and focus on the overall closer economic and political
relationship between two neighbours,' says <PERSON>Mr Harry Freeman</PERSON>, a trade
lobbyist.
Those willing to accept a 'new' <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> want one which would encourage
pollution clean-up in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, raise standards of food safety, and boost the
living standards of Mexican workers. Their goal is 'the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> model' under
which countries were only admitted after democratic reforms took root and
the poorer countries are given compensatory payment for social programmes.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> has promised to establish a strong environmental protection
commission with substantial powers and resources to prevent and clean up
water pollution and encourage enforcement of air pollution laws.
But he has been vague about the relationship between the side agreements and
the original <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> text. The critics will insist that this linkage be
formalised, so failure by any of the three governments to meet their
obligations on environment and labour could be punished by higher tariffs.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> will also have to make changes to the proposed dispute settlement
mechanism, according to <PERSON>Mr Alex Hittle</PERSON>, a spokesman for Friends of the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, who is willing to support 'a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> with teeth'. The president-elect
apparently envisions a process under which citizen groups would take their
complaints to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> officials, who would then pass them to their Mexican or
Canadian partners.
Environmentalists want the process opened to public participation. The
current text says both sides in a dispute must agree before outsiders are
brought into the process.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> will be leaned on hard, and he will have to press <PERSON>Mr Salinas</PERSON>, who
in turn has signalled that the price of new negotiations could be a
multi-billion-dollar fund to help pay for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to develop infrastructure
and clean up its environmental. He may also reopen talks about labour
mobility.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Clinton pledges trade initiatives: Approval of Nafta hailed
as boost for Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JUBILANT <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> president <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> for his Asian summit
yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and promising new
initiatives to liberalise world trade.
His mission, he said, was to drive down world trade barriers as a spur to US
economic revival.
Earlier, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> declared from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> lawn that the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION>' approval of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> was 'a
long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous
international competition.
The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote gave the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 'the economic, political and moral standing' to
make its case, he said, not only with the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation</ORGANIZATION> group but also in the push for a successful conclusion
to the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of global trade talks.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s optimism was echoed by trade officials in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> who said the
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote had improved the chances of an agreement on trade liberalisation
measures under the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by
the <DATE>December 15</DATE> deadline.
<PERSON>Mr Peter Sutherland</PERSON>, director general of <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>, said: 'There is no negotiator
in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> today who isn't breathing a sigh of relief as a result of the
vote.'
The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> debate had cast a shadow over <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> talks for several weeks, tying
US negotiators' hands even though time was perilously short. It is now hoped
that talks next week in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> between <PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade
representative, and Sir <PERSON>Leon Brittan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> commissioner, will give
long-awaited impetus to the negotiations.
The <ORGANIZATION>US Senate</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> next week, as is its Mexican
counterpart. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said President <PERSON>Salinas</PERSON> had invited <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> vice-president
<PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> for the Mexican side of the ratification process. The new trading
bloc, which includes <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, is to take effect on <DATE>January 1</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had
appeared likely even as the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debated the agreement. The majority was
composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of the 258 Democrats, with
the sole independent voting against.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> thanked all who had voted in favour of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and hoped
that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the day could be applied to
other great issues facing the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, such as healthcare reform.
The president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition and to
heal the open wounds in his especially with organised labour.
Trade union leaders remained unmollified. The full hierarchy of the <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION>,
the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to express regret
at <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s passage. <PERSON>Mr Bill Bywater</PERSON>, head of the electricians, warned those
Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're going to make sure we get even at the
polls.' <PERSON>Mr Owen Bieber</PERSON>, of the car workers, said <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> votes next week
would be duly noticed, too.
<PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, a loser in the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> debate, also threatened retaliation by
his independent movement.
US stocks fell after investors took the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote as a signal to take
profits. The Dow closed off 19.01 points at 3,685.34.
In <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Sutherland</PERSON>, at a briefing to underline trade liberalising
moves that have already been provisionally agreed, warned of difficulties
ahead. He said: 'The overall picture is heartening, but there are still
significant difficulties in bringing the round to a conclusion.'
In <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, Sir <PERSON>Leon</PERSON> said the vote would remove a big distraction for the
US and allow a final drive for a <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> agreement.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Clinton still requires a winning Nafta vision: The
president's uphill battle to win the hearts of Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> tomorrow formally launches his uphill battle to make the
<ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> acceptable to a dubious <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
With ex-presidents <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> expected at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> for a
Rose Garden ceremony, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> will sign the supplemental agreements on
labour, environment and import surges negotiated over seven months with
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> is also hoping to acquire the salesmanship skills of <PERSON>Mr Lee
Iacocca</PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> and a pitchman notable enough to challenge
<PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, leader of the strong <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> opposition.
There is now a determination in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> to portray the pact, along
with its side agreements, as '<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>' and therefore one which
should be more acceptable to labour and environmentalists. However, if the
side pacts have won any adherents, they have yet to announce their
conversion.
As is usual with trade issues, the spotlight is on <PERSON>Mr Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority leader, whose backing is seen as key to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s passage in
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr Gephardt</PERSON> leaves a tantalising opening in his current
insistence that he cannot support the pact - as it stands.
<PERSON>Mr Gephardt</PERSON> has been demanding for a long time a fixed funding source,
dedicated to pay for environmental clean-ups at the US-Mexican border and
for worker retraining. An outline of the financing plans may be released
tomorrow.
The administration plans to propose a scaled down version of a <ORGANIZATION>North
American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION>. However, this could be expanded by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>,
where there is support for an institution capable also of start-up business
loans in districts threatened by job losses.
Currently, the proposal is to limit the <ORGANIZATION>Nadbank</ORGANIZATION> to environmental projects at
the border and to locate it within the <ORGANIZATION>InterAmerican Development Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
However, congressional supporters of a larger bank may well prevail when the
plan gets to <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>.
It has been suggested that <PERSON>Mr Gephardt</PERSON> might find acceptable a cross-border
tax which would provide the embryonic funding for a <ORGANIZATION>Nadbank</ORGANIZATION>. The tax would
be 'finite' - in place only until it raised the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
currently envisaged from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> for paid-in capital - which may
make it acceptable to the business lobby.
Vice President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> yesterday suggested that the implementation of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
may be delayed beyond its scheduled launch on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>. He
acknowledged that the vote may not come until early next year, but scoffed
at press reports that the administration is backing away from the
controversial agreement.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> has established a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> 'war room', reminiscent of the
quick-response team which won high praise for its wit and speed in last
year's presidential campaign. <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> captains are in place - <PERSON>Mr Bill Daley</PERSON>,
an accomplished Democratic backroom deal-maker, and <PERSON>Mr Bill Frenzel</PERSON>, a
former <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Republican congressman - although neither has been visible
much in public.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s lack of enthusiasm in defending <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> has fuelled doubts about
his commitment to the cause. He has seemed remote from the fray, unable to
inspire the public and unwilling to articulate a vision of an expanded home
market with more jobs to gain than to lose. He can hardly be pleased about
the rift it is creating between the moderate and liberal wings of the
Democratic party.
However, reports that the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> is backing away from <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> have
'enraged' the administration. One jubilant official said: 'The political
will is there; the fight is now starting.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Liberal party softens its approach to
freer trade - Trade Pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>CANADA</LOCATION>'S Liberal party has substantially softened its stand on North
American free trade since the last general election in <DATE>1988</DATE>. During that
election, which they lost, the Liberals made abrogation of the US-Canada
free trade pact a key plank of their policy platform.
By this year's campaign, however, the Liberals had pledged only to seek
renegotiation of some elements of the <DATE>1989</DATE> accord, the <ORGANIZATION>FTA</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>North
American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>, which includes <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 'Abrogating trade
agreements should only be a last resort if satisfactory changes cannot be
negotiated,' the Liberals' campaign platform said.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is due to come into force on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>. Diplomats and political
observers predict that, with a little help from President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of multilateral trade talks, the Liberals
will eventually sign on to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in time to meet the implementation date.
The outgoing Progressive Conservative government pushed <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> enabling
legislation through <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>summer</DATE>. Only formal promulgation is
required to put it into law.
The Liberals pledged in the campaign to seek four specific 'improvements' to
the <ORGANIZATION>FTA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>: a subsidies code, an anti-dumping code, a more effective
dispute settlement mechanism, and the same protection for Canadian energy
producers as is envisaged for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
Some Liberal concerns would be addressed if the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION> is
successfully wrapped up this year. The previous Conservative government
tried but failed to negotiate a subsidies package in the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>FTA</ORGANIZATION>.
Anti-Nafta pressure on <PERSON>Mr Chretien</PERSON> would also be eased if the <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION>
ratifies <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Votes are scheduled in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> next month.
On other issues, diplomats predict that <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> will find a
face-saving formula which will enable <PERSON>Mr Chretien</PERSON> to point out that his
concerns are being met, and allow him to proceed with implementation of
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. A visit to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> will be among the new prime minister's early
priorities.
President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said yesterday he did not expect the election to have an
impact on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
The results of the election should also make it easier for <PERSON>Mr Chretien</PERSON> to
press ahead with <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. The left-leaning New Democratic Party, the only
parliamentary group unambiguously opposed to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, ended up with only eight
seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION>. The two regional parties, the <LOCATION>Bloc Quebecois</LOCATION>
and the Reform party, which will form the bulk of the opposition, generally
favour the free trade agreements.
Even within the Liberal party itself, support for free trade is more vocal
and opposition more muted than it was <DATE>five years ago</DATE>.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Gore-Perot joust seen as gamble for Clinton

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> has taken a political gamble in sending Vice
President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> into televised battle with <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> populist,
on the merits of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
The confrontation was last night fixed for <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> evening in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, with <PERSON>Larry King</PERSON>, the talk show host, as moderator. There may be
other TV debates before the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> votes on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> on
<DATE>November 17</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> is giving a hour-long interview on one of tomorrow's
regular <DATE>Sunday</DATE> morning current affairs programmes. <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is certain to
consume a fair part of this.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr Warren Christopher</PERSON>, secretary of state, warned <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> of the
dire consequences of rejecting <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Drawing together the treaty, the
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round trade negotiations and the <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> later this
month, he said, 'these are 40 days that can shake the economic world and
shape <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s future position in it'.
Last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s round of off-year elections, which saw the Democrats lose
three big races in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, might have stiffened
resistance to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> among the 50 plus Democrats still reckoned to be
undecided.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was not an issue in any of the contests but the results have been
freely interpreted as demonstrating that <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s political coattails
are very short and that congressmen may be inclined to pay more attention to
local opinion against the agreement.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> also thinks <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s credibility is diminishing, a
conclusion borne out by public opinion polls. But <DATE>last year</DATE>'s three
televised presidential debates showed how effective he could be with his
homespun arguments.
It was considered inappropriate for <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> himself to take <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> on,
while fielding <PERSON>Mr Lee Iacocca</PERSON>, pugnacious former head of <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> and a
prominent pro-Nafta campaigner, might have resulted in verbal fireworks, but
too much on <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s terms.
<PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON>, his many years in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> notwithstanding, is not a natural
television debater. His confrontation last year with then vice president <PERSON>Dan
Quayle</PERSON> showed him to be a bit stiff. But it is thought his dignity and
ability to marshal arguments and facts will stand up well against <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s
tendency to shoot wildly, if divertingly, from the hip.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Nafta vote raises Gatt deal hopes - US
decision means just half of the battle is won, says Sutherland

TRADE officials urged yesterday that <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> congressional approval of the <ORGANIZATION>North
American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> should be used to secure a successful
completion of the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of trade liberalisation talks.
<PERSON>Mr Peter Sutherland</PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade</ORGANIZATION>, praised President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s success, but noted that the
234-200 vote in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> was 'just half of the battle
won'.
The priority would now necessarily turn to successful completion of the
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round.
'<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and similar enterprises - no less the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> - cannot thrive
in isolation. They are not economically self-sustainable and must be part of
a broader world trading system under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>,' he said.
'The other half of the battle, making the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> a genuine positive force in
the world economy, must be the conclusion of the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round.'
The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote cast a shadow over <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> talks in recent weeks, tying <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
negotiators' hands when the time remaining for completing the round has been
perilously short, and difficult deadlock-breaking compromises have been
urgently needed.
Amid rising optimism that a long-elusive trade-liberalsing package is
finally within negotiators' grasp, expectations have run high in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> that
the success of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote would free top US and <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> trade negotiators
meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> early next week to provide long-awaited impetus.
<PERSON>Mr Sutherland</PERSON>'s comments came during a briefing intended to underline trade
liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed in <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
Round negotiations, and to focus on what is at risk if the small number of
outstanding differences result in failure.
'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said.
In <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, Sir <PERSON>Leon Brittan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> trade commissioner, welcomed the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
vote in favour of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, saying it would remove a big distraction for the
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration and allow a final drive for agreement in <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> talks.
However, <PERSON>Sir Leon</PERSON> sounded a note of caution, telling reporters that he
needed to look at the 'small print' to see what the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> may have
offered members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to get their vote and how it might affect <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>.
With only four weeks remaining to the <DATE>December 15</DATE> deadline for a <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> deal,
<PERSON>Sir Leon</PERSON> is due to hold talks with <PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade
representative, in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> next week.
Meanwhile, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> said it was now up to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to produce 'new proposals' to
bring the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> negotiations to the same successful conclusion as the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
accord.
<PERSON>Mr Gerard Longuet</PERSON>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s foreign trade minister, said the the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>
administration could and should henceforth 'devote itself fully to the
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round'.
<PERSON>Mr Sutherland</PERSON> warned that 'if what is currently on the table is now lost,'
then 'the threat from unreconcilable disputes will be intense'.
<PERSON>Mr Gijs de Vries</PERSON>, a Dutch member of the European Parliament speaking for the
body's liberal group, hailed the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote as a 'victory for common sense'.
'The only 'sucking sound' Americans will hear is the sound of exports going
south,' he said, referring to <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>'s oft-quoted description of
Americans losing their jobs to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> as a result of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Traders nonplussed by trade vote - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE POLITICS of international trade can be devilishly complicated
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
just try explaining what <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round or <ORGANIZATION>Blair House</ORGANIZATION> are all
about - but <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the
North American Free Trade Agreement: if <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passes the treaty next
week, it will be good for the economy, good for US companies, good for the
stock markets, and good for President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>.
Their reasoning is quite simple. Investors believe that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will lift
corporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the
three signatory countries the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, with its superior industrial productivity
rates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic
benefits. The expectation is that growth in <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>
will outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south.
Investors are not alone in their optimistic view of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Most Wall Street
economists are pro-Nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent
polls are to be believed.
There is, however, the dark side of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> to consider. What if <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
votes no? Investors fear that a rejection of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would have dangerous
knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION> and eventually <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and endangering vital trade negotiations over
the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>. By coincidence, the day after next week's <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote,
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> will be in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> for a trade conference with leaders of <ORGANIZATION>Asian
Pacific Nations</ORGANIZATION>. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, the
President's authority on trade issues will be compromised.
Investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would throw such a
spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of
international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic
growth.
In this scenario, inflation would be the biggest concern of markets. Many
economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating
collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global
inflation. Low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows,
which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets.
Thus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher
inflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are
already vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock
valuations.
Then there is the political cost of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s failure to consider. Although
the President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he
has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> through
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. On paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task,
because <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is controlled by Democrats.
Yet, opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> among Democratic legislators beholden to labour
interests is considerable. Anti-Nafta forces have warned that opening up
trade with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> will lead to a migration of American jobs south of the
border, where wages are much lower. Because the domestic labour market
remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary Americans.
The result is that the President faces a tough fight ensuring that the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
of Representatives votes to approve the treaty on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
As of yesterday, the outcome of the vote was deemed too close to call. Stock
markets in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, however, believe the chances of success for
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> improved this week. Share prices in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> rose on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and US stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> between Vice-President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s most
celebrated opponent.
Gore clearly bested <PERSON>Perot</PERSON> in a heated war of words, and polls taken over the
next few days revealed that more Americans had been won over to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
Whether this helped swing the votes of some anti-Nafta legislators the
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration's way remains to be seem.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. A week
ago bond yields jumped amid worries that resurgent economic growth might
rekindle inflation. Although data released this week on producer and
consumer prices showed that fears of rising inflation are, at least for now,
unjustified, equity investors remain nervous about rising bond yields.
Amid all the doubts over the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, one thing is certain, trading on markets
next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s
vote, which, like the battle over President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s first budget, will be
extremely close.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'They'd sell off bits of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> lawn for a vote if they could'
 - <PERSON>Jim Jontz</PERSON>, head of the Fair Trade Campaign against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> 'It's one
president, all the living former presidents, 41 governors, 14 Nobel
Laureates and 284 economists versus <PERSON>Perot</PERSON>, <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>; it's your
choice'
 - <PERSON>Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade representative
Barring the unforeseen, the latest addition to the matriarchy of all
political battles will be finally decided on <DATE>November 17</DATE> when 258 Democrats,
175 Republicans, and one independent in the 435-member <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION> (there is one vacant seat) vote on whether to approve the
North American Free Trade Agreement linking the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> on
<DATE>January 1</DATE>. A simple majority of 218 is all that is needed. If it passes, the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> will almost certainly follow suit; if it fails, the upper chamber
does not have to act.
The stakes are enormous - for the political credibility of President <PERSON>Bill
Clinton</PERSON> early in his term and for the legacy of President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas</PERSON> as
he nears the end of his, for the evolution of the Mexican and US economies,
and for a global trading structure in which a <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round agreement
scheduled to be reached by <DATE>December 15</DATE> may be unattainable if <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> goes
down.
Conventional party lines are irrelevant in the intense retail political war
now going on in pursuit of the 218-vote nirvana. More Republicans, perhaps
as many as 120 according to congressman <PERSON>Jim Kolbe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, far fewer
according to <PERSON>Mr Jim Jontz</PERSON>, a former congressman from <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, will vote for
than against, not least because the original <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was negotiated by the
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration. This leaves <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> needing at most 40 per cent of
his own party to triumph - and therein lies the problem.
For the Democratic coalition that just - by one vote - sustained the
president in the great budget battle against unanimous Republican
opposition, is in tatters. In <DATE>July</DATE> it was the 'new' Democrats, especially
moderates from the south, who deserted <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> while the old liners -
labour, liberals, blacks - held their noses and held fast. On <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, the
positions are in good measure reversed.
According to Ms <PERSON>Lori Wallach</PERSON>, a leading co-ordinator of the 'anti-'
campaign, the 'no' camp already numbers 208-210 'including some leaners'.
<PERSON>Bill Daley</PERSON>, drafted from his <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> domain to direct the 'yes' campaign,
disputes this estimate, counts about 195 in favour and says that some 55
Democrats are still undecided. <PERSON>Mr Jontz</PERSON> disagrees, reckoning there are now
more Republicans than Democrats on the fence. He thinks the freshman class -
<DATE>66</DATE> Democrats and 48 Republicans - is particularly resistant to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
Both sides hail and blast each new convert. Democrat <PERSON>John Dingell</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> came out for the 'noes<DATE>' this week</DATE>, but <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> counters that he
could never understand why anybody thought he would do anything different.
Ms <PERSON>Wallach</PERSON> is equally dismissive of the impact of the 'yes' declarations of
Democrats <PERSON>Joe Kennedy</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Esteban Torres</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.
The latter, she insists, probably could not carry the 18-member Hispanic
caucus.
The politics of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> have produced uneasy dalliances among political
heavyweights. In one bed lie the president, the Republican leadership,
including <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON>, a fervent conservative, the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> majority leader,
the Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, most leaders of big business, and some prominent
environmental groups: in the other can be found the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority leader
(<PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>) and most of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic House</ORGANIZATION> whips, including <PERSON>David
Bonior</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, the chief anti-Nafta strategist, plus <PERSON>Ralph Nader</PERSON>, the
consumer advocate, most of the labour unions, <PERSON>Pat Buchanan</PERSON>, the right-wing
ideologue, and <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>, last year's independent presidential candidate.
Ms <PERSON>Wallach</PERSON>, who portrays the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> divide as one between 'populists and the
elites', says there is little top-level contact with <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>, who first
spoke of the 'giant sucking sound' of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> jobs going south to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, but
that his troops offer access to conservatives and small businesses. <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON>
says that '<PERSON>Perot</PERSON>'s credibility is diminishing because he has become a
politician', an assessment borne out by several recent opinion polls.
Both sides agree that the role played by President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> himself is
crucial. 'He is my number one worry - never underestimate the power of the
presidency,' says <PERSON>Ms Wallach</PERSON>. He got off to a slow start. In the <DATE>summer</DATE> he
was consumed by the budget, and more recently distracted by healthcare,
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION>. Meanwhile the opposition was off and running early.
The administration pinned a lot of its midsummer hopes on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s 'side
agreements', covering Mexican environmental and labour laws and guarding
against import 'surges', meeting most objections. But these were only
completed in <DATE>mid-August</DATE>, later than planned, and were only partly
successful. Six prominent US environmental groups came out in favour, but
union opposition became entrenched. Most important, Congressman <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON>,
whose backing could probably have ensured passage, declared he was not
satisfied.
<PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> insists it does not matter that the president started late because
'in politics, decisions are only taken in the last few days'. Whatever the
merits of this argument, there is no questioning that the pro-Nafta campaign
is now in full swing, with plans that <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> himself do little other
than argue for the agreement in the next two weeks.
Every day brings a new media show. Last week saw Products Day on the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> lawn, a display of 175 goods that would benefit from <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Last
weekend the president went to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to maintain that <ORGANIZATION>JFK</ORGANIZATION> would have been
pro-Nafta. On <DATE>Monday</DATE> he appeared at an electronic 'town meeting' with
members of the <ORGANIZATION>American Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. Later this week he is in
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>. On <DATE>Sunday</DATE> an hour-long TV interview is scheduled.
About twice a week he has 15-20 congressmen in his office for a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
exhortation. He works the phones constantly, and all members of his cabinet
are fully engaged, sometimes inventively. <PERSON>Mr Kantor</PERSON>'s latest pitch is that
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and would, along with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, seek to profit from its
defeat. The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> 'war room', operating out of the Old Executive Office
building next to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, co-ordinates it all and makes sure that
businessmen keep up the pressure on individual members.
Certain actions, both substantive and personal, get taken with <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in
view. Last week's creation of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Development Bank</ORGANIZATION>, with its
funds available for border clean-up, obviously helped Congressman <PERSON>Torres</PERSON>
come off the fence. At the other extreme, <ORGANIZATION>Congressman E Clay Shaw</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
Republican, is demanding that the administration put pressure on <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> for
the extradition of an accused rapist. <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> says: 'We have made our views
known to the Mexican government on this, though they knew about it already.'
All this activity is matched with fervour and skill by the other side. Ms
<PERSON>Wallach</PERSON> claims to have kept a lid on vote switching. She points out that
Congressman <PERSON>Kweisi Mfume</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, leader of the 38-strong black
Democratic caucus previously so loyal to <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, is helping <PERSON>Mr Bonior</PERSON>
garner votes against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, and that only one black congressman has come out
in favour. On broader policy issues, both camps were bombarding the media
with their respective spins after last week's Canadian election result.
'They've thrown everything at us, but it hasn't made a difference so far,'
she insists.
With two weeks to go, neither side will publicly admit the possibility of
defeat. <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> says he will not sell the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> lawn, but seen
crossing it yesterday was a gaggle of living Nobel Laureates, including
<PERSON>Henry Kissinger</PERSON>, last seen being nice to <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION>Martha's Vineyard</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>August</DATE>. The grass seemed in place.

TRADE officials said yesterday that <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> congressional approval of the <ORGANIZATION>North

<PERSON>Mr Peter Sutherland</PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement on Tariffs

that the vote in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, by 234 to

'The other half of the battle, making the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> a genuine positive force in

Trade negotiators in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> have set a <DATE>December 15</DATE> deadline for completion
of the round. The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote had cast a shadow over <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> talks for several

success of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote would allow top US and <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> trade negotiators
meeting in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> early next week to provide long-awaited impetus.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, before flying to his Asian summit in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
approval of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was 'a long step in the right direction' of more open
markets and more vigorous international competition.
The vote gave the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make
its case with the Asian leaders and in the final push to conclude the
<LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>.
The measure was passed by a far more comfortable margin than had appeared
likely even as the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debated the agreement.
<PERSON>Mr Sutherland</PERSON>'s comments came during a <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> briefing intended to underline
trade liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed, and to
focus on what is at risk if the few outstanding differences result in
failure.
'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said. 'The overall
picture is heartening, but there are still significant difficulties in
bringing the round to a conclusion.
'There is a lot there that should stimulate the participants with the
knowledge of how much they stand to lose.'
In <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, Sir <PERSON>Leon Brittan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> trade commissioner, also warmly welcomed
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> vote, saying it would remove a big distraction for the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>

next week.
A measure of concern exists that so much remains to be negotiated in the
<ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> talks, with so little time remaining. 'You have a feeling that each
side has spent half of its time calculating how to blame the other in the
event of a failure,' one <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> official said.

<TEXT>
THE FIGHT over the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> yesterday shifted
outside <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to the Congressional districts of members, sampling
public opinion at home during this Veterans<DATE>' Day holiday weekend</DATE>.
The pro-Nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of Vice President <PERSON>Al
Gore</PERSON> over <LOCATION>Texan</LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>, hoped they had finally captured the
elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> vote next
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. A <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the
trade pact between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> had shot up from 34 per cent
before the debate to 57 per cent after it.
<ORGANIZATION>Arthur Andersen &amp; Company</ORGANIZATION> yesterday released a survey, by its tax and
business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives
of medium-sized companies in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> strongly support
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
Meanwhile in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> the country's <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> launched a fierce attack on <PERSON>Mr
Perot</PERSON> and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious
response to <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s comments in the debate.
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and
democratic rights. He said just 34 families owned half the country, and some
85m others lived in poverty.
The Mexican <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement, supported by most political
parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments
expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack
and offend Mexicans. We condemn them as inadmissible and without
foundation.'
US opponents of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> believe that fear of job and investment losses to
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact.
'The only thing that matters is the economy,' said <PERSON>Mr Christopher Whalen</PERSON>, a
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> trade consultant.
'The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will have to look for other employment next year.'
Trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, Congressman <PERSON>David
Bonior</PERSON>, an anti-Nafta whip, on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> announced that he had 219 of 434
members pledged to vote against the pact. However, he needs at least 10-12
votes more than the majority to prevent last-minute switches, as the
<ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> increases its pressure.
The <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> this week has picked up 10 public endorsement votes, and
claims to have a total of 192. It is publishing a free 800 telephone number
with the offer to voters to send, free of charge, pro-Nafta telegrams to
their congressman.
Around the country, the opposition troops are planning rallies, marches,
town hall meetings and 'accountability meetings' with congressmen. Ms <PERSON>Lori
Wallach</PERSON>, an anti-Nafta leader, said <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would be won or lost in the
congressmen's home districts.
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend. The
anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta Claus</ORGANIZATION>' to the Capitol
to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> to a
reluctant <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

What turned the tide in the fight for Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VOCIFEROUS opposition to the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> first
surfaced three years ago when a coalition of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> labour, environmentalists,
consumer groups, farm and church organisations formed to oppose extension of
the 'fast track' authorisation, under which <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> agrees to vote on trade
pacts such as <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> without amendment.
These groups comprise the worker bees of the Democratic party, so it was
with trepidation that the supporters of then Governor <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> watched
their candidate endorse <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> during the primary and general election
campaigns last year.
<PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, the campaign chairman and now <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade representative,
said <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> immediately recognised that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would not be 'politically
viable' - with either the electorate or the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> later on - without the
side deals ultimately negotiated on labour, environment and unexpected
import surges.
The big business backers of the trade pact perceived that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was in deep
trouble when, during the presidential debates, <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the
independent candidate, repeatedly raised the threat of a 'giant sucking
sound' drawing <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> factories south of the US-Mexico border. The phrase found
resonance in the steady drumbeat of corporate cutback announcements,
fuelling worker insecurity as the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy restructures.
Organising against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> continued as negotiations over the supplemental
pacts dragged on for seven months. The administration was in a squeeze;
business, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> were resisting a strong deal guaranteeing the
right of Mexican workers to organise and strike. It was not clear that the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> unions would support any <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> at all.
Just as Republicans and the business community were grumbling that President
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> did not have his heart in <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> returned from its
<DATE>summer</DATE> recess alarmed about the pact's unpopularity, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> put on
a spectacular launch ceremony. On the bill were President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> at his
most passionate (inexplicably, he is always his best on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>) and the
endorsements of former Presidents <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>,
all of which came to symbolise the extraordinary bi-partisanship which in
the end got <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> through the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
Thereafter, a succession of <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> events, including <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> endorsements
by practically every living former cabinet official and economist,
presidential trips and speeches, just barely moved public opinion on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
'Four weeks ago not one person, outside a few, thought we could pass this
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>,' <PERSON>Mr Kantor</PERSON> said.
The president was eating with, jogging with and pressuring congressmen, but
making little apparent headway until Vice President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> suggested
debating <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>.
It was a brilliant strategy, because it personalised <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in the form of an
arrogant, secretive and peculiar <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire. <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s televised
threats - and those of labour - that they would eject from office all <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
supporters in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> was a big miscalculation. It caused resentment among
congressmen and a determination by some not to be seen as being in labour's
pocket.
Implicitly acknowledging that backroom deals would be key to passage, the
administration brought in as '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> czar' <PERSON>Mr William Daley</PERSON>, son of the late
<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> mayor 'Boss' <PERSON>Richard Daley</PERSON> and brother of the current mayor. It was
a series of deals that <PERSON>Mr Daley</PERSON> was involved in and which were detailed in
presidential letters to congressmen, and a turnaround in public opinion
after the debate, which brought a flood of endorsements just before the vote
and clinched the 234-200 victory.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Perot attacks Nafta over 'threat to jobs': Prince of the pie
charts returns to the screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>MR ROSS PEROT</PERSON>, independent presidential candidate in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, this
weekend accused the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration of using taxpayers' dollars to
promote the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
The Texan billionaire warned Americans that the pact with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>
would jeopardise their jobs.
In a paid television 'info-mercial', he made his case against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> with the
sort of pie charts and graphs he wielded during the presidential campaign,
and with film of Mexican slums.
Greedy factory owners would move south of the border to take advantage of a
minimum wage of <MONEY>58 US cents</MONEY> (37 pence) an hour, <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> said. The loss of
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> jobs would make it impossible to balance the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> budget.
'If you and I sit here complacently, it will create the giant sucking sound
I've been talking about,' he said of the job flight to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. He urged
voters to write '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> yes' or '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> no' on a piece of paper and send it to
their Congressmen, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and him.
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> excoriated the 'lobbyists in the employ of foreign governments',
who he said had written the agreement. He signed off the half-hour broadcast
somewhat awkwardly, concluding, 'I love you'.
Supplements to the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, signed last year for the US by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration, are being negotiated by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION>.
After that, the accord would need approval by the <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration had sought, even before the <PERSON>Perot</PERSON> appearance, to
limit the damage with a show for the press - billed as 'a serious in-depth
discussion' - by three members of the cabinet. Although they came prepared
with their own visuals, to argue that jobs would be lost with or without a
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, they inexplicably kept cameras out of the briefing room.
<PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade representative, used his graph to demonstrate how
exports to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> had soared in <DATE>1986-92</DATE>, creating 425,000 relatively
well-paid US jobs in the process. Handling the popular <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> gingerly, <PERSON>Mr
Kantor</PERSON> said the unpredictable billionaire had been 'misled' about the threat
of job losses. The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would enhance the prospects of small and medium <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
businesses which cannot penetrate <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s tariff walls.
'Opponents of this agreement are looking at the future through a rear-view
mirror,' he said.
When the presentation was taken up by <PERSON>Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson</PERSON>, head of the
council of economic advisers, the focus shifted from the impact of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
to the outcome if it were not to be enacted. <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s liberalisation 'could
easily be derailed', and many of the new jobs created could be lost, she
said. 'There's a great cost to not going forward.'
<PERSON>Mr Robert Reich</PERSON>, labour secretary, said: 'Long term, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> cannot compete
on the basis of low wages. The only way we can build up the American economy
is through a very different strategy premised on education, training,
infrastructure and resources in the private sector, to continue to invest in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Battle for hearts and minds over Nafta -
Guerrilla tactics versus White House pomp and press machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERRILLA tactics by <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION> were swamped by the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> pomp in
which <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> and three past <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> presidents this week endorsed the <ORGANIZATION>North
American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
But the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> hearing
to unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again and
again on evening news shows.
With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots
organisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread
public hostility against the pact with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. A new Wall Street
Journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest
level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
The continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff
announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration
with a formidable challenge. Fifty per cent of the Americans polled
disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created
than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that
US companies and workers could compete with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the
opposition's success in framing the debate against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> as a pact which
would cost jobs.
But they took heart from <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s presidential show: President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s
passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced;
President <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s attack on <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the populist billionaire, as a
demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s praise of
Mexican President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas</PERSON>; President <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s warning that the country
would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given
no work at home.
'It was a revival,' said <ORGANIZATION>Texas Congressman JJ Pickle</ORGANIZATION>. 'I think <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was
born again.'
To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
took off for <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> and top officials in his administration fanned out
on speaking tours across the country. Government agencies have been
mobilised for the battle, given pro-Nafta literature and instructed to boost
the pact in seminars and public forums.
Congressional committees have begun to examine the details in preparation
for writing its implementing legislation, now expected on the Hill in
<DATE>November</DATE>. It is believed this process may satisfy some of the Congressional
doubters, who are demanding a 'level playing field' and a speedup of Mexican
tariff reductions.
Pro and anti-Nafta forces are keeping the fax lines burning. A <ORGANIZATION>Greenpeace</ORGANIZATION>
release warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be
undermined if the pact is approved.
In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental,
citizen and labour groups, Vice president <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON>, Senator <PERSON>Max Baucus</PERSON> and
other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the
largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental
side pact, held a briefing to praise <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s environmental safeguards.
Seemingly unfazed by <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign,
one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk'
the <ORGANIZATION>Clinton Administration</ORGANIZATION> claim <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would create 200,000 jobs in the next
five years.
Unmindful of a television camera, its leaders plotted new strategies:
anti-Nafta resolution in 25 state legislatures; a letter writing campaign
and more.
Notable by his absence from the fray has been <PERSON>Mr Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>House
Majority Leader</ORGANIZATION>, who is said to be close to moving from tentative to
committed opposition. He will join forces with Congressman <PERSON>David Bonior</PERSON>, the
majority whip, and three of <PERSON>Mr Bonior</PERSON>'s lieutenants, leaving the <ORGANIZATION>House
Speaker</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Tom Foley</PERSON>, nearly alone on the defence, among the leadership.
'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> - the
very positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supporting
this,' <PERSON>Mr Foley</PERSON> acknowledged.
Without <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> relationship with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> could 'deteriorate,' and
'much of what people are worried about will happen, perhaps more speedily
without <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> than with it. Those things have to be presented more
forcefully.'

<TEXT>
THE NEXT three weeks promise to be decisive for the future of global free
trade. Will the world's trading powers be able to proceed down the home
stretch towards an agreement in the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round of the <ORGANIZATION>General Agreement
on Tariffs</ORGANIZATION> and Trade? Or will they have to brace themselves for an
escalation of bilateral trade conflicts that could poison international
relations and impair world economic growth? An initial answer may come on
<DATE>November 17</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>US House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> votes on whether to ratify
the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>) between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
Technically, the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote is quite separate from the wider <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round
negotiations; in practice, the two are intimately connected. If President
<PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> fails to prevail over <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s opponents - an alliance of trade
unionists, environmentalists and protectionists - he will be so weakened
that he will have little chance of gaining approval for the concessions
needed to secure a <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> agreement. If he wins, he can choose to press ahead
with concluding the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round by the deadline of mid-December, when his
'fast-track' negotiating mandate expires.
The good news is that after months of hesitation <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> has finally come
out fighting for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> with a series of campaigning speeches for the
agreement and an increasingly sophisticated lobbying effort aimed at
congressional waverers. As a result it is beginning to look as if the
balance is tipping in his favour. Although <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> could still be derailed by
the election of a new Canadian government, which claims to be committed to
renegotiating it, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> appears confident that <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION>'s ire is directed
more at its existing free-trade agreement with the US than at the new deal
which will supersede it.
Of course, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s efforts to secure <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> come at a price. Sceptics in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and elsewhere note that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> has lately taken a harder line over
the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>, withholding further tariff concessions, raising the stakes over
financial services with east Asian countries and refusing to mollify the
<ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> over farm trade. They wonder whether <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> might,
having secured <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, be tempted to spurn the multilateral negotiations in
search of bilateral pacts with the Asian countries whose leaders <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>
is to meet in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> on <DATE>November 19</DATE>.
They should withhold judgment, at least for a time. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s current
negotiating posture may be more form than substance. There is no reason why
freer North American or Asian trade should do anything other than complement
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s commitment to the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round, while serving the useful purpose
of concentrating recalcitrant minds in the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>. It is in everyone's interest
that he secure <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Then, if he is wise, he will decide it is in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
interest to complete the new multilateral trading framework that the world
so badly needs.

FARM and manufacturing interests in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> midwest have grown weary of
holding their fire against foes of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
Like business groups and public officials across the country, they believe
anti-Nafta forces, particularly labour unions and <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, last year's
independent candidate for the presidency, need to be answered if the pact is
to be implemented next <DATE>January</DATE> on schedule.
In <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, the defence will be taken up by a coalition of 200 of the
state's largest companies, representing agriculture, manufacturing,
electronics, oil, steel and finance. The objective is to regenerate
political momentum for the pact.
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, a business coalition, <ORGANIZATION>USA Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, has the same goal. It is
attracting support from across the country. The nation's governors,
particularly those in the west, are also coming out for the pact. According
to a survey by the heritage foundation, 40 of 50 governors strongly support
the agreement, with 10 undecided or not responding.
'If <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is to become a reality, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> has to be behind it,' said
<PERSON>Mr Bill Lane</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION>, the heavy equipment maker. He said the group
will work with the <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> congressional delegation to create a pro-Nafta
force in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
Illinois, with its farm and manufacturing base, has a lot at stake. <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>
is its second largest foreign market, with exports of Dollars 16.5bn
annually.
Group members include drug maker <ORGANIZATION>Abbott Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>; electronics
manufacturer <ORGANIZATION>Motorola</ORGANIZATION>; the giant retailer, <ORGANIZATION>Sears</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Amoco</ORGANIZATION> Oil; and a variety
of farm organisations and food companies. <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION> stands to gain <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION>
45m in additional sales under <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1992</DATE> it sold Dollars 200m in engines

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL trade, above all <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, is an issue which has never quite
taken off in this year's long primary and presidential campaigns.
Yesterday's signing of the agreement threatens to change that, for the
moment at least.
President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> will be able to proclaim <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> as another example of
his international statesmanship, conveniently obscuring the fact that his
administration has been unable to bring to pass a successful conclusion of
the broader <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round of trade negotiations.
Coming on top of recent summits with the Russian and Israeli leaders and
with <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> peace talks about to resume here, the image of a president
on top of foreign affairs can be presented to offset the lack of solutions
to what is happening in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION> and with <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>. Yet the
biggest plus for <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> may be in the extent to which <PERSON>Mr Bill Clinton</PERSON>, his
Democratic opponent for the presidency, is caught on a political hook on
which he can only wriggle.
Yesterday <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> issued statements almost identical to his last
pronouncement on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago. He reserved judgment on the treaty
itself, pending study of its details and whatever emerges from <ORGANIZATION>Congressional</ORGANIZATION>
hearings. But he repeated that he would support it 'so long as it provides
adequate protection for workers, farmers and the environment on both sides
of the border.' He added that 'we must have strong transition strategies
that ensure workers benefit from a more open world trading system.'
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> has been trying to reduce the Democratic Party's dependence on
those of its constituent parts, such as organised labour, which have long
been associated with outright protectionism. To this end, he began his quest
for the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> by supporting the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> goals and the 'fast track'
approach to it, whereby <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> can only vote on the agreement, not amend
it.
The failure of <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s Democratic opponents, and of <PERSON>Mr Patrick Buchanan</PERSON>
on the Republican side and <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>, the defunct independent, proved
protectionism had only limited political appeal in the primaries. But as the
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> negotiations have moved to a climax, opposition to it, concentrated in
the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, has become more focused and vocal.
In particular it has brought back to the fore Congressman <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, who ran for the Democratic nomination four years ago on a
blatantly protectionist platform. Some of <PERSON>Mr Gephardt</PERSON>'s criticisms of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
have reportedly been run past <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> still felt free two weeks ago to condemn 'the outdated rhetoric
of both the free traders who are oblivious to workers and the environment
and the protectionists who ignore the benefits of expanded world trade.' He
associated <PERSON>Mr Gephardt</PERSON> with the same sentiments.
This is a fine line to walk and further qualification of his earlier stand
invites not only Republican attack. In a recent editorial entitled 'a test
of <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s backbone,' the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> wrote that he 'will have to
choose between the protectionist policies of old and his own campaign
promises.'
In theory <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> can wait, since <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will not vote on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> until
next year. He may try to confine himself to promising to change what he does
not like if he becomes president. His opposition and the media are unlikely
to allow him that luxury.

the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes
a reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
Anti-Nafta crusaders drove caravans through <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>
to mobilise opposition. Equipped as information centres, the vans cruised
from town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation
in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds
134,230) a year in cash - foes of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> have worked for three years to mount
a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> proponents - mostly the business community - are spending
millions, bypassing the voters, to convince <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to pass <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released <DATE>last week</DATE> showed 31 per cent of all
Americans in favour of the pact, a slight increase from previous surveys,
while 29 per cent are opposed. However, 63 per cent believe <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will cost
US jobs.
Although the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration weeks ago said it would appoint a '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
czar' to shepherd the pact through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, it has yet to announce it has
found anyone to take on the task. By contrast, the opposition has an
'anti-Nafta czar' in place and making speeches around the country.
He is <PERSON>Mr Jim Jontz</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> congressman. <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> foes have pooled
their meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field
legislative directors. Forty-one states have been organised, and every two
weeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman
to back away from support of the deal. One <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> gubernatorial hopeful,
Ms <PERSON>Kathleen Brown</PERSON> - sister of former Governor <PERSON>Jerry Brown</PERSON> - has been stalked
by demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
According to <PERSON>Mr Craig Merrilees</PERSON>, director of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s Fair Trade
Campaign, <PERSON>Ms Brown</PERSON> has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest
of the state's Democratic establishment.
With the expected conclusion this week of the talks over side agreements on
labour and environment, both sides are preparing to crank up their lobbying
efforts.
The opposition is not awaiting an announcement of the details, said <PERSON>Ms Lori
Wallach</PERSON>, one of the opposition's leaders. The side pacts will be 'silly,'
she said, 'It's the same old <PERSON>Bush Nafta</PERSON> with the supplementals used to
create a fig-leaf.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Nafta passage in peril
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> launched his campaign for ratification of
the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>), with a finely choreographed
event involving three ex-presidents and a speech that rose magnificently to
the occasion. Here was a Democratic president, leader of the party within
which most resistance to the agreement can be found, setting out firmly and
clearly the reasons why that resistance is so utterly wrong-headed. At last,
one felt listening to him, the administration is going to give this issue
the priority it needs.
Yet by the end of the week the presidential propaganda machine had already
moved on to beat the drums for healthcare reform. That is an important
issue, but unlikely to reach decision point before mid-1994 at the earliest.
By contrast a decision on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is needed by the end of this year, and as
things stand the decision is more than likely to go against it. One speech
is certainly not enough to undo the damage done by <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON> in whipping
up hysteria on the issue.
Precious time was lost between <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s inauguration last <DATE>January</DATE> and
the signing in mid-August of 'side agreements' on labour and the
environment, which he had promised to secure during his election campaign.
From a strict free trade point of view, these agreements actually reduce the
attraction of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, since they forbid further unilateral deregulation in
these areas by any of the three signatories (<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>).
Worrying parallels
The object of the side agreements is, of course, to pacify powerful lobbies
in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, whose anxieties <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> shares or at least claims to share.
The exercise is similar to the 'clarification' of the <ORGANIZATION>Blair House</ORGANIZATION> agreement
on agricultural trade, which the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> has now agreed to seek in order to save
the French government from the wrath of its farm lobby. Indeed there is a
worrying parallelism between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> attitude to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and the French
attitude to <ORGANIZATION>Blair House</ORGANIZATION>: both have come to be seen as symbolising all the
demons that threaten national living standards and a cherished way of life,
although in both cases the likely economic effect is quite small.
It would be helpful if all discussion of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> began with a
reminder that the whole Mexican economy is no bigger than the amount by
which the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy grows in two average years, and then proceeded to point
out that <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> imports from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> are already virtually unrestricted. The next
point to note is that, even without <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, deregulation in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> has
already turned a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> deficit on bilateral trade of Dollars 5.7bn in <DATE>1987</DATE> into
a Dollars 5.6bn <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> surplus in <DATE>1992</DATE>. The 'giant sucking sound' of jobs moving
south, with which <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> has terrorised American workers, should be
drowned, in any rational universe, by the noise of new factories being built
in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to supply the Mexican market.
Strategic centrepiece
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is not a zero-sum game. It should result in a net increase in
employment on both sides of the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> (and indeed of the 49th
parallel). But, while the short-term gains might well be greater in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,
the agreement's political importance to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> can hardly be exaggerated.
President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas de Gortari</PERSON> has made <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> the centrepiece of his
liberalising strategy, which reverses all 20th-century Mexican traditions
and is still bitterly contested both outside and (more discreetly but also
more dangerously) inside the ruling party. US rejection is likely to derail
this strategy. That should be a matter of acute concern to Americans, right
across the political spectrum. The last thing the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> needs is a southern
neighbour sinking back into economic stagnation and political instability,
from which ever growing numbers would flee northward.
Republican congressmen and senators should not let partisan feeling, or
dislike of the side agreements, dissuade them from voting for an agreement
which remains a great achievement of their party. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, for his part,
must not fall into the trap of thinking that, having at last made his own
position clear, he can now afford to move on to other issues. This one
requires all his persuasive powers, and if it goes wrong it will be a sad
victory for the forces of irrationalism, leaving little hope that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
will grasp the more difficult nettles of freer trade with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.

FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: No 'slam dunk' shot for Gatt in Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> has officially informed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> of his intention to
sign a <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round package, but he repeated past vows not to 'enter any
agreement unless I am satisfied that US interests are protected'.
While praising the overall package, he said negotiations would continue to
work on 'a few areas of significance that we were unable to resolve at this
time'. This includes financial services, audio-visual trade and market
access.
'Some commitments were contingent on receiving satisfactory commitments from
other countries,' he said in a speech on <DATE>Wedenesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 'We will continue
to work to ensure that the best possible agreement.'
Gatt - not to mention the newly named <ORGANIZATION>World Trade Organisation</ORGANIZATION> - is as
obscure as ever to most Americans; it is not likely to inspire the level of
passion achieved in the battle over the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
Congressional approval of the trade deal could be many months off, and might
even slip into <DATE>1995</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> has 90 days in which to sign approval of the
package, then a further 90 legislative days before sending the implementing
legislation to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, already facing a packed agenda next year.
The long delay will allow both pro- and anti-Gatt forces, still trying to
disentangle the detail of the deal, plenty of time to muster arguments and
lobby congressmen.
Most of the business community in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> yesterday was reacting
positively to the agreement. The chemical industry, however bemoaned the
failure of many countries to agree to tariff cuts.
'Our support for tariff reductions down to the 5-6 per cent range was
conditioned upon obtaining major country coverage in the round and the
elimination of non-tariff measures,' it said. 'If the developing countries
aren't on board, then the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> must reserve the right to make adjustments to
its offer. . . to keep pressure on the developing countries to participate.
'We've been told this is possible, and urge it as a strategy of last
resort.'
Other industries have not achieved their objectives. However, it is by no
means clear they will strongly oppose it.
The main opposition that is surfacing is built around the core of populists
which fought the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>. The followers of <PERSON>Mr
Ross Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire, may join in, but the trade unions may
split, depending on the gains achieved by their industries.
Congressman <PERSON>Jim Kolbe</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, one of the cannier leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
fight, believes it will not be 'a slam dunk', or easy shot, to get <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>
approved by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Kolbe</PERSON> was disappointed that the Japanese held firm against reducing their
tariffs on copper, a major commodity in the state. But he will still support
the deal.
'The issues in the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> were clear cut,' he said. 'This will be much
cloudier. There will be an attempt to pick off individual members by
different interest groups.
'Some agriculture people will oppose it and we could lose the
pharmaceuticals.' The environmentalists, who are beginning to appear to be
solidly against the pact, have exhausted their influence in the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
battle.
<PERSON>Mr Abraham Katz</PERSON>, a former US ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>OECD</ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION>US
Council for International Business</ORGANIZATION>, says the members of his groups -
multinationals and service providers - will support the pact. It is
inevitable industry will be less united on <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> than on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, because many
had aims diametrically opposed. Exporters wanted the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> dumping laws
weakened; domestic industry wanted them preserved. 'Every one of these
issues was a matter of balancing,' <PERSON>Mr Katz</PERSON> said.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Gore fights for Nafta as Congress vote nears: Perot attacks
trade pact in ill-tempered TV clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US vice-president <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> said <DATE>early today</DATE> that the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free
Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> would create 'hundreds of thousands' of jobs in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> but
if it did not work the pact could be ended by giving six months' notice.
<PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> strongly defended the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> pact with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> during a TV
debate, marked by testy exchanges, with <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the Texan billionaire
who ran as an independent candidate in last year's presidential elections.
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> is one of the most strident opponents of the free trade pact, which
faces a crucial vote in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
Answering <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s charges that jobs would be lost to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> said
that 22 out of 23 studies had shown that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would create more jobs in the
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. 'We know this works. If it doesn't work, we give six months notice and
we are out of it,' <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> said.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s Democratic administration is pushing hard for
congressional endorsement of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, which would create a free-trade zone of
more than 370m people. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> negotiated environmental and labour
protection safeguards to add to the basic pact negotiated by his Republican
predecessor, <PERSON>Mr George Bush</PERSON>.
But even so, labour unions and environmentalists fear the pact will shift US
jobs abroad and cause ecological damage, especially in border regions.
The TV confrontation was marked by frequent interruptions and sharp attacks
by each participant on the other's personal integrity. <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> said that
opponents of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> were confusing 'the bad trade deals in the past with
this one, which is the first time we've been able to get one that's even
steven.'
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> retorted by arguing for a 'social tariff' to be imposed on Mexican
goods because of the much lower standard of living of Mexican workers.
'Livestock in this country and animals have a better life than good decent
Mexican workers,' the acerbic millionaire said.
The administration's efforts to build support for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
vote appeared to be bearing fruit yesterday as half a dozen wavering
Democrats announced their support for the pact.
In a further move, the <ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means</ORGANIZATION> committee, which controls tax and
trade legislation, passed the bill implementing the trade agreement by a
surprisingly wide margin of 25-12.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<LOCATION>MEXICO</LOCATION> is to spend as much as Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.4m) on lobbying efforts
by the end of this year, to try to ensure the passage of the <ORGANIZATION>North American
Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Centre for Public Integrity</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
'<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> has employed a veritable phalanx of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> law firms, lobbyists,
public relations companies and consultants,' said <PERSON>Mr Charles Lewis</PERSON>,
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Centre</ORGANIZATION>, which draws about 10 per cent of its
support from labour unions.
Basing its conclusions on an eight-month analysis of <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION>
records, researchers found that 33 former US officials had been hired by
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to try to ensure the implementing legislation for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> gets
congressional approval. Among those working for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> are former US trade
representative <PERSON>Bill Brock</PERSON> and former analyst for the <ORGANIZATION>International Trade
Commission</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Ruth Kurtz</PERSON>.
The report is the latest snag in the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration's efforts to
sell <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
Negotiations among the three governments on labour and environmental
supplemental agreements are now stalled over a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> proposal to allow trade
sanctions against companies which demonstrate a pattern of failure to
enforce environmental laws. However, <PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade
representative, said this week he still expected to complete negotiations
this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
The most serious threat to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> may come from <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the former
presidential candidate, whose 'infomercial' against the accord is due to run
nationwide on television on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s folksy presentations
have done much to arouse fear that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will draw jobs from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
While many Democrats are in open rebellion against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, Republican
senators and some business groups are threatening to oppose it if the
president succeeds in negotiating strong side agreements.
Union leaders, meanwhile, have given no sign that they will be satisfied by
the proposed tripartite commission on labour standards, which the side pact
would establish.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s commitment to congressional passage of a
<ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
'We will make our case as hard and as well as we can,' he told supporters of
the pact between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will create jobs - good
paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The ceremony - for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge
side agreements - began with a spine-tingling entrance of Presidents
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the
Chief.
Vice President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON>, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series
of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
He lauded the bipartisan <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> foreign policy, in place since the second world
war, as 'how we won the cold war. . . how we promoted peace and
reconciliation in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>.'
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three
ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with
several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
debate in a way that has been wholly lacking before as about whether
Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to
resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'.
Workers have become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is behind most of the
opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'. However, he said, 'when you live in a time of change,
the only way to recover your security is to broaden your horizons and to
adapt to the change. . .
'If we learned anything from the collapse of the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall and the fall of
the governments of eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, even a totally controlled society cannot
resist the winds of change,' he said.
Each former president urged support for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. It fell to <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> to
take on <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the billionaire leading opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, as 'a
demagogue. . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely
careless with the truth'.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Virginian congressmen feel the Nafta heat: Nancy Dunne sees
protesters trying to influence the vote on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN <LOCATION>VIRGINIA</LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> evokes a passionate
opposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession.
A 'not this <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>' rally on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> provided little competition for the
college 'game of the century' - <ORGANIZATION>Florida State University</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION>.
Only 115 demonstrators turned out amid the autumn foliage in the grounds of
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s capitol in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>.
They came promptly at two in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> and by three most were gone. The
organisers said they were sending a message to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s three wavering
congressmen that a 'yes' vote on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> would be
'remembered in <DATE>November</DATE>'. That is, next <DATE>November</DATE>'s mid-term elections, when
those assembled - mostly followers of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaires of <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>
and union members - would unite to throw the rascals out of office.
'We are absolutely for free trade,' says <PERSON>Mr Bill Diggitt</PERSON>, the state director
of <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>United We Stand</ORGANIZATION>. 'But <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> undermines our constitution. It
puts decision-making in the hands of international panels, which undermines
our judicial system.' He says he is concerned about the loss of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s
tax base as companies move production to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and place continuous
downward pressure on wages.
'The administration is selling everything it can to every congressman it
can. That's wrong,' he says.
<PERSON>Mr Josh Greenwood</PERSON>, owner of a small hydroelectric company, says: 'I might
run against my congressman myself.'
Mexican workers are treated like slaves, he claims. 'In <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> there was
slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued
them. They had better housing and better sanitary conditions than the
workers in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> today. The babies of the slaves weren't born with brain
damage from concentrated pollution.'
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has 11 congressmen. Three have joined the anti-Nafta forces; five
have declared themselves in favour of the pact. The three undecided have
found themselves in the eye of a lobbying whirlwind.
<PERSON>Mr Greenwood</PERSON>'s congressman, <PERSON>Norman Sisisky</PERSON>, spent <DATE>Friday</DATE> meeting groups from
both sides. 'He is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says
his press secretary. As a member of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> armed services committee he
expects the foreign policy implications of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> vote to weigh heavily
in his decision.
This argument carried little weight at <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s rally. <PERSON>Mr Ralph Dombrower</PERSON>,
a Perot devotee, brought the results of an interactive computer poll showing
a growing isolationism among American voters.
'The public is becoming less inclined to see the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> as arbiter of worldwide
human behaviour and wishes to get out of our foreign policy involvements,'
he says.
The <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> business community began a pro-Nafta lobbying effort last
<DATE>March</DATE>. 'The unions had gotten to everyone. We were going against a tide of
misinformation,' says <PERSON>Ms Kathy Otts</PERSON>, co-captain of Virginians For <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
The coalition - 100 of the state's largest businesses and 500 small and
medium-sized companies - counter-attacked with an 'education' campaign.
Company employees were exhorted to write or call their congressman.
The anti-Nafta forces on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> published long lists of business
contributors to the pro-Nafta congressmen. 'Constituents only have votes to
give, and it seems these congressmen are having a hard time hearing their
message,' the cover page said.
On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, after the fifth pro-Nafta congressman announced his position, a
dispirited <PERSON>Lorrie Beckwith</PERSON>, an opposition organiser, said her campaign had
been hindered early on by a lack of unity. President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> seemed to
be buying off the undecided congressmen. One was reported to have been
promised that a manufacturing research centre would be located in his
district. Another was said to have received assurances of funding for a new
aircraft carrier to be built in his district. A visit to Congressman <PERSON>Sisisky</PERSON>
had not been encouraging, says <PERSON>Mr Beckwith</PERSON>.
'He says he had a bad feeling about the agreement in his gut. He was
concerned it may hurt family farms. But if he is offered a decent project,
he says he might find it tough to say no.'
In <LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, one of the last undecided congressmen, <PERSON>Owen
Pickett</PERSON>, is in his district office, as he is every weekend. His door bears a
sign, 'This office belongs to the people of the second district of
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'.
The unionised port workers are urging opposition. The military, which
comprises most of the district's voters, are worried about jobs in the face
of <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> cutbacks. 'He will listen to everyone's side,' a <ORGANIZATION>Pickett</ORGANIZATION> aide
says.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mexico offers a soft target - Nafta
critics accuse country of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> today begins a formal campaign to win congressional
approval for the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is a
problem.
The president has the backing of ex-US presidents and support from 280 US
economists, including 12 US Nobel laureates. However, silencing critics of
the pact, who say the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> has no business integrating its market with a
non-democratic country guilty of corruption and human rights abuses, is
going to be difficult.
<PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade representative, <PERSON>Mr Robert Reich</PERSON>, labour
secretary, and Ms <PERSON>Carol Browner</PERSON>, head of the environmental protection
agency, will all bring their persuasive skills before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> ways and
means committee to argue that the pact will create more jobs than it will
cost.
But the administration's efforts, now supported by pro-Nafta television
commercials funded by private-sector backers, have yet to address increasing
scrutiny of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s political system.
'There is a lot of unease that the side agreements (on the environment and
labour) don't address the corruption issue and the chronic abuse of labour
rights and environmental standards,' said <PERSON>Mr John Cavanagh</PERSON>, a fellow with
the <ORGANIZATION>anti-Nafta Institute for Policy Studies</ORGANIZATION>. 'In the end the side agreements
have very weak enforcement powers.'
<PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON> is also exploiting the administration's vulnerability on the
corruption issue. The former presidential candidate has hit the air waves
with a scathing attack on the multi-million-dollar pro-Nafta lobby and the
'hired guns' - former <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> officials - working for a foreign government.
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s one-party rule has been referred to on several occasions by Senator
<PERSON>Pat Moynihan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, chairman of the key <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> finance committee who
seems at best an unenthusiastic <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> backer. Meanwhile, anti-Nafta forces,
led by Senator <PERSON>Ernest Hollings</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate commerce committee</ORGANIZATION>,
are proposing a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> alternative: a common market which would require Latin
American countries to embrace democratic reforms before they could join.
Congressman <PERSON>Henry Gonzalez</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> banking committee, has not
taken a public position on the pact, but last week he held hearings which
featured testimony about drugs and corruption in the Mexican financial
sector. <PERSON>Mr R Christopher Whalen</PERSON>, a former official in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Federal
Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, warned of the lack of legal protection for private property and
contracts in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> unions are so hostile to the labour side agreement, which was meant
to pacify them, that the administration fears resources they have reserved
for healthcare reform will be diverted into the anti-Nafta cause.
'Mexican workers cannot defend their own economic interests,' says the
labour-supported <ORGANIZATION>Economic Policy Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 'Trade unions independent of
government control are discouraged. The Mexican government intimidates union
leaders and workers who do not toe the government line.'
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> opponents are also working closely with anti-government forces in
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr Carlos Heredia</PERSON>, a visiting fellow at the Development Gap, a
progressive policy group, is in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for a year because 'I want it to
be known that a pro-democracy movement - opposed to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> - exists in
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'. He and others believe <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will reinforce the current political
system.
Pro-Nafta forces are left to link free trade, prosperity and democracy. <PERSON>Mr
Harry Freeman</PERSON>, a business lobbyist, says: 'Isolation is not the way to prod
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> into democracy and get rid of corruption. There is a higher
probability things will improve with <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> than without it.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (5): Vote deadline is November 17 - Nancy
Dunne explains the US procedures for approving Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>, the most controversial US trade
agreement since the second world war, has now entered the shadowy world of
the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional</ORGANIZATION> fast track where legislative procedures are turned on
their heads, a bill is not a bill, a conference not a conference, and
legislation to implement trade agreements is born.
The fast-track procedure mandates an up or down vote on the 'implementing
legislation', thus evading deal-killing amendments designed to benefit
special interests. Unlike a treaty, which requires a two-thirds senate vote
for passage, fast track gives the responsibility of approval to a majority
in both houses.
The only hope for getting a trade pact through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> without amendments
is to ensure a majority vote in advance.
This is achieved through a pre-approval negotiating process between the
administration and the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. Representatives of both essentially write
the implementing legislation together.
Work on the 'non-bill' that will become the implementing legislation begins
first in committees - the <ORGANIZATION>House Ways and Means Committees</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate
Finance</ORGANIZATION> - which have primary jurisdiction over trade. Other committees with
jurisdiction - like banking and agriculture - will also hold hearings.
After holding hearings, <ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means and Finance</ORGANIZATION> each write a 'non-bill',
in consultation with the administration and other committees. This process,
ordinarily called a 'markup', to produce bills, is called a 'mock up'.
The 'non-bill' makes changes in current law necessary for the implementation
of trade agreements, provides for financing mechanisms and changes tariffs.
It could also include the administration's interpretation of unclear
portions of the trade pact. Other trade legislation can be attached.
There is talk about adding a 'Super 301' provision to the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in order to
attract wavering Democrats. Super 301 requires the administration to
negotiate away foreign trade barriers (or use sanctions if the trading
partners baulk).
The committees take their non-bills to a House-Senate 'mock conference'
where they iron out their differences and most of the changes are made. <PERSON>Mr
Richard Daley</PERSON>, the administration's '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> czar', will be hard at work,
making backroom deals in exchange for member votes.
The result then goes to the president, who has a free hand with the
'non-bill'. He can tear it up, alter it, or submit it to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for
fast-track action, at which point it becomes a bill.
The bill can no longer be changed. It must be voted on in no fewer than 90
legislative days (days in session). The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> committees have 45 days to
debate its merits before it moves on to full <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debate for 15 days. If it
loses here - which may well happen - that is the end of the process.
If it passes, it goes on to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where the committees have 15 days to
debate and vote and the full <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> has 15 days. Both houses must schedule
20 hours of floor debate.
The president has asked Congressional leaders to accelerate the process in
order to get a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> into effect on <DATE>January 1</DATE>, as scheduled. <PERSON>Mr Tom Foley</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> speaker and <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> supporter, has scheduled a floor vote for
<DATE>November 17</DATE>.
There is considerable speculation about whether or not the vote will go
forward on schedule. The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and Congressional leadership have vowed
that it will. A senior <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> aide said that the administration wants to get
the issue 'over and done with' to make way for more popular issues such as
health care and crime legislation. 'Members don't want to go home and talk
about it any more,' he said. 'The administration won't pick up votes by
waiting.'
Others say the administration has been forced to take a tough line on the
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> schedule to stem the flow of defecting Republicans and Democrats, who
are afraid a pro-Nafta vote will hurt them in their districts. They will not
want to support the bill if they think the president might delay it or pull
it for re-negotiation.
But will the leadership act if a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> loss seems probable? <DATE>November 17</DATE> is
less than a month before the <DATE>December 15</DATE> deadline for the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>.
There is concern that a failure of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION> would discourage
politically-risky concessions in the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> talks, particularly if as
expected, <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire, comes out in opposition to
the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> and promises to fund a fight against its passage.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Trade accords 'will benefit US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATIFICATION of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
Round of talks on trade liberalisation would bring substantial cumulative
benefits to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy, a survey of 35 economic forecasters concluded
this week.
It says that ratification of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, over the next 15 years, would raise
the real level of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> gross domestic product by 3 per cent. A successful
<ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> deal would add a further 4 per cent over the same period.
Conducted by the London-based <ORGANIZATION>Consensus Economics</ORGANIZATION>, the survey nevertheless
reflected considerable uncertainty about success either in next week's <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
vote in the <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION>, or in meeting the <DATE>December 15</DATE> deadline for
completion of the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>.
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> forecasters gave a 57 per cent chance that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would ratify the
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, but assigned a bare 51 per cent chance of the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round being
successfully completed.
The findings coincide with signs in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> of a swing in public opinion
behind the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
Public support for the pact has leapt from 34 per cent to 57 per cent in the
wake of a nationwide televised debate <DATE>this week</DATE> between Vice President <PERSON>Al
Gore</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire who is a leading <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
opponent.
The <ORGANIZATION>Consensus Economics</ORGANIZATION> survey points to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> providing a Dollars 4.5bn
(Pounds 2.9bn) boost to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports in the first year after ratification,
rising to an annual Dollars 13.2bn by the year <DATE>2005</DATE>.
Gains from a successful <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> round outcome would be even more marked,
boosting exports by Dollars 6.5bn in year one, and more than <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 24bn by
<DATE>2005</DATE>.
US imports would rise, but less markedly.
The forecasters see the agreements trimming inflationary pressures, slowing
the rise in employment costs, and generating a 'small net increase' in jobs.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore scores but game is still in doubt -
The TV clash with Perot over Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUNDITS and pollsters alike declared Vice-President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> the clear winner
in <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s televised debate with <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON> about the <ORGANIZATION>North
American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
Unlike an election debate, however, this confrontation could hope to
influence fewer than a hundred members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> who remain uncommitted
either for or against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. The debate's impact on ordinary viewers - a
pool already diminished because the debate reached only homes with cable
television - will be felt only indirectly in the crucial vote in the <ORGANIZATION>House
of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> may have attained a number of his objectives. The forum gave him the
opportunity to present the case for the treaty to a sceptical public, made
fearful by the slow recovery and corporate cutbacks. The vice-president
underlined the foreign and trade policy initiatives at stake and the danger
that the administration might be unable to overcome a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> defeat to
complete the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round of global trade talks.
However, he also presented a somewhat negative case for the agreement: he
repeatedly noted that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> could withdraw with only six months' notice if
the pact did not work, and warned that 'the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> round would probably not be
completed if <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> were defeated'.
While the vice-president did not manage to provoke <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> into any
stunning displays of paranoia, by constant needling he succeeded in making
his opponent appear nasty and thin-skinned. (Only on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> told a
rally that he had been warned by the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> of a plot against his life by six
armed Cubans.)
The perception that <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> may be more of a drawback than an advantage to
the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> opposition appears to be shared by several leading opponents of
the treaty, both inside and outside the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. The tone of <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s
arguments was so unremittingly negative and defensive that he actually
served up an excuse for any congressman still in search of a reason to vote
in favour in next week's <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> debate.
The administration's calculated gamble, that identifying the anti-Nafta camp
closely with <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> would work in favour of the agreement, appears to have
paid off, at least to some modest degree.
It still needs a political miracle to get <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> through the <ORGANIZATION>House of
Representatives</ORGANIZATION>. The hope was that the debate would create a momentum
towards passage of the treaty that the administration has been unable to
achieve after weeks of deal-making.
Indeed, in its wake, one congressman, <PERSON>Mr Jim Bacchus</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, announced
his support, but he had been leaning towards a yes vote and the
administration has to secure 25-35 more.
It was useful to the pro-Nafta side that an hour after the debate was over
<PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> was quickly declared the winner in an <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> telephone poll by 47 per
cent of viewers compared with 33 per cent for <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>. But the real gains
come in the televised soundbites - like the one in which <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> calls the
vice-president a liar - and follow-up reporting.
<PERSON>Mr Al Hunt</PERSON>, former Wall Street Journal bureau chief, yesterday accused <PERSON>Mr
Perot</PERSON> of lying when he claimed to have never hired lobbyists. <PERSON>Mr Hunt</PERSON> said
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> had secretly lobbied the <ORGANIZATION>Ways and Means</ORGANIZATION> committee and had 'snuck
through' a Dollars 15m tax break for himself 'in the middle of the <TIME>night</TIME>'.
It was one more attack on <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s credibility, begun when the
vice-president pointed out that the Texan had supported <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> before running
for president. <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> held up a brochure featuring <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>'s picture and
extolling the benefits to be derived from Latin American trade for the <PERSON>Perot</PERSON>
family Alliance airport project in <LOCATION>Fort Worth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> scored a number of debating points with his visual aids. One
featured a modern US company factory in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> surrounded by slums which
have sprung up for the workers. <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> could have made the point more
effectively that, without <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, working and environmental conditions will
just worsen.
Ironically, <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> often sounded as though he were more interested in
protecting the living standards of Mexican workers than those of their <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
counterparts, and argued, with apparent seriousness, for a 'social tariff'
to force the Mexican government and elites to raise wages.
The sheer fact that the debate took place reflects the administration's need
to play catch-up in a race that is almost won by <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s opponents. The best
opportunity for winning support for the agreement was during the
negotiations on the side accords on environment and labour. But those
accords were not strong enough to win over influential members like
Congressman <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, the majority leader. Instead, the
administration is caught up in nerve-wracking last minute efforts which seem
only Sisyphean.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: White House gathers up endorsements for
Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOVING with all deliberate speed and flashes of passion and anger, the <ORGANIZATION>US
House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> yesterday approached its climactic vote on the
<ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
At the other end of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Avenue emotion of a different sort - barely
suppressed elation - was evident as the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> totted up the steady
stream of new endorsements for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and calculated, though it would not
admit it publicly, that it would win.
<PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, the Trade Representative, was among those convinced that
the administration's application of maximum political force was on the edge
of producing a great victory for President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>. Anything bigger
than a margin of one would be 'academic,' said <PERSON>Mr Bill Daley</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> co-ordinator.
An evening <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> count suggested that the agreement had secured
support from 10 more members than the 218 needed for passage, though some
may be released from their promises once the magic number had been passed.
Significantly, <PERSON>Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur</PERSON>, the Democrat from <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and a
leading <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> opponent, conceded that she thought President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> would
carry the day, mostly, she added with scorn, on the back of support from the
Republican party.
The President went running in a pro-Nafta teeshirt and said 'it's never in
the bag until the vote's in.' He had despatched officials by the dozen to
<LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> to keep up the pressure, as had the anti-Nafta forces. <PERSON>Mr Ross
Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> populist, was behaving exactly like the lobbyists he
constantly condemns as he toured the halls exhorting members to vote
against.
In the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> itself, the debate was briefly interrupted by anti-Nafta
demostrators shouting that <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> was bribing his way to victory and
throwing fake Dollars 50 bills on to the floor. Earlier <PERSON>Mr David Bonior</PERSON>, the
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Democrat and chief anti-Nafta strategist, had opened the debate by
proclaiming 'its <ORGANIZATION>Nafta Claus</ORGANIZATION> time at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>.'
'Its Dollars 50bn in goodies and give-aways,' shouted <PERSON>Mr Gerald Solomon</PERSON>, the
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Republican.
<PERSON>Mr Solomon</PERSON> was at his most abrasive, which is saying something. He charged
that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> established an 'unelected, unaccountable bureacracy' that would
undermine the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> constitution. But his assault on everything Mexican,
especially its '64-year-old one party dictatorship' of a government, was too
much for the venerable <ORGANIZATION>Kika de la Garza</ORGANIZATION>, the Democrat from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> who rules
the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> agriculture committee.
'I share blood with the Mexican people,' he barked back, 'and I resent the
xenophobia I've been hearing on this floor.' Reaching back into the <DATE>last
century</DATE>, he turned on <PERSON>Mr Solomon</PERSON> and others who had spoken in the same vein.
'They want a Mexican government run by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, but let me remind you, we
tried that and it didn't work.'
Perhaps unconsciously, <PERSON>George Miller</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat, evoked
memories of <PERSON>Harold MacMillan</PERSON>'s words condemning the <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON> government's
attitudes to the British miners 'who had helped defeat the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>.' The
American worker, <PERSON>Mr Miller</PERSON> declared, 'had helped win the cold War and now
are not even being given an afterthought.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Clinton gets tips on fine-tuning Nafta -
An influential report offers policy signposts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGGRESSIVE enforcement of national labour laws in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and a Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 2.1bn) environmental clean-up fund are called for in an assessment
of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> released yesterday by the
influential Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Institute for International Economics</ORGANIZATION>.
The recommendations address fierce criticism of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, particularly from <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>
labour and environmental interests which have been lobbying the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>
administration for amendments to the regional trade agreement.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was signed late last year by President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s President
<PERSON>Carlos Salinas de Gortari</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Mr Brian Mulroney</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s prime minister.
It is to be put to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for ratification later this year.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> has committed the new administration to amendments to
the text, taking account of these pressures.
The <ORGANIZATION>IIE</ORGANIZATION> assessment - giving an overall B+ grade to the 2,000-page agreement
 -is intended to provide signposts to the policies he could adopt. It gives
clear support for the administration's call for supplementary agreements to
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> on labour and the environment, and recommends a Dollars 3bn '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
fund' in preference to a proposal from Democratic senator <PERSON>Max Baucus</PERSON> for a
special <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> transaction tax.
The <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> fund would finance the environmental clean-up on the US-Mexican
border and would help to underwrite work by the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection
Commission</ORGANIZATION>, already suggested by <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>, in sponsoring broad assessments
of environmental conditions in each country. The <ORGANIZATION>IIE</ORGANIZATION> calls on the three
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> signatories to earmark for the fund Dollars 300m a year each for five
years, from <DATE>1994</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Commission</ORGANIZATION> should also set up procedures to encourage
harmonisation of environmental standards, and set fines, or 'green fees',
for countries distorting trade inside the region because of poor
environmental standards.
The study predicts that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would create a net 171,000 new jobs in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,
with <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> surpluses in its trade with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> varying between Dollars 7bn and
<ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 9bn a year up to <DATE>1995</DATE>.
'<PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON> got it wrong,' said <PERSON>Mr Fred Bergsten</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>IIE</ORGANIZATION>.
'There has been a huge sucking sound, as <PERSON>Perot</PERSON> described, but it has been
due to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports and the creation of American jobs.' <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> last year
predicted <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would create the 'sucking sound' of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> jobs lost to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Bergsten</PERSON> noted a Dollars 13bn swing in favour of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in trade with
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> since <DATE>1989</DATE>, a shift which he estimates has already created
200,000-300,000 jobs in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>.
While 316,000 jobs would be created by <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>IIE</ORGANIZATION> report forecasts that
145,000 jobs would be 'dislocated' - a bare <MONEY>2 per cent</MONEY> of the 8.9m jobs lost
in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in the five years to <DATE>1990</DATE> because of plant closures, bankruptcies
and lay-offs. It calls for Dollars 335m a year to be spent from existing
tariff revenues for adjustment programmes linked with <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> job losses, but
calls for this to be part of a wider national worker training programme.
<PERSON>Mr Gary Hufbauer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Jeffrey Schott</PERSON>, the authors of the report, recommend
new negotiations to establish Mexican commitment to 'aggressive enforcement
of national labour laws and regulations'. They call for a trinational
commission to enforce labour standards, and authorise sanctions if
governments fail to halt abuses.
However, they insist the ultimate value of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is in its boost to the
competitiveness of regional industries, rather than in job creation.
'Efficiency benefits and growth stimulus could exceed Dollars 15bn annually.
This figure, rather than jobs gained or lost, is the true measure of the
economic gain from the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> agreement,' which they see as one aspect of a
wider <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and productivity.
The assessment confirms, but is more optimistic than, the findings of a
study just released by the <ORGANIZATION>US International Trade Commission</ORGANIZATION> on the
potential impact of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
This predicts the trade pact would provide a lift of up to <MONEY>0.5 per cent</MONEY> of
real GNP in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, with a potential increase of 11.4 per cent in
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> could be boosted from <MONEY>5.2 per cent</MONEY> to 27
per cent by the agreement, with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s exports to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> jumping by
between 3.4 per cent and 15 per cent. It predicts aggregate employment gains
in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> of 'less than <MONEY>1 per cent</MONEY>' of a workforce that currently totals
117m.
The commission says industries which will see greatest benefit will be
machine tools, bearings, industrial machinery, steel mill products,
pharmaceuticals, textiles, grains and oilseeds, cotton, wood products and
motor parts. Industries likely to suffer will be the motor industry,
garments, flat glass, glassware, household appliances, shrimps, peanuts, and
vegetables.
It points to 'an almost discernible effect on US wage rates for both
low-skilled and high-skilled workers' - a conclusion shared by the <ORGANIZATION>IIE</ORGANIZATION>
study.
The studies coincide with signals from labour groups that they may be poised
to moderate claims that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will be a catastrophe for workers and
consumers.
As leaders of the influential <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION> trade union grouping held their first
executive council meeting since the presidential election, they hinted that
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> workers must come to terms with closer integration in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, pressing
for higher minimum wages in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> instead of opposing <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> itself.

<TEXT>
THE declining <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade surplus with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> has become a significant element
of the debate over the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>, linking the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>.
Last year the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> manufacturing trade surplus to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> rose to Dollars
7.5bn, a feat President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> proponents cite as
proof that North American trade has already created thousands of jobs. But
the growth of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> sales to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is slowing. The trade surplus has declined
from Dollars 380m in <DATE>January</DATE> to Dollars 120m in <DATE>June</DATE> as <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> sinks towards
recession.
To Ms <PERSON>Thea Lee</PERSON>, an economist in the labour-supported <ORGANIZATION>Economic Policy
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the trend is 'going the way we predicted; exports are rising but
imports are rising faster'. Ultimately, she contends, the trade surplus will
be in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s favour, and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> will lose 550,000 jobs.
<PERSON>Mr Manuel Suarez-Mier</PERSON>, a visiting fellow at the <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown School of
Business Administration</ORGANIZATION>, believes nervousness over <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s prospects in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has contributed to the the stagnant trade picture. The slowdown in
the Mexican economy is a consequence of high interest rates, in place partly
to control inflation and partly to offset the '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> jitters' in a
securities market worried that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will damage the trade pact.
But powerful <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> opponents - followers of <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the populist
billionaire, labour and many environmentalists - paint a depressing picture
of the US-Mexican trade relationship. In his new anti-Nafta book, <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON>
points out that Dollars 15.5bn of last year's Dollars 40.6bn <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports to
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> was capital goods. This, he asserts to the uninitiated, means
factories.
'When <ORGANIZATION>Smith Corona</ORGANIZATION> closed its typewriter factory in <LOCATION>Cortland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, last
year and shipped its manufacturing equipment to <LOCATION>Tijuana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the
transfer of equipment counted as an 'export' from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>,' he says. 'At this
rate, the <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> will go bankrupt running up trade surpluses.'
He labels 'a myth' the administration's contention that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will create a
vast, lucrative new market. 'The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the market,' he says.
'Mexican consumers do not have the money to buy American or Canadian
exports.'
At the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mexico Office</LOCATION>, where US-Mexico trade is
analysed, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade surplus slowdown is seen as 'a temporary pause', due
to slower growth in the Mexican economy and lower demand for imports.
Ms <PERSON>Regina Vargo</PERSON>, the office's director, says <PERSON>Mr Perot</PERSON> is purveying myths of
his own. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> ships a lot of capital goods to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, because that is what
it produces competitively, she says. Capital goods comprise 40 per cent of
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports worldwide, but only 33 per cent of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
What has been growing are sales of consumer goods. Giant US retailers are
undergoing an 'enormous expansion' and helping to renovate <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s retail
sector. The average Japanese last year spent Dollars 47 on <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> consumer
products. The average Mexican spent Dollars 49 - spurring sales of US-made
textiles, clothing, carpets, furniture, musical instruments and sporting
goods.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Another one under his belt: Nafta was a lesson for Clinton
on the power of his office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spinmeisters are having a field day now that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is over and won.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s fans say he alone pulled it off, demonstrating
toughness with his own Democratic party, persuasiveness in argument and
shrewd tactical sense in understanding that this was a victory that could
only be gained late in the day. He displayed, they said, the sort of
resilience against all odds that characterised his election campaign and
this means broad sunlit uplands ahead, even in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> political
swamp.
His detractors are dismissive, saying he was too slow to realise that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
might lose, bought it with give-away deals, was bailed out by his
vice-president, <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON>, conqueror of <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON> in televised debate, and
only survived on the backs of a Republican vote he can never again take for
granted.
The truth is an amalgam of some of the above, and more besides. Perhaps the
most objective assessment has come, surprisingly, from Senator <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON>, the
Republican leader, a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> supporter but normally the most partisan of
politicians.
'I have to say I am impressed,' he said hours before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted but
when victory seemed assured. 'I had my doubts but it has become clear that
he understands it is important to win and he has not just stuck with it but
fought hard and realised what would happen to his presidency he if he
failed.'
The same could have been said for the budget battle in <DATE>July</DATE> and will
doubtless be said again when healthcare reform comes to congressional crunch
next year. The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> presidency, it seems, is destined to live or die on a
handful of hard-won votes. It may be a rum way to run a railroad but from
<LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> these are the tracks on which democratic governments are now
consigned to run.
The clear lesson from <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, certain to be duplicated over healthcare, is
the extent to which most of the tough domestic issues, taxation only partly
excepted, cut completely across party lines. Success or failure depends on
amassing a series of shifting coalitions, often with unlikely bedfellows.
Most of the Democrats who sustained <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> over the budget deserted him
over <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. A majority of the Republicans, who voted as a bloc against the
budget because of its tax increases, supported him on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Already on
healthcare there are more glimmerings of an alliance between the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
and moderate Republicans than with conservative Democrats. Liberal members
of the president's own party somehow have to be brought on board, if only to
offset the certain opposition of the Republican right wing.
The fault lines in both parties are now very deep. Democratic wounds,
especially with organised labour, will take some repairing. But <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>,
always good at political healing, was conciliatory in victory on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, as was <PERSON>Mr Thomas Foley</PERSON>, the Democratic Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>, in the
last speech of the great debate. With time the unions will probably retract
threats to work against Democrats who supported <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. They will fight <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>,
if it comes to them, but with small expectation of success and thus much
less effort.
It is no exaggeration to say that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> might prove to be the last great
stand of the old left. Deprived of the demonology of the Reagan/Bush
presidencies and with tenuous peace prevailing in <LOCATION>central America</LOCATION>, it has
been pushed to find great causes around which to unite. Working with <PERSON>Ross
Perot</PERSON> and the '<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> First' brigade cannot have been a pleasant
experience, especially since it came up short.
Divisions in the Republican party, contemplating a ferocious contest for the
<DATE>1996</DATE> presidential nomination, are perhaps more profound now that the Cold
War no longer provides cohesion. <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON>, who probably will run, and <PERSON>Pat
Buchanan</PERSON>, who says he will not again, slugged it out on TV this week
offering two very different visions of what the party should look like - and
both come from its right wing.
One of the more fascinating spectacles of the past two weeks has been the
performance of Congressman <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, the chief Republican
attack dog and almost certain to be its next leader in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. Not only
was he seen co-operating closely with President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, a prospect once
considered unthinkable, but he was even nice to some of his less
conservative colleagues. He also delivered the goods, in the shape of 132
Republican votes for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. It is a larger question, however, if this
bipartisan approach will extend to other issues, above all healthcare.
A clear loser in <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>, increasingly perceived as not only
just another politician but also a most bad-tempered one. Both parties,
especially Republicans, will be relieved at this, but the well of discontent
he tapped last year as an independent presidential candidate has not
evaporated and there is every chance that he will continue to throw his vast
financial resources at issues which catch his fancy, including healthcare.
But it is <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> who gets the most attention. Here he is, 10 months
into his presidency, with two big victories under his belt and a long list
of lesser ones yet still unable to command the heights of respect that his
record might seem to warrant. This month's off-year elections showed no
regard.
Polls this week, admittedly taken before the vote, put his approval rating
at generally below 50 per cent. This is the lowest of any president after
nearly a year except, curiously, <PERSON>Mr Reagan</PERSON>. Since <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> seemed so dimly
understood by most Americans there is no assumption that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> will get a
lasting bounce up again. His poll standing seems to rise most when little is
happening - as in the <DATE>summer</DATE>.
In a TV interview <DATE>this week</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> was typically philosophical. 'Any
time you try to change as many things as we do, you put yourself on the
line. But that's the kind of person I am. I didn't run for president to
husband my popularity or to be very limited in my aspirations.'
What he might have learned from this struggle, though, is a lesson in the
power of his office. All along, even when it appeared well ahead, the
anti-Nafta coalition confessed a fear of what might happen if <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>
woke up to this fact, not simply because of the patronage at his disposal
but also because of the force of argument he could bring to bear.
He had been pondering this, too, though for non-trade reasons. A few weeks
ago, he held a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> dinner for a small group of intellectuals,
including <PERSON>William Julius Wilson</PERSON>, the black sociologist from the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Chicago</ORGANIZATION>. Their advice was the imperative of using the presidency once
again as a 'bully pulpit', as <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> once called it and as
<PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> so effectively used it.
Thus, <DATE>last weekend</DATE>, at <ORGANIZATION>Rev Martin Luther King</ORGANIZATION>'s old church in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr
Clinton</PERSON> delivered a powerful sermon on crime and on the responsibilities of
black citizens to arrest the decay of their families and communities. Dr
<PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> probably was nodding in approval.
It is a far cry from this message to the legislative complexities of
anti-crime legislation and healthcare. Some <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials already
think <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> spreads himself in public too thinly, others want him to
impose himself with greater authority on the political culture. Both seem
difficult to achieve, given his intellectual and political eclecticism.
Meanwhile, business will go on. <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> digested and the instant spin spun
out, it will be back to healthcare, <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, a possible Cabinet
reshuffle, a balanced budget amendment, the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> conclusion, <ORGANIZATION>Apec</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nato</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and Yeltsin in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. At least the foreigners now
have reason to be impressed.

<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> yesterday tried to minimise the impact of published remarks
by <PERSON>Mr Leon Panetta</PERSON>, the budget director, to the effect that its economic
programme was in trouble in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and that the North American Free Trade
Agreement (<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>) currently was politically 'dead'.
President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> said he had no reason to be angry with <PERSON>Mr Panetta</PERSON>. Ms
<PERSON>Dee Dee Myers</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> press secretary, insisted the legislative
programme was 'on track', that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was 'alive and well', and that <PERSON>Mr
Panetta</PERSON> was only speculating on its prospects 'if it went up to the Hill
this week'.
She said that whatever the current opposition the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> treaty would be seen
in a different light when it was eventually presented for ratification with
supplemental agreements now being negotiated with <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr
Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, treasury secretary, also told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> yesterday that the
treaty remained an administration priority.
<PERSON>Mr Panetta</PERSON> was particularly concerned at the anti-Nafta campaign being waged
by <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, last year's independent presidential candidate. This, he
said, 'makes it even more difficult' to get the treaty through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> when
it already had many enemies.
The general thrust of his comments, in an interview with <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> reporters, did
not appear to help the administration, recently defeated over the Dollars
16bn (Pounds 10bn) stimulus package and increasingly subject to criticism
from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> over various aspects of its extensive domestic agenda.
The budget director, a former congressman from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, specifically said
he was advising <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> to delay releasing his plan for healthcare
reform, probably due out next month, until after the budget reconciliation
bill has been voted in <DATE>June</DATE>.
He predicted stiff congressional resistance to published proposals to trim
the costs of Medicaid and Medicare, the federally funded health care
programmes, to the energy tax in its present form, to the investment tax
credit, already under fire from Democrats, and to the new student loan
programme.
He thought there was no chance of passage of a value added tax unless it
were a 'revenue neutral' substitute for payroll and income taxes.
The president ran the risk of seeing his programmes torn apart by a
combination of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. He urged <PERSON>Mr
Clinton</PERSON> 'to define his priorities more clearly,' and to be willing to carry
the fight for his proposals to the public.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: US textiles caucus urges tougher stance in

PRESIDENT <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> is being pressed by members of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> textiles caucus
to harden the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> stand in textile negotiations in the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round to win
votes for the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
Ten congressmen from textile and apparel producing states last week told the
president that commitments on a number of issues - including the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
Round - 'would help decide our vote on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> and could influence the vote of
other Members with textile and apparel constituencies.'
The <ORGANIZATION>Clinton Administration</ORGANIZATION> is engaged in a frantic last minute effort to eke
out 218 votes in favour of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. Most of the members, who signed the
letter, are undecided or planning to vote against <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, but they are less
worried about <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> than the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>. However, in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is
being pressed to make further concessions by lowering its highest tariffs.
'The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> has already made significant concessions in the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>,' they
said in a letter to the President. 'If you want support for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> from
members from textile constituencies, extend the phase-out of the Multifibre
Arrangement from 10 to 15 years.'
This would also be supported by the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> countries, who 'realise that
it will be hard for them to compete in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> market against lower-wage
nations like <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> once trade-allocation by quotas is eliminated.'
The congressmen said the staging of tariff reductions and quota phase-outs
should be gradually implemented over a 15 years. For quotas, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> should
not agree to lift restrictions on products for which foreign market
penetration exceeds 20 per cent until the last possible stage.
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> industry and their European counterparts are close to agreement on
tariff reductions, they added. 'Our government should make no offer beyond
the levels European and American industry have discussed.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / Clinton underlines his support for Nafta pact: President
calls on US to embrace global economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s commitment to congressional passage of a
<ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
However, an unexpected twist in <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> saw President <PERSON>Carlos Salinas</PERSON>
using the same occasion - for the signing of labour, environmental and
import surge side agreements - as an opportunity to downplay the deal's
importance to the Mexican economy.
'No one will do for <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> what <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> does not do for itself,' he said.
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said his administration would 'make our case as
hard and as well as we can,' in support of the pact between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. '<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will create jobs - good paying jobs. If I didn't believe
that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> ceremony began with the entrance of Presidents <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>
and <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the Chief.
Vice-president <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON>, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series
of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
He lauded the bipartisan <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> foreign policy, in place since the second world
war, as 'how we won the cold war . . . how we promoted peace and
reconciliation in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>.'
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three
ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with
several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
debate, in a way that has been previously lacking, as about whether
Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to
resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'.
The president said workers had become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is
behind most of the opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'. However, he said, 'when you live in
a time of change, the only way to recover your security is to broaden your
horizons and to adapt to the change.'
Each former president urged support for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>. It fell to <PERSON>Mr Jimmy Carter</PERSON> to
take on <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the billionaire leading opposition to <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, as 'a
demagogue . . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely
careless with the truth'.
The decline in GNP, which if repeated in the quarter that ends this month
would mean the country was officially in recession, will put pressure on the
month-old coalition government to increase its plans for a further
pump-priming economic package, due to be announced tomorrow.
<PERSON>Mr Yasushi Mieno</PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>, said yesterday he saw no
evidence of imminent recovery. However, he expected further benefits of
previous economic stimulus packages to emerge.
The <ORGANIZATION>Economic Planning Agency</ORGANIZATION>, traditionally more optimistic than the central
bank, said it still thought there would be recovery in the <DATE>second half of</DATE>
the current tax year to <DATE>March</DATE>.
Private sector analysts' forecasts for the full year range widely, from an
economic decline to something below last year's 1.5 per cent growth, itself
the lowest for 18 years. 'The trade surplus is going up and there is no
growth in the short term. Now let's get some policy response,' said <PERSON>Mr James
Vestal</PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION>Barclays de Zoete Wedd</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.
The stimulatory measures due tomorrow will be the third such package in the
<DATE>past 16 months</DATE>, during which the government has allotted nearly Y24,000bn
(Dollars 226bn) of public spending. Growth reached 2.3 per cent in the <DATE>first
quarter</DATE>, holding out the short-lived prospect of a recovery.
The previous two spending packages have begun to flow through, as seen in a
5.2 per cent rise in public investment over the previous quarter. Yet this
was not enough to offset the continued slide in external demand - down 0.5
per cent, reflecting a fall in exports - and the decline in private
consumption, down 0.6 per cent as Japanese spent less on cars, furniture and
clothes.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s trade surplus widened to Dollars 7.54bn last month, up 7.5 per cent
from Dollars 7.02bn in the same month last year. Sluggish domestic demand
and the impact of the rising yen on the dollar value of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s exports were
the main factors. In yen terms, the surplus fell 11.3 per cent over the same
period.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s surplus with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, its main trading partner, rose from Dollars
3.13bn to Dollars 3.45bn. This adds to strains with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> just a few
weeks before <PERSON>Mr Morihiro Hosokawa</PERSON> meets <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> president <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> for the
first time since he became prime minister.
A 3.3 per cent annualised rise in <DATE>August</DATE> in bankruptcies with liabilities of
more than Y10m was also reported by private credit agency, <ORGANIZATION>Teikoku Data
Bank</ORGANIZATION>. This was the first increase in four months; compared with <DATE>July</DATE>,
company collapses were up 5.6 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free
Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides
of the US-Mexican border, President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> said yesterday.
Referring to the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in language generally used by its opponents, he
acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also
an investment agreement'.
Because it would make <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> a 'much more attractive' investment, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration had negotiated rules protecting intellectual property and
investment. 'Shouldn't we also, in the interest of both the economies of
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, see that basic environmental standards and labour
standards are observed?' he said.
A few hours before the president spoke, his private sector and labour
advisers were briefed about the progress of the new <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> negotiations. One
said labour union representatives now seemed hopeful they could use the
opportunity to strengthen labour law enforcement in both the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
The administration will try to satisfy labour in order to fend off attacks
by <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the former independent presidential candidate, who is
still loudly opposing <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.
'Its going to be a tough <DATE>spring</DATE>,' the adviser said. 'There is a problem
between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and the administration and the
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> wants a lot of teeth. Our guys know wonder how they can
get teeth when they know (the enforcement provisions) work both ways.'
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> referred in his press conference to a <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration foreign
aid programme in which the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 'spent taxpayers' money to encourage American
companies to invest in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> who then went down there and actually
lowered wages instead of raising them in the host company'.

deal is still alive

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration is making a concerted drive to prove that the
North American Free Trade Agreement with <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is not dead.
<PERSON>Mr Leon Panetta</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> budget director, threw the administration
and the Democratic congressional leadership into turmoil earlier this week
with the warning that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> simply could not pass <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
The loud criticisms of <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> populist, were making the
task much more difficult, he said.
Since then, administration officials have gone out of their way to reaffirm
their commitment to the treaty.
<PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade representative, insisted that the
administration intended to complete this <DATE>summer</DATE> the side agreements on the
environment, labour standards and import surges which President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>
has asked for.
'We intend to take <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and we intend to meet the <DATE>January
1, 1994</DATE> deadline for the implementation of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade
Agreement</ORGANIZATION>,' <PERSON>Mr Kantor</PERSON> said.
<PERSON>Mr Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON>, the treasury secretary, acknowledged that winning
congressional approval would be difficult, but said <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s passage was
important for <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> relations with the whole of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, and not just
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
'It's going to be a tough time passing it. It will not be easy, but I am
optimistic that we will get there, and this year,' he said.
Congressional leaders acknowledge that <PERSON>Mr Panetta</PERSON>'s vote count is correct,
but say that, with the side agreements still to be negotiated, it is
scarcely surprising that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> does not yet have the necessary support.
Foreign governments and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> trade analysts have at times been
perplexed over who in fact controls <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade policy, and there have been
reports of rifts between <PERSON>Mr Bentsen</PERSON>, with a broadly free trade approach, and
<PERSON>Mr Kantor</PERSON>, whose style has been more confrontational.
<PERSON>Mr Bentsen</PERSON>, however, insisted that trade policy was <PERSON>Mr Kantor</PERSON>'s
responsibility.

European trade negotiators arrive in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> for a two-day meeting
with US counterparts that is likely to determine the shape and scope of the
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round package of world trade reform.
'I am confident now that there will be an agreement by <DATE>December 15</DATE>,' the
deadline set for an accord, a <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> negotiator said before
departure. 'The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> meeting will decide whether it is a big deal, or
something more modest.'
While warning that a 'small package' would be much harder for national
governments to ratify, he signalled that outstanding differences over
protection and subsidies for steel presented a stumbling block. Negotiators
would be trying to 'reduce matters to an absolute minimum' - focusing on
market access, trade in services, anti-dumping rules, subsidies and
disciplines over support for steel and aircraft.
The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> meeting between <PERSON>Mr Mickey Kantor</PERSON>, <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade representative,
and Sir <PERSON>Leon Brittan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> trade commissioner, will allow <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> negotiators to
learn how events of the past week have influenced <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> strategy towards
completion of the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> has been a spectator during the
approval by the <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> and
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> courtship of Asian nations at the <ORGANIZATION>Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation</ORGANIZATION>
summit in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
US officials said at the weekend they believed that winning congressional
approval for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> had strengthened their hand in the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round
negotiations and had improved prospects of congressional support for the
<ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> deal.
'A good consequence of the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> win is that while we really would like a
deal, we don't have a high octane political need for one. When the president
says we want a good one, we can mean that,' an administration official said.
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> through on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by 61-38. A total of 34
Republicans joined 27 Democrats in favour of the measure; 28 Democrats and
10 Republicans opposed it.
As the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION> approaches <DATE>December 15</DATE>, after which President <PERSON>Bill
Clinton</PERSON> will lose his fast track authority to negotiate without line-by-line
congressional oversight, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> believes that the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> battle has
re-established a constituency for free trade within <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> would 'not accept a flawed agreement' but added
that a good <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> deal could create 1.4m jobs in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> over 10 years.
<PERSON>Tom Burns</PERSON> adds from <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>: President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
underlined that the road to a <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> agreement remained rocky when he used
bilateral weekend talks with the Spanish government in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> to deliver a
stinging attack on what he said were bullying US tactics following the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
accord.
He was supported by <PERSON>Mr Edouard Balladur</PERSON>, prime minister, who warned in a
joint press conference with <PERSON>Mr Mitterrand</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON>, Spanish
prime minister, that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> would have to soften its stance on <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
IN A victory for President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, a federal appeals court yesterday
overturned a ruling that US officials must prepare an environmental
assessment of the <ORGANIZATION>North American Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>).
The unanimous 3-0 decision reversed a lower court's ruling, which had
threatened to delay, if not scuttle, the proposed free trade pact between
the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
The earlier ruling would also have set a precedent which could have affected
other <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade agreements, including the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> Round. Environmental impact
statements (EIS) take months to prepare, and sometimes years to argue when
they are challenged in court.
On <DATE>June 30</DATE>, the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade community was thrown into an uproar when three
environmental and public interest groups - <ORGANIZATION>Public Citizen</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION>
and Friends of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> - successfully argued for US officials to prepare
an assessment of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s impact on the environment.
District Court <PERSON>Judge Charles Richey</PERSON> ruled that the three groups had
'demonstrated that there is a reasonable risk that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> may cause
environmental injury'.
The administration swiftly appealed, arguing that while agency proposals
might be subject to the <ORGANIZATION>EIS</ORGANIZATION> rule, the president is not. It is the president
who submits trade agreements, and his ambassador who negotiates them.
The appeals judges agreed and said the plaintiffs could not even sue until
executive action was final, that <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> has yet to be sent to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, and
the side agreement on environment 'may well change the dimensions of the
conflict over potential environmental damage'.
Although yesterday's ruling is likely to be appealed again to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION>, the court is not required to hear the case, and, if it does, is not
expected to reverse it.
While the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> yesterday was claiming victory, the three groups which
brought the suit could claim gains in the court of public opinion. In early
<DATE>summer</DATE>, most Americans were just beginning to learn about the trade pact.
The publicity given the court action brought the environmental link into the
news.
<ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> has become the most controversial trade agreement in memory, as
opponents fan the fears of job losses and environmental damage. The
administration is finally pushing hard for the pact, but it will be an
uphill battle.
Free-traders in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> worry that the unpopularity of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> bodes ill for
the more important <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>. They worry that, if the pact is defeated,
loss of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> credibility will hamper the already arduous negotiations in
<LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> and strengthen the forces of populism and protectionism in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
THE WHITE HOUSE yesterday chose to characterise as 'merely a difference of
opinion' President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s criticism of strong-arm trade union
tactics to persuade members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to vote against the <ORGANIZATION>North American
Free Trade Agreement</ORGANIZATION>.
Towards the end of his <DATE>Sunday</DATE> television interview, the president himself
had qualified his attack.
Advised during a commercial break of the initial news agency headlines of
his earlier comments, <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> said: 'These guys are my friends. I just
don't agree with them on <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>.'
<PERSON>Mr Mack McLarty</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, went on television
yesterday to deliver the same message. The president and the unions 'shared
a lot of common ground,' he said, although <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> was an exception.
Nevertheless, <PERSON>Mr Thomas Donahue</PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>AFL-CIO</ORGANIZATION>, the
umbrella union organisation, had on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> accused <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> of 'a
cheap shot', one which was 'part of a desperate effort to capture votes'.
Only a tiny fraction of organised labour has come out in favour of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>,
though opposition to it from some white-collar and federal employee unions
has been muted.
More typical was a comment to the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post yesterday by <PERSON>Mr William
Bywater</PERSON>, head of the electrical workers union: 'I tell any Democrat
(preparing to vote for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>) I am not going to support any of them, period.
I will try to get a candidate to run against them in the primary,' even if
it meant a seat falling to the Republican party.
Meanwhile, one employer with a heavily unionised workforce did come off the
fence yesterday in <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'s favour. <ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service</ORGANIZATION>, the country's
largest employer of members of the <ORGANIZATION>Teamsters</ORGANIZATION> union (165,000 out of the
company's payroll of 240,000), said that 'the trade boom from <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> will
result in hundreds of new <ORGANIZATION>UPS</ORGANIZATION> jobs', most of them for union members.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> was critical on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> corporations for not lobbying hard
enough in favour of the agreement, though the shift in the <ORGANIZATION>UPS</ORGANIZATION> position had
been decided on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Some substantial business political contributors
have also privately threatened to withhold funds from those who vote
against.
The president himself was fully engaged in the lobbying effort yesterday,
with three <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> meetings and a dinner for 15-20 undecided members of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> on his schedule.
But most attention was focused on tonight's televised debate between
Vice-President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire and last
year's independent presidential candidate.
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> yesterday confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> had passed on to <PERSON>Mr
Perot</PERSON> a death threat which, he said, came from a 'Mafia-like' group working
for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> approval.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US political sands shift under Nafta -
Prospects for the free trade deal are no longer so certain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement
seemed assured.
The proposed pact between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> had the support of the
Republican establishment, of Governor <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, the prospective
Democratic nominee, of the powerful <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Democrats on Capitol Hill and most
of the Democratic leadership in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushed
to the forefront of many polls in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> election campaign <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON>,
the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> billionaire. His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,
and he has said a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> pact would send jobs to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s support for <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is a winning issue. Although many working class
Hispanic Americans believe <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> would cost jobs, the Latino business
organisations cautiously support the pact.
Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
approved by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> this year. Between retirements and election defeats,
one-quarter to a one-third of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> could change, and no one can foresee
the prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
The president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the
agreement at the most politically opportune time.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like <PERSON>Mr Harry Freeman</PERSON>, executive
director of the <ORGANIZATION>MTN Coalition</ORGANIZATION>, believes the Democrats will use <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> as a
weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>May 1991</DATE>, in which he committed himself to action on
environmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>, or if they
don't send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional
Democrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn't
matter,' said <PERSON>Mr Freeman</PERSON>.
Governor <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>'.
The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> has prepared its
ground well in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>. It now has 200 signatories to a resolution,
introduced by Congressman <PERSON>Henry Waxman</PERSON> and majority leader <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>,
which warns that they will not support a <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> that does not have strong
environment or food safety provisions. Fifty-seven of the 200 signatories
voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on
the issue.
'There are millions more people who 'get' the <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> now,' said <PERSON>Ms Lori
Wallach</PERSON> of <PERSON>Ralph Nader</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Public Citizen</ORGANIZATION>. 'They have been contacted by their
local churches, labour unions, farm groups, environmental or consumer
organisations. There is a new awareness of its costs and that has come back
to their representatives in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.'
In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator <PERSON>Don
Riegle</PERSON>, which would permit <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to amend the agreement in five areas.
'If the <PERSON>Riegle</PERSON> resolution gets through,' said one business lobbyist, 'we
might as well kiss <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> goodbye.'

   Anyone who has been in Mexico City lately knows that the
city has a fair amount of industrial pollution. Now the talk
of including Mexico in a North American Free Trade Agreement
has stirred environmentalists' complaints that such an
arrangement would export a lot of Mexican pollution north of
the border.
   U.S. unions also complain about Mexican pollution. They
argue further that Mexican plants aren't subject to all of
the anti-pollution regulations that apply to U.S. plants.
It's easy to guess, though, that their major concern is that
NAFTA would send American jobs south of the border -- to
Mexico and its relatively low-cost labor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's impossible to come up with an easy answer. In a
<ORGANIZATION>National Bureau of Economic Research</ORGANIZATION> paper (Working Paper No.
3914), <PERSON>Gene Grossman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alan Krueger</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> seemed for
a while to have done so. Their research indicated that
air-quality measures in a cross-section of countries indicate
that economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems
once per-capita income reaches <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY>.
   <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is already at <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> and thus possibly at the point
where further growth would generate new political pressure
for environmental protection and perhaps changes in private
consumption. The current Mexican government already has
reduced the lead content of gasoline, ordered several power
stations to burn natural gas instead of sulfur-generating
fuel oil, and shut refineries and private firms found to be
major sources of air pollution.
   Presumably <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> still has a comparative advantage, at
least over the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, in pollution-control costs. But authors
<PERSON>Grossman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Krueger</PERSON> find little evidence that this advantage
has drawn much business to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. They speculate further
that removal by <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> of barriers to direct <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investment
could lead to specialization in low-polluting industries.
   If <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION> works as well as its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> labor union critics
fear, it is a safe assumption that it will make <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> more
prosperous. A more prosperous <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> would be better able to
afford pollution-control systems and devices. After all,
hardly anyone is fond of dirt.
   The Princeton authors admit that they haven't offered the
last word on this subject: "Our findings must remain
tentative until better data become available," they write.
"We have been unable to use any information about the
pollution situation as it currently stands in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, since
environmental monitoring there has been unsystematic at best.
Furthermore, the kinds of pollutants that we can examine are
limited by data availability."
   These are by no means the only obstacles to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s
participation in <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION>. This is an election year in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>,
and legislators sensitive to union views -- particularly
legislators based in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> -- have strongly
opposed <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s participation in <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION>.
   There is, moreover, an entirely different sort of
opposition to <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION>. There are many economists who believe
that free trade pacts such as <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION> will steadily undercut
international free trade agreements, such as the <ORGANIZATION>General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ORGANIZATION>. Regional trading blocs have
done very well through the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, while <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> seems to have
run aground.
   The <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> has sailed ahead, adding members
and planning to add more. Europe <DATE>1992</DATE>, its expansion plan, is
regarded as so sure a thing that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies are rapidly
expanding in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to take advantage of it. At the same
time, <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION>, which was supposed to have completed its <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay
Round</ORGANIZATION> by late <DATE>1990</DATE>, has yet to reach an agreement.
   Some trading blocs seem more natural than others. Even
without the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, European countries presumably would be doing
the bulk of their trade with one another, and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>
also seems a natural area. An agreement between the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> would seem less natural. Even <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>, with its ties to
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, would fit better with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   Some economists still see hope that <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> will reach an
agreement and, in the meantime, fear that its progress would
only be impeded by arrangements such as <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION>. If <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> does
finally settle its differences, they say, <ORGANIZATION>NAFTA</ORGANIZATION> and similar
pacts would fit in quite nicely.
   Mexican and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade officials, however, are unlikely to
stand aside cheerfully while <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> tries to solve its
problems. The current Mexican government is embarked on
economic reform, a program that could be quite beneficial to
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> as well as the Mexican economy.
   It's a difficult job, particularly when you consider the
obstacles. If it succeeds, however, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> may be not only
more prosperous but cleaner as well.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's tricky agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY one expectation arose from <PERSON>Mr Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s election <DATE>last November</DATE>
it was that, as a Democrat, he could break the legislative 'gridlock' by
working with the majority in both houses of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. Yet his main
achievement since taking office has been to scrape together, after months of
lobbying, the narrowest of congressional majorities for a distinctly
unadventurous budget. Within a few months now the political horizon will be
dominated by next year's congressional elections. If the president has not
by then firmly established his authority and used it to impose his own
agenda he will be in severe danger of becoming the third out of the last
four presidents to leave office after only one term.
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> political season opens today with a press conference at which the
vice-president, <PERSON>Mr Al Gore</PERSON>, will announce his proposals for 'reinventing
government'. In European terms this is partly about subsidiarity - letting
lower-level civil servants get on with their jobs and take decisions without
for ever referring to higher authority. In British terms it also contains a
dash of 'citizen's charter' - giving taxpayers guarantees of quicker and
better service for their bucks. In American terms there is something even
more familiar about it: a promise to cut the deficit by eliminating waste.
Such savings have generally proved illusory in the past. Perhaps <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON>
will do better, but in any case his performance will only be the hors
d'oeuvre. The substantial items on <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s menu are healthcare and the
North American free trade agreement.
Fragmented consensus
Health is the issue he has made peculiarly his own. He believes the
uncontrolled escalation of healthcare costs is the single most urgent
problem facing <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, a view that is widely shared, not least in the
business community. But, as the budget deficit issue shows, it is not enough
to achieve consensus on the urgency or importance of a problem in general
terms. Consensus quickly fragments when specific groups discover the problem
is to be solved at their expense. The chances against <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> achieving a
workable healthcare package on the first try do not seem promising.
But at least he will try. There is no danger of that issue going by default.
It would be agreeable to say the same, with the same confidence, about the
issue of free trade, whether in the North American regional context or the
broader one of <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION>.
Deserves credit
Certainly <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> is on record as favouring both ratification of <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION>
and an early conclusion of the <ORGANIZATION>Uruguay Round</ORGANIZATION>. He deserves much of the credit
for the breakthrough achieved in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>, and he can hardly be blamed
if it is sabotaged by French threats to veto the <ORGANIZATION>Blair House</ORGANIZATION> agreement on
agriculture which the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> negotiated with his predecessor. But while it is
primarily for Europeans to deal with that European problem, there are many
other items in the round still to be agreed, and they are unlikely to be so
by the <DATE>December</DATE> deadline without intensive political involvement at the
highest level.
Some <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> businessmen see <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> as an alternative to the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION>, even a
chance to punish <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with a taste of its own regional protectionist
medicine. That would be a good reason for opposing it, but there is little
or nothing in the agreement to justify such an interpretation.
Those who oppose <ORGANIZATION>Nafta</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, from <PERSON>Mr Ross Perot</PERSON> to <PERSON>Mr Ralph Nader</PERSON> and
the environmental movement, the trade unions, and an awkwardly large number
of Democratic congressmen, do so for other reasons. <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> has not
surrendered to these lobbies, but his handling of them has dismayed the
treaty's supporters.
That issue now cries out for real leadership, as do a number of foreign
policy issues: not least the Bosnian imbroglio, where <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s
indecision cannot be excused by, even if it does not in turn excuse, the
feebleness of his European allies. At home and abroad, he is now being
compared with his last Democratic predecessor, <PERSON>Mr Jimmy Carter</PERSON>. If - as may
be safely assumed - <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> strongly dislikes that comparison, he must
realise he has only a short time left in which to prove it wrong.
