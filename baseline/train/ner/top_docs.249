<DATELINE>VALLEY OF THE QUEENS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the <ORGANIZATION>Place of Beauty</ORGANIZATION>.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said <PERSON>Christian LeBlanc</PERSON>, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Children</ORGANIZATION>. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON>'s team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in <DATE>1307</DATE> B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show <PERSON>Hathor</PERSON>, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON>
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because <PERSON>Hathor</PERSON>'s realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> across the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> from present-day <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the <ORGANIZATION>Valley of the Kings</ORGANIZATION>. Many of ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON> in <DATE>1922</DATE>.
   That discovery brought international fame to the <ORGANIZATION>Valley of the
Kings</ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION>. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the <LOCATION>Nobles</LOCATION>.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the <ORGANIZATION>Valley of the Kings</ORGANIZATION>.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> talked, he and <PERSON>Fathy Hassanein</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center</ORGANIZATION>,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>'s powerful queen <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
<LOCATION>Nefret</LOCATION>, one of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>'s many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales <PERSON>LeBlanc</PERSON> has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses III</ORGANIZATION>.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, <PERSON>Leblanc</PERSON> said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator <PERSON>Ernesto Schiaparelli</PERSON>
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>.
It was <PERSON>Schiaparelli</PERSON>, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.

   Treasures even greater than those in <LOCATION>King
Tut</LOCATION>'s tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, director
of the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids area outside <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> and the huge ancient
cemetery of <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of what's
buried. After all, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut</ORGANIZATION> _ was found almost
intact in <DATE>1922</DATE> by the British archaeologist <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON>.
   It took <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Valley of the
<LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Tutankhamun</PERSON> was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of <LOCATION>Pharaoh Cheops</LOCATION>, whose pyramid on <LOCATION>Giza
Plateau</LOCATION> is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the <LOCATION>New
Kingdom</LOCATION>, the era of Tutankhamun and the <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 <ORGANIZATION>B.C. Records</ORGANIZATION> say he wanted to be
buried in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Siwa Oasis</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to <LOCATION>Siwa</LOCATION> to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the <ORGANIZATION>Siwan Oracle</ORGANIZATION>.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said <PERSON>Sayed
Tawfik</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   In <DATE>January</DATE> five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION>. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In <DATE>March</DATE> a mummy of a young woman, her <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON> smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>'s East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
<LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
<PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``In <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. These caches, which may explain the
<ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION> statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> find the <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

<HEAD>Artisans Reprise Great Moment, Re-creating Tut's Tomb</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artisans are re-creating one of the great
moments of archaeology on an island south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Nov. 26, 1922</DATE>, English archaeologist <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON> opened the
tomb of the boy <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION> and found a glittering world of
delicate statues, inlaid chests, feather-light fans and decorated
coffins of solid gold.
   The riches he discovered amazed the world.
   Now, 68 years after <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> peered into the small tomb in
southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, the artisans are fashioning Tut's netherworld once
again, working from photographs and other records. The replicas of
Tut's treasures are to be entombed as the archaeologist saw them.
   Twenty-two artists, sculptors, engineers and university students
are rekindling craftsmanship unseen since the days of the Pharaohs.
   They are halfway through their assignment: to duplicate his
four-chambered tomb and 1,000 of the 1,703 Tut objects in the
Egyptian Museum, as they were left by priests 3,313 years ago and
the robbers who came later.
   Ever-watchful jackals, goddesses in sleek gowns, open-mouthed
lions and even the boy Pharaoh himself, out for a walk in thonged
sandals, cram the bustling workshop on <ORGANIZATION>Jacob</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>.
   A year from now, every day on Jacob's Island will be <DATE>Nov. 26,
1922</DATE>.
   Until then, people wanting to marvel at <ORGANIZATION>King Tut</ORGANIZATION>'s storied world
must travel to the two places they have visited for decades: the
treasure hoard in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s Egyptian Museum and his tomb, with the
mummy, 450 miles to the south, in the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>.
   ``It's the wonder that we must produce in our tomb - the shock,
which you don't feel when you see the objects away from the tomb,''
said <PERSON>Mahmoud Mabrouk</PERSON>, a sculptor and art professor who directs the
Jacob's Island project.
   ``We work as a team, just as the ancients did,'' he said.
   Novices think Tut's treasures were all of solid gold. There was
plenty of that, but there also were objects of wood, silver and
other metals, alabaster, ivory, leopard skins, leather, pottery and
gemstones.
   Decisions on whether to replicate individual items, big or
small, were based on whether they were important to history or to
art knowledge.
   The project is costing 1 million Egyptian pounds (almost
<MONEY>$360,000</MONEY>) and is the brainchild of former diplomat <PERSON>Hassan Ragab</PERSON>, an
entrepreneur who revived <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s extinct papyrus industry.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE> he opened his Pharaonic Village on <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>, where
tourists come to view life from the days of <PERSON>King Tut</PERSON>, but without
the boy Pharaoh himself.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. Ragab</PERSON> asked me to create a full-scale tomb with exact
copies of objects so that tourists would feel the wonder as <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>
felt it,'' <PERSON>Mabrouk</PERSON> said. ``The tomb was no problem, but nobody knew
how to make the objects. Everybody I talked with told me to refuse
the offer.''
   Mabrouk, who advises an international committee working to save
the Sphinx, said he accepted the challenge for two reasons.
   ``First, I wanted to enter the mind of the ancient artist,'' he
said. ``What kind of people were these, to create things so
beautiful, but things that would never be seen by the living?
   ``Today, we artists have exhibitions and everybody congratulates
us. Not these artists. Their creations were locked up with Tut.''
   The second reason harks back to <ORGANIZATION>Mabrouk</ORGANIZATION>'s childhood.
   ``I was 12 when my brother and I saw the Tut collection in the
museum,'' he said. ``We were so happy, but we were sad. The objects
were beautiful, but nobody knew anything about them.''
   ``I want Egyptian youth to look back on their history with a
sense of pride, a sense of identity. It's an Arab problem that
Egyptians turn their backs on anything about the Pharaohs.''
   Mabrouk said he is astounded by the quality of Tut relics. ``We
had to start with the simplest items,'' he said. ``Once we mastered
the techniques, we could tackle the most difficult.''
   Reproduction has been made more difficult because objects in the
museum must be examined from behind glass and many Tut objects are
locked in storerooms. Books contain conflicting information, and
<PERSON>Mabrouk</PERSON> said many of <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s notes are inaccurate.
   Even lowly artifacts proved tricky. A simple pair of sandals
took three months to reproduce.
   Many of the 50 alabaster items from the tomb were lovingly
worked with exquisite designs. Alabaster posed one of the toughest
challenges.
   ``We spent six months working in alabaster factories outside the
Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>, just to see how to use the stone,'' <PERSON>Mabrouk</PERSON>
said. ``We finally made three simple vases, but even that took a
month.''
   Still to come are <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION>'s gold death mask and the
elaborately inlaid gold sarcophagus.
   ``Sometimes you just have to compromise,'' <PERSON>Mabrouk</PERSON> said. ``We'll
use gold-plated copper instead of gold, but the effect will be the
same.''

   Artisans are re-creating one of the great
moments of archaeology on an island south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Nov. 26, 1922</DATE>, English archaeologist <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON> opened the
tomb of the boy <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION> and found a glittering world of
delicate statues, inlaid chests, feather-light fans and decorated
coffins of solid gold.
   The riches he discovered amazed the world.
   Now, 68 years after <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> peered into the small tomb in
southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, the artisans are fashioning Tut's netherworld once
again, working from photographs and other records. The replicas of
Tut's treasures are to be entombed as the archaeologist saw them.
   Twenty-two artists, sculptors, engineers and university students
are rekindling craftsmanship unseen since the days of the Pharaohs.
   They are halfway through their assignment: to duplicate his
four-chambered tomb and 1,000 of the 1,703 Tut objects in the
Egyptian Museum, as they were left by priests 3,313 years ago and
the robbers who came later.
   Ever-watchful jackals, goddesses in sleek gowns, open-mouthed
lions and even the boy Pharaoh himself, out for a walk in thonged
sandals, cram the bustling workshop on <ORGANIZATION>Jacob</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>.
   A year from now, every day on Jacob's Island will be <DATE>Nov. 26,
1922</DATE>.
   Until then, people wanting to marvel at <ORGANIZATION>King Tut</ORGANIZATION>'s storied world
must travel to the two places they have visited for decades: the
treasure hoard in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s Egyptian Museum and his tomb, with the
mummy, 450 miles to the south, in the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>.
   ``It's the wonder that we must produce in our tomb - the shock,
which you don't feel when you see the objects away from the tomb,''
said <PERSON>Mahmoud Mabrouk</PERSON>, a sculptor and art professor who directs the
Jacob's Island project.
   ``We work as a team, just as the ancients did,'' he said.
   Novices think Tut's treasures were all of solid gold. There was
plenty of that, but there also were objects of wood, silver and
other metals, alabaster, ivory, leopard skins, leather, pottery and
gemstones.
   Decisions on whether to replicate individual items, big or
small, were based on whether they were important to history or to
art knowledge.
   The project is costing 1 million Egyptian pounds (almost
<MONEY>$360,000</MONEY>) and is the brainchild of former diplomat <PERSON>Hassan Ragab</PERSON>, an
entrepreneur who revived <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s extinct papyrus industry.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE> he opened his Pharaonic Village on <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION>, where
tourists come to view life from the days of <PERSON>King Tut</PERSON>, but without
the boy Pharaoh himself.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. Ragab</PERSON> asked me to create a full-scale tomb with exact
copies of objects so that tourists would feel the wonder as <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>
felt it,'' <PERSON>Mabrouk</PERSON> said. ``The tomb was no problem, but nobody knew
how to make the objects. Everybody I talked with told me to refuse
the offer.''
   Mabrouk, who advises an international committee working to save
the Sphinx, said he accepted the challenge for two reasons.
   ``First, I wanted to enter the mind of the ancient artist,'' he
said. ``What kind of people were these, to create things so
beautiful, but things that would never be seen by the living?
   ``Today, we artists have exhibitions and everybody congratulates
us. Not these artists. Their creations were locked up with Tut.''
   The second reason harks back to <ORGANIZATION>Mabrouk</ORGANIZATION>'s childhood.
   ``I was 12 when my brother and I saw the Tut collection in the
museum,'' he said. ``We were so happy, but we were sad. The objects
were beautiful, but nobody knew anything about them.''
   ``I want Egyptian youth to look back on their history with a
sense of pride, a sense of identity. It's an Arab problem that
Egyptians turn their backs on anything about the Pharaohs.''
   Mabrouk said he is astounded by the quality of Tut relics. ``We
had to start with the simplest items,'' he said. ``Once we mastered
the techniques, we could tackle the most difficult.''

Corona del <ORGANIZATION>Mar High School</ORGANIZATION>'s basketball team displayed an impressive amount of 
tenacity <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in its nonleague game against <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION>, the 
county's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Was it good enough for an upset? Not quite. Not with <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano Valley</ORGANIZATION> forward 
<PERSON>Scott McCorkle</PERSON> back in the lineup after missing one game because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle scored a game-high 38 points -- including 16 in the first half -- to 
lead <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION> to a 66-53 victory at <ORGANIZATION>Saddleback College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
For <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano Valley</ORGANIZATION> (8-2), the victory should help to boost the team's 
confidence for its next venture: the <ORGANIZATION>King Cotton</ORGANIZATION> tournament, one of the most 
prestigious in the nation, <DATE>Dec. 26-30</DATE> at <LOCATION>Pine Bluff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Especially uplifting for the <ORGANIZATION>Cougars</ORGANIZATION> was the play of <ORGANIZATION>McCorkle</ORGANIZATION>, a 6-foot-5, 
210-pound senior forward headed for <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> next year. <PERSON>McCorkle</PERSON> did not play 
in <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION>'s 82-59 loss to <LOCATION>Edison</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. But against <ORGANIZATION>Corona 
del Mar</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>McCorkle</PERSON> was tough to stop, especially in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (4-5) struggled early, forcing shots and making mental mistakes 
as <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION> took a 10-3 lead. After a timeout, <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> upped 
its man-to-man defensive pressure, and slowly chipped away at <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano 
Valley</ORGANIZATION>'s lead. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing 31-24 at halftime, <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> held <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION> 
scoreless for the first four minutes of the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, as it went on an 8-0 
run to take a 32-31 advantage. The score was tied at the start of the <DATE>fourth 
quarter</DATE>, 39-39. 
</P>
<P>
That would be as close as Corona del Mar would get. As the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION>' game fell 
apart -- thanks, in part, to a pressing <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano Valley defense</ORGANIZATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano 
Valley</ORGANIZATION> went on an 11-2 run, thanks to a three-pointer and a layup off a steal 
by <PERSON>Chris Kostoff</PERSON> and six points, four on free throws, by <ORGANIZATION>McCorkle</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff, who scored 40 points <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, was held to 11 points, nine in 
the fourth period. <PERSON>Warren Johnson</PERSON> had 24 points to lead the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Doug 
Hesse</PERSON> added 16.

Ronnie Long had three touchdown runs and intercepted three passes as <ORGANIZATION>Temecula 
Valley High</ORGANIZATION> claimed its first CIF championship <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with a 29-7 
victory over visiting <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section Division VIII</ORGANIZATION> title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss marked the last football game for <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON>, which is closing next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Temecula Valley</LOCATION> (11-3) took the lead for good at 10-7 on Long's two-yard run 
with 4:25 left in the first half. Long led the Bears with 83 yards in 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
After <PERSON>Mike Lassig</PERSON>'s fumble recovery near midfield, <LOCATION>Temecula Valley</LOCATION> took a 16-7 
lead on <PERSON>David Gonzalez</PERSON>' 26-yard pass to <PERSON>Greg Campbell</PERSON> with 46 seconds remaining 
in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (8-6), which had a four-game winning streak snapped, took its only 
lead at 7-3 as running back <PERSON>George Felactu</PERSON> scored from a yard out, culminating 
the first drive of the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Sea King quarterback <PERSON>Tim King</PERSON> dropped back to pass only six times in the <DATE>first 
half</DATE>, but was guilty of three turnovers. King threw two first-half 
interceptions and was hit in the pocket before losing the ball to <PERSON>Lassig</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
On the game's opening series, the Bears drove to the Palos Verdes 29-yard line 
before missing a field goal. Then, on the first drive for <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Sea 
Kings</ORGANIZATION> gained 41 yards in four carries before <PERSON>King</PERSON> was intercepted by Long. 
</P>
<P>
That turnover helped produce the game's first score on the ensuing drive, a 
36-yard field goal by <LOCATION>Temecula Valley</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>James McKee</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Long closed the scoring with two short touchdown runs in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Felactu paced <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON>' attack with 65 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez picked apart the <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON> defense with short passes in the first 
half, completing 11 of 14 attempts for 101 yards and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> completed 17 of 24 passes for 201 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez' favorite receiver was <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON>, who had 10 catches for 84 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> committed six turnovers; the Bears had only one. 
</P>
<P>
A 70-yard punt by <PERSON>John Miller</PERSON> was one of <PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON>' highlights.

<HEAD>Fragment of Gold Bracelet Linked to Ramses' Favorite Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses
II</ORGANIZATION>'s beautiful <PERSON>Queen Nefertari</PERSON> found a fragment of beaten gold
jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for
3,250 years.
   Resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been
attached originally to her missing mummy, Egyptian and American
officials said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in announcing the find.
   If the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen, it
would be rare indeed. The only other surviving legacy of <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>
is the lid of her sarcophagus, on exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION>Turin Egyptian
Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   Egyptian Culture Minister <PERSON>Farouk Hosni</PERSON> called the jewelry, which
is 1{ inches long and an inch wide, ``a significant discovery _
only the second object ever found that probably belonged to
<PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>.''
   The piece resembles segments of armlets or bracelets surviving
from <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>' <LOCATION>New Kingdom</LOCATION> era, with golden pieces linked by chains
and beads and decorated with flowers.
   The fragile gold sheet was in an anteroom behind the queen's
burial chamber, found during a project to stop the decay of
<PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>'s tomb in southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Valley of the <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>.
Sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, the project began
18 months ago and is expected to last another 3{ years.
   With its splendid vividly colored wall paintings, <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>'s is
the greatest among 80 tombs in shallow valleys called ``the place
of beauty.'' Royal wives and children were buried there in rock-cut
tombs opposite the ancient capital <LOCATION>Thebes</LOCATION>, now called <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, 450
miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Luis Monreal</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Getty Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s director, said nobody
believed anything of significance had escaped the attention of
grave robbers or the thousands of tourists and conservators who
visited the tomb since its discovery in <DATE>1904</DATE>.
   Workmen inching across the floor of the tomb's final chamber,
clearing away the centuries of dust by hand, found the fragment on
<DATE>Feb. 8</DATE>, <PERSON>Monreal</PERSON> said.
   It lay ``covered by dust, then by broken bits of wall paintings
which in themselves were covered by layers of dust,'' he said.
   ``Another real bonus that we hadn't expected is that we
recovered pieces of a complete segment (of wall painting), which
will cover some 10 square feet when we reattach it to the rear
wall,'' he said.
   Although proof hasn't been found that the fragment was
<PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>'s, there are indications, including its hieroglyphic
inscriptions, <PERSON>Monreal</PERSON> said.
   Los Angeles-based British Egyptologist <PERSON>Helen Strudwick</PERSON>, who
studied the piece for <ORGANIZATION>Getty</ORGANIZATION>, found significance in the ritual
inscription ``true of voice,'' a phrase ancient Egyptians normally
used after the name of the person who died.
   She noted that the phrase had a feminine ending. That, plus the
fragment's discovery inside <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>'s tomb, ``highly suggests''
that it was from the queen's burial paraphernalia, perhaps even
torn from her mummified body.
   ``The piece does not rank with the Tutankhamun treasure in
esthetic terms, but it still has historical and sentimental value
because the powerful <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON> simply vanished,'' <PERSON>Monreal</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON>, the beautiful and bold wife of warrior-hero <PERSON>Ramses
II</PERSON>, is thought to have died about age 45 about 3,250 years ago. Her
tomb paintings and inscriptions depict her as a woman of great
charm and exquisite taste, adorned with magnificent jewelry and
wearing fashionable gowns.
   Ramses' favorite of 13 wives, <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON> accompanied her husband
in battle and helped negotiate the world's first peace treaty,
<PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>' agreement with the troublesome <ORGANIZATION>Hittites of Asia Minor</ORGANIZATION>. In
her famous temple at <PERSON>Abu Simbel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON> is pictured begging
<PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> to be gentle with his captives.
   ``<PERSON>Nefertari</PERSON> was the world's first first lady,'' <PERSON>Monreal</PERSON> said.
``She was last seen accompanying her husband to consecrate the two
temples at <LOCATION>Abu Simbel</LOCATION> in <DATE>1255</DATE> B.C. Then we know nothing of her.
Maybe this piece will tell us about her death.''

<HEAD>Tut's Real Curse: Bacteria Eating Wall Paintings In Famous Tomb</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALLEY OF THE KINGS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapidly multiplying bacteria
are eating away vivid pictures from the walls of <ORGANIZATION>King Tut</ORGANIZATION>'s tomb,
one of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s most-visited tourist sites.
   Specialists have begun applying an antidote they hope can arrest
the bacteria, but antiquities officials say the original color never
can be restored to the small, pox-like black specks and blotches
marring the walls.
   ``The situation inside the tomb is extremely serious,'' said
Mutaw'ie Balboush, the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>'s director
for upper <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. ``Damage is appearing almost everywhere you look
among the figures.''
   At the start of the winter tourist season in early <DATE>November</DATE>,
officials were so worried they considered closing the tomb to let
conservators work unhindered.
   After the antidote was developed last week, however, work to save
the paintings was scheduled before and after tourist hours.
   Tutankhamun, a young pharaoh who died in <DATE>1323</DATE> B.C., was buried in
a makeshift tomb stuffed with riches in the barren Valley of the
Kings _ the southern wasteland where royalty and nobility were
buried for 500 years.
   During tourist season, his single-chambered tomb draws more than
2,500 visitors a day.
   Its wall paintings, some with colors as bright as the day they
were painted, depict noblemen and officials transporting Tut's mummy
to the tomb. They include a unique scene of the ``Opening of the
Mouth'' rite in which the dead king is given eternal life.
   ``We can't simply remove the infection, because the bacteria have
become part of the paint itself,'' said restoration director <PERSON>Shawky
Nakhla</PERSON>. ``We have to put the bacteria in a situation that won't
endanger the tomb itself.
   ``In the past the bacteria were dormant, but something has
triggered them to life. When we looked at them in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, they were
so active they were duplicating every day.''
   They found four kinds of bacteria and actinomycetes _ an
intermediate step between bacteria and fungi that in humans cause
abscesses under the skin.
   <PERSON>Omar Arini</PERSON>, science officer at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, said
bacteria have been present in Egyptian tombs since they were sealed
thousands of years ago.
   ``If something changes the environment inside a tomb, such as a
rise in humidity, then bacteria can come to life,'' <PERSON>Arini</PERSON> said.
   ``When this happens, the situation is extremely dangerous not
only for the tomb but for others in the vicinity. The bacteria can
spread.''
   <PERSON>Nakhla</PERSON> said bacteria in Tut's tomb could have been activated by
high humidity, difficult to control with so many visitors. And the
number of tourists is expected to increase dramatically during peak
season over the next two months.
   Though smaller and with lesser-quality paintings than some of the
62 nearby tombs, <PERSON>Tut</PERSON>'s burial place mesmerizes visitors.
   It owes part of its allure to the myth of a curse visited on
anybody who violates it. It gained prominence in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> and
<DATE>1930s</DATE>, after a number of people from the expedition team that found
the tomb in <DATE>1922</DATE> died unusual deaths.
   Egyptologists scoff at the idea. Grave robbers violated the tomb
at least twice in antiquity and <PERSON>Egyptologist Howard Carter</PERSON>, the
expedition leader, died naturally in <DATE>1939</DATE> at age 66.

   Stonecutters squat in the field alongside the outer wall of the Jing Ling tomb, chipping away at large granite blocks. 
Watched over by a marble Chinese lion, they work with hammer and chisel, echoing the work of the 15th- and 16th-century stonecutters who worked on these magnificently crafted <ORGANIZATION>Ming Tombs</ORGANIZATION>. 
As the 30 or so men strike their blocks, the melody they make rings in harmony with the guide's rendition of his spiel: <PERSON>Chang Ling</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ming</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ding Ling</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Ming</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jing Ling</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ming</LOCATION>. 

   A cock crows in the distance, a workman with a shovel over his shoulder ambles by, and it is easy to believe that times have not changed much since the days of the <ORGANIZATION>Ming Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The Ming emperors ruled a prosperous and fairly peaceful <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> from <DATE>1368</DATE> to <DATE>1644</DATE>. 
When the third emperor moved the capital from <LOCATION>Nanking</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> he set about finding a proper and peaceful royal burial place, near enough to the capital for fitting ceremonial respect to be paid, but remote enough to discourage curious visitors. 
Geomancers finally chose this forested, mountain-protected valley, about 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 

   Thirteen of the 16 Ming emperors lie here in elaborate tombs, each approached through a series of stylized, symbolic gates, screens and buildings. 
These structures are in various states of repair. 
It appears that the stonecutters are working to renovate <PERSON>Jing Ling</PERSON>, but that is not the case. 
The men are actually shaping stones to be used as the guardrails for a "flyover" (overpass) on the new superhighway being built nearby. 

   Ten thousand visitors a day come to look at the tombs. 
They drive through the Sacred Way, lined with mammoth stone animals and Chinese entrepreneurs hawking orange soda pop, T-shirts, cloisonne bracelets and fur hats. 
Past the Sacred Way, individual roads lead to the tombs. 

   <PERSON>Chang Ling</PERSON>, the oldest and largest of the tombs, has been meticulously renovated, but not excavated. 
All the tombs are easy to spot. 
The double-roofed stele pavilions immediately in front of each grave tumulus were built to command the valley, and their red roofs still dominate the scene. 
It is the names that confuse Westerners. 
The Ming emperors had a personal name and a reign name. 
Each tomb has a separate name, as does the temple within. 
Add to this the change in Chinese-to-English Romanization (Peking to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, Ching-ling to <PERSON>Jing Ling</PERSON>) and it's easy to see why the tombs are referred to by number, chronologically. 
Tomb One (<ORGANIZATION>Chang Ling</ORGANIZATION>) holds the third Ming emperor, but the first to be buried in the valley. 

   The 10th tomb, <PERSON>Ding Ling</PERSON>, has been excavated and is open to the public. 
After climbing three flights of stairs, visitors can see the magnificent blue-and-white porcelain jars in which oil was set aflame as the tomb was closed (to create an oxygen-free vacuum) and the massive four-ton marble tomb doors that sealed from the inside. 

   Tomb Three, <PERSON>Jing Ling</PERSON>, where the stonecutters work, has not been excavated nor has its exterior been as meticulously restored as that of the first tomb. 
It was built by the fifth Ming emperor, who ruled 1425-35. 
Since most tourists go to the first or 10th tomb, a visit here can be a serene glimpse into Ming history and architecture. 
Once inside the outer walls it is easy to appreciate the peace that the emperors sought. 

   Inside the first courtyard, a triple set of steps leads up to what was once a sacrificial hall. 
The hall is gone, and the expanse of open ground where it was gives a feeling of spaciousness. 
A steep ramp leads up to the stele pavilion, forcing visitors to stoop as they approach the grave site. 

   The pavilion dominates <PERSON>Jing Ling</PERSON> and holds the grave stele, the emperor's flattering "tombstone." 
A hidden passageway connects this building with the actual grave site. 
The emperor does not lie alone in <LOCATION>Jing Ling</LOCATION>. 
His empress is buried with him, as are 10 concubines. 

   When the tomb is eventually opened it is apt to contain a trove of blue-and-white porcelain like the jars in Ding Ling that inspire feverish whispers among tourists. 
It was during the fifth emperor's reign that this famous porcelain was perfected. 

   Except for developments in porcelain and a penchant for amassing collections (including one of Korean virgins), the fifth emperor made few ripples in history. 
One incident, however, does stand out. 
When the guardian families of Jing Ling village, whose job it was to protect the tomb, cut some trees that the emperor thought important to the beauty and serenity of the site, he had the villagers executed. 

   He might not take kindly to the stonecutters, whose steady chipping helps to build a highway to bring the curious more easily to his tomb site. 
And he would certainly be appalled at the sight of the helicopter poised in a small clearing between the peach and apple orchards that ring Jing Ling. 
It waits to take customers on a noisy flying tour of the <ORGANIZATION>Ming Tombs</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Funeral Boat Gently Moved into Elaborate Museum
Tomb Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the
funeral boat of one of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s most powerful pharaohs takes another
journey this week.
   The delicate, 32-foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off
the floor of the <ORGANIZATION>Field Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and
rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky
maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would
harm the ancient wood.
   Today, the boat used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in
about <DATE>1850</DATE> B.C. will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new
setting in the museum _ a <MONEY>$2.2 million</MONEY> permanent exhibit.
   When the exhibit opens in <DATE>November</DATE>, it will allow visitors to
walk through the eerie world of tombs, mummies, shrines to cat
goddesses and other treasures from ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. The museum said
the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>
to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex.
   King Sen-wosret's boat _ a graceful, crescent-shaped canoe-like
craft _ is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures
from the museum's collection used to recreate the burial scenes.
   Visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh,
<PERSON>King Unis</PERSON>, dating to <DATE>2400</DATE> B.C. and excavated from <LOCATION>Saqqara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,
in <DATE>1908</DATE>.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft takes visitors into
the dark and eerie burial chamber. The sarcophagus is empty. When
it was excavated, the pharaoh's mummy was gone, stolen by robbers
or destroyed by time.
   Leaving the burial chamber, the visitor passes through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into another scene depicting a
variety of Egyptian burial rites.
   ``This could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit,''
said its developer, <PERSON>Janet Kamien</PERSON>. ``It gives them (visitors) a
chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after
death.''
   Next month, the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the
exhibit, along with the accouterments their souls were to take with
them to the afterworld.
   Sen-wosret's boat will be displayed nearby.
   No one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the
king's body across the <LOCATION>Nile River</LOCATION> to the burial site, said <PERSON>Frank
Yurco</PERSON>, a scholar on ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Oriental Institute</ORGANIZATION> and a
consultant on the museum project.
   The boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 1893-94
by <PERSON>Jacques DeMorgan</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Welsh Egyptologist</ORGANIZATION>. Two badly deteriorated
ones were left at the site.
   Two of the four DeMorgan saved are at the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Museum</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> and the other is at the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
   Sen-wosret is remembered for military campaigns that extended
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s boundary into the Nubian region of <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION>,
as well as securing control of the <LOCATION>Nile River</LOCATION> to the south, he said.
   He also centralized the Egyptian government, setting the pattern
for several hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, said
Yurco.

THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: CHRONICLES OF AN ABUNDANT LAND, BY WILLIAM F. KING.

<P>
When the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> and the Spanish government established La Mision 
del <ORGANIZATION>Santo Arcangel San Gabriel de Los Temblores</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1769</DATE>, the surrounding land 
was marked chiefly by broad grass plains and clusters of oak and alder trees. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the area known as the <LOCATION>San Gabriel Valley</LOCATION> is better identified as home to 
nine freeways, more than two dozen cities and communities and close to 2 
million residents. 
</P>
<P>
That transition from virgin land to major metropolis is the subject of 
historian <PERSON>William F. King</PERSON>'s "The <LOCATION>San Gabriel Valley</LOCATION>: Chronicles of an Abundant 
Land." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Alhambra Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, the book looks at the area's 
history and its impact on the rest of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as one of the state's most fertile regions, the valley was an 
original site of what was to become <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s booming citrus industry, King 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1940</DATE>, the state's first freeway was built in the <LOCATION>San Gabriel Valley</LOCATION>. The 
opening of the <LOCATION>Arroyo Seco Parkway</LOCATION>, later called the <ORGANIZATION>Pasadena Freeway</ORGANIZATION>, ushered 
in an era of great highway construction for the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Today, <PERSON>King</PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> and the region's 
aerospace industry continue to affect the rest of the state, country and world. 
</P>
<P>
A native of <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION> and history professor at <ORGANIZATION>Mt. San Antonio College</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>King</PERSON> 
said much of the material for the book came from the college courses he 
teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Chronicles of an Abundant Land" is one of a series of community and regional 
histories produced by <ORGANIZATION>Windsor Publications</ORGANIZATION>. Others in the series include the 
<LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minn</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
According to <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> editor <PERSON>Jeffrey Reeves</PERSON>, the books chronicle histories of 
areas that might otherwise go unrecorded. "They tell a story that doesn't 
normally get told."

<TEXT>
   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
<PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was known to ancient Egyptians as <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, the
prophet, poet and king in the <DATE>14th century B.C.</DATE>, who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said <PERSON>Ahmed Osman</PERSON>.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,'' was published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Grafton Books</ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rights are under negotiation.
   Osman's first book in <DATE>1987</DATE>, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named <PERSON>Yuya was Joseph</PERSON>,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, held a reception <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, Osman builds on <PERSON>Sigmund
Freud</PERSON>'s last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at <ORGANIZATION>Jews' College</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   <PERSON>Naim Dangoor</PERSON>, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' <PERSON>Dangoor</PERSON> said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Amenhotep III</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Queen Tiye</PERSON>,
daughter of <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION> was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, <LOCATION>Tutankhamen</LOCATION>.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in <LOCATION>Sinai</LOCATION> with
a few followers,'' <PERSON>Osman</PERSON> said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, <PERSON>Ikhnaton</PERSON> saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged <ORGANIZATION>Horemheb</ORGANIZATION>'s general, <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>, for
the throne but <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in <DATE>1333</DATE> B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>' successor, <PERSON>Seti</PERSON> I.
This fight is recorded in the <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
<PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> because of memories of the oppression, <PERSON>Osman</PERSON>
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
<PERSON>Moses</PERSON> became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   <PERSON>Eric Uphill</PERSON>, an Egyptologist at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>University College</ORGANIZATION>,
said he helped and supported <PERSON>Osman</PERSON>'s research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, <PERSON>Uphill</PERSON> said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' <PERSON>Leperer</PERSON> said.
   Dangoor said <PERSON>Moses</PERSON>' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' <PERSON>Dangoor</PERSON> said.

CONEJO VALLEY MADE IT TOUGH BUT OFTEN FOUND A WAY TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION> established a reputation for playing exciting baseball this year, 
but it wasn't always in a positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, <ORGANIZATION>Conejo Valley</ORGANIZATION>'s young team had a tendency to be downright sporadic, as 
it was <DATE>Saturday</DATE> during a 10-9 win over District 16 rival <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> in the third 
round of the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion 6th Area</ORGANIZATION> playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A gallon of bleach could not have cleaned <LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION>'s mess, but Coach <PERSON>Craig 
Sturges</PERSON> was still beaming over the opportunity to play at <ORGANIZATION>Jackie Robinson 
Stadium</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We do some strange things out there, but you gotta love it," <PERSON>Sturges</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sturges</PERSON>' heart has been in his mouth lately. His team avoided a disaster by 
inches when <PERSON>Jim Chergey</PERSON>'s diving catch ended a nerve-wracking ninth. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION> took a 10-4 lead into the inning, but <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> (21-5), the 
District 16 champion, scored five runs -- four unearned -- courtesy of three 
<LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION> errors. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably saw more of that than I did, because I had my hands covering my 
eyes most of the time," <PERSON>Sturges</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time <LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION> fans had seen such unspectacular play. 
Last <DATE>spring</DATE>, all but one of <LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION>'s players attended Thousand Oaks 
High. The Lancers led the <ORGANIZATION>Marmonte League</ORGANIZATION> in errors last season, still, the 
team developed a knack for come-from-behind wins. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Garth Marcus</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Lancers</ORGANIZATION>' assistant coach, was at <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s game sporting a 
familiar grin. "TO baseball, baby," he said. <LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>a.k.a. Thousand 
Oaks</LOCATION>, had lost three of four games to <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION> continued to employ its cardiac style in the playoffs. It came 
from behind to beat <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, 9-8, in 10 innings <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, and its shaky 
defense allowed <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> to crawl back into <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s contest. The magic 
ended a few hours later, however, when <LOCATION>Woodland Hills West</LOCATION> eliminated <LOCATION>Conejo 
Valley</LOCATION>, 13-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize a loose approach, but I think we played it a little too loose," 
<PERSON>Sturges</PERSON> said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's <PERSON>Chris Borchard</PERSON>, who had led off the ninth inning <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with a 
walk and reached third on <PERSON>Jon McMullen</PERSON>'s single, scored after an error on <PERSON>Mike 
Mitchell</PERSON>'s grounder. <PERSON>Mike Muncy</PERSON>'s bloop single drove in two more runs and cut 
the deficit to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Conejo Valley</LOCATION> pitcher <PERSON>Bryan Corey</PERSON>, who had relieved <PERSON>Nick Brown</PERSON>, dropped a pop 
fly that would have ended the game. Then <PERSON>Kasha Clemons</PERSON> -- who had hit his 11th 
home run in the sixth -- stepped into the batter's box representing the tying 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (<ORGANIZATION>Conejo Valley</ORGANIZATION> third baseman) <PERSON>Billy Hall</PERSON> that if <PERSON>Kasha</PERSON> hits a three-run 
dinger, we'll have to run over and revive <PERSON>Sturges</PERSON>," <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Gary Wagner</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> didn't homer but still gave <PERSON>Sturges</PERSON> palpitations with a long fly ball 
to right field that <PERSON>Glenn Marshall</PERSON> dropped on the warning track. The error 
allowed two more runs to score and pulled <LOCATION>Camarillo</LOCATION> to within 10-9. And <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> 
stood eagerly at second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for a popup, and we drop it. Then I want a fly ball, and we drop 
that," <PERSON>Sturges</PERSON> said. "Then I just didn't want them to hit it to short, where my 
son (<PERSON>Brian</PERSON>) was." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mitch King</PERSON> lofted a fly ball into short center field and <PERSON>Chergey</PERSON>, who got a 
late jump, charged and made a diving catch. Chergey, who played on the junior 
varsity at <LOCATION>Thousand Oaks</LOCATION> <DATE>last spring</DATE>, started in place of <PERSON>Brent Christenson</PERSON> and 
was three for four. <PERSON>Christenson</PERSON>, who is batting .350, missed the game in order 
to practice with the <ORGANIZATION>U. S. Amateur</ORGANIZATION> team. 
</P>
<P>
"Chergey's only a sophomore, but he had a great game," <PERSON>Sturges</PERSON> said. "We put a 
load on his shoulders, and he carried the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, we play an exciting brand of baseball." 
</P>
<P>

<ORGANIZATION>El Toro High School</ORGANIZATION> presented a different version of the two-minute offense 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> High, one that produced points in the water. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger water polo team scored twice with less than two minutes remaining 
in first half, and <ORGANIZATION>J.P. Mathot</ORGANIZATION> scored the game-winning goal with 1:54 to play 
as <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> (25-3) defeated <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION>, 3-2, in the Southern Section 4-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> will face Long Beach <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> (22-6) in the final at <TIME>8:45 Wednesday night</TIME> 
at <LOCATION>Belmont Plaza</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. Wilson beat <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION>, 8-4, in the other 
semifinal. <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> will be seeking its first 4-A championship after winning 
consecutive 3-A titles in <DATE>1988</DATE> and <DATE>'89</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have an experience advantage over some teams," <PERSON>Mathot</PERSON> said, "because 
we aren't happy just to be in the finals, but we want to win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Capistrano Valley</ORGANIZATION> (23-4) has dropped the past three meetings with <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION>, 
including last year's 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mathot</PERSON>, who scored 31 goals in his previous five games, went scoreless for the 
first 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense for both teams today was unbelievable," <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Ron Stoll</PERSON> 
said. "I thought <ORGANIZATION>J.P.</ORGANIZATION> was playing well, but he got frustrated because he tried 
to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played lousy today," <PERSON>Mathot</PERSON> said, "but I tried to focus myself to 
do at least one thing right on that last play." 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied, 2-2, and two minutes remaining, <PERSON>Mathot</PERSON> zeroed in when he 
received the ball in the hole. He turned <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano Valley</ORGANIZATION> defender <PERSON>Dan Hancock</PERSON> 
at the two-meter line, then fired his game-winner past goalie <PERSON>Nick Kittredge</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't crash down on <PERSON>Mathot</PERSON> on that play," <ORGANIZATION>Capistrano Valley Coach</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Don 
Cholodenko</PERSON> said, "but we lost the game because we didn't capitalize on our 
six-on-five advantages." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars went zero for three on the one-man advantages, but <ORGANIZATION>El Toro</ORGANIZATION> 
converted on two consecutive <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION> kick-outs, with <PERSON>Greg Craycraft</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Jason Kneitel</PERSON> scoring, to erase a 2-0 deficit late in the first half.

<HEAD>Student Rediscovers Tutankhamun's Funeral Feast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruits, spices and grains entombed with the
ancient Egyptian boy king <PERSON>Tutankhamun</PERSON> for his journey to the
afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty
storeroom, a newspaper reported today.
   The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> said an archeological student discovered the
boxes of food remains at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION>.
   The newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since
they were sent to the gardens in <DATE>1932</DATE> by <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON>, who
discovered <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION>'s tomb in the Valleys of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1922</DATE>.
   The remains were to have been cataloged by retired botanist
<PERSON>Leonard Boodle</PERSON>, but were apparently forgotten after his death in
the <DATE>1930s</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Arthur Bell</PERSON>, director of the gardens at <LOCATION>Kew</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>south London</LOCATION>, was
quoted as saying the remains recently were identified by <PERSON>Christian
Tutundjian de Vartavan</PERSON>, a 23-year-old French student working on a
master of science degree in ancient Egyptian plants at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>University College</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Times</ORGANIZATION> said the college's <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Archaeology</ORGANIZATION> is trying
to determine what species of plants are represented in the hoard,
which includes sections of funeral wreaths and more than five
pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in <LOCATION>Tutankhamun</LOCATION>'s tomb
after his death more than 3,300 years ago.
   The Times said the species indentified so far include emmer
wheat for making bread on the journey, barley for brewing beer and
a considerable quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on.
   Also found were coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries and grapes.
   The Times quoted <ORGANIZATION>University College</ORGANIZATION> botanist <PERSON>Gordon Hillman</PERSON> as
saying the collection also includes more than 20 species of weeds.
   ``They will help to tell us how the crops were irrigated, how
they were harvested and how they were stored,'' <PERSON>Hillman</PERSON> was quoted
as saying.
   The newspaper said officials at <LOCATION>Kew</LOCATION> are willing to return the
specimens to the Egyptian government, but would like to put some on
display.
   The Independent newspaper said Tutundjian de Vartavan came
across the Tutankhamun remains while studying ancient Egyptian
plant remains.
   The Times and The Independent said the find represents only a
fraction of the food buried in the tomb. The rest is still in 116
original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the <LOCATION>Cairo
Museum</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Dokki Agricultural Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
<PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was known to ancient Egyptians as <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, the
prophet, poet and king in the <DATE>14th century B.C.</DATE>, who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said <PERSON>Ahmed Osman</PERSON>.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,'' was published in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Grafton Books</ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rights are under
negotiation.
   Osman's first book in <DATE>1987</DATE>, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named <PERSON>Yuya was Joseph</PERSON>,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, held a reception <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, Osman builds on <PERSON>Sigmund
Freud</PERSON>'s last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at <ORGANIZATION>Jews' College</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   <PERSON>Donald B. Redford</PERSON>, professor of <ORGANIZATION>Near Eastern</ORGANIZATION> studies at <ORGANIZATION>Toronto
University</ORGANIZATION> and an expert on <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, scoffed at the theory.
   ``There is no evidence that <PERSON>Ikhnaton</PERSON> was a man called <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and
the religious teachings of <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION> have nothing to do with <PERSON>Moses</PERSON>,
who appears to have lived five centuries after him or longer,''
<PERSON>Redford</PERSON> said in a telephone interview.
   <PERSON>Naim Dangoor</PERSON>, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' <PERSON>Dangoor</PERSON> said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Amenhotep III</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Queen Tiye</PERSON>,
daughter of <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, <ORGANIZATION>Ikhnaton</ORGANIZATION> was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, <LOCATION>Tutankhamen</LOCATION>.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in <LOCATION>Sinai</LOCATION> with
a few followers,'' <PERSON>Osman</PERSON> said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, <PERSON>Ikhnaton</PERSON> saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged <ORGANIZATION>Horemheb</ORGANIZATION>'s general, <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>, for
the throne but <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in <DATE>1333</DATE> B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>' successor, <PERSON>Seti</PERSON> I.
This fight is recorded in the <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
<PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> because of memories of the oppression, <PERSON>Osman</PERSON>
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
<PERSON>Moses</PERSON> became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   <PERSON>Eric Uphill</PERSON>, an Egyptologist at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>University College</ORGANIZATION>,
said he helped and supported <PERSON>Osman</PERSON>'s research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, <PERSON>Uphill</PERSON> said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' <PERSON>Leperer</PERSON> said.
   Dangoor said <PERSON>Moses</PERSON>' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' <PERSON>Dangoor</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pit In Luxor Temple Yields 15 More Ancient Statues</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excavators have uncovered another 15 statues
of ancient royalty and gods from a pit inside <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION> that
yielded five magnificent statues earlier this year.
   The overall find is as significant as the discovery of the tomb
of Tutankhamun in <DATE>1922</DATE>, which yielded enormous amounts of gold and
other precious objects, said <PERSON>Sayed Tawfik</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The Tut tomb was wonderful but gave us information only about
the art of the day,'' <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``This find will answer
many questions about many periods of history.''
   He said one of the new statues is unlike any ever found: a
42-inch-high white granite cobra, probably representing Mertsager,
the goddess of silence. Her job was to keep secret the location of
royal tombs in the bone-dry valleys of the kings and queens across
the <LOCATION>Nile River</LOCATION> opposite present-day <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> 450 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   Tawfik and other Egyptian officials said workers trying to take
the search deeper hit underground water at the 10-foot level that
makes digging more difficult.
   Water is more than 3 feet deep at the bottom of the pit,
endangering not only the excavation but a row of towering columns
nearby, <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> said.
   Many Egyptologists consider <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION>, built more than 3,300
years ago, the most endangered monument in the antiquity-rich <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>
area. It lies in a picturesque setting between the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> and the
modern town of <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> and suffers greatly from rising water and
other natural debilitations.
   The new statues, found in a sacred courtyard beneath the earlier
finds, cover a wide range of Egyptian history and include
depictions of some of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s best-known rulers and a pantheon of
gods.
   Tawfik said the earliest appears to be an alabaster Sphinx
dating from the reign of <LOCATION>Tutankhamun</LOCATION>, the young pharaoh who died in
<DATE>1323</DATE> B.C. after a 10-year reign. The latest is a whnite
cobra from the reign of Tao ruled for 26 years and died in
664 <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION> at a time when the pharaonic period was in its death
throes.
   He said some of theries are broken and lack the
artistic excellence of the original five.
   Most of the new stere found last month. Officials said
pieces of some statues were buried at diff
phenomenon they could not explain.
   On <DATE>Jan.</DATE>ound the first of the original five
beautifully preserved statues from the <LOCATION>New Kingdom</LOCATION>, a golden age of
wealth and power for Egyptian kings. The five dated from the reigns
of Amenhophis III, the builder of <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION> who ruled from <DATE>1391</DATE>
to <DATE>1353</DATE> B.C., to <LOCATION>Haremhab</LOCATION>, a powerful military commander who died
in <DATE>1307 B.C.</DATE>, 12 years after gaining the throne following
Tutankhamun's pnd the brief reign of the caretaker
Aya.
   Antiquities experts are debating why the statues ried,
when and by whom. The answers may never be found.
   ``We have to wait to find the answers, because evee
think we have the right information, we have to change our mim different
periods are found,'' <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON>
said. ``Now we've even found Roman pottery'' in the exc  <ORGANIZATION>The Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION>
cache doesn't appear to approach in number
those statues discovered early th
complex three miles away.
   At <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION>, the cache contained thousands of statues of gods and
individuals, ans cache contains only
royal and religious images and at least three unique statues,
Tawfik sai
   Statues in the latest find are of various materials and sizAn alabaster
statue of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>, its head missing, stands on a is 30 inches high.
   Of the 15, the relic ins a 2-foot-tall
diorite head of the powerful god Amun wearing atwo feather crown.

HOWARD CARTER by <ORGANIZATION>T G H James Kegan Paul Pounds</ORGANIZATION> 24.95 443 pages
<PERSON>HOWARD CARTER</PERSON> BEFORE TUTANKHAMEN by <PERSON>Nicholas Reeves</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>John H Taylor
British Museum Pounds 12.95</ORGANIZATION>, 201 pages
AT LAST, 70 years after he found the tomb of <LOCATION>Tutankhamen</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON> is
receiving the acclaim he deserves - a major biography, a fascinating
exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION>British Museum</ORGANIZATION> and a lively book and television series to
accompany it. Why so long? Probably because he was difficult, litigious and
somewhat greedy - in short, 'a troublemaker'. Yet this archaeologist, who
never received an honour from British royalty and never went to university
but was an honorary doctor of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, resurrected the <DATE>14th century</DATE> BC teenage
king of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> with a patience, determination and skill that still leave
professionals gasping.
How did <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> come to be the man who raised Tutankhamen from the dead? The
short answer is that he was well respected but out of work in <DATE>1909</DATE>, when
<ORGANIZATION>Lord Carnarvon</ORGANIZATION> hired him to dig in the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION> on the <LOCATION>West Bank
of</LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> opposite <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>. TGH <PERSON>James</PERSON>, retired Keeper of Egyptian
Antiquities at the BM, gives the long answer in his judicious, leisurely
biography, which fits many strange details in to their context (even if it
omits <PERSON>Almina Carnarvon</PERSON>'s re-marriage within nine months of the <ORGANIZATION>Earl</ORGANIZATION>'s
death.)
James's book will delight those eager to learn about archaeology abroad in
the days when <LOCATION>Carnarvon</LOCATION> ordered <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON>'s of Piccadilly to send out curried
fowls and tabasco sauce to the <ORGANIZATION>Winter Palace</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>. And it will bring wry
smiles of recognition to any digger who has suffered prickly colleagues,
permit problems with host officials, and money disputes with committees in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON> came from a family of journeyman-artists. Aged only 17, his fine
watercolours of birds and wild animals gave him an extraordinary break when,
with a subvention from <LOCATION>Lord Amherst</LOCATION>, he went as a 'tracer' to record the
spirited paintings in the tombs at <LOCATION>Beni Hasan</LOCATION> in middle <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. The country
caught him. He lived in a tomb on a cliff overlooking the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> and worked
from dawn to dusk.
His drawings and pictures, on view at the BM, show he was a prodigy with an
exceptional eye, a firm but lively line, and the humility and patience to
look at every little bit of what the ancient artist had created and
reproduce it. (He even includes the cracks and flaking.) As bland
photographs never can, his pictures take you straight back to how the world
saw itself 4000 years ago.
Two months later he had a dig of his own - for <LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION>, but under the
direction of the great <PERSON>Flinders Petrie</PERSON>. Within three years (and still a
minor) he had changed for ever how draughtsmen drew Egyptian tombs. In the
meantime he started a lifelong career of part-time dealing in antiquities,
using his keen eye and knowledge of Arabic and the Egyptians which today
would be quite improper for a field archaeologist. It repaired his modest
circumstances, a constant nag to which patrons and grand friends did not
respond.
Later, he bought for Carnarvon and the American museums, and died in <DATE>1939</DATE>,
comfortably off from commissions and lecture fees. He had come up in the
world, dressing with a touch of the rakish like <LOCATION>Carnarvon</LOCATION>, and had taken
elocution lessons.
At 25 he was chosen by the Director of Antiquities to be Inspector of <LOCATION>Upper
Egypt</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> - an astonishing but perceptive testimonial to the excellence
of a self-taught man. <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> tackled the job practically, fitting gates and
installing electric light in the tombs in the Valley of the Kings so that
visitors at last could see them. He lived in 'Castle <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>' among the ruins
on the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION>, where he kept a menagerie that included a pet gazelle.
Promotion to <LOCATION>Lower Egypt</LOCATION> was not so happy. In <DATE>1905</DATE> a fracas erupted with a
party of drunken French visitors at <LOCATION>Saqqara</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s men used their sticks:
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON> he rushed off a telegram to <ORGANIZATION>Lord Cromer</ORGANIZATION> to explain. This revealing
incident strained the <ORGANIZATION>Entente Cordiale</ORGANIZATION>, a touchy thing in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. The press
was fervid in both languages. Rights and wrongs are unclear. An apology from
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON> would have let it pass, everybody told him. He refused, and became
known as a difficult man. Soon after he resigned his job, thinking he would
make a living from his watercolours, dealing and high-class guiding.
A grim few years followed which <ORGANIZATION>Carnarvon</ORGANIZATION>, who had come to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to recover
from a motor accident, broke by offering him a job to dig for him on the
<LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> (as well as buying antiquities). The two men became good friends.
In <DATE>1911 Carter</DATE> built himself a second 'Castle <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>', with bricks from the
<ORGANIZATION>Earl</ORGANIZATION>'s own brickworks stamped 'MADE AT BRETBY ENGLAND FOR <PERSON>HOWARD CARTER</PERSON> AD
<LOCATION>THEBES</LOCATION> 1910' - just as the Pharoahs used to do. In <DATE>1914</DATE> Carnarvon secured
the concession for the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>, where it seemed that only one
royal tomb had not been found. The First World war then interrupted the
proceedings, and <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> worked intermittently for Intelligence in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
In the <ORGANIZATION>Valley</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> mapped everything that he - or anybody else - had
found. By <DATE>autumn 1922</DATE> the only place left to look was under some huts. He
moved them and on <DATE>November 4</DATE> found the entrance of the sealed royal tomb.
Carnarvon left <LOCATION>Berkshire</LOCATION> at once. On <DATE>November 26</DATE> the two peered in through a
small hole. 'Can you see anything?' 'Yes, wonderful things.'
Troubles began forthwith - with the press, officials, visitors who thought
they deserved privileged access, and the scholars. 'Gold always maddens
people', <PERSON>Petrie</PERSON> wrote later. Nerves were at breaking point: was the tomb
really intact? Yes] and although there had been a break-in a very long time
ago, the tomb had been resealed. <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> faced the most difficult and most
spectacular task that archaeology has ever seen. The pressure was colossal.
Thank goodness for his cool determination. He assembled a first-rate team
and took ten years to clear the tomb. It was all worth the effort, the rows,
and suffering from ill health. If in doubt, go to the Egyptian Museum in
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, and in the BM exhibition look at <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>'s catalogue cards and records
to see with what superb professionalism this awkward and, I assume,
resentful man did the job.
From <ORGANIZATION>Earl's Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Swaffham</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> it is a long way to the
Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>. It was his eye that carried him forward, both by what
he drew or bought and, figuratively, because he recognised what was really
important. To grasp fully his achievement, visit <PERSON>Howard Carter Before
Tutankhamen</PERSON> at the BM (till <DATE>May 31</DATE>), and look at his watercolours, his
plans, and the wonderful pieces he bought for his collectors. An entrancing
video, slowed down to cut out the jerky movements of <DATE>1920s</DATE> film, shows him
at work. Tut brought blessings, not curses.

section of the <ORGANIZATION>Field Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> to an exhibit
designed to recreate a pharoah's tomb.
   ``It went very well,'' said <PERSON>Suzanne Santos</PERSON>, a museum spokeswoman.
   Before the move, the 32-foot boat _ a graceful craft resembling
a canoe _ was gently lifted off the floor and rotated so it was
pointing south to its new destination, <PERSON>Mrs. Santos</PERSON> said.
   Riggers who performed the tricky maneuver had to keep their
hands off, so no sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood.
   The boat, used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in about
1850 <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION>, now becomes part of a new permanent exhibit called
``Inside Ancient Egypt,'' which opens in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   The actual moving of the boat took about an hour, <PERSON>Mrs. Santos</PERSON>
said.
   The ancient craft has been at the museum since <DATE>1900</DATE>, and for at
least a dozen years has been encased in glass in a room with other
Egyptian artifacts.
   ``It was your typical museum collection,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Santos</PERSON> said.
   The new exhibit will give visitors a feel for ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,
though glass will still prevent any direct contact with the boat,
she said.
   The exhibit will give visitors their only opportunity outside
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex, with two
burial chambers, mummies and a shrine to the cat goddess Bastet,
the museum said.
   King Sen-wosret's boat is among more than 1,000 artifacts to be
displayed.
   Visitors will enter the tomb chambers of Unis-ankh, son of the
5th Dynasty pharaoh Unis. The chambers date to <DATE>2400</DATE> B.C. and were
excavated at <LOCATION>Saqqara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1908</DATE>.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft will take visitors
into the dark burial chamber itself. The sarcophagus is empty. When
the tomb was excavated, the mummy was gone, probably stolen by tomb
robbers.
   Leaving the burial chamber, visitors will pass through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into a series of Egyptian burial
scenes featuring dioramas, 23 mummies and other artifacts.
   ``It gives (visitors) a chance to explore the age-old mysteries
of mummies and life after death,'' said the exhibit's developer,
<PERSON>Janet Kamien</PERSON>.
   Sen-wosret's boat was one of four excavated in <DATE>1894</DATE> from his
tomb at Dashur by <PERSON>Jacques DeMorgan</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Welsh Egyptologist</ORGANIZATION>, the
museum said. Two are at the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> and the other
is at the <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>.
   No one knows if Sen-wosret's boats were used to transport his
body across the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> to the burial site, or if they was buried near
the tomb for use in the afterlife by the king's soul, said <PERSON>Frank
Yurco</PERSON>, a scholar on ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Oriental Institute</ORGANIZATION> and a
consultant on the museum project.
   Sen-wosret conducted military campaigns that extended <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s
boundary into the Nubian region of <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION>, as well
as securing control of the <LOCATION>Nile River</LOCATION> to the south, he said. He
also centralized the government, setting the pattern for several
hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, <PERSON>Yurco</PERSON>
said.

CHURCH GROUP TO FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of more than 40 churches in the northeast <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> 
announced plans <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to form a community-based volunteer group to combat 
social problems such as drugs and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a meeting of the Ministers' Fellowship of the 
<LOCATION>Greater San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> attended by more than 200 people, including 
representatives from several homeowner groups, at <ORGANIZATION>First United Methodist Church 
of Pacoima</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Los Angeles City</LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON>Nate Holden</PERSON> delivered a brief speech 
supporting the group's effort. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Fred Taylor</PERSON>, assistant to the president of the group, said the organization 
wants to reassert the black church's historical importance and effectiveness in 
dealing with a number of social ills, including the proliferation of drugs, 
gang activity and other crime in <LOCATION>northeast Valley</LOCATION> communities. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said the organization, known as the Ministers' Fellowship of the <LOCATION>Greater 
San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>, will establish a non-religious group, to be named Focus 
90, to address these issues. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group will provide counseling, drug- and alcohol-treatment programs 
and financial support to homeless youngsters or those who might be without 
proper family support. The group also will be involved in neighborhood cleanup 
programs in an effort to restore community pride, and will work closely with 
the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police Deparment</ORGANIZATION> to provide safer neighborhoods, <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group's main goal will be to re-establish the church's leadership 
role in the community, something he said was lost with the assassination of 
<ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1968</DATE>. King's birthday is being celebrated today as a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try and create that type of leadership again, in a small way, in 
the <LOCATION>northeast Valley</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said, adding that he hoped that social programs 
established by the fellowship would spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the Rev. <PERSON>James V. Lyles</PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>First United 
Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Pacoima</LOCATION>, was installed as president of the fellowship. 
<PERSON>Lyles</PERSON> was elected to the <DATE>post two months ago</DATE>.

<HEAD>Archaeology Student Finds King Tut Hoard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain,
dried fruit, spices and insects from the 3,300-year-old tomb of the
<ORGANIZATION>Egyptian King Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION>, archaeologists said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   ``It obviously is extremely important archaelogically because
it's a very large amount of material,'' said <PERSON>John Evans</PERSON>, director
of the <ORGANIZATION>University of London's Institute of Archaeology</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Very little work has been done on material of this period in
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, and I understand that some of the species which have been
identified are, in fact, the earliest occurrences,'' <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said at
a news conference.
   Most of the discovery consists of the food placed in
<LOCATION>Tutankhamun</LOCATION>'s tomb to sustain him on his journey to the afterlife.
Scientists said the material is well preserved and could provide
best evidence to date of the diet and lifestyle of the Egyptians at
the time of <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION>'s death in <DATE>1323</DATE> B.C.
   For more than 50 years, the hoard has lain undisturbed in 30
cardboard boxes in a musty storeroom at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Botanical
Gardens</ORGANIZATION>. The specimens were sent in <DATE>1932</DATE> by <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON>, the
British archaeologist who discovered <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION>'s treasure-laden
tomb in the Valleys of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1922</DATE>.
   They were to have been cataloged by the botanist <PERSON>Leonard Boodle</PERSON>.
But Boodle and <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> both died in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> before the work could
be completed, and the specimens were stored in boxes labeled ``From
Ancient Egypt.''
   In <DATE>February of this year</DATE>, the material was turned over to a
French graduate student at the archaelogical institute, 23-year-old
Christian Tutundjian de Vartavan, for research leading to a
master's degree in archaeobotany, the institute's speciality.
   He recognized notations on the boxes as those of <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>,
providing the first clue that they might be from <LOCATION>Tutankhamun</LOCATION>'s
tomb. Scientific analysis confirmed his theory and eventually
fragments were matched with photographs taken by <PERSON>Carter</PERSON>.
   ``It all fit in. It was beyond coincidence,'' said
archaeobotanist <PERSON>Gordon Hillmann</PERSON>, who supervised the student's work.
Tutundjian de <PERSON>Vartavan</PERSON> did not attend the news conference.
   Professor <PERSON>David Harris</PERSON>, director of the archaeology institute's
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Human Environment</ORGANIZATION>, said the announcement was delayed
until it had completed scientific analysis.
   ``We were anxious to announce it as soon as possible, lest it
should leak out, but we felt we had to keep it under wraps as long
as possible, so that we could get as much work accomplished as we
could,'' <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said.
   He acknowledged that one reason for the secrecy was concern that
the Egyptian government might demand possession before the
institute had completed its analysis.
   Last week, the institute informed the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>
about the discovery and offered to return the material. As of
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the institute had received no reply, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said.
   The hoard includes fragments of funeral wreaths and more than
five pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in <LOCATION>Tutankhamun</LOCATION>'s
tomb, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said.
   Among identified species are emmer wheat for making bread on the
journey, barley for brewing beer, a large quantity of watermelon
seeds to chew on, coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries, grapes and a datelike fruit known as
a jujube.
   The grains, fruits and seeds were intended as raw materials that
figurines known as shawabtis found in the tomb would cultivate into
food needed by the ``ka'' _ one of the king's souls _ in the
afterlife, <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said.
   Dr. <PERSON>Ken Thomas</PERSON>, a specialist in insects, said the remains of
thousands of beetles also had been identified. The foods were to
sustain the boy king through eternity, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said, ``but the
insects got through first and had a pretty good crack at them.''
   The find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the
tomb. <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> said the remainder is in 110 to 120 original wicker
baskets and several pottery jars in the <LOCATION>Cairo Museum</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Dokki
Agricultural Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.

3-A NEWCOMERS REACH SEMIFINALS; 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO REAL, FREMONT TO MEET IN DECLASSIFIED CITY SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two teams that have benefited from a drop in class will meet tonight in the 
semifinals of the <ORGANIZATION>City Section 3-A Division</ORGANIZATION> playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the key in that pronouncement is 3-A. <ORGANIZATION>El Camino Real</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, which 
play at <TIME>7:30 tonight</TIME> at <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, have flourished under the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>'s releaguing 
plan that bumped each school to the 3-A level in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont advanced to the 4-A playoffs last season and even knocked off <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> 
and <ORGANIZATION>Taft</ORGANIZATION> in the first two rounds, but the Pathfinders were overmatched against 
<PERSON>Crenshaw</PERSON> in the 4-A semifinal, losing, 93-72. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> is king of the hill in the 3-A. The top-seeded 
Pathfinders breezed to the <ORGANIZATION>Central League</ORGANIZATION> title with a 12-0 record and will 
take a 24-3 mark into tonight's game. Behind the play of 6-5 senior <PERSON>Tyrone 
Phillips</PERSON>, who has scored 50 points in postseason play, they squashed Eagle Rock 
in the first round, <DATE>96-57</DATE>, and dispatched <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION>, 58-51, <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Four <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> players score in double figures, led by <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> at 18.8. He is 
followed by <PERSON>Chris Ford</PERSON> (16.5), <PERSON>Lionel Pandy</PERSON> (14.4) and <PERSON>Maurice McKenzy</PERSON> (10.5., 
8 assists, 5 steals), all of whom play guard in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s three-guard offense. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>El Camino Real</ORGANIZATION> also has found life in the 3-A less hazardous to its health. The 
Conquistadores opened <ORGANIZATION>Northwest Valley Conference</ORGANIZATION> play with four games against 
<ORGANIZATION>North Valley League</ORGANIZATION> opponents, who compete at the 4-A level. <ORGANIZATION>El Camino Real</ORGANIZATION> 
lost three of the four but then won five of six <ORGANIZATION>West Valley League</ORGANIZATION> games to 
enter the playoffs as the league's first-place representative. Two rounds 
later, they are the only Valley-area boys' team still playing. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the drop in class, the Conquistadores (11-8) have benefited from the 
play of <PERSON>Brent Lofton</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-6 senior forward is averaging 23.1 points a game and 8.3 rebounds. He 
scored 33 in a 72-57 win over <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> and 19 in <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s 67-63 victory over 
<LOCATION>Jefferson</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as critical to <ORGANIZATION>El Camino Real</ORGANIZATION>'s success is senior <PERSON>Jason Steele</PERSON>, who 
averaged fewer than 10 points during the regular season but has blossomed in 
the playoffs. After an 11-point, 10-rebound effort against <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>, he scored a 
team-high 23 points and also blocked eight shots against <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON>. Controlling 
his emotions has given him as much difficulty as opponents this season. He was 
suspended for a game this season for his role in an on-campus fight, and Coach 
<PERSON>Mike McNulty</PERSON> benched him for two minutes after receiving a technical foul 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those teams talk a lot and he has to tune it out," <PERSON>McNulty</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"But even though he lost his temper, that was the best game he's played. He was 
probably worth 15 or 20 points on defense. If he gets in foul trouble we're not 
the same team." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after recording one of the biggest wins in its history, the <LOCATION>Reseda</LOCATION> 
girls' team will make its third Sports Arena appearance in three years in 
today's <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> City 4-A semifinal against <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Regents boosted their record to 16-4 with a 79-72 victory over <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Cougars</ORGANIZATION>' first playoff loss to a Valley team this decade. 
Apparently, the releaguing plan that promoted <LOCATION>Reseda</LOCATION> to the 4-A level has not 
hurt the Regents, <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> 3-A champions the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Regent Coach <PERSON>Andrea Francola</PERSON> is not thrilled about returning to action 
so soon after the <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> game, nothing can diminish the importance of that 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed we have only one day between games, but we're never going 
to forget that game," she said. "It will always be a good memory." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is no stranger to the <ORGANIZATION>Sports Arena</ORGANIZATION>, either. The Generals, 
co-champions of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern League</ORGANIZATION>, own a six-game win streak. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has 
reached the semifinals four of the past five years and twice has been 4-A 
runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is led by a pair of 5-6 junior guards. <PERSON>Detra Lockhart</PERSON> (17.6 ppg) and 
<PERSON>Remitha Houston</PERSON> (20.7) are cousins who run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda will counter with a diversified attack featuring <PERSON>Jennifer Marzahl</PERSON>, 
<PERSON>Cheryl Hightower</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aggie Garcia</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-A semifinal, <LOCATION>Canoga Park</LOCATION> will travel to <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> for a <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> game. 
The Hunters (9-7) won the <LOCATION>West Valley League</LOCATION> championship behind the play of 
<PERSON>Soo Yoon</PERSON> and her twin Joo, who emigrated from <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>. Soo is a 
5-10 forward who averages 19 points and Joo is a 5-7 point guard averaging 7 
assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt (11-3), the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern League</ORGANIZATION> champion, is led by <PERSON>Luscinda Silva</PERSON>, the 
league MVP who averages 29.2 points.

FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Greene King sells Morland stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Greene King</PERSON>, the East Anglian brewer, has sold for Pounds 28.7m its 28.8 per
cent stake in <LOCATION>Morland</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Thames Valley</LOCATION> brewer it failed to acquire in
<DATE>1992</DATE>.
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, bought the 6.23m shares for 460p a share and
placed them with institutions. <PERSON>Greene King</PERSON> had paid an average of 450p a
share for them during the abortive bid, with the bulk coming from the
<ORGANIZATION>Whitbread Investment Company</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Greene King</PERSON> will book an exceptional profit of Pounds 600,000 before
expenses but it had already taken a Pounds 2.7m charge for the bid costs in
its <DATE>1992</DATE> results. It will use the proceeds to cut its debt to Pounds 66m
from Pounds 95m. Gearing will fall by <PERCENT>10 percentage points</PERCENT> to 30 per cent.
<PERSON>Greene King</PERSON> was attracted by <PERSON>Morland</PERSON>'s pub estate in the <LOCATION>Thames Valley</LOCATION>. It
also hoped to close <LOCATION>Morland</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Abingdon</LOCATION> brewery and use the site as a
distribution centre for its own beers such as <LOCATION>Abbott</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>IPA</ORGANIZATION>.

Notes: <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Gary Salazar</PERSON> rates his <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> as the team to 
beat in the <ORGANIZATION>Sea View League</ORGANIZATION>, and the returning talent he has supports his case. 
A third consecutive Southern Section 4-A team title seems an attainable goal. 
Phebus, <PERSON>O'Leary</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pollock</PERSON> and senior <PERSON>Courtney Strauss</PERSON> lead the team. Last 
season's Southern Section 3-A champion, <PERSON>Dana Hills</PERSON>, has moved up to the 4-A 
division and should be a good test for <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> during the playoffs, 
especially if <ORGANIZATION>Mall</ORGANIZATION> is healthy. Mall, arguably one of the top three singles 
players in the county, has been bothered by a rotator cuff strain in her right 
shoulder. Also contending in the 4-A class will be <LOCATION>Capistrano Valley</LOCATION> and its 
ace, <PERSON>Bartelt</PERSON>.

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Ocean View</ORGANIZATION>, La Quinta and Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball teams will find 
themselves in unfamiliar positions when the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section</ORGANIZATION> playoffs continue 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>: Each will be making the school's first appearance in the girls' 
playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (26-2) will play Buena (25-0) in a 5-A game at <ORGANIZATION>Ventura High School</ORGANIZATION>; 
La Quinta (25-3) will meet <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION> (25-2) in a 4-A game at College of the 
<LOCATION>Desert</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Alamitos</ORGANIZATION> (20-3) will play <LOCATION>San Dimas</LOCATION> (16-6) at <ORGANIZATION>Bolsa Grande 
High School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, the fourth-seeded team in the 5-A division, faces a difficult task 
for several reasons. Buena, the top-seeded team in 5-A, has plenty of playoff 
experience. Last year, the Bulldogs lost in the semifinals. They have been 
semifinalists four times before in the 4-A division, finalists five times, 
champions in <DATE>1979</DATE> and '84 and state champions in Division I in '83 and <DATE>'84</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs have advanced to the playoffs in each of Coach <PERSON>Joe Vaughan</PERSON>'s 16 
years. <PERSON>Vaughan</PERSON> has the best record (351-29) in the state among girls' coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Buena has lost only twice at home in the past 10 years, to <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> two 
seasons ago and to state champion Brea-Olinda last season. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for <ORGANIZATION>Ocean View</ORGANIZATION> is that although the game is a home game for 
<ORGANIZATION>Buena</ORGANIZATION>, at least it won't be played in <ORGANIZATION>Buena</ORGANIZATION>'s gym. All semifinal games are at 
alternate sites. The game will be played at <ORGANIZATION>Ventura High School</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has a definite height advantage with 6-2, 185-pound <PERSON>Jennifer 
Sullivan</PERSON> (17.4 ppg, 14.6 rebounds) and 5-11 <PERSON>Tracy Wolfe</PERSON> (13.3 ppg, 9.5 
rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (18-9) vs Loara (16-10) at <ORGANIZATION>Savanna High School</ORGANIZATION> -- Loara has come on 
strong in the playoffs, upsetting Mission Viejo in the quarterfinals and 
second-seeded <PERSON>Woodbridge</PERSON> in the second round. Loara is led by 6-1 junior center 
<PERSON>Tracy Titus</PERSON> (16.6 ppg, 10.9 rebounds). <PERSON>Jennifer Leonard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Liz Redman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kristin 
Thibodeau</PERSON> provided strong support, and senior guard <PERSON>Lisa Nakazono</PERSON> runs the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, like <LOCATION>Loara</LOCATION>, is unseeded. The Cougars upset third-seeded <LOCATION>Westlake</LOCATION> in 
the second round before eliminating <ORGANIZATION>Edison</ORGANIZATION>. They are led by 5-7 junior guard 
<PERSON>Cori Herman</PERSON> (16.45 ppg), an adept three-point shooter, and 5-9 sophomore 
forward <PERSON>Denise Rea</PERSON> (9.5 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A: 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (25-3) vs <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION> (25-2) at College of the <LOCATION>Desert</LOCATION> -- <ORGANIZATION>La Quinta</ORGANIZATION> 
has dominated the not-so-tough <ORGANIZATION>Garden Grove League</ORGANIZATION>, winning nine straight 
titles. But in the past, the Aztecs have faltered when they met tougher 
competition in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not so this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are led by <PERSON>Amy Jalewalia</PERSON> (33.4 ppg, 11.8 rebounds), a 6-1 
guard-forward-center who last year led the state in scoring. <PERSON>Heather Brannan</PERSON>, a 
5-11 senior forward, averages 15.0 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded <LOCATION>Palm Desert</LOCATION> starts a good-sized lineup including leading scorers 
<ORGANIZATION>Tisa</ORGANIZATION> Read (5-10) and <PERSON>Brenda Joyce</PERSON> (5-10) each of whom average about 12 points. 
Senior guard <PERSON>Christie Dammer</PERSON>, whom coach <PERSON>Randy Housken</PERSON> calls the best defensive 
guard in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, will attempt to stop Jalewalia. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (28-0) vs Alemany (20-6) at Esperanza High School -- Top-seeded 
Brea-Olinda has trounced two playoff opponents. The Lady Cats, the defending 
division champions, are led by state player of the year <PERSON>Aimee McDaniel</PERSON> and 
all-state guard <PERSON>Tammy Blackburn</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany, the fourth-seeded team in the division, is led in scoring by 5-2 
sophomore <PERSON>Rachel Corelli</PERSON> (10 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (26-4) vs. Estancia (14-12) at <ORGANIZATION>University High School -- Unseeded 
Estancia</ORGANIZATION> has come on strong in the playoffs, upsetting third-seeded <LOCATION>Lompoc</LOCATION> in 
the quarterfinals, thanks to a school-record 42-point performance by junior 
guard <ORGANIZATION>Melody Earle</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Patrice Lumpkin</PERSON>, a 5-10 forward, averages 12.6 points a game. Forward <PERSON>Monique 
Sweet</PERSON> also provides some solid play. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Palos Verdes</PERSON> has won the <ORGANIZATION>Bay League</ORGANIZATION> title and reached the playoffs the past 
three seasons, advancing to the 4-A semifinals last year. The <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> have a 
definite height advantage with three starters at least 6 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lisa Humphreys</PERSON>, a 5-10 senior forward leads the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> in scoring with 15.2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A: 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Dimas</LOCATION> (16-6) vs Rancho Alamitos (20-3) at <ORGANIZATION>Bolsa Grande High School</ORGANIZATION> -- 
<PERSON>Rancho Alamitos</PERSON>, the top-seeded team in the division, is led by <PERSON>Jenny Newsome</PERSON>, 
a 5-9 senior who averages 24 points and 12 rebounds a game. <LOCATION>San Dimas</LOCATION> relies 
heavily on inside scoring, which should contrast strongly with the Vaqueros 
up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Natalie Kramer</PERSON>, a 5-11 senior center, and <PERSON>Shelly Baughn</PERSON> a 5-11 junior post 
player each average 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
South Hills (19-5) vs. <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> (15-11) at Estancia High School -- <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION> 
is undoubtedly the <LOCATION>Cinderella</LOCATION> team of the division. The unseeded Mustangs were 
third in the <LOCATION>Pacific Coast League</LOCATION>, but they are in the semifinals after 
upsetting third-seeded <LOCATION>Bellflower</LOCATION> convincingly and defeating <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame of 
Sherman Oaks</ORGANIZATION> in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are led by <ORGANIZATION>Orange County</ORGANIZATION>'s best freshman -- <LOCATION>Olivia DiCamilli</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli (5-10) averages 14.8 points and 11.8 rebounds but she's scoring more 
points in the playoffs. Junior forward <PERSON>Rachel Ward</PERSON> averages 10.8 points and 
senior guard <PERSON>Thuy Nguyen</PERSON>, a three-point threat, averages 11.1 points. Senior 
<PERSON>Michele Bryant</PERSON> runs the point and junior <PERSON>Robin Nichols</PERSON> is the fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded <LOCATION>South Hills</LOCATION> defeated at-large <ORGANIZATION>Yucca Valley</ORGANIZATION> by 14 points in the 
second round, then edged Cabrillo, another at-large team, by six points in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-AA: 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Ynez Valley</ORGANIZATION> (20-3) vs <LOCATION>Santa Margarita</LOCATION> (20-6) at <ORGANIZATION>Saddleback College</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>7 
p.m.</TIME> -- <LOCATION>Santa Margarita</LOCATION>, the fourth-seeded team in the division, meets its 
stiffest competition in top-seeded <LOCATION>Santa Ynez Valley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are led by sophomore <PERSON>Kristen Mulligan</PERSON>, the only <LOCATION>Santa Margarita</LOCATION> 
player who averages in double figures (22.1 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Santa Ynez Valley</LOCATION> has plenty of height. <PERSON>Amy Kisling</PERSON> (5-11) leads <LOCATION>Santa Ynez 
Valley</LOCATION> with 14.2 points a game, followed by 5-11 <PERSON>Amy Gillingham</PERSON> (11.2 ppg) and

<LEADPARA>  Wilma Dyche, a longtime resident of both the Pajaro and Santa Clara valleys
who had been in failing health for several years, died Monday in Watsonville
at the age of 93. She was a musician and a church organist, but she played no
religious favorites.;    Mrs. Dyche was born a Methodist, so it was natural
that she started playing the organ at the First United Methodist Church of
Watsonville. It was a reed instrument; pumping its pedals fills the bellows
and makes the sound.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WILMA DYCHE, ORGANIST AT WATSONVILLE CHURCHES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     When the <ORGANIZATION>First Christian Church of Watsonville</ORGANIZATION> was rebuilt after several
fires, it had a new organ -- a pipe organ -- no pedals, no pumping, and those
pipes filled the sanctuary with chords.;    "It was like dangling a carrot,"
said <PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON>Ayleen Martin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION>. First Christian
wanted <PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON>, and she wanted that pipe organ, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. She played it
virtually every <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for more than 30 years.;    "The pipe organ is the king
of instruments," said <PERSON>Inez Jefferson</PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON>'s. She knows that
because she also played church organs in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> and also taught piano.;   
<PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON> closed out her career as a <LOCATION>Watsonville</LOCATION> church organist with a
several-year stint at <ORGANIZATION>All Saints' Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was a
member.;    <PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON> had graduated with a degree in music from College of
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> when it was still in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>, then married <PERSON>Justin K. Dyche</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Watsonville High School</ORGANIZATION> teacher who died in 1953.;    <PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON> was a
teacher, too. She taught scores of <LOCATION>Pajaro Valley</LOCATION> youngsters how to play the
piano, then continued doing the same for many years after moving to the <LOCATION>Santa
Clara Valley</LOCATION> in the late 1960s.;    <PERSON>Mrs. Dyche</PERSON> belonged to the <ORGANIZATION>Music Teachers
Association of Santa Clara County</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>American Guild of Organists</ORGANIZATION>. For
more than 50 years she was a member of the PEO Sisterhood, a philanthropic and
educational organization seeking opportunities in higher education for women.;

<TEXT>
   British brewers and archaelogists wanting to know
how ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a
brewery, read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the
liquid in ancient pottery.
   News of the three-year project, launched by a leading British
brewery and the nation's prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Egypt Exploration Society</ORGANIZATION>,
drew headlines in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> newspapers on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``Brewers seek the Pharaohs' secret,'' said one. ``Explorers
seek the recipe for <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamen</ORGANIZATION>'s beer,'' boasted another.
   The Independent called it one of the first large-scale research
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a
commercial British company.
   When the researchers have figured out what went into brewing
beer in ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, the brewery will try to reproduce it at its
laboratory in the Scottish capital of <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Jim Merrington</PERSON>, corporate affairs director for Scottish and
<ORGANIZATION>Newcastle Breweries PLC</ORGANIZATION>, said he wasn't sure if the fine ale of the
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in British pubs.
   ``It is highly improbable it will appear on the bar, but it is
not beyond the realms of possibility,'' he told a news conference
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>.
   He said the project will be based largely on archaeological
excavations at Tell-el <LOCATION>Amarna</LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s ancient capitals
located 190 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   Archaeologists from the society, led by field director <PERSON>Barry
Kemp</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University</ORGANIZATION>, are investigating a royal brewery
there attached to a temple built by <PERSON>Queen Nefertiti</PERSON>.
   She was the leading wife of <PERSON>King Tutankhamen</PERSON>'s father, the
<ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Akhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, whose name also was spelled Akhenaten or Ikhnaton.
   Tutankhamen reigned from <DATE>1333</DATE> to <DATE>1323</DATE> B.C. His tomb was
discovered in the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> in <DATE>1922</DATE>. His solid
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the
imagination of the world.
   <PERSON>Merrington</PERSON> said <PERSON>Nefertiti</PERSON>'s temple, each side of which measures
750 feet, had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread
for religious festivals. Both processes employ yeast.
   But no one knows what the beer tasted like.
   Ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several
different beers, ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a
finer texture.
   Wall paintings from <LOCATION>Tutankhamen</LOCATION>'s day depict courtiers vomiting
after getting drunk on beer. Another wall painting shows <PERSON>Nefertiti</PERSON>
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel.
   <PERSON>Merrington</PERSON> said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of
the beer. If they're successful, he said, scientists working for
Scottish and <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> would use a chemical process to test those
samples to try to determine the ancient brew's taste and
consistency.
   ``Apart from what the archaeologists give us, we hope to examine
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Merrington</PERSON> said. ``We will use <DATE>20th century</DATE>
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe.
Then we will try to brew it.''
   Researchers on the project also will examine ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics, tomb models and written material for clues to making
the beer.
   ``The pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer, with
bakeries and breweries operating together,'' <PERSON>Kemp</PERSON> said. ``The
ancient Egyptians baked a kind of bread first, then used it as a
mash from which to brew the beer.''
