<P>
When we think of cactus, we usually visualize ungainly, prickly plants that 
somehow survive in stark surroundings such as the <LOCATION>Mojave Desert</LOCATION>. Actually, 
cacti and other succulents grow just about everywhere -- from desert to 
tropics, sea level to mountain peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the micro climate peculiar to <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> and surrounding areas, more 
growers of cacti and other succulents can be found here in just a few square 
miles than anywhere else in the world. The region provides the perfect 
climactic compromise: warm but not too warm, cool but not too cold. 
</P>
<P>
Although each grower has carved out his or her own niche, all share a love for 
the plants they raise. They also say that interest in their product has 
increased lately, probably for two reasons: the need to conserve water and the 
trend toward the Southwestern look in architecture and design. 
</P>
<P>
Cacti are just one of many plant families categorized as succulents because of 
their ability to store water. In other words, all cacti are succulents, but not 
all succulents are cacti. 
</P>
<P>
Cactus plants store water in their stems and tend to have a spiny or hairy 
covering rather than leaves, while other succulents retain moisture in either 
roots, leaves or stems. 
</P>
<P>
"Succulents were designed to survive in dry climates, and they came up with all 
manner of techniques to protect themselves from the harsh environment -- from 
dryness, sunlight and animals," said <PERSON>Sandy Williams</PERSON>, who owns and operates 
<ORGANIZATION>Homegrown Cacti and Succulents</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> with her husband, <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>. "For instance, 
spines and fur provide protection from sun, ribs a surface to gather water and 
to shade the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Many cacti also manufacture protective substances in their spines. You know 
when you've run into one of them because it hurts for days. 
</P>
<P>
The Williamses grow a wide variety of cacti and other succulents and sell their 
plants in 4- and 6-inch pots to wholesalers, who in turn sell to retail 
outlets, including nurseries, smaller non-chain stores and tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Like most local growers, <PERSON>Sandy Williams</PERSON> sees an increased interest in 
succulents, and in using the plants in unique ways -- in wreaths, for example, 
as a substitute for holly. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Silhouettes of the Desert in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> also market succulents, 
ranging from the tiny to the huge. They sell to garden centers, nurseries, 
chain markets and landscapers all over the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 
and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a steady increase in business the last two or three years," said 
manager <PERSON>Thais Aguirre</PERSON>. "People have discovered that cactus gardens don't have 
to consist of rocks and cow skulls. As fast as we get the plants in from the 
field, we're loading them up." 
</P>
<P>
Business has been so good at <ORGANIZATION>Hilltop Cacti</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> that owner <PERSON>Theresa Roberts</PERSON> 
has added four greenhouses and increased her growing space by 10,000 square 
feet. Hilltop sells about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of its product to brokers, who resell to their 
own clients in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The cacti and succulent business is very healthy right now," said <PERSON>John Cooper</PERSON> 
who, with wife <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, owns <ORGANIZATION>Cooper's Cactus &amp; Succulents</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION>. "We've 
received numerous calls recently from local landscapers looking for 
drought-resistant plants." 
</P>
<P>
By mixing cacti and other succulents, <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION>Southern Californians</ORGANIZATION> can 
create a pleasing landscape at a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
Another mass wholesaler in <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION>Western Cactus Growers</ORGANIZATION>, with acreage 
in both <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>. Hans and <PERSON>Margaret Britsch</PERSON> have been in the 
business since <DATE>1966</DATE> and grow their product in greenhouses and fields. 
</P>
<P>
"The soil is better in <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> for field growing," said <PERSON>Hans</PERSON>. "In Vista we 
have adobe soil and must add a lot of sand and other amendments." 
</P>
<P>
In general, cacti get their start from seeds while other succulents grow from 
cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most local growers, <PERSON>Carl Volkers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jim Kampwirth</PERSON> of C and J Cactus 
Nursery in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> eschew what they call the "chop-chop school." They planted 
their first seeds on New Year's <DATE>Day, 1977</DATE>, and they still grow by seed 
exclusively, hand pollinating with the help of small paintbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the best of both worlds," said <PERSON>Volkers</PERSON>. "We sell to collectors, 
especially European collectors. Cactus is big in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, and 
they've discovered it in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David Grigsby</PERSON> bought the first plant grown at <ORGANIZATION>C &amp; J</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Grigsby Cactus 
Gardens</ORGANIZATION> sells plants retail as well as wholesale. Grigsby's clients range from 
local gardeners who drop by to pick up a plant or two, vacationers wanting a 
gift for their African tour guide, as well as botanical gardens around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Other growers who have a retail market include <PERSON>Ferguson</PERSON>'s Cacti and Succulents 
in <LOCATION>Solana Beach</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cactus King Nursery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rainbow Gardens</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growing nature of the plants produced by most <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> growers 
sets them apart from growers specializing in foliage plants. On the plus side, 
cacti tend to take up less space per plant, said <PERSON>Steve Harbour</PERSON>, sales 
coordinator for <ORGANIZATION>Altman Specialty Plants</ORGANIZATION> and Indian Rock Greenhouses, which 
grows approximately 1,500 varieties of cacti and other succulents. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes an impatiens plug approximately 10 to 12 weeks to reach one-gallon 
size," <PERSON>Harbour</PERSON> said. "On the other hand, a cactus seedling takes about two 
years to get to the smallest saleable size. Some species only grow one inch a 
year, so a five-foot plant may be as old as 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Steven Anthony</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Romero</PERSON> of Excelsior Cactus and Succulent Gardens in 
<LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> have started producing a different type of cacti and succulent, one that 
grows more quickly but, like its slower-growing cousins, accommodates the need 
to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they have discovered a fast-maturing plant that looks similar to 
the rosette-shaped Echeveria, a slow grower. 
</P>
<P>
"It's finally the turn of the humble cactus," <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON> said. "Cacti and 
succulent gardens do not have to be desolate; there's such a wide range of 
color and texture. Besides, these are the hardiest plants in the world, because 
they evolved through hard times." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jay Jackson</PERSON> of Desert Theatre 2 in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION> also extols the virtue of the humble 
cactus and its companion succulents. He recommends succulents such as Euphorbia 
trigona as houseplants since they can thrive despite central heating, low light 
and infrequent watering. 
</P>
<P>
He ships his greenhouse- and field-grown plants all over the country and to 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Lately, landscapers in areas of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> experiencing strict water 
rationing, have shown a new-found interest in the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the increasing interest in succulents is that far more 
varieties are available now, said <PERSON>Louis Servatka</PERSON>, who, along with <PERSON>Norine 
Morehouse</PERSON>, owns <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Vista Cacti</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Growers, except those who sell to collectors, typically grew 10 varieties of 
Euphorbia," <PERSON>Servatka</PERSON> said. "There are over 3,000 varieties of Euphorbia out 
there, and now growers are more likely to carry 50 different types." 
</P>
<P>
Other local growers continue to concentrate on the traditional. Silverthorne 
Ranch in <LOCATION>Fallbrook</LOCATION> -- run by brothers <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Loomis</PERSON>, who took over the 
business started by their parents in <DATE>1948</DATE> -- sells all its products in pots and 
turns out 200,000 dish gardens a year. 
</P>
<P>
And the increased demand does not change the basic nature of the business, 
which <PERSON>Barbara Zink</PERSON> calls labor- and capital-intensive. She and husband <PERSON>Duane</PERSON> 
specialize in hanging plants at their <PERSON>Zink</PERSON>'s Greenhouses in <LOCATION>Vista</LOCATION>, which she 
calls the cactus capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"People buy one cactus plant and get hooked," said <ORGANIZATION>Excelsior</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Steven Anthony</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>

LOVERS OF CACTI, SUCCULENTS POINT TO BEAUTY, LOW WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a neighborhood of manicured lawns and well-groomed flower beds, it's easy to 
spot Bart and <PERSON>Rosalie Palisi</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Anaheim Hills</LOCATION> home. Their yard features several 
varieties of the cacti and succulents they have nurtured from seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always loved cactus and succulents," <PERSON>Rosalie</PERSON> explained. "When we moved 
to <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, it made sense to try to plant something in keeping with 
the desert environment. We wanted a yard that was low maintenance, yet 
attractive. At the time we planted cacti, we weren't necessarily thinking about 
the drought; we simply wanted something to go along with our busy lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
Planting drought-resistant plants such as farrow cactus, barrel cactus and 
yucca makes sense in an era of water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, most cacti and succulents need only a light watering about every 
two days during the <DATE>summer</DATE> and no watering at all in the <DATE>winter</DATE>," said <PERSON>Lloyd 
Garretson</PERSON>, president of the 90-member <ORGANIZATION>Orange County Cactus</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Succulent 
Society</ORGANIZATION>. "This is a step in the right direction when it comes to cutting back 
on water consumption." 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners may not be ready to give up their colorful flower beds in favor 
of a more prickly display. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, according to <PERSON>Garretson</PERSON>. "There are many flowering varieties of 
cactus and they bloom at different times of the year. You can have blossoms 
year-round if you want," he said. "Some varieties even bloom at <TIME>night</TIME> and close 
their buds when the sun comes up." 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,000 species in the succulent family -- cacti is the 
largest group. Other succulents include milkweed, lilies, aloe and ocotillo. 
These plants are called succulents because they store water in their leaves, 
stems and roots. Succulents are generally the smoother-skinned versions of 
their prickly cacti cousins. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are surprised to learn that hibiscus and oleanders are also 
members of the succulent family," <PERSON>Palisi</PERSON> said. "A lot of people who aren't too 
crazy about cactus because of the thorns become enamored of succulents. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we just finished planting a succulent garden for my mother, who 
doesn't care for cactus . . . but she loves succulents." 
</P>
<P>
Like most cactus lovers, the <PERSON>Garretsons</PERSON>' interest in the plants started as a 
hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a gardener," <PERSON>Garretson</PERSON> admitted. "But most of my experience 
was with fruit trees and raising vegetables. Quite frankly, I thought a lot of 
cacti were ugly. Then my wife, <PERSON>Toni</PERSON>, started getting interested in cactus 
plants and succulents and that got me going." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the yard of the Garretsons' Garden Grove home stands as testimony to 
their interest. Cacti grow in their front and back yards, and two separate 
greenhouses shelter their ever-growing collection of these hearty plants. 
</P>
<P>
"What many people don't realize is that not all cactus and succulents look 
alike," <PERSON>Garretson</PERSON> said. "There are many varieties that don't even remotely 
resemble the commonly known images. The ponytail palm and the bursera look like 
trees, while the beaver tail cactus produces a large pink flower." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rosalie Palisi</PERSON> has "what is called a pencil cactus in our yard that has very 
thin branches. It's an attractive plant and what has been an extra bonus is 
that it attracts hummingbirds who stop and rest on it." 
</P>
<P>
The jade succulent resembles its Oriental cousin. Aloe comes in many varieties. 
Still other types of succulents resemble ferns. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get involved with these plants, it's hard to stop," <PERSON>Garretson</PERSON> said. 
His wife's initial purchase of a small gray succulent -- commonly known as baby 
toe or living stone because of its smooth, round appearance -- started the 
<PERSON>Garretsons</PERSON>' fascination with this species. 
</P>
<P>
The ease of caring for cacti is probably one of its primary attributes. Once it 
has been planted, there is little maintenance involved. However, make sure to 
leave enough space between the plants since they can grow quite large. 
Succulents should also be planted in loose, rocky soil with good drainage. In 
keeping with the desert or Southwestern look, many cacti gardeners cover the 
ground with pebbles or white stones. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than light watering . . . the only real maintenance is pulling weeds," 
<PERSON>Garretson</PERSON> said. "By scattering rocks or stones, you can better control the 
weeds. 
</P>
<P>
"And they had better be pretty hearty weeds," he said with a laugh. "Because 
they aren't going to get much water." 
</P>
<P>
Most varieties of succulents grow well together, and <PERSON>Garretson</PERSON> said it's not 
necessary to plant only cacti. In his own garden, he has flowers and other 
varieties of plants mixed in with the succulents. However, he does warn that 
cacti have a dominant tendency. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to keep your cactus plant small, keep it in a pot," he 
recommended. "Also, don't be too hasty in tossing out a cactus that looks like 
it's seen better days. Often cactus, especially during the winter months, may 
appear dead, when in fact it's just lying dormant for a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of folks throw away perfectly good plants because they mistakenly 
believe it's dead," he said. "Before throwing it out, check very closely for 
any signs of new growth. Sometimes the only clue you may have is a very tiny 
leaf or clump, but if you look carefully, you can see it. Before you throw it 
out, just keep a watch for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Starting new plants is often as simple as breaking off a piece or cluster, and 
planting it in a small pot until it forms new roots. When transplanting from a 
pot to the ground, be careful not to over-water. Unlike most other plants that 
require more watering when first planted, if a cactus receives too much water, 
it can collapse and rot. 
</P>
<P>
Cacti also tend to do well in pots, especially if they're outdoors in the 
sunlight. Plants in containers should have a fast-draining mix with a large 
drain hole in the bottom. Also be aware that plants in containers may require a 
little more water than those planted directly in the ground, but the amount of 
water needed is still less than that of most other plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine planting anything other than succulents," <PERSON>Palisi</PERSON> said. 
"Besides, it's easy for friends to find my house. I just tell them it's the one 
with the innovative garden. 
</P>
<P>
"Since people are becoming aware of water conservation, more of my neighbors 
have been asking me about succulents. When I tell them what my water bill is, 
they can't believe it's so low compared to what they pay. I think we're going 
to be seeing quite a few more places planting cacti now."

CACTI SOLVE PRICKLY WATER PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cactus has been stuck with a bad reputation ever since settlers first set 
foot onto Western soil -- and into the pointy needles of the spiny plant. But 
early ranchers wasted no time in finding practical uses for them: the "prickly 
pear" cactus was commonly used to fence in animals (or to keep trespassers 
out); some types are edible, and in times of desperation, a cactus can even be 
a source of water. 
</P>
<P>
As <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> faces yet another water crisis, gardeners looking for 
ways to conserve water may not have to look any further than their own back 
yards. Cacti and succulents can add symmetry, texture and color to a landscape 
-- and all the while conserve water during the dry <DATE>summer</DATE> months because of 
their ability to store water. 
</P>
<P>
But drought tolerance is just one appealing quality, says <PERSON>Larry Grammer</PERSON>, who 
grows more than 800 cacti and succulents in his greenhouse and outside of his 
<LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baja the Turning Point 
</P>
<P>
A trip to <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> in the '70s influenced Grammer's choice of plants. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Texaco</ORGANIZATION> oil refinery worker was a house-plant and yard man up to that point, 
but his introduction to the cactus in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> had a lasting impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I was camped in the middle of them and looking at their spines, formations and 
the geometric-type patterns -- the way they clumped and criss-crossed," he 
recalls. "That one trip changed my mind, and they weren't even in flower." 
</P>
<P>
But it's typically a cactus in bloom that makes a cactus convert, says <PERSON>John 
Trager</PERSON>, curator of the desert collection at <ORGANIZATION>Huntington Botanic Gardens</ORGANIZATION> (one of 
the largest and most diverse collections in the world, with more than 5,000 
species). "What usually appeals to people is the brightly colored flowers 
coming out of these unusual plant forms -- they're beautiful," <PERSON>Trager</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
Cacti can be grown indoors and out; they range in size from tiny button-size 
(from <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>) to hulking 300-pounders (the <LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION> has samples of these). 
</P>
<P>
Get a good look at more than 1,000 cacti and succulents at the fourth 
<ORGANIZATION>Inner-City Cactus &amp; Succulent Show</ORGANIZATION> and Sale going on at the <LOCATION>L.A. Arboretum</LOCATION> 
<DATE>today</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. "The public will see things at the show that are 
magnificently grown," <PERSON>Trager</PERSON> says. "They'll see the results of good care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pooling Resources 
</P>
<P>
Grammer is show chairman for the <ORGANIZATION>Long Beach Cactus &amp; Succulent Club</ORGANIZATION>, one of 
three clubs pooling resources to put on the show. Though he grows his plants 
partially for the enjoyment and relaxation, a competitive streak surfaces at 
show time, as he enters his own prize plants in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the show," <PERSON>Grammer</PERSON> says. "The show is there to educate the 
public, but it's also nice to show off your hobby." 
</P>
<P>
Trager says two of the most common mistakes gardeners make is overwatering a 
cactus and assuming it will take care of itself. "The No. 1 problem is a lack 
of fertilizer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer uses a porous mixture of pumice, a "little bit" of sand and potting mix 
to grow show-quality cactus. "I water once a week in <DATE>summer</DATE> (the growing 
period) and I stop watering in <DATE>November</DATE> and let them rest till <DATE>March 1</DATE>," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
This might surprise some gardeners, but the cactus' ability to survive without 
water is one of the qualities that makes it so practical for the <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> climate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overwatering Can Kill 
</P>
<P>
"Watering too much at the wrong time of the year can really hurt," <PERSON>Grammer</PERSON> 
says. "They withstand the cold better when dry." If the roots are wet and the 
weather turns cold, it "will kill them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the plants to look for at the show include agaves and aloes, both 
succulents, the golden barrel cactus and cereus cactus. 
</P>
<P>
"These grow very well in almost any garden situation," <PERSON>Trager</PERSON> says, "as long as 
they're not overwatered. They certainly provide unusual and different design 
potential . . . mixing in well with other garden plants."

<LEADPARA>  Q I have been putting off re-potting my cactuses because the last time I tried
to work with them I got thorns in my hands despite wearing heavy gloves. What
do you suggest?;   A You may find it works better if you fold a couple sheets
of newspaper into a long strip an inch or two wide, then use this as a grip to
hold the cactus while working with it. Lightweight kitchen or other tongs
might also be used.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In case you get a real cactus spine in your finger, it can be removed the
same as a splinter, using a needle that has been dipped in denatured alcohol
or sterilized in a flame. The tiny, almost invisible glochids that occur on
many of the optunia or prickly-pear cactuses are better lifted from the skin
by using a piece of transparent adhesive tape.;   Q I have a hanging basket of
wandering Jew, a beautiful variety with leaves that are reddish purple on the
backsides and striped green, silver and purple on the front. But what causes
the stem bases, near the soil, to shrivel up and die even though the tips are
still leafy? I got the impression the whole plant was a little droopy, so I
have been extra careful to water more.;   A I think you have a plant known
botanically as Zebrina pendula quadricolor. The condition you describe
indicates that at some time the plant has been left standing in water until
the roots rotted, or possibly it was allowed to become so dry the stem bases
shriveled up and died.;   Another possibility is that the stems were
disturbed, perhaps in moving the plant a little too roughly so that mechanical
damage occurred. In any event, what you need to do is make tip cuttings of the
healthy parts and discard the rest, or rather add it to your compost.;   Take
a piece of the wandering Jew about 5 inches long. Strip off the leaves from an
inch or two at the base, then set to root in a pot of moist, fresh soil with
added peat moss and sand. Keep shaded but in bright light.;   Maintain evenly
moist growing conditions and roots will soon take hold. At this point you can
move the young plant to stronger light. The old hanging-basket container can
be cleaned and rehabilitated as the place to set up to a half-dozen of the
rooted cuttings. Soon you have a thriving young zebrina that won't peak for at
least one growing season.;   Q All my cyclamen plants have stopped blooming.
Do they need to be dried off and rested for a season or should I compost
them?;   A <DATE>Summer</DATE> is the season for keeping cyclamen dry and resting. A simple
method is to place the pots on their sides outdoors under some shrubs or other
planting that will afford shade but permit air and possibly a little moisture
to reach the semi-dormant tubers.;   At the end of <DATE>summer</DATE>, the cyclamen pots
can be upturned, the contents turned out, the tubers gently cleaned and then
reset in fresh soil. They will start to flower by Christmas.;   What is most
vital about the cyclamen cycle, or so it appears to me, is that one season out
of four be spent dry to discourage leaf growth, in moderate temperatures,
preferably in relative darkness but with fresh air circulation. Cyclamen that
have flowered seem to go into decline if an attempt is made to keep them
growing non-stop thereafter.  </TEXT>

Back in the '70s, <PERSON>Richard Hipp</PERSON> recalls, there were a dozen or more <ORGANIZATION>Orange 
County</ORGANIZATION> nurseries specializing in cacti and succulents. But spiraling land costs 
forced others to pack up and move out, making <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON> shop the last of a 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>House of Cactus</ORGANIZATION> has occupied its spot on <LOCATION>Beach Boulevard</LOCATION> since <DATE>1959</DATE> (for 18 
years it was called <ORGANIZATION>Black's House of Cactus</ORGANIZATION> before the original owner sold to 
<PERSON>Hipp</PERSON>). Outside, a desert mural graces the stucco walls; inside, more than 1,500 
varieties of cacti and succulents are offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In his 12 years running the shop, <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> has seen some changes in the cactus biz. 
Collecting cacti in the wild is now heavily regulated and in some cases 
forbidden by the federal government; meanwhile, importing cacti and succulents 
for retail sale has also been outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
That means most new specimens must be propagated from seeds or from cuttings. 
Because most cacti grow slowly, it usually takes at least two years before they 
are salable, and even then they are tiny. The popular saguaro, for instance, 
grows about one inch a year. Thus, <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> said, "large plants are in very short 
supply" -- especially with the recent interest in <LOCATION>Southwestern</LOCATION> home decor. 
</P>
<P>
Hipp buys many of his plants from wholesale suppliers, but propagates many of 
the rarer and more unusual specimens himself. He works the shop alone, usually 
with an emerald green conure parrot named <PERSON>Mikey</PERSON> perched on his shoulder. His 
wife, a hospital dietitian during the week, helps out on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the store's stock is inexpensive, <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> also offers a number of 
rare specimens with price tags running into the hundreds of dollars. Collectors 
will pay the premium prices, <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> said. "It can become quite an obsession." He 
held up one small plant, a brand-new variety with only a few specimens known, 
priced at <MONEY>$175</MONEY>. "If you want to be first," he said, "it is expensive."

<LEADPARA>  Q Would a volunteer tomato plant that came up next to an oleander have fruit
that would be safe to eat? I have heard that oleander is a poisonous plant. I
don't want to continue watering the tomato if I can't grow it safely.;    --
A.M., Sunnyvale  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TOMATOES GROWN NEXT TO OLEANDER OK TO EAT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mailbag  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A The leaves, stems and roots of oleander are poisonous if eaten in quantity
or the smoke from burning parts is inhaled, but there is no way that any
poison could migrate to an adjacent plant. So eat your tomatoes and enjoy
them. The only cost to you is the water used to raise them. It is said that
those that are "free" taste the best. You'll be the judge here.; Q I have a
Chinese tallow tree that I grew from a seed. It is about 8 years old and about
5 feet tall. It hasn't bloomed yet. What can I do to make it bloom?;    --
<LOCATION>C.C.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>; Q Mailbag suspects that the tree is not mature enough to
produce flowers and that the surrounding soil is not acidic enough to promote
growth. The tree should eventually get to be 35 feet tall. To give the tree
some help, you need to acidify the soil. If the tree is in the ground, add 1/2
cup of aluminum sulfate around under the canopy and water in well. If it is in
a container, add a couple tablespoons of aluminum sulfate and water it in.
Also, if in a container, add a teaspoon of vinegar to a gallon of the
irrigation water you use. This is a mild acid and will help keep the soil
acidic. Feed the tree this month with a high nitrogen fertilizer (Ra-pid-Grow
is a good water-soluble one) and then again when the leaves come out in the
<DATE>spring</DATE> and in late June.;    Q I'm trying to find the real name for a flower
that grew in my grandmother's yard in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. We planted tiny brown seeds
gathered from the previous fall's crop. We called them "touch-me-nots" because
when the ripened seed pods were squeezed the seeds sprayed in all directions.
The plants grew about a foot high and had many pastel-colored flowers that
were shaped almost like a snapdragon blossom. Do you know what they are?;   
-- <LOCATION>J.T.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>; A The plant you are looking for is called balsam, and seeds
are found on the racks in the <DATE>spring</DATE>. You gave an excellent description of
them. It is a <DATE>summer</DATE> annual but gets a little higher than what you remember,
to 30 inches, probably as a result of hybridizing. Some nurseries carry them
as transplants in the <DATE>spring</DATE>. Now there are various forms including dwarfed
and a double-flowered variety that has camellia-like blooms. They are a
species of impatiens (Impatiens balsamina), but do not confuse them with the
<LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> or the Walleriana types so frequently planted in our area.;    Q
Enclosed is a leaf from a ti plant. It appears to be dying. Because there are
webs, I assume it is infested with spider mites. I have sprayed malathion and
it does not work. I don't want to lose the plant as it was babied by my late
husband.;    -- <LOCATION>D.K.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>; A Spider mites are hard to control. Try using
<ORGANIZATION>Ortho</ORGANIZATION> Spider Mite Killer (in a pressurized spray can), Lilly-Miller Systemic
Plant and Pot Insecticide (add to soil, water in) or Safer insecticidal soap.
Spraying with <ORGANIZATION>Ortho</ORGANIZATION> or soap will give immediate control; adding systemics to
the soil gives long-range control. Be aware that plants need to be sprayed
weekly for several weeks to kill the mites when they hatch. Systemics do not
kill the eggs, but insecticidal soap will if the soap makes contact with the
eggs.;    Salts in the soil will cause grief too. Flush out the plant three
times with water. If too large to take outdoors or put in the sink, use a
turkey baster to take away excess water in the saucer. After the third
flushing, water the plant with a mixture of 1/2 teaspoon vinegar to a quart of
water. Vinegar is a mild acid that counteracts the alkali and will keep your
ti plant healthier. Use Ra-pid-Grow to feed the plant, using it every other
week as you water the plant.;    Q Please tell me where I can find Epiphyllum
or Christmas cactus. Also when and how I can grow it successfully.;    --
<LOCATION>C.N.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>; A You have mixed apples and oranges in species of cactus.
Epiphyllums are known as "orchid cactus" and bloom from <DATE>March to July</DATE>.
Christmas cactus are Schlumbergera bridgesii and can be forced to bloom at the
holiday season. Mailbag will assume you want the Christmas cactus.;    Your
best bet for finding the Christmas cactus would be to wait until the holiday
season to purchase one. Most of the nurseries lost their supply during the big
freeze last winter.;    You should feed the Christmas cactus regularly because
it comes from a jungle environment rich in nutrients. Regular watering and
liquid fertilizer seems to be the trick to successful growing. Feed weekly or
every 10 days or so with liquid fertilizer and keep the soil moist but not
soggy wet.;    To get buds to set for Christmas bloom, keep them in a place
where night temperatures are around 55 degrees and give them 12 to 14 hours of
darkness per day during the month of <DATE>November</DATE>. You'll be rewarded with an
abundance of cheery blooms for the holiday season.  </TEXT>

BIG, COLORFUL ZINNIAS GREET THE SUMMER SUN; 
</P>
<P>
EASY BLOOMERS: SIMPLE TO GROW FROM SEEDS, THESE ANNUALS BURST FORTH IN ALL 
THEIR GLORY IN THE HEAT OF JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Mary Ellen Guffey grows annuals in her Malibu flower 
garden. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not many flowers are grown from seed these days, but zinnias are worth the 
effort. These easy <DATE>summer</DATE> annuals reward the grower with bright flowers up to 
six inches across that look right at home in city or country gardens as well as 
in charming bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I got a late start on my summer flower garden, not planting my zinnia 
seeds until <DATE>July</DATE>. The recommended time is <DATE>May</DATE> or <DATE>June</DATE> so that plants can become 
established before the intense <DATE>summer</DATE> heat. 
</P>
<P>
Because I hadn't placed a catalogue order, I went to my neighborhood nursery 
and bought several packages of zinnia seeds. But I also purchased some zinnia 
seedlings, thinking they would give me an earlier crop. 
</P>
<P>
I was surprised to learn that the nursery seedlings, even with their head 
start, bloomed only 10 days ahead of my seed-grown plants. The flowers of each 
group were lovely, but the seed-grown plants cost a fraction of what I spent on 
the nursery plants, and the seeds provided hundreds of plants -- many more than 
I could use. 
</P>
<P>
Zinnias come in a wide variety of forms and sizes. My favorites are the large 
cactus-flowered blooms that look like mop-headed daisies. I'm also fond of the 
smaller lilliput (pompon) variety whose thickly layered petals resemble 
parakeet feathers. 
</P>
<P>
The more formal dahlia-flowered zinnias display large blooms with flat petals, 
while the <LOCATION>Haageana</LOCATION> or Mexicana type has 1 1/2-inch flowers with pointed petals 
bordered with a contrasting shade. 
</P>
<P>
Zinnias are embarrassingly easy to grow. Children often do as well as expert 
gardeners. The seeds are large, unlike those of petunias or snapdragons, so 
there's no difficulty seeding them or spacing them appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
In prepared soil, dig a furrow about an inch deep. Drop the seeds about four 
inches apart. Cover with one-eighth inch of soil and water gently so that the 
seeds are not washed away. Keep the soil damp until the seeds germinate -- 
usually in four to eight days. Thin the seedlings to 10 inches apart, 
transplanting extras to bare spots or into pots. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with zinnias is mildew, especially along the coast where I 
live. Its effects can be reduced by planting zinnias early enough in the <DATE>summer</DATE> 
that they can bloom before <DATE>late September</DATE> -- when the days shorten and plants 
are moist at night. It's also wise to keep the foliage dry by watering only the 
roots. At the first sign of a white powder dusting the leaves, spray with a 
fungicide, such as Funginex. 
</P>
<P>
One <DATE>summer</DATE> I tried the species Z. augustifolia (also called zinnia classic, Z. 
linearias, or thin-leaved zinnia). Its 1 1/2-inch golden-orange semidouble 
blooms are not nearly so striking as those of today's hybrids, but the plants 
had one especially appealing characteristic: no mildew, even in my humid 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
Now I see that the Burpee hybridizers have crossed Z. elegans with Z. 
augustifolia to produce a pink 2 1/2-inch bloom said to be mildew-resistant. 
I'm eager to try this new variety, <PERSON>Rose Pinwheel</PERSON>, in this <DATE>summer</DATE>'s flower 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
Along with it I will plant pink statice, rose shades of strawflower, blue 
salvia (S. farinacea Victoria), pink cosmos, rose cleome and gloriosa daisies. 
The gold centers of Rose Pinwheel should blend nicely with the gold daisies, 
and blue is always an excellent complementary color. 
</P>
<P>
Because they take longer to flower, I'll start the strawflowers in flats a 
couple of weeks before they go into the garden. All the other plants will be 
sown directly in the garden. Although blue salvia is easy to grow from seed, 
it's a perennial (often grown as an annual) that takes several months to begin 
flowering, so it's one <DATE>summer</DATE> flower that I usually purchase from the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
To use water as efficiently as possible, all my plants will be grown alongside 
soaker hoses. Although some irrigation systems are quite sophisticated (what 
with computer timers and multivalve stations) mine is simple. 
</P>
<P>
For each tier of my garden where annuals are sown, I use 150 feet of soaker 
hose that connects to the garden hose. I allow the water to run about five 
hours, gently, twice a week. By monitoring the soil dampness, I can determine 
whether to apply more or less. 
</P>
<P>
For gardeners who prefer the speed and convenience of seedlings, several 
familiar zinnia strains can be found at garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
The largest is dahlia-flowered State Fair, a reliable favorite that's been 
around for years. <PERSON>Peter Pan</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Pulchino</LOCATION>, and Cut-and-Come-again zinnias produce 
three-inch flattened blooms on 12- to 18-inch bushes. The smallest zinnia, 
<LOCATION>Thumbelina</LOCATION>, is cute but it's in bloom for such a short time that it seems 
hardly worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Terry Hartog</PERSON>, who raises thousands of bedding plants for his <ORGANIZATION>Vintage Nursery</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Lakewood</LOCATION>, likes to use zinnias as backdrop plants. He favors a mass planting of 
<PERSON>Peter Pan</PERSON> (because of its relatively large flower size and compact growth) 
bordered by white vinca Little Bright Eye. The vinca hides the lower leaves of 
zinnias, which can become unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
Terry says: "Both vinca and zinnias are good bets for hot-weather areas because 
they can stand up to the heat." 
</P>
<P>
The best selection of zinnias is in such catalogues as <ORGANIZATION>Burpee Gardens</ORGANIZATION> 
(featuring zinnias on the cover), <LOCATION>Warminster</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>PA</ORGANIZATION> 18974, and Park Seed, 
<PERSON>Greenwood</PERSON>, SC 29647-0001, Most local garden centers also have a variety of 
zinnia seeds.

POTTED CACTI JUST CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cactus can't get too much sun, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people associate cactus and succulents with full, hot, blazing sun," said 
<PERSON>Richard Hipp</PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION>House of Cactus</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Stanton</LOCATION>. But when home gardeners 
leave their potted cacti and succulents out in the <DATE>summer</DATE> sun, <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> said, the 
results are often scarred and unhealthy plants. 
</P>
<P>
In the wild or planted in gardens, roots of such plants are kept at a 
relatively cool and uniform temperature, even when the plant above is baking in 
the hot sun; in pots, though, the roots are not so well insulated and can 
easily overheat. 
</P>
<P>
"The plants do burn," <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> said. "Our <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> sun is just a little brutal 
for potted plants." 
</P>
<P>
Hipp recommends giving potted succulents and cactus full morning sun, then 
moving them to filtered sun in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. "The plants will be a lot 
healthier and prettier," <PERSON>Hipp</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Potted roses need more water -- The combination of pots and warm weather can 
also prove troublesome for roses. Many people don't realize that potted roses 
require more water than those planted in the ground, especially when the 
weather grows warmer. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there's a heat wave, I get a bunch of calls about leaves dropping 
and spider mites," reported <PERSON>Mike Morton</PERSON>, co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>Country Bloomers Nursery</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Orange</LOCATION>. Potted soil loses water quickly, leading to stressed plants that are 
more prone to those afflictions as well as mildew and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll read that roses shouldn't be overwatered," <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said about 
gardeners, but that does not apply as strongly to potted roses. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Morton</PERSON> recommends watering every day when the mercury climbs above 75 or 80 
degrees and also that home gardeners consider a drip watering system with 
battery-operated timer. Because runoff water carries nutrients from the soil, 
potted roses also need to be fertilized more often than those planted in the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Proper pruning is essential -- As a horticultural consultant for <ORGANIZATION>Roger</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Gardens in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> del Mar, <PERSON>Cristin Fusano</PERSON> has seen it all, from underwatering 
to overfertilizing, from misuse of spray pesticides and fungicides to "putting 
shade plants in the sun and sun plants in the shade." 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief problems she sees on visits to home gardens is poor pruning, 
especially pruning at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Often, plants are allowed to become "leggy" and overgrown only to be cut back 
suddenly to the bare branches -- just as the cold weather hits. "The poor plant 
is forced to work overtime to put out new green leaves," <PERSON>Fusano</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Many plants need to be pruned regularly, but there is a right time -- and a 
right way -- to do it, she said. The timing varies from plant to plant, but in 
general <DATE>spring</DATE> is a good time. The best bet is to do a little reading before 
heading out with the shears. 
</P>
<P>
Let there be (the right kind of) light -- The proper care of house plants is 
practically a science in itself, but many indoor gardeners doom their efforts 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"People buy the wrong plants for the wrong light," said <PERSON>Eddie Smith</PERSON>, co-owner 
with his wife, <LOCATION>Debra</LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Plant Stand</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Costa Mesa</LOCATION>, interior plant 
specialists. Many plants require abundant natural light to thrive, he said, 
while others can get by on fluorescent lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Palms, for instance, need natural light, while the hardier dracaenas (including 
the popular corn silk plant) can survive under indoor lighting and infrequent 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
Where a plant will go -- and what the lighting conditions will be -- should be 
considered before buying an indoor plant, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. He recommends getting 
professional advice on buying the right plant for the right conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The bark of the dogwood -- The staff of Tree of <ORGANIZATION>Life Nursery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Juan 
Capistrano</LOCATION>, specialists in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> native plants, came back with a 
less-than-serious response when asked to make a suggestion for this column: 
"Many gardeners create confusion in the garden by planting the dogwood too 
close to the cattails," reads the written reply. "This, however, is not as 
great a problem as it seems, because the dogwood's bark is worse than its 
bite."

   particular cactus was uprooted illegally. They don't have brands on

big business. This time we got lucky.''
   Big business, yes, though not in comparison with the traffic in
drugs or even illegal birds smuggled through the <ORGANIZATION>American
Southwest</ORGANIZATION>. But these states are facing dwindling water supplies and
are encouraging developers, resort operators and homeowners to turn
to desert plants for their landscaping. As a result, the legal
trade in cactus in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, just one state, has grown to about <MONEY>$2
million</MONEY> a year. The illegal trade, according to state experts, is
probably half again as much. The cactus in the nursery had a
sticker price, as it were, of <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>.
   Moreover, the sleuths who pursue cactus rustlers seem every bit
as determined as yesterday's cattle-rustler posses and today's
narcotics detectives, and the crime just as pernicious.
   They view the illegal ripping of a fragile plant out of a
fragile desert as a desecration, a ruthless violation of a
cathedral of nature. All they have to do is look south across the
Mexican border to see the unholy bleakness of the very same desert
practically laid bare by cactus rustlers and smugglers.
   Such was their dedication that luck played only a minor role in
catching the thieves who stole the great cactus that wound up in
the <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> nursery.
   That capture came about because of an observant nature-lover
from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> whose outrage set on the thief's trail wildlife agents
from three states and the federal government. Their hunt took eight
months. It led to the nation's first and only felony conviction to
date for the crime of cactus rustling.
   Of all the 5,000 varieties of cactuses, the one that comes to
mind with the very word is the saguaro, Cereus giganteus, the giant
of the desert, pronounced suh-WAH-row.
   If you see saguaros growing in the wild you are looking at
southern <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, their only natural home on this planet. If you
see them at sunset, the needles covering their giant torsos and
uplifted arms reflect an aura of gold; in moonlight, silver. They
seem to possess a mystical quality.
   The Papago Indians, who harvest cactus fruit to make wine and
jelly, call saguaros ``the old men.'' The residents of <LOCATION>Quartzsite</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, had a special name for the one tracked to that <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>
nursery: ``Old Granddad.''
   A saguaro grows only an inch or less a year in the arid desert.
That would make Old Granddad 200 years old. Saguaros don't even
develop their characteristic arms until they are at least 70.
   Old Granddad stood in utter remoteness 20 miles east of
<LOCATION>Quartzsite</LOCATION>, an old stagecoach stop on what is now I-10. But Old
Granddad, which stood there before the first stagecoach arrived,
wasn't visible from any paved road.
   Roy and <PERSON>Rosslee Crockett</PERSON>, from <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, heard about the
majestic saguaro when they first wintered near <LOCATION>Quartzsite</LOCATION> back in
<DATE>1977</DATE>.
   ``It was not like any other saguaro we had ever seen,'' <PERSON>Mrs.
Crockett</PERSON> said. She and Roy of course took snapshots of each other
standing next to Old Granddad. Each winter thereafter the Crocketts
drove their camper to southwestern <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, and each year made a
trip out to visit Old Granddad and make snapshots.
   And indeed it was like no other saguaro they had seen or were
likely to see.
   It was a crested saguaro, the rarest of the rare. According to
<PERSON>Victor Gass</PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION>Desert Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>,
maybe one saguaro in 200,000 develops a crest, and Old Granddad had
the most developed crest <PERSON>Gass</PERSON> or any of his colleagues had ever
seen.
   A crest is a fan-shaped growth on the top of the plant's main
stem. It is actually a deformity, a botanical aberration called
``fasciation.'' Nobody knows what causes it. It occurs only in the
wild and can't be reproduced in a nursery. On this particular
saguaro the crest measured more than 6 feet across and 4 feet tall.
   On <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rosslee Crockett</PERSON>'s ninth winter in <LOCATION>Quartzsite</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Old
Granddad</LOCATION> was gone.
   ``We didn't know what to do or what to think,'' <PERSON>Rosslee Crockett</PERSON>
said. ``The more I thought about it the madder I got. Finally I
called the sheriff.''
   The following day <PERSON>Mrs. Crockett</PERSON>'s report reached <PERSON>Alex Leivas</PERSON>, an
agent of the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Agricultural</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Horticultural Commission</ORGANIZATION>
whose district encompasses <LOCATION>Quartzsite</LOCATION> and whose duties include that
of cactus cop, as they are known in the state.
   She led him to the hole in the ground where the old cactus had
stood. Leivas found some tire tracks and took some pictures. She
showed him her own pictures of Old Granddad.
   ``I had figured it was just another saguaro,'' <PERSON>Leivas</PERSON> said.
``When I saw her pictures, I thought, wow. I had never seen such a
crested saguaro.''

<TEXT>
   Twenty-one people accused of illegally collecting
and selling protected cactus plants worth thousands of dollars have
been indicted on federal charges as a result of a four-year
undercover investigation.
   ``We live in a very fragile environment in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, and we
intend to do what we can to maintain that environment,'' <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Attorney <PERSON>Steven McNamee</PERSON> said. ``We intend to prosecute vigorously
anyone involved in stealing cacti.''
   The indictments alleged thousands of cacti _ primarily barrel
cactus but also including towering saguaros, some hundreds of years
old _ have been uprooted and stolen since <DATE>1986</DATE> from federal, state
or private lands throughout <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>.
   Healthy saguaros can sell for hundreds of dollars and prized
``crested'' plants sell for as much as <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>. The saguaro cactus
is not listed as endangered but is protected under <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s native
plant law and under a federal law that prohibits the interstate
trafficking of protected plants. It's also <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s state plant.
   Nineteen of the 21 people charged in the Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife
Service</ORGANIZATION> investigation had been arrested as of early today. They
were named in indictments issued <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by federal grand juries
in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, officials said.
   Charges include theft of federal property, conspiracy and
illegal interstate transportation of protected plants. The charges
carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> fine.
   ``This action demonstrates that the federal government takes
very seriously its responsibility to protect plants,'' Interior
Secretary <PERSON>Manuel Lujan</PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Lujan, who is from <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, called the saguaro ``a cherished
part of our Western landscape'' and said ``those who collect them
illegally are stealing from the public for their own personal
profit.''
   ``People come from all over the world to see these giant saguaro
cactus. This is a big part of our tourist industry, like the Grand
Canyon,'' <PERSON>McNamee</PERSON> said.
   Investigators said the defendants allegedly removed saguaros
from remote areas during the night and sold them to nurseries,
development companies and collectors in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and such foreign countries as <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>.
   The investigation was characterized as the largest federal case
ever undertaken involving a protected plant.
   Fish and Wildlife agents, alerted to the cactus theft problem by
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> officials several years ago, set up a phony business in
suburban <LOCATION>Scottsdale</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> and began posing as cactus dealers.
   ``We saw what we felt was a very flourishing business when we
first started,'' said <PERSON>Richard Marks</PERSON>, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION>Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION>
agent who headed the investigation.
   The saguaros cactus is is protected by <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> state law because
it is highly vulnerable to damage by vandals and because the plants
do not begin to reproduce until they are 50 to 75 years old.
   Officials said approximately 150 large saguaros, from 12 to 20
feet tall, and nine crested saguaros were sold to federal agents.
Marks said it wasn't yet known what will happen to them.
   Cactuses legally obtained from public lands have a tag and a
government seal.
   The Sonoran Desert in southern <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> is the only
place saguaros grow naturally, <ORGANIZATION>Marks</ORGANIZATION> said.

Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Rich still has a philodendron that came over from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> with her
grandmother more than 50 years ago; jade plants have a natural lifespan of 70
to 100 years; and cacti, which live for decades in the desert, can also live
for decades in your living room -- if given the right care.;    "It's just
that some plants have the misfortune of falling into the hands of someone who
doesn't have a green thumb," she says.;    In fact, though we like to surround
ourselves with foliage plants, most of us begin to neglect them soon after
bringing them home. Thinking we don't have the expertise to make them last, we
discard them when they show the least amount of stress.;    Unfortunately, few
plants are idiot-proof. Although many thrive in very low light, others can
tolerate watering mistakes and still others shrug off the cold drafts that are
so common around windows in winter, given enough of these problems, even the
hardiest will falter.;    But what are some of the real diehards -- the ones
even most brown thumbs can grow?;    <PERSON>Mike Geimer</PERSON>, of <PERSON>Geimer Greenhouses</PERSON> in
<LOCATION>Arlington Heights</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, puts any member of the dracaena family at the top of
his list. Most of us are familiar with the corn plants (Dracaena massangeana)
and the thin-leaved Dracaena marginata, often called a dragon tree, but we may
not recognize Dracaena deremensis '<PERSON>Janet Craig</PERSON>,' one of the houseplants used
most in interior design.;    <PERSON>Geimer</PERSON> also lists other "workhorses of the trade
-- anything in the philodendron family, Chinese evergreens (agloanema) and
pothos (Scindapsus aureus).";    No listing of workhorse plants would be
complete without the ubiquitous mother-in-law plant (sansevieria), one of the
hardiest of all plants.;    Cactus and succulents also can live from
generation to generation, <PERSON>Geimer</PERSON> says, but <PERSON>Kate Jerome</PERSON>, a plant information
specialist at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Botanic Garden</ORGANIZATION>, finds euphorbias (cousins of cacti,
many of which are native to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>) somewhat easier to grow. "Crown of
thorns is a good one because if it is stressed, it goes into dormancy," <PERSON>Jerome
says.</PERSON>;    Other long-lived succulents include <DATE>Christmas</DATE> and Easter cactus,
kalanchoes and agaves. Geimer even mentions the curiosity-generating lithops,
also called living stones, which will achieve old age as long as they are not
watered when they are splitting.;    Less common plants, those slightly out of
the realm of the average plant shop, become long-lived favorites of those who
know how to grow them. "Plants develop interesting patterns as they grow
older," says Rich. "I like ming aralias (Polyscias fruticosa) for their
elegance and because they are so beautiful. Ponytail palms (Beaucarnea
recurvata) are interesting because you can watch the bulb at its base swell as
it grows older." Ponytails are actually not palms but relatives of the yucca
family, and like the same high light conditions.;    "A great plant that will
last forever is the fragrant olive, Osmanthus fragrant," <PERSON>Jerome</PERSON> says. "It will
fill the room with fragrance all <DATE>winter</DATE> long and you can take it outside in
the <DATE>summer</DATE>. It will grow to about three feet, but it can be pruned back to
keep it small. It has a clove fragrance with a little bit of lemon, a very
heady scent.";    Next to a jade plant, the longest-living specimen in our
home is a Ficus benjamina that sulked for years before receiving the treatment
it expected. It still pales in comparison to one <PERSON>Jerome</PERSON> tends that "has a
four-inch diameter trunk," she says.;    "You have to watch for insect pests
and keep conditions steady. A change in air movement, temperature or light is
when they have a tendency to drop their leaves," she says. As much as a third
of the foliage will litter the floor when these conditions change. "The fewer
times that happens, the healthier the plant will be.";    <PERSON>Geimer</PERSON> says newer
ficus cultivars are not as prone to dropping their foliage. He cites
<ORGANIZATION>Wintergreen</ORGANIZATION> as a more compact version of benjamina. Ali is a thin-leaved type.
Green Gem responds to pruning with great branching. Alex is an even more
compact variety that doesn't grow past four feet.;    Longevity can be found
even among plants we consider truly tropical in origin. <PERSON>Geimer</PERSON> says one of the
oldest plants in his collection is a hibiscus that is more than 15 years old.
The trick, he says, is to thin out the branches in <DATE>winter</DATE>, prune it back hard
in <DATE>March</DATE> and, when it is ready to go outside in <DATE>May</DATE>, give it a good jolt of
fertilizer. "In two weeks, it will be in full bloom," he says.;    For the
ultimate experience in keeping plants alive, one has to consider the Japanese,
who have raised the challenge to an art form with their "bonsai." These are
trees grown in miniature form through assiduous pruning. Masters are trained
to do nothing but consider how to shape and form these national treasures.;   
You want longevity? Some bonsai specimens are more than 1,000 years old.; HOW
TO KEEP PLANTS THRIVING; <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Tribune;    ALTHOUGH they abhor making
generalizations about plant care, members of the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Foliage Association</ORGANIZATION>
do offer some tips that should help you keep your plants thriving:;    (check)
TEMPERATURES -- The most desirable range is 70 to 75 degrees during the day
and 65 to 70 at night.;    (check) HUMIDITY -- Foliage plants grow best where
humidity is high, <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> or higher if possible. Indoor humidity during
winter rarely gets that high without some supplemental moisture.;    (check)
WATERING -- Most foliage plants are adapted to regions where the soil is moist
but not continually saturated with water. Never allow soil to become
completely dry. When you do water, apply enough to wet the entire soil ball --
but roots should never be allowed to stand in water for any length of time.;  
 (check) CONTAINERS -- Foliage plants look best in containers of neutral
colors: white, brown, black, gray, copper or aluminum. Containers without
drainage holes should be checked frequently to prevent overwatering. Plants in
containers made of porous material, such as clay, must be watered more often
than those in plastic pots.;    (check) SOILS -- Foliage plants are easier to
care for in soils containing high levels of peat moss, which retain water and
fertilizer. Good aeration is achieved if the peat is mixed with coarse sand or
perlite.;    (check) FERTILIZATION -- Four applications a year are usually
sufficient, because it is often desirable to keep foliage plants from growing
excessively. Fertilizers prepared for indoor use are frequently more
convenient to use than those for lawn or gardens.;    (check) CLEANING FOLIAGE
-- The dust and residue that accumulate on foliage can be removed by spraying
the foliage with water or wiping it with a soft, moist cloth.  </TEXT>

   Leivas returned to the site with survey maps and confirmed his
suspicion that it was on land controlled by the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land
Management</ORGANIZATION>, federal land, and phoned <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Fish and
Wildlife agent.
   Then he recalled a ``transit notice'' he had received earlier
from a border agent in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, information the two states
exchange when native plants are transported across state lines. To
uproot a protected plant legally requires a permit from the state
and a metal tag affixed to the plant.
   The notice said that a load of cactuses, duly tagged, had passed
through <PERSON>Vidal Junction</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, on a flatbed truck <DATE>Feb. 3</DATE>. It
mentioned no crested saguaro, but, as <PERSON>Leivas</PERSON> discovered later, the
saguaro had been hidden beneath other varieties of especially
prickly plants, concealed as if by barbed wire. The notice said the
load was bound for <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, the carrier listed as <ORGANIZATION>Rattlesnake
Ranch</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Wenden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   Leivas decided to check it out. Meanwhile, he had <PERSON>Mrs.
Crockett</PERSON>'s pictures made into a sort of wanted poster, like a
missing-child bulletin in a supermarket, and mailed a copy to every
border checkpoint in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>.
   He also sent a poster to <PERSON>John Jones</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Division of
Forestry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, and told him about the load of cactuses.
Jones immediately recognized the picture of the crested saguaro as
one that recently arrived at <ORGANIZATION>Cactus King</ORGANIZATION>, a leading <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> nursery.
   But a picture is not, as the cops say, a positive <LOCATION>I.D.</LOCATION>, so
<PERSON>Keeler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leivas</PERSON> arranged to drive the 300 miles to <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> with
Mr. and <PERSON>Mrs. Crockett</PERSON> and have them take a look.
   ``There it is!'' <PERSON>Roy Crockett</PERSON> cried, even before they pulled
into the nursery.
   Said <PERSON>Linda Akers</PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney who prepared the
case for trial, ``It was the only plant lineup I've ever heard of.
I mean, `Mr. and <PERSON>Mrs. Crockett</PERSON>, do you recognize any plant among
that bunch?' You have to admit it's bizarre.''
   It turned out the deal had been made through a middleman, a
broker, and the the nursery owner was unaware that it was illegal.
The thief sold it for <MONEY>$1,300</MONEY> to the broker, who resold it to the
nursery for <MONEY>$1,500</MONEY>. That would be about the markup for any saguaro
this size, but this crested beauty was special.
   ``After it was here a week I was offered <MONEY>$7,500</MONEY>,'' said the
nursery owner, <PERSON>Jeff Meckley</PERSON>. ``Obviously I wasn't going to let it
go for the first offer, but the truth is I didn't want to sell it
at all. That's why I marked it up to <MONEY>$15,000</MONEY>. It was so magnificent
I wanted to keep it myself.''
   Meckley, disappointed, bundled up Old Granddad with loving care
and proper equipment. He hauled it to where <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON> had arranged for
its keeping, the <ORGANIZATION>Desert Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   It is no easy job to move a giant saguaro without damage,
internal or external. They are deceptively heavy, storing enough
water within to last as long as four years without a refill. This
one weighed two tons. Transporting one safely involves hydraulic
hoists and slings and padded cradles. The thief had used none.
   Now <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leivas</PERSON> had their cactus, but not their case.
   The cactus was tagged with a legitimate tag, No. 10108. It was
issued to <PERSON>Glen and Karen Clontz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Rattlesnake Ranch</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Jan.
10, 1986</DATE>. It authorized them to dig cactuses along a 100-foot-wide
right-of-way for an oil pipeline across the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> desert.
   The only time permission is given to uproot any of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s 212
species of protected plants from state or federal land _ which
constitutes <PERCENT>87 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> soil _ is when they are in
certain danger of being destroyed by such a project.
   Keeler found <ORGANIZATION>Rattlesnake Ranch</ORGANIZATION> ``out in the middle of nowhere''
in a place known as <ORGANIZATION>Butler Valley</ORGANIZATION>. The ``ranch'' turned out to be a
trailer and a few other beat-up vehicles. No electricity. No
running water.
   The Clontzes admitted they had dug the crested cactus. They
maintained that they had saved it in the nick of time from the
pipeline bulldozers. Keeler noticed a dozen saguaros scattered
about, with no tags, and also an immature red-tailed hawk, a
protected bird, which he found starving to death in a cage. He took
the pitiful creature to a rehabilitation center in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   ``Who's to say precisely where a cactus was taken?'' <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON>
said. ``He claimed it came from the pipeline path. Without the
<PERSON>Crockett</PERSON>'s photos we didn't have much of a case.''
   So <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON> took the photos out to the site and stood in the exact
spot where the Crocketts had stood and snapped his own pictures.
The backgrounds matched. Only Old Granddad was missing _ a mile
from the pipeline. That sewed it up.
   ``The evidence was so overwhelming,'' said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Akers</PERSON>,
``that we let the Clontzes plead guilty and saved the expense of a
trial.''
   Under <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> law cactus rustling is a misdemeanor. Under
federal law it is a felony and this was the first time the
government had had the evidence to make it stick. In recognition,
the Crocketts received a <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> reward.
   On <DATE>Feb. 23, 1987</DATE>, a year and a day after <PERSON>Rosslee Crockett</PERSON>
reported the missing saguaro to the sheriff, <PERSON>Glen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Karen Clontz</PERSON>
were each fined <MONEY>$250</MONEY> and he was sent off to the federal
penitentiary in <LOCATION>Boron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, where he served six months of a
two-year sentence. Both were put on five years supervised probation
and forbidden to deal in plants for that period.
   ``When I called the sheriff,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Crockett</PERSON>, ``I thought
he would just scold somebody and make them put it back. Now I know
what it means to make a federal case out of something.''
   The baby hawk died.
   So, at last, did the cactus.
   <PERSON>Gass</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, said the great plant had
suffered more knocking around than it could endure.``Something had
gotten inside it, some form of bacteria,'' he said. ``We have kept
the crest, to study it.''
   So they have. It rests on soft grass in the shade and is
magnificent in its size, a rotting relic of desert glory, destroyed.

hoists and slings and padded cradles. The thief had used none.
   Now <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leivas</PERSON> had their cactus, but not their case.
   The cactus was tagged with a legitimate tag, No. 10108. It was
issued to <PERSON>Glen and Karen Clontz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Rattlesnake Ranch</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Jan.
10, 1986</DATE>. It authorized them to dig cactuses along a 100-foot-wide
right-of-way for an oil pipeline across the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> desert.
   The only time permission is given to uproot any of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>'s 212
species of protected plants from state or federal land _ which
constitutes <PERCENT>87 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> soil _ is when they are in
certain danger of being destroyed by such a project.
   Keeler found <ORGANIZATION>Rattlesnake Ranch</ORGANIZATION> ``out in the middle of nowhere''
in a place known as <ORGANIZATION>Butler Valley</ORGANIZATION>. The ``ranch'' turned out to be a
trailer and a few other beat-up vehicles. No electricity. No
running water.
   The Clontzes admitted they had dug the crested cactus. They
maintained that they had saved it in the nick of time from the
pipeline bulldozers. Keeler noticed a dozen saguaros scattered
about, with no tags, and also an immature red-tailed hawk, a
protected bird, which he found starving to death in a cage. He took
the pitiful creature to a rehabilitation center in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   ``Who's to say precisely where a cactus was taken?'' <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON>
said. ``He claimed it came from the pipeline path. Without the
<PERSON>Crockett</PERSON>'s photos we didn't have much of a case.''
   So <PERSON>Keeler</PERSON> took the photos out to the site and stood in the exact
spot where the Crocketts had stood and snapped his own pictures.
The backgrounds matched. Only Old Granddad was missing _ a mile
from the pipeline. That sewed it up.
   ``The evidence was so overwhelming,'' said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney <PERSON>Akers</PERSON>,
``that we let the Clontzes plead guilty and saved the expense of a
trial.''
   Under <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> law cactus rustling is a misdemeanor. Under
federal law it is a felony and this was the first time the
government had had the evidence to make it stick. In recognition,
the Crocketts received a <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> reward.
   On <DATE>Feb. 23, 1987</DATE>, a year and a day after <PERSON>Rosslee Crockett</PERSON>
reported the missing saguaro to the sheriff, <PERSON>Glen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Karen Clontz</PERSON>
were each fined <MONEY>$250</MONEY> and he was sent off to the federal
penitentiary in <LOCATION>Boron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, where he served six months of a
two-year sentence. Both were put on five years supervised probation
and forbidden to deal in plants for that period.
   ``When I called the sheriff,'' said <PERSON>Mrs. Crockett</PERSON>, ``I thought
he would just scold somebody and make them put it back. Now I know
what it means to make a federal case out of something.''
   The baby hawk died.
   So, at last, did the cactus.
   <PERSON>Gass</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Botanical Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, said the great plant had
suffered more knocking around than it could endure.``Something had
gotten inside it, some form of bacteria,'' he said. ``We have kept
the crest, to study it.''
   So they have. It rests on soft grass in the shade and is
magnificent in its size, a rotting relic of desert glory, destroyed.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Gardening: Being kind to geranium cuttings - Arthur Hellyer
leafs through the traditional catalogues and finds a huge choice of
varieties for every flower bed and pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT virtually all the geraniums we use for planting outdoors in <DATE>summer</DATE>
are grown from seed, it is easy to forget that there is a different and very
important - though much smaller - trade in geraniums grown in the
traditional way, from cuttings.
This is carried out by nurseries, a few of which, such as The <PERSON>Vernon
Geranium Nursery</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Cuddington Way</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cheam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Surrey</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Fibrex Nurseries</ORGANIZATION>,
Honeybourne Road, <LOCATION>Pebworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Stratford</LOCATION> on Avon, and <PERSON>Thorp</PERSON>'s Nurseries, 257
Finchampstead Road, <LOCATION>Wokingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Berkshire</LOCATION>, grow hundreds of varieties. I have
just received the <DATE>1992</DATE> Vernon catalogue, which is exceptionally well
illustrated and it made me think about the varied types of geranium that are
available in this way.
Taking this catalogue as a reminder, I see that <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON> leads off with
<ORGANIZATION>Speckled Geraniums</ORGANIZATION>, which means speckled flowers, although there are quite
different varieties with speckled or netted leaves.
I do not know any of the nine varieties which <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON> puts in this class and
cannot say how the speckling arises, but in most of the ivy-leaved or
trailing varieties colour blotching, which can be very bold, is due to virus
infection. This, though not harmful to the plants, can produce variable
results which are not to everyone's liking. Nevertheless an ivy-leaved
geranium such as Rouletta, which combines carmine and white in varying
proportions, is very popular and most striking for hanging baskets, window
boxes and other containers.
Still following <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON>, there are a few finger-flowered varieties, in which
the petals are quilled and the leaves deeply lobed. There are also many
varieties with double or semi-double flowers which I know to be highly
effective. In the way geranium specialists tend to have of making things
rather too complicated they recognise a separate race of double-flowered
varieties known as <ORGANIZATION>Rosebud Geraniums</ORGANIZATION> which have small, very full flowers
like little pompons. They are pretty but I have found them difficult to grow
as the flowers rot if the air is too moist.
Then there are <PERSON>Irene Geraniums</PERSON>, with big single flowers, although their
leaves can easily get too large and coarse if they are given over-rich soil.
The Deacon Geraniums are yet another double-flowered race and were all
raised by the late Rev S <PERSON>Stringer</PERSON>. Many, but not all, appear to make
exceptionally compact plants.
There is a great class of Single Geraniums, in character similar to most of
those we now grow so freely from seed. Cactus-flowered Geraniums have
quilled petals; the <ORGANIZATION>Vernon Geranium Nursery</ORGANIZATION> lists 18 varieties of a type
which it calls Stellar Geraniums. They seem to have no common
characteristics except that they all originated from crosses made between a
geranium known as Chinese Cactus and ordinary zonal-leaved geraniums, the
kind we commonly think of when geraniums are mentioned.
A few geraniums have cupped flowers and are known as tulip-flowered. There
are also old varieties with rather thin yet distinctly woody stems that are
called Unique Geraniums, and are close to the <ORGANIZATION>Regal Geraniums</ORGANIZATION>. Then there is
a big section, known as <ORGANIZATION>Scented Leaf Geraniums</ORGANIZATION>, which have nothing in common
except the quality of having aromatic foliage which releases its scent when
brushed. Most have insignificant flowers and many have deeply divided leaves
but one, named <PERSON>Pelargonium Tomentosum</PERSON>, has big, heart-shaped, densely downy
leaves that are strongly peppermint scented. Other scents are lemon, apple,
rose, nutmeg and pine.
There is a big class called Golden Foliage Geraniums and another called
<ORGANIZATION>Ornamental Foliage Geraniums</ORGANIZATION>, some of which have three separate bands of
colour on the leaves. One of the most famous of these is <PERSON>Mrs H Cox</PERSON>, which
combines bands of yellow, red and black with a green centre. It won a <ORGANIZATION>First
Class Certificate</ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Horticultural Society</ORGANIZATION> as long ago as <DATE>1879</DATE>.
There are a great many Dwarf Geraniums and at least as many Miniatures which
are even smaller, just a few inches high. Cascade Ivy-leaved Geraniums are
much grown on the continent and Hybrid Ivy-leaved Geraniums are the result
of crossing ordinary ivy-leaved varieties with Zonals. They are intermediate
in habit and excellent for hanging baskets, window boxes and other
containers.
Regal Pelargoniums are mainly for cultivation in greenhouses and
conservatories though they can be used outdoors. They have large, often
richly-coloured flowers which are produced in late <DATE>spring</DATE> and early <DATE>summer</DATE>.
They can be stood outdoors when they cease to flower but need to be brought
inside before there is frost in the autumn.
Finally, there are the Angel Geraniums, which are really miniature Regals
and are said to be gaining in popularity.
It is an astonishing variety of plants to be obtained from one genus. Plants
can be purchased as rooted cuttings or as small pot plants for many months
of the year but especially in <DATE>spring</DATE> and early <DATE>summer</DATE>. They are easily grown
in peat or soil composts but most of the experts seem to prefer peat because
of its open, well-drained character.
They must not be allowed to freeze at any time, although high temperatures
are not necessary. For economy in <DATE>winter</DATE> I set my greenhouse thermostat at
7`C and keep the plants rather dry, but it would really be better to have it
three or four degrees higher. The biggest danger in winter is from botrytis
or grey mould fungus, which produces a rapid decay of stems and leaves and
flourishes in cold, damp air. Sulphur is the best remedy, either spray or
dust form.

surgery on your cactuses is a simple and easy way to propagate a sizable

<TEXT>     Since most cactuses are dormant during the winter months, they will begin
their strongest growth as temperatures warm up. "Right now is the best time of
year to make the cuttings. But let them dry for a period of time before you
start to root them," says <PERSON>Paul Long</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County
Cactus</ORGANIZATION> and Succulent Society.;    The drying period is important: It may take
as long as a month for a cutting to "callus off," or form a hard, leathery
seal -- but <PERSON>Long</PERSON> says when a fresh cutting is put in a potting medium without
the callus, it usually rots. Place the cutting in a shady spot to let the
callus form. "The bottom of the cutting will begin to shrink in a little and
the area where it is cut will become dry and leathery looking," he says.;   
At this point, set the cutting in a dry  planting medium, just deep enough to
stand alone. Long favors plain pumice  as a planting medium, but sand, potting
mix or cactus and succulent mix could be used.;    Since a cutting needs warm
temperatures and light to put out roots, it should be placed in filtered sun
indoors or out.;    No watering, though. Long says the cutting should not be
watered until it begins to grow roots. Tug gently on the little plant. If it
does not move easily, then roots are probably in place. Water sparingly.;  IF

<LEADPARA>  Q What is the secret to growing English lavender? I am aware that they are
drought tolerant so I water sparingly every three to four days.;   Their
leaves change from green to light gray and appear dry. I have managed to
salvage one by moving it to a less sunny spot. I am embarrassed to tell you
how many I have purchased this past summer but I am determined to find a
solution.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GIVE LAVENDER TIME TO GET ESTABLISHED  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mailbag  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     -- <LOCATION>V.E.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>;   A The tipoff to the problems you are experiencing in
growing lavender is in the watering schedule and the amounts of water applied
to your plants. One of the reasons we don't recommend planting of
drought-resistant materials during a drought is that it takes frequent,
regular watering of your new plants the first year, or one growing season and
one winter. This gives the plant an opportunity to get established and send
roots down deeply into the native soil. Only then will the drought-resistant
capabilities come into play.;   In the early <DATE>spring</DATE> the lavender will send
down roots deep into the soil to extract nutrients and water. Until then the
lavender (or any other plant) is growing in the root ball formed in the
container in which it was grown in the nursery. The roots have had no chance
to spread beyond and out from this ball of earth. The gardener must give the
plant sufficient moisture so that this ball of earth is kept moist and the
plant can survive long enough to get established.;   Give your surviving
lavender more water more frequently. Next year you will be able to enjoy its
color, fragrant blooms and aromatic foliage.;   Q I tried your suggestion
about adding vinegar to water for resurrecting houseplants that suffer from
burned leaf edges and have revived some nice plants. Is there a fertilizer
that would do the same? I have lots of pots and some are showing the same
symptoms. Is cider vinegar OK to use?;   -- <LOCATION>J.Z.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;   A Salt burn on
the edges and tips of leaves can be caused by hard water, the type of soil and
the fertilizer used to feed your plants. The imbalance causing the leaf cells
to die is from an excess of chemicals with a base reaction. The addition of a
weak acid, such as found in vinegar, or fertilizing with Miracid can
neutralize these basic salts.;   <LOCATION>Flushing</LOCATION> the soil will remove most but not
all of the accumulated salts. The continued addition of acidic fertilizers or
acidified water will help the plant grow better.;   If, by some small chance,
the soil would become too acidic for the plants, then the application of lime
would be needed. Mailbag has yet to see this condition in our area. An
inexpensive kit for testing the pH (the acidity or alkalinity) can be used.
The kit costs about <MONEY>$4</MONEY> and gives 10 tests.;   The use of vinegar seems to be
easiest. White or cider vinegar is recommended. Wine vinegar can have an
unpleasant odor.;   Q My epiphyllum (orchid cactus) survived the freeze last
year whereas most of my cactuses did not. Now it has a brownish scale on it
and I'm afraid it will die. How do I get rid of the scale?;   -- <LOCATION>A.C.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Los
Gatos</LOCATION>; A From your description it sounds as though the epiphyllum is showing
signs of infectious disease rather than an insect attack. Epiphyllums are
subject to several diseases that can be controlled by spraying with Captan, a
fungicide. Use three tablespoons per gallon of water and spray three times at
one-week intervals.;   If it turns out to be an insect attack, Mailbag
recommends using insecticidal soaps to control scale insects. There are very
few plants that are bothered by the soap and it will kill the adult scale
insects as well as the juveniles (known as crawlers).;   Q I have had a potted
gerbera for two years. It was blooming when I bought it but hasn't bloomed
since.;   -- <LOCATION>B.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>; A Gerberas (<LOCATION>Transvaal</LOCATION> daisies) are subject to a
fungus that is common in our area. The disease Phytophora attacks the crown
and then spreads to the roots, killing the plant. There is no cure. It is best
to destroy the plant, the soil and the pot to prevent the spread of the
disease.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE first wave of schlumbergera has hit the stores, signaling the start of the
holiday season.;   Schlumbergera, in case you're wondering, is the genus of
the Thanksgiving cactus and Christmas cactus, two flowering houseplants that
delight the eye in winter. The Thanksgiving cactus is a species that begins to
bloom a few weeks earlier than the Christmas cactus.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HOLIDAY CACTUSES ADD BEAUTY TO SEASON  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In bloom with flowers of white, pink, rose or red, they're both gorgeous.
But out-of-bloom, they're dull as a banana peel. Still, this is a graceful
plant and, unlike the poinsettia, it's worth saving for the future.;   In fall
these cactuses benefit from cooling weather while the lengthening nights
initiate buds. Beware: High house temperatures (above about 55 degrees at
night) and lights inhibit bud formation, so go easy on both. While the buds
are setting, water modestly.;   Once buds are set, however, you can enjoy your
plant. The buds and flowers will last much longer if the temperature is 70
degrees or lower. The plant needs good light and regular misting to simulate
jungle humidity.;   Water it well, then let the soil dry out just slightly
before watering again. Drafts and wide fluctuations in humidity are unnerving
to schlumbergera and may cause the buds to drop. But overwatering is another
leading cause of failure.;   Once the flowers fade after several weeks, keep
the plant on the dry side and fairly cool while it rests before putting out
new growth. This is the start of the dull stage, but bear with it since the
results of tolerance are so rewarding.;   Once the growing season is under way
next <DATE>spring</DATE>, keep it well-watered and feed it every two or three weeks with a
liquid, flowering houseplant fertilizer (African violet fertilizer, for
example) diluted to half-strength.;   These plants are also easy to propagate
by stem cuttings, 2 to 3 inches long, rooted in <DATE>spring</DATE>.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Q The leaves of my houseplants always turn yellow. A friend advised using
eggshell water, but I don't eat eggs. What are the best plants requiring only
a little care?;    A Eggshell water on potted plants is not a treatment I've
used but presumably it is designed to "sweeten" acid soil. My advice is stick
to plain tap water, applied at room temperature or slightly warmer.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CARE-FREE PLANTS JUST DON'T EXIST; EVEN HARDIEST
NEED SOME ATTENTION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Houseplants
Elvin McDonald is a New York-based garden columnist.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Plant leaves do not mysteriously turn yellow as a rule. Usually the soil
has gotten so dry between waterings that the leaves have wilted, or the roots
have been left standing in water until rot has set in. Or the plant has been
suddenly deprived of sunlight.;    If you consistently have trouble with
plants becoming too dry between waterings, it may be that the pots are too
small. Transfer them to several sizes larger if necessary in order to suit
your ability to water, which might be only once a week.;    So far as giving a
list of plants needing little care, let's be honest: If you really want plants
in the rooms where you live, you must also be willing to take care of them. It
doesn't take much time or effort; a few minutes every day is all any plant
needs and many can get by, as I have just suggested, being watered as
infrequently as once weekly.;    If a living plant isn't worth a little TLC,
why bother? There are "permanent" types that thrive on neglect and make
first-rate dust-catchers.;    There are unusually durable real plants, some of
them no doubt to be found at your local garden shop. Anything in widespread
distribution is fairly tough or it wouldn't be out there in the market.;   
There is also that unknown factor having to do with the individual person, the
individual plant, and the particular situation in which they exist. Put
another way, the same plant may thrive in the care of one gardener while it
dies in that of another, all things being seemingly equal.;    One fairly
constant guideline is that all plants need a certain amount of light in order
to live, and even desert cactuses and other succulents have to be watered on
occasion.;    That said, some plants that have survived life with me for many
years include sansevieria, calathea, syngonium, ficus, pleomele, dracaena,
spathiphyllum, pink cissus, African gardenia and murraya. Perhaps surprising,
because they are so small, I have also had great and extended success with
miniature sinningias in plastic bubble bowls or other small glass enclosures.;
   Q You have often written about the African gardenia or mitriostigma. I have
a young plant in a five-inch pot. What kind of care will get it to grow well
and bloom freely?;    A Mitriostigma grows well in humus-rich soil such as
equal parts packaged, all-purpose potting soil, clean sand, peat moss and
well-rotted compost. If you have it, add an extra part of peat moss as this
relative of the gardenia does best with plenty of acid.;    Mitriostigma also
thrives in warm, fresh, moist air that circulates freely, and with up to a
half day of direct sun. It also needs generous watering, so there is never
enough dryness to even slightly wilt the leaves.;    Mitriostigma has been one
of my favorite houseplants for many years. I have even managed to give away
several after getting them to grow and bloom profusely. This plant does seem
enticing to brown scale and may also get mealybugs. Weekly sprays of
insecticidal soap will keep the leaves and stems clean, but only if the
undersides are completely coated at each spraying.;    Mitriostigma is also
called African gardenia, a name that hints of its creamy white blossoms and
seductive fragrance. The flowers are much smaller than the related true
gardenia; they are an inch across, single and delightfully pink-tinged. They
have a fleeting life but appear in clusters off and on through the year.;   
If you don't find mitriostigma through your usual plant sources, ask about it
when visiting any public garden or arboretum. Mail-order specialists such as
<ORGANIZATION>Logee</ORGANIZATION>'s (55 <LOCATION>North St.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Danielson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION> 06239; catalog <MONEY>$3</MONEY>) also list it.;   
Most mitriostigma plants are fairly recently rooted cuttings or young bushes,
up to 18 inches tall and as wide. After several growing seasons it is possible
to have a specimen three or four feet tall. This kind of increase depends on
plenty of all the good things previously mentioned and regular applications of
fertilizer. I have used various combinations of 14-14-14 timed release
pellets, 30-10-10, 15-30-15 and fish emulsion.  </TEXT>

for what it was -- a true oasis. Here was a palm-dotted retreat where an 
ancient hot springs gushed forth. Here was nature, simple and unadorned. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the old <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> is a little hard to find. As the demand for 
more golf courses and more luxury housing increases, the last vestiges of wild 
<LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> are all the more precious. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are people and places committed to the preservation of the 
last of the wild desert. <PERSON>Patricia Moorten</PERSON>, who owns and operates <ORGANIZATION>Moorten</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Botanical Garden, believes the purpose of her garden is nothing less than the 
preservation and protection of our endangered native desert flora. "The idea 
behind <PERSON>Moorten</PERSON>'s Garden is to give visitors, after they've been downtown, the 
feeling that they're out in the desert again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is on <ORGANIZATION>Palm Canyon Drive</ORGANIZATION> just a few blocks from high-fashion salons 
and tacky T-shirt shops, but it is a world apart. The wood-burned plaque at the 
entrance reads: "This garden fosters the spirit of the desert despite the 
advent of man's possessive encroachment therein." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the wooden fence, overgrown cacti facing the street and the 
funky hand-lettered signs suggest a tourist attraction from the <DATE>1930s</DATE> -- kitsch 
instead of glitz. But once inside, the visitor is amazed by the extent of the 
cactus collections. And even though you swore you were going to concentrate on 
nothing but fun and sun in <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, you end up effortlessly learning an 
amazing amount of natural history and desert lore. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the garden is an introduction not only to the <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> of the 
past but also to the botanical diversity found in the deserts of the world. The 
self-guided tour takes the visitor through the environments of the Sonoran, 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Chihuahuan</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mojave</ORGANIZATION>, African and South American deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's was opened more than a half-century ago by <PERSON>Chester</PERSON> "Cactus Slim" 
<PERSON>Moorten</PERSON> and his bride, <PERSON>Patricia</PERSON>. Slim was a <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> actor-turned-desert 
landscaper who developed a reputation for locating and transplanting exotic 
cactus species during the worldwide cactus craze in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The garden very much reflects the personality of <PERSON>Patricia Moorten</PERSON>, a well-read 
botanist who, after more than 50 years of work, still consults with cactus 
lovers the world over. Dressed smartly and always wearing a large sun hat, 
<PERSON>Moorten</PERSON> frequently inspects her garden paths. She runs the place with the help 
of son <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and grandson <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so glad to share our garden with visitors," she says. "The fact that 
it's three generations of us now working here makes it very special." 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's is a great place to commune with cacti. More than 3,000 species can 
be found here, among them enormous century plants, spectacular 15-foot giant 
saguaros and a 20-foot cardon from <LOCATION>Baja</LOCATION>. Several hundred full-size species of 
cacti and succulents flourish in the cactarium, a temperature-regulated 
hothouse. 
</P>
<P>
One special attraction is an S-shaped palm tree that was moved here years ago 
from the open desert. The move was not an easy one, and a giant crane was 
required. The tree had been hit by lightning, which burned and bent it; still, 
it survived. 
</P>
<P>
"To me this palm is an example of that Bible passage that talks about how we 
grow from the heart out," <PERSON>Moorten</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
The palm is the focal point of the garden's Little Tahquitz Falls area, which 
is a reproduction of the actual Tahquitz Canyon area just a few miles away. 
It's a romantic place, judging from the number of weddings and receptions that 
take place here. 
</P>
<P>
Children are drawn to "Tortoise Terrace," where desert tortoises lumber about 
and bask in the sun. And they seem to have a great time following the "Dinosaur 
Footprints" in the Prehistoric Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Home gardeners can browse in the garden's nursery and buy succulents and cacti 
of all sizes from deserts near and far. 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's philosophy about preserving the desert extends far beyond the walls 
of her garden. She frequently hosts gatherings of like-minded civic and 
conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> is still a very unique and romantic place," <PERSON>Moorten</PERSON> says, "but 
the city, for some reason, has always felt compelled to promote pseudo-glamour 
instead of the magnificent geographical setting." 
</P>
<P>
For five decades, <PERSON>Patricia Moorten</PERSON> has been a voice in the <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> 
wilderness. She was one of the first botanists to preach the gospel of 
xeriscaping -- drought-resistant landscaping. As a city parks commissioner, she 
fought for desert landscaping instead of lawns and insisted that the palms not 
be pruned. To this day, when she learns of an imminent development, she makes 
it a point to beat the bulldozers to the construction site and "liberate" the 
native plants. 
</P>
<P>
"A little patch of green doesn't hurt, but the greatest percentage should be 
desert, open and natural," <PERSON>Moorten</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly <PERSON>Moorten</PERSON> and other <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> preservationists lost more battles than 
they won. They have seen the land and the names on the land change to an 
astonishing degree -- <PERSON>Rio del Sol</PERSON> is now Bob Hope Drive, Wonder Palms Road is 
<ORGANIZATION>Frank Sinatra Drive</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
To <PERSON>Patricia Moorten</PERSON>, and to visitors who step off the commercial path, 
<ORGANIZATION>Moorten's Botanical Garden</ORGANIZATION> is a place that celebrates the diversity of desert 
life and is living proof that the desert is anything but a barren wasteland. 
"The desert is far from deserted. It's full of fascinating creatures, 
especially plants. In fact, I feel like the desert is in tune with the 
universe." 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's <ORGANIZATION>Botanical Garden</ORGANIZATION> is at <DATE>1701</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>S. Palm Canyon Drive</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, (619) 
327-6555. It's open <DATE>Monday</DATE> through <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>4:30 p.m.</TIME>; <DATE>Sundays</DATE>, 10

Plants custom-designed by nature for water conservation will be available at 
the 25th annual show and sale sponsored by the Cactus and <ORGANIZATION>Succulent Society of 
America</ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION>Arboretum</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 29</DATE> and 30 and <DATE>July 1</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Specimens of silver cactus and succulents from every continent except 
<LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> will mark the silver anniversary of the oldest continuous Cacti and 
Succulent Show in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. They will also illustrate leaf 
modifications that conserve water within plant tissue. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-toned plants include those with waxy coatings that slow 
transpiration, or water loss, through the leaf surface. A newly introduced 
example from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> is Orostachys 'Warenge' from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, whose waxy variegated 
leaves form a smooth rosette. 
</P>
<P>
Another modification of the leaf's upper epidermal layer results in woolly 
silvery hairs that lower leaf tissue temperature by providing insulation from 
the sun and reducing the effect of wind. 
</P>
<P>
One popular hirsute group is the <ORGANIZATION>North American Mammillaria</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. The 
abundant soft white hair of M. hahniana Superba, called the "old lady" cactus, 
and M. plumosa, called the "feather cactus," beg for a pat but not all members 
of the family are so benign, warns <PERSON>Joe Clements</PERSON>, curator of the <LOCATION>Huntington 
Desert Garden</LOCATION> and show manager. "No one who handles M. senilis, 'the old man 
cactus,' " <PERSON>Clements</PERSON> says, "will forget the terrible hooks that seem to embed 
themselves forever." 
</P>
<P>
South American plants also have duplicitous hairy coverings. A few, such as the 
small fuzzy balls of the Bolivian Rebutia muscula named 'Mousy' have an 
innocuous covering that is pettable, but others, such as Cleistocactus strausii 
'Silver Touch' and its forms have insidious spines. 
</P>
<P>
Semperviviums from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> protect themselves from <DATE>summer</DATE> sun and winter snow by 
a hairy vesture of their waxy leaves. From the southern part of that continent, 
the "spider web" plant, S. arachnoideum, has a showy tangle of silvery hair. 
</P>
<P>
From <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> comes the contorted stems of the rare Anacampseros albissima, 
covered with minute brilliant-white scale-like leaves. And, from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, 
there is A. australis. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance to the sale is free. The Arboretum, at 301 <LOCATION>South Baldwin Ave.</LOCATION> in 
<LOCATION>Arcadia</LOCATION>, can be reached off the <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> exit south from the Foothills (210) 
freeway. Admission is <MONEY>$3</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> for seniors 62 years and older and 
for students, <MONEY>75 cents</MONEY> for children 6 and older, with no charge for children 5 
and under. Teddy <PERSON>Colbert</PERSON>

<LEADPARA>  SCRATCH and squeeze may sound like the newest lottery game. But, in reality,
these are ways to determine how badly garden plants have been damaged by the
December freeze.;    That record-breaking hard freeze ravished tropical and
Mediterranean plants in Bay Area gardens. But experts say the damage may look
worse than it is.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FIRST AID FOR FREEZE VICTIMS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to end of article
(box) For a complete guide to assessing
and repairing plant damage, see Page 2D  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "You're seeing the outward signs -- the cosmetic damage -- like brown,
crinkly leaves, shriveled lemons and jades that turned to mush. But deep down
beneath the bark and at the roots, many are still alive and will come back,"
says <PERSON>Ed Carman</PERSON>, a horticulturist and owner of <ORGANIZATION>Carman</ORGANIZATION>'s Nursery in <LOCATION>Los Gatos.</LOCATION>; 
  Recovery -- or lack of it -- hinges on whether the plant's roots were frozen
in those 20-degree temperatures. If that's the case, there is no hope.;    So,
getting back to scratch. You can do a fingernail scratch test to locate damage
on plants such as citrus and hibiscus. Lightly scratch your nail over a
branch. Green beneath the bark means living; brown, naturally, means dead.
Move further along the branch and try again. Eventually you will be able to
isolate most of the dead parts.;    The squeeze test tells you the same thing
about jade, cactus and banana plants. Wrap your hand around a branch and
squeeze. Then, move to another branch and try again. Squishy is bad news,
<PERSON>Carman</PERSON> says. "It's pretty obvious. You'll be able to feel the dividing line
between living tissue and dead.";    First aid for these freeze victims should
be postponed, however, until the first signs of new growth between
mid-February and mid-March. Once you spot new growth -- and with the help of
the scratch and squeeze tests -- you can easily pick the places to make the
cuts.;    At the same time, start watering plants deeply and give everything a
feeding with an all-purpose fertilizer such as 10-10-10.;    In the worse
cases -- even when there is no sign of life -- wait until <DATE>July</DATE> before giving a
plant the last rites. Like <PERSON>Lazarus</PERSON> it may miraculously rise against all odds.;
   "Basically you want to give these damaged plants every chance," <PERSON>Carman</PERSON>
says. "If there is no new growth by <DATE>summer</DATE>, then take it out, whether it's a
prized eucalyptus tree or a passion-fruit vine.";    He admits there are some
that just aren't going to come back -- caladiums, passion-fruit vines, many
cactuses and jades, myoporum and carob trees, and <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> island pines are top
contenders for the casualty list.;    In the same vein, what comes back
perhaps isn't worth the saving. "If you have to cut a hibiscus back to bare
bones, or trim a bougainvillea right down to the ground, maybe you should just
dig it up, instead, and start over with a new one," <PERSON>Carman</PERSON> says. "You'll get
good growth on a hibiscus by <DATE>July</DATE>, but it will take at least two years for a
big hibiscus to come back with flowers again.";  AGAPANTHUS; (box) When: In
late February.; (box) What: Cut off all foliage that is brown or lying on the
ground.; (box) Alive or dead: Look down at the heart of the plant. If the
plant is alive, you will spot the tips of new little green leaves coming up.
If there is no new growth by <DATE>July</DATE>, the plant is dead. Dig it up.; (box) Same
treatment: Fortnight lily, calla lily, other plants with stiff, swordlike
leaves.; (DRAWING: AGAPANTHUS) (Color);   CITRUS; (box) When: In March.; (box)
What: Remove all brown leaves and damaged fruit.; (box) Alive or dead: Lightly
scratch wrinkly looking shoots and branches with your fingernail. Signs of
green beneath the bark mean that branch is alive. Use scratch test to locate
any brown, dead wood. If a shoot has dead wood on part of it, don't keep it.;
(box) Same treatment: Hibiscus, fuchsia, rhododendron, other woody shrubs and
trees.; (DRAWING: Citrus) (Color);    BOUGAINVILLEA; (box) When: In early
March.; (box) What: Remove all dead foliage and flowers.; (box) Alive or dead:
Lightly scratch stems near growing tips with your fingernail looking for green
beneath the bark. If only the tips are dead, cut them back to stems with green
growth. If entire vine has dead leaves with no sign of green on the main
branches, then cut the vine to one foot above the soil.; (box) Same treatment:
Passion vine, hoya vine.; (DRAWING: BOUGAINVILLEA) (Color);   JADE; (box)
When: In mid-February.; (box) What: Remove collapsed branches, obviously dead
parts.; (box) Alive or dead: Gently squeeze branches. Damaged wood feels soft
and mushy. Wherever the trunk or branch feels solid, make the cut just above
the line between living tissue and freeze damage. You'll get new growth from
that point. A soft trunk down to the soil line probably means the plant is
dead. But leave it in place until <DATE>July</DATE> to see if new growth appears.; (box)
Same treatment: Cactuses, succulents.; (DRAWING: Jade) (Color);  FERN; (box)
When: In mid-February; (box) What: Cut off all brown fronds. Leave the green
or partially green ones in place.; (box) Alive or dead: Some ferns are more
hardy than others, but if roots are alive, the ferns will come up again. Ferns
used as ground cover should be cut to one to two inches above the soil.
Tall-growing ferns should have a four- to six-inch stem.; (box) Same
treatment: Ground covers, herbs.; (DRAWING: Fern) (Color)  </TEXT>

All around <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, the curtain is rising on this year's springtime 
show of colorful wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
This is the best month to see this glorious display, although blooms this year 
are later and more sparse than usual because of scant rainfall and an 
exceptionally cold winter. Still, there are plenty of locations where you can 
see wildflowers, especially in moist coastal areas and at some <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> 
botanic gardens, where patches of wildflowers are seeded and irrigated. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a sampling of places to find wildflowers near <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. To 
learn more about the flowers, join one of the nature walks offered at each 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are alone or with a group, remember that wildflowers are a fleeting 
annual treasure for all to enjoy. Look, but don't pick. 
</P>
<P>

<LEADPARA>  ASSESSING and repairing your freeze-dried garden is a job that will take a few
weekends to complete.;    Start first with plants that are already showing new
growth and then work up to the slow starters. Last of all, turn your attention
to borderline plants that may -- or may not -- be alive.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   Citrus;  There are probably more damaged citrus than any casualty. Lime trees
were especially hard hit and only those that were totally protected will
survive.;    No matter how bad the tree looks, hold off repair work until the
tree is growing in <DATE>March</DATE>. "That happens when daytime temperatures begin to
regularly reach 55 degrees," says wholesale citrus grower <PERSON>Don Dillon Sr.</PERSON>,
owner of Four Winds Growers in Fremont.;    To locate damage, lightly squeeze
bad-looking shoots and branches. Damaged bark feels wrinkly or loose. Scratch
the branch with a fingernail, or use the sharp blade of a pruning shear to
lightly scrape a small spot. Green beneath the bark means that branch is
alive. Go out further along the branch and scratch another spot. Keep doing
this until you have pretty much covered the whole tree.;    Even though the
tree looks awful, you may find that the entire tree is green underneath the
bark, and you won't have to prune.;    But if a shoot has dead wood on part of
it, don't keep it. Cut away the whole shoot so no dead wood is left on the
tree.;    Pick off all dead leaves and damaged fruit. "The damaged fruit isn't
good for anything except maybe composting," <PERSON>Dillon</PERSON> says.;    (box) New or
renew: It will take three years for a citrus to recover and bear a decent
crop. Cost for new citrus in 5-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$25.</MONEY>;  <LOCATION>Avocado</LOCATION>;
 Don't prune avocados. They don't need it. Pick off damaged fruit and leaves,
but leave the pruning shears behind. The tree will either make it on its own,
or die, without further interference.;    (box) New or renew: It will take at
least a year -- and probably longer -- for an avocado tree to renew leaves and
bear fruit. Cost for avocado in 5-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$35.</MONEY>; 
<LOCATION>Hibiscus</LOCATION>;  Hibiscus is extremely sensitive to cold, so this is an iffy case.
Many won't make it. To check for living wood, give a hibiscus the scratch test
(see citrus) to look for green growth beneath the bark. Cut off the branches,
or tips of branches, that are damaged, so no dead wood is left on the shrub.
Strip off all brown, crinkly leaves.;    (box) New or renew: You can expect
good growth on small-size hibiscus around <DATE>July</DATE>, but it will take at least two
years for a big bush to come back. Cost for hibiscus in 1-gallon container:
approximately <MONEY>$8.</MONEY>;  <LOCATION>Bougainvillea</LOCATION>;  Another sensitive tropical that has been
widely damaged, its recovery can go either way. Vines that are more than two
years old have a good chance of making it, and regrowth is fairly fast.;   
Give a vine the scratch test, looking for live wood. You may find only the tip
shoots damaged. In that case, cut them back to new green growth. If the entire
vine has dead leaves and is in bad shape overall -- no sign of green on the
main part of the vine -- cut the vine down to about a foot above the soil. New
growth will start at that point if the roots are alive.;    (box) New or
renew: If only the tips are damaged, you can expect plenty of new growth and
flowers by <DATE>summer</DATE>. Vines cut down near the soil may flower this year; for sure
next year. Cost for bougainvillea in 1-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$7.</MONEY>; 
<ORGANIZATION>Jade</ORGANIZATION>;  Jade plants are bad news because most plants turned to mush and
collapsed in the first cold wave. Give plants the squeeze test: Wrap your hand
around the trunk and squeeze like a rubber ball. "Squishy is definitely not
good," says horticulturist <PERSON>Ed Carman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Carman</ORGANIZATION>'s Nursery in <LOCATION>Los Gatos</LOCATION>. "It's
pretty obvious where the freeze damage is because the branch is soft and will
probably break off in your hand.";    Wherever the trunk or branch feels
solid, make the cuts there. New side growth will sprout quickly along the
trunk below the cut.;    (box) New or renew: You can expect growth this year,
but it usually takes more than one year for jade to come back to its former
self. Cost for jade in 1-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$9.</MONEY>;  <ORGANIZATION>Cactus</ORGANIZATION>;  Most
cactuses and a good many succulents were severely damaged. If the plant feels
soft, it probably won't come back. Dig it up.;  Agapanthus;  Also known as
Lily-of-the-Nile, these perennials grow from fleshy rootstock. They may look
terrible surrounded by brown, collapsed leaves. But deep down in the roots,
most are OK and will put up new growth.;    Pull off -- or cut back -- dead
foliage, but don't remove green leaves. Look down at the heart of the root for
new little shoots -- green leaves -- coming up. They may only be an inch or
two so far. "If there is no sign of green, it probably means the roots were
frozen and are now dead," <PERSON>Carman</PERSON> says.;    But, still, don't dig up seemingly
dead ones. Give them a chance into <DATE>summer</DATE> to revive. No growth by <DATE>July</DATE> means
there is no further hope.;    (box) New or renew: You will get growth, perhaps
some flowers this year. Flowers will show up in full force next <DATE>summer</DATE>. Cost
for agapanthus in 1-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$7.</MONEY>;  Ferns;  Some kinds
of ferns are more cold-tolerant than others, but all of them are injured, if
not dead. A fern will recoup, however, if the roots are alive. Cut off dead
fronds, but leave green or partly green ones in place. Ferns used as ground
cover should be cut down to about one inch high;    (box) New or renew: They
will need all of this <DATE>summer</DATE> to come back, but most will take until next
<DATE>summer</DATE> to fully recover. Cost for fern in 1-gallon container: approximately
<MONEY>$10.</MONEY>;  <ORGANIZATION>Canna</ORGANIZATION> lilies;  They should be cut down to the ground in late winter
normally, so the freeze damage and collapsed leaves don't matter. Cut off
stalks about two inches above the soil.;  Calla lilies;  Like agapanthus, the
callas look pretty sad, but they should be OK if the rhizomes are alive. Cut
off brown leaves and foliage lying on the ground. If all the leaves are down,
cut off everything two inches above the soil. But, green leaves that are
standing upright should be left in place.;    (box) New or renew: Callas that
revive should put out new green growth and flowers this year. Cost for calla
lily in a 1-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$7</MONEY>; single rhizomes from <MONEY>$1</MONEY> to <MONEY>$5</MONEY>,
depending on the variety.;  <LOCATION>Caladium</LOCATION>;  Take them out -- they haven't a prayer
of coming around. A fancy-leaf caladium bulb costs from <MONEY>$1</MONEY> to <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY>.;  Banana
plant;  Most banana plants are going to pull through even though they look
like candidates for the compost pile. Wait until <DATE>May</DATE> to rejuvenate banana
plants.;    Cut off the brown, drooping leaves because they are, indeed, dead.
But the roots are very likely still alive. Squeeze the thick main stem,
feeling for the difference between squishy and solid wood.;    Cut off the
main stem slightly higher above the spot that feels solid, and check for signs
of green. What you are looking for is a green shoot near the core (center) of
the cream-colored stem. If you don't spot it on the first cut, go down another
six inches or so, and make another cut. Wherever you spot that green shoot,
that's where the new growth of the banana plant will start.;    (box) New or
renew: You'll get lots of rapid growth with new, big leaves by the end of
<DATE>summer</DATE>. Cost for a banana plant in a 1-gallon container: approximately <MONEY>$10.</MONEY>;  
<ORGANIZATION>Evergreen</ORGANIZATION> shrubs;  Most will come back. Wait for new growth and then shear
back to the new growth.;   Palms; It's hard to tell whether a damaged palm
will pull through, <PERSON>Carman</PERSON> says. The damaged fronds should be removed. Some
palms will put out new fronds from the crown of the tree, but if none appear
by <DATE>July</DATE>, the tree is lost.;    (box) New or renew: You can expect two or more
new fronds by <DATE>summer</DATE> for some varieties. Cost for a palm: from <MONEY>$10</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100</MONEY> or
more, depending on variety and size.;  <LOCATION>Pines</LOCATION>;  The needles on both <LOCATION>Norfolk
Island</LOCATION> pine and <LOCATION>Canary Island</LOCATION> pine freeze at about 20 degrees and hang on the
tree. The brown needles won't come back. <PERSON>Carman</PERSON> says the tree will have to be
cut down.;    If the roots are alive, you can saw the trunk at the ground.
When new suckers come up, pick the best one and start that as your new tree.; 
  (box) New or renew: These trees grow very slowly, perhaps no more than one
to two feet in a year. Cost for new: from <MONEY>$25</MONEY> to more than <MONEY>$100</MONEY>, depending on
size.;  Other trees;  Myoporum and carob trees are two examples of tropical
and <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> evergreen trees that are unlikely to pull through. Myoporum,
a.k.a lollipop tree, grows an attractive canopy of green leaves -- which are
now totally brown. "The trees will probably die," <PERSON>Carman</PERSON> says. "Some branches
may come back. But limbs that are dead won't put out new leaves." The carob
tree is supposedly hardy to 18 degrees, but a good many are damaged beyond
recovery,too.;    (box) New or renew: Hold off until <DATE>summer</DATE> for new growth to
appear. Before pronouncing a mature tree totally gone, it might be best to
consult a certified arborist for a professional opinion. Cost of new trees
vary widely, depending on size and variety.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of the world's endangered plants,
from tiny Indonesian orchids to the giant saguaro cactus of
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, have found a home in a cluster of government-run
greenhouses where they are nursed back from the brink of extinction.
   ``We keep the Noah's Ark of the plant world,'' said <PERSON>Rob
Pennington</PERSON>, superintendent of collections at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Botanic
Garden</ORGANIZATION>'s 20-acre <ORGANIZATION>Poplar Point Nursery</ORGANIZATION> in southeast <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   Among the 25,000 plants that flourish in the nursery's two dozen
greenhouses on the <LOCATION>Anacostia River</LOCATION> banks are about 3,000 rare and
exotic specimens seized by customs officials at <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ports of entry.
   The plants were removed from import shipments that violated the
Convention on <ORGANIZATION>International Trade in Endangered Species</ORGANIZATION>, a
multinational accord that forbids trafficking in a long list of
endangered plants and animals without strict certification.
   Diseased plants are destroyed immediately. The others are sent
to 15 government ``plant rescue stations'' around the country,
including <ORGANIZATION>Poplar Point</ORGANIZATION>, where they are nurtured and bred for
scientific study and display at botanical gardens.
   The Botanic Garden, established by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1821</DATE>, also grows
plants at <ORGANIZATION>Poplar Point</ORGANIZATION> to landscape the Capitol and adjacent
federal buildings and for seasonal floral displays at its
conservatory, a formal greenhouse on the <ORGANIZATION>Mall</ORGANIZATION> at the foot of
<LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION>.
   There are no man-eating plants in <LOCATION>Pennington</LOCATION>'s collections, but
there are extremely rare specimens of Encephalaratos lehmannii
cyads from the desert region of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. These primitive, palm-like
plants survived the dinosaur era because of their toxic trunk and
roots. For centuries, they have poisoned human beings who beat the
pulp into bread flour.
   <ORGANIZATION>Poplar Point</ORGANIZATION> also acquired hundreds of Javanicum Tortipelatum, a
small, endangered orchid from <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, from a grower's shipment
that was confiscated in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. They had spent six weeks in
boxes without light or water. <PERSON>Pennington</PERSON> said it's a miracle that
many managed to survive.
   Domestically, the greenhouse is the last refuge of a ``sneeze
weed'' that the state of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> spent 30 years trying to
eradicate. Also here is the insect-gobbling Saracenia Oreophila
plant, now nearly extinct in its natural habitat along the <LOCATION>Carolina</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Coast</ORGANIZATION> shores.
   Poplar Point also is salvaging a majestic saguaro cactus of
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, once commonplace as a travel poster symbol of the arid
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> until it was nearly bulldozed into oblivion by land
developers.
   Pennington delights visiting school children with tales about
his Pittosporum boninensis, a nondescript shrub that's nearly
extinct on its native island of <LOCATION>Chichi Jima</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>. A
cannibal supposedly lived there at one time.
   Chichi Jima became a footnote in the history books when <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON>, a young <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot who later became president, ditched his
crippled plane a few miles offshore after a bombing run against
Japanese forces in World War II.
   ``I tell the kids that the cannibal used to hide in this
shrubbery waiting to eat downed pilots, and that <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>
escaped with his life,'' <PERSON>Pennington</PERSON> said with a laugh. ``When you
have a plant this plain and ugly, you have to think of something to
tell them.''
   Pennington, 36, a horticulturist trained in plant pathology,
said the biggest threat to the world's tropical plants comes from
runaway population growth. More and more people means destruction
of forests and vast amounts of foliage for food, housing and
commercial development.
   ``These plants are endangered because they no longer have a home
when their environment is removed,'' he said. ``We provide a home
for wayward plants, you might say.''

<P>
One of the greatest joys of indoor gardening is growing herb plants. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are herbs beautiful to look at and fun to grow, but as both .ey go 
froma professional gardener and an amateur cook I can assure you there's 
nothing more rewarding than seasoning your favorite dish with a bit of oregano, 
thyme or sage that you grew yourself in your very own kitchen windowsill. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between herbs and spices? 
</P>
<P>
Well, most herbs are fleshy, succulent plants that grow in relatively temperate 
climates and whose leaves and stems can be used for culinary purposes, for 
giving off delightful fragrances, have proven curative powers or can be used as 
natural cosmetics or dyes. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs can also be dried to make beautiful wreaths or breath-taking potpourri. 
</P>
<P>
A spice, on the other hand, is generally a very aromatic part of an herb plant, 
ground from the root, fruit, flower or bark. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the plant coriander is an herb, generally known as cilantro or 
Chinese parsley, while the ground seeds of coriander are classified as a spice. 
The same with ginger -- the plant itself is an herb; the root is a spice. 
</P>
<P>
And spices prefer a more tropical environment than herbs. 
</P>
<P>
The culinary herbs, those used for flavoring food, include savory, rosemary, 
basil, dill, parsley, mint, anise, bay, chervil, chives, fennel, mustard and 
many, many more. 
</P>
<P>
They can be used either fresh or dried. Just remember that dried herbs are 
stronger than fresh herbs -- one tablespoon of fresh herbs equals one teaspoon 
of dry herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you should add fresh herbs relatively late in the cooking process so that 
you don't cook out all the subtle, delicate flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Although almost all herbs are scented, the most fragrant include bay, lavender, 
scented geraniums, lemon verbena, patchouli and tansy. Among herbs used for dye 
and color are indigo (for blue), agrimony (for yellow) and madder root (for 
red). And people have been using herbs for medicinal purposes since the 
beginning of time, such as chamomile for tea and aloe vera, applied topically, 
for rashes and burns. 
</P>
<P>
The most rewarding route toward growing your own herbs is to start them from 
seeds. You'll find a large variety of packeted herb seeds in nurseries, garden 
centers and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the directions on the seed packet, which will read something like this: 
Fill a pan or a low, wide pot with one-half commercial potting mix, one-quarter 
vermiculite and one-quarter perlite. Plant the seeds in rows about four inches 
apart and about half an inch under the soil. Keep the soil moist and in a 
bright, warm spot. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds should sprout within two weeks. As the individual plantlets reach 
heights of 3 to 4 inches, weed out the smallest, scrawniest seedlings and plant 
the strongest into individual small pots about 2 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Keep them in bright sunlight and keep the soil moist (this usually means daily 
watering). Within a few weeks you should have flourishing plantlets that are 
anywhere from six inches to a foot tall and ready to be transplanted into and 
cultivated in four-inch pots. 
</P>
<P>
As fresh herbs become more and more popular in cooking, people are also buying 
established herb plants, usually in 3- or 4-inch pots. You can find 
high-quality plants in better nurseries and garden centers in our area almost 
all year long. 
</P>
<P>
Although you can buy perennial herb plants during the fall and winter, the best 
time to buy is now, during the <DATE>summer</DATE>, so that they can get a good root hold in 
your house or apartment. When buying herb plants, make sure they're healthy: A 
good plant is full, bushy and free of drying leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The general rules for growing herbs indoors, to keep them thriving even during 
the winter months, are: 
</P>
<P>
Light: Herb plants need at least five hours of good sunlight a day, although 
they should be protected from direct sunlight during the hot <DATE>summer</DATE> months. If 
you can't provide enough natural sunlight, herbs will do very well under 
artificial lights. 
</P>
<P>
Water: Most herbs should be kept moist at all times, although some need to be 
drier than others. (See specific care instructions.) 
</P>
<P>
Soil: A regular commercial potting mix is fine, but I suggest you add a bit of 
perlite to create a lighter soil and ensure extra good drainage. 
</P>
<P>
Food: Herb plants need very little food -- a once-a-month feeding with an 8-7-6 
liquid houseplant food is plenty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvesting 
</P>
<P>
Whether you're growing your herbs for cooking, fragrance or medicinal use, 
you'll want to harvest them frequently. I'd suggest cutting a couple of inches 
off the tops every time your herb plants grow that much. This will not only 
keep you well-supplied with herbs but will help encourage bushy new growth as 
well. You can harvest herbs using scissors or by just pinching off the tops any 
time you like. 
</P>
<P>
I've tried lots of herbs indoors, but I've had the best luck with these five, 
all perennials, ensuring growth year-round: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oregano 
</P>
<P>
Almost interchangeable with another delicious perennial, sweet marjoram, 
oregano (Origanum varieties) has a slightly sharper flavor and makes a 
wonderful container plant. It grows into a shrub about two feet tall with dark, 
green, oval leaves. Oregano should be grown in full sun, kept moist, and can be 
propagated from seeds, cuttings or root division. 
</P>
<P>
Oregano is an especially good addition to dishes such as pasta, soups, salads 
and tomato-based dishes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thyme 
</P>
<P>
Thyme, Thymus varieties, (pronounced "time") is a perennial that will thrive in 
full sun when kept lightly moist in a well-drained soil. All varieties do well 
indoors, but you should clip (or harvest) your thyme plant frequently so it 
won't develop woody stems. Propagate by seed or stem cuttings. Thyme can be 
used effectively with meats, poultry, stews, sauces and soups. (I make a mean 
zucchini loaf flavored with thyme.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savory 
</P>
<P>
Among the many varieties of savory (Saturega varieties) the two most common are 
winter savory (S. montana) and <DATE>summer</DATE> savory (S. hortensis.) Winter savory is a 
hardy perennial that will grow almost two feet tall and will do very well on a 
bright, sunny windowsill. Summer savory is an annual that has a slightly more 
delicate flavor than winter savory but which I don't recommend you try to grow 
indoors. Both varieties have small, needle-like leaves and produce tiny, 
pinkish-white flowers. Winter savory prefers a more sandy soil than its <DATE>summer</DATE> 
brother and is propagated by division or root cuttings. Savory is delicious is 
salads, soups and stews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sage 
</P>
<P>
Another hardy perennial, sage (Salvia varieties) is a member of the mint 
family. Besides its culinary value, sage has long been used as a medicinal herb 
for everything from upset stomachs to baldness. In medieval times, sage was 
even thought to improve the memory. Among the many varieties of sage you'll 
find at your nursery or garden center, the showiest is the variegated s. 
"tricolor" and the most interesting (if you can find it) is s. elegans, or 
pineapple sage, whose light-green leaves have a strong pineapple aroma. Sage 
can be propagated by seed or stem cuttings and goes well with sausage, pork 
chops, vegetables or pasta sauce. The most traditional use for sage is at 
Thanksgiving, in turkey stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rosemary 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary (Rosmarinas varieties) is more woody than the average herb plant, thus 
we often see it designed as a topiary or a bonsai plant. Rosemary is said to 
alleviate headaches, heal wounds and induce sleep, but it's most prized as a 
flavorful addition to meats, soups and vegetables. And for a summer treat I 
sprinkle rosemary leaves on my homemade fruit salad. Rosemary should be kept 
away from cold drafts during the <DATE>winter</DATE>, and although it needs full sun, it 
should only be watered when the soil is dry. 
</P>
<P>
Using fresh herbs as flavoring can often turn a very good dish into a gourmet 
delight. But, even if you choose to dry some of the herbs you grow and harvest, 
you'll get a great deal more satisfaction from sprinkling home-grown rosemary 
into a recipe than adding the same herb from a store-bought jar. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know more about growing herbs, there are lots of excellent books 
available on the subject, ranging from "Herbs" by <PERSON>Emelie Tolley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chris Mead</PERSON> 
(Potter: <MONEY>$35.00</MONEY>), a beautiful coffee-table tome, to the bargain of the batch, 
"Herbs -- An Illustrated Guide" (Sunset: <MONEY>$6.95</MONEY>). 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. It's time for you to join the ranks of those of us who 
have discovered the pleasure of growing our own herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you start your herbs from seeds, cuttings, or buy the plants already 
under way in 3- or 4-inch pots, good luck, happy growing, and bon appetit!

<LEADPARA>  Changeover Season; You won't find it marked on any calendar, but Memorial Day
weekend is the changeover season. It's time to get everything in the ground
without delay. Plant vegetables and annuals from six-packs and 4-inch pots;
but start beans, squash and corn from seed in the garden because they don't
transplant well. Put in trees, shrubs, perennials, herbs and ground covers.
It's OK to put down sod lawn, but too late to start a lawn from seed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  BEST BET;  Flower Power;  <PERSON>Tom Slowik</PERSON>, a professional landscape gardener who
favors flowers and mixed borders -- and uses organic techniques -- will
conduct a tour of his own garden as part of a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> presentation on growing
flowers at <ORGANIZATION>Common Ground</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>2225</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>El Camino Real</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. Donation: <MONEY>$7</MONEY>.
Pre-registration required. Information: (415) 328-6752.;  BEST BUY; Getting
Potted; Container plants in bloom are a smart buy because they can be left to
bloom in their own pots, or transplanted to the flower plot. You'll find a big
selection including hibiscus, <MONEY>$19</MONEY>, and roses, <MONEY>$12</MONEY>, in 5-gallon containers; and
azaleas, <MONEY>$5</MONEY> in 1-gallon containers.;  TECHNIQUE; Stock Answers; When setting
out containerized stock, fill the hole to the shoulder of the root ball, pack
the soil firmly and water. As soil settles, add more as needed to complete the
planting and water generously again. Use care in removing plants from
containers to avoid breaking the soil ball.;  YOUR CHECKLIST; (check) If an
outdoor planter has no drainage holes, add a layer of crushed stones equal to
one-quarter to one-fifth of the planter's depth; (check) To get the most
flowers, cut them regularly. Don't let them go to seed.; (check) Destroy all
leaves affected by peach-leaf curl or other diseases. Don't compost these
leaves or use them as mulch.; (check) Plant cactuses, succulents and palms.;
(check) If you fertilize cut flowers with a slow-release product, twice should
be enough -- once at planting time and again six to eight weeks later.;
(check) Start tuberous begonia bulbs in a sandy compost mixture in filtered
sun. Keep them well-watered.; (check) Replace lemons, limes, and other citrus
and avocado trees killed in the freeze.  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  Cover Story; Dorothy Kelly is a free-lance writer in Larkspur.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Until recently, the plant was rarely seen in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, except in a
botanical garden or two. This will soon change, however, if <PERSON>Demetrios
Kontaxis</PERSON>, a plant pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California's Cooperative
Extension</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Contra Costa County</LOCATION>, realizes his vision.;   Two summers ago, he
visited <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> to observe the caper in its natural
habitat. There he found the bush surviving on poor soil, among rocks and along
walls, seemingly unaffected by extreme heat and dryness.;   Kontaxis returned
from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with 56 pounds of caper seeds and later imported some cuttings as
well. Since then he has distributed more than 200 plants, 600 roots and
thousands of seeds to commercial farmers. "I'm convinced the caper will grow
quite well in this country," he says, "but whether it will become profitable
commercially remains to be seen. Meanwhile, it can be fun for the home
gardener to grow.";   Though the caper is mainly cultivated for its buds, it
makes a stunning ornamental as well. Buds develop into white, delicately
scented flowers up to three inches across, each with a long tassel of purple
stamens.;   Individual blossoms last only half a day, but the plant will bloom
continuously for four months. The shiny oval leaves are borne on long, arching
stems. Some varieties of caper have pairs of hooked spines; others are
spineless. Plants grow to be three to five feet tall and spread seven to 10
feet. The roots reach eight to 10 feet into the soil, making the plant ideal
for erosion control. It appears to be hardy to around 30 degrees Fahrenheit.; 
 According to <LOCATION>Kontaxis</LOCATION>, the easiest method for propagating capers is by root
cuttings. Seeds are more readily available but are difficult to germinate.
Kontaxis, however, has devised a technique he says has a 40 to <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT>
success rate. Immerse the seeds in a quart of warm water (110 degrees) and
leave them there; for at least 12 hours, allowing the water to cool. Then
drain and wrap the seeds in a moist bag and refrigerate for 65 to 70 days.;   
Remove and soak the seeds overnight in warm water before sowing them
one-quarter to one-half-inch deep in a flat or in six-inch pots containing a
well-drained potting medium. (Kontaxis recommends two parts soilless mix, one
part perlite and one part sand.) Water well and keep moist in a warm, sunny
place.;   Germination should start within three to four weeks but may take as
long as two to three months. When the seedlings are three to five inches tall,
Kontaxis carefully moves them to individual one-gallon containers, watering
them well and covering them with a plastic bag for one week to keep them
moist. After a week, he cuts off the top of the bag to gradually expose the
seedlings. After a year, he transplants them to a permanent, well-drained bed,
spacing them eight to 10 feet apart. He likes to prune plants 3 years or older
to the ground each <DATE>November</DATE> to encourage strong new growth.;   Caper plants
require little water or fertilizer once established and should begin to bear
within two or three years. Harvest the flower buds when they reach the size of
a small pea, and pickle them in a brine solution similar to that used for
cucumbers and olives. Kontaxis recommends the brine technique that has been
used in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> for generations: Place a whole raw egg in a
half-gallon of water and start adding salt. When the egg rises to the top,
you've got the right concentration to pickle your capers.; IFYOU'RE

<DESCRIPT>  GARDEN; PRODUCT; WINTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  EVER since I noticed the newspaper article on Dec. 20, 1981, it has been
sitting on my desk. The picture caught my eye; it was of a woman and her two
grandchildren, who, until she joined a community fuel cooperative, the story
said, had been living in a freezing cold house.;    What struck me about the
photo were the plants in the background. Lined up behind the family stood a
parlor palm, a Chinese evergreen and a pothos; none, considering their size
and rampant growth, newly acquired, yet flourishing despite an inhospitable
environment. I couldn't help wondering: Had the place really been so cold, or
are indoor plants more rugged than I was giving them credit for?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DARK-COLORED CONTAINERS KEEP IN THE HEAT
MANY INDOOR PLANTS CAN WEATHER THE COLD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Houseplants  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The picture returned to my thoughts the other night when my husband
complained that our sun room, where we sit and read after dinner, was too
chilly. Our plants don't seem to mind, I said, directing his attention to the
geraniums, miniature rose bush and orchid plant, all blooming extravagantly at
our large windows.;    With energy conservation and costs on everyone's minds
these days, especially in winter, I was curious to learn which plants can
survive at lower thermostat settings. For enlightenment, I visited the
conservatory in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Druid Hill Park</LOCATION> to consult with manager and
greenhouse supervisor <ORGANIZATION>Larry Ge</ORGANIZATION> Smith.;    Most house plants, he said, even
tropical varieties, do not need as much warmth as one might think.
Temperatures of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit are more to their liking. In the
<DATE>summer</DATE> heat, plants give off moisture to stay cool, waiting until nighttime
when conditions improve to grow.;    Under cooler and more uniform
temperatures, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said, plants do not grow as rapidly, and instead of
elongating, develop sturdier stems. In a cooler environment, too, plants do
not dry out as quickly and therefore do not need to be watered as often.;   
People fail to realize, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said, that the glass in a sunny window acts as a
magnifying glass, raising the heat level within the plant and also, in hitting
the container, increasing the soil temperature and making the roots
uncomfortable as well. Too much heat stresses a plant. Symptoms are dulling of
its vibrant color and possibly wilting.;    <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> advised moving plants back
or hanging a sheer drapery in front of the glass to reduce glare where the sun
is likely to beat down.;    Water plants in a cool room early in the day --
between <TIME>9 a.m. and 10 a.m.</TIME> -- to enable them to dry somewhat before night
falls. Plants standing in damp soil in a cold dark room may develop fungal
diseases that are brought on by these conditions.;    In a cool room, it can
be difficult to tell whether soil in a pot is moist or just cold and thus
needs water. To determine which is the case, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said, lay a brown paper
towel on top of the soil (he specifies brown because moisture stains on a
white background are less noticeable) and press for a minute or two to see
whether moisture is absorbed.;    In watering in a cool environment, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
said, use lukewarm water. Cold water lowers the soil temperature and shocks
the plant. Plants grow better in warmer soil, he said, citing as evidence the
growth that they produce outdoors in <DATE>spring</DATE> after soil temperatures begin to
moderate.;    Keeping plants in a cool room in dark-colored containers, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
said, also contributes to their well-being. Because dark hues absorb heat, the
soil will take longer to cool down at night. For plants resting on the floor
that prefer a toastier environment, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said that moving them to a shelf or
table top 4 to 5 feet high where the air is warmer (warm air rises) will put
them more at ease.;    Plugging in a heater is another way to make plants in a
chilly room feel more snug in winter. But do not set the heater on the floor,
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.;    There, it would heat the floor and not the plants. Instead,
elevate the heater to the same height as the plants and direct the heat away
from the foliage. During the day, open the curtains to let in sunshine.;    In
a cool environment, roots rot more readily, especially when soil remains
constantly wet. A sign that rot is occurring is shedding foliage. And because
the high humidity in winter is likely to cause fungal spores to germinate and
spread, indoor plants should not be misted, nor should they be set on trays
layered with pebbles and filled with water. By the same token, plants in a
cool room in winter have fewer insect problems.;    Plants that <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
recommends for a cool indoor environment include <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> island pine, holly
fern, dracaena, lady palm, clivia, calathea, peperomia, sansevieria,
aspidistra, dieffenbachia, cactus, orchid and oleander.  </TEXT>

WINDOW BOXES ADD COLOR

<TEXT>
<P>
Window boxes are something the British whip up exceptionally well. They brim 
with a kaleidoscope of color: lavender lobelia, red-and-white stripped 
petunias, pink pelargoniums, orange geraniums, magenta china asters, and, of 
course, sprigs of English ivy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you live on massive acreage or in a small apartment, window box 
dressing gives a special kind of gardening pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that there is no magic in creating your own showcase window 
box. All you need is a container, soil, a small variety of flowers and some 
foliage imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Simple containers are the most versatile; they blend with most architectural 
styles and don't detract from the plants growing inside. Neutral colors -- 
gray, beige, brown, natural wood, white -- are the best complements. 
</P>
<P>
Boxes are made of wood, metal, stone, fiberglass, plastic or clay. 
</P>
<P>
Wood -- either redwood, pine or cedar -- is the "traditional" choice for window 
boxes. A 24-inch-by-12-inch redwood box costs about <MONEY>$25</MONEY>. Redwood resists 
rotting and adds a touch of country. Painted white, it offers a traditional 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Clay boxes are romantic and whimsical. Italian terra cotta clay containers 
blend well with almost any floral selection. They can be bought or painted 
white for a dressier look. There is a new plastic window box that looks like 
clay. 
</P>
<P>
Metal and stone boxes are more modern and sleek. Exotic chiseled stone boxes 
are hard to find, difficult to maneuver and expensive -- but elegant. 
Fiberglass boxes are durable in hot and cold weather and are relatively 
inexpensive. One popular model sold by numerous mail-order garden-supply 
companies looks like white-painted wood. Fiberglass boxes are also easy to 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
Where to put your flower boxes? Find a spot where they can slip in easily -- 
fitting onto a windowsill or doorway ledge. If your windowsill is wide enough, 
a window box can simply rest upon it. Anchor the box with rocks in the back to 
make sure it does not slide or blow off the sill. If your window sill slopes 
forward, as many do, place wedges of wood under the front of the box to level 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Few tools are required for window box gardening. You will need a cultivator to 
aerate the soil and scratch in granular fertilizers, a watering can, a hand 
sprayer for misting and feeding, pruning shears for trimming shrubs and 
clipping dead flowers, a small trowel for digging planting holes and a dibble 
for planting seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Coloring your window box with flowers is where you get to be as wild or as 
timid as you wish. You can go neon-rainbow with bright, mixed color, or 
monochromatic for a serene color scheme. 
</P>
<P>
If you want soft harmony, plant analogous or related color schemes, those close 
to one another on the artist's color wheel, like pink and purple; red, orange 
and yellow; or pastels. White flowers or silver foliage can be added to lighten 
and brighten the effect. 
</P>
<P>
A monochromatic box idea would be to set pink chrysanthemums and rose 
pelargoniums inside English ivy. Or purple china asters, pink and white 
petunias and lavender lobelia. Try different shades of lobelia, from deep 
purple to palest lavender with impatiens in rose and light pink amid cascading 
Swedish ivy. 
</P>
<P>
The English cottage garden look requires more contrasting color. Let your 
imagination run riot with polychromatic color schemes. The appeal of window box 
gardening is that you can rarely make a bad choice with too much color. 
</P>
<P>
Red petunias, yellow marigolds, pink pelargoniums, blue china asters, white 
nasturtiums, lavender lobelia, stripped sweet <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>, scarlet snapdragons -- 
or any combination of color -- gives a window box a charming 
"the-more-the-merrier-look." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite window box sat outside my dorm room in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> -- a white wood box 
filled with lavender, pink and red lobelia, Swedish and English ivy, scarlet 
impatiens, rose and pink geraniums, red wax begonias, white petunias and sweet 
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>. How do I remember it so well? Some memories you carry with you like a 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
When making your plant choices, consider the plants' height and width since a 
good mixture makes for a more pleasing box. 
</P>
<P>
Dip your hand into some unusual plants. For height, experiment with 
lavender-blue catmints, white candytufts, wish-bone flowers (lavender flowers 
with deep purple markings and a yellow spot), rosy speedwell or sapphire 
flowers (good for front-of-window boxes). For width, try Kolomikta vine (leaves 
splashed with pink and white), dusty miller, silver-lace (lacy silver foliage), 
love-in-a-mist, snow-on-the-mountain (white-edged green leaves) or lovingstone 
daisy (neon-like colors). 
</P>
<P>
There are three options for putting plants in window boxes. You can plant 
directly in the boxes, plant removable liners that fit inside the boxes, or 
plant in individual pots sunk into peat moss inside the boxes. Regardless of 
the method you use, every box and liner need drainage holes in the bottom. In 
stone trough containers in which you cannot drill drainage holes, put a layer 
of gravel in the bottom of the box to improve drainage. 
</P>
<P>
Soil mixes for window boxes are the same as those for your houseplants and 
other outdoor containers. Start with packaged potting soil and mix it with a 
source of organic matter -- compost that you have crumbled into small pieces or 
pressed through a sieve, peat moss or leaf mold. To lighten the soil's texture, 
add some vermiculite, perlite or builder's sand. A good all-purpose formula is 
three parts soil; two parts compost, leaf mold or peat moss; and one part 
vermiculite, perlite or sand. If you are growing flowers from bulbs, add some 
bone meal for extra phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
When planting, leave enough space between plants to allow them to grow to their 
full size. Many people make the mistake of crowding the roots during planting. 
</P>
<P>
If you are transplanting, dig holes large enough to accommodate all the roots. 
Set the transplants at the same depth they were growing in their previous flat. 
Leave the soil level about an inch below the top of each box, to allow room for 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
Window boxes need regular fertilizing and watering. In hot, dry weather, water 
once or twice a day, whenever the soil feels dry an inch or two below the 
surface. Make sure the soil is moistened all the way through and all the roots 
receive water. 
</P>
<P>
Window boxes are not just for flowers. Herbs such as dill, garlic, chives, 
thyme, sage, basil and parsley can be grown in these rectangles. For a little 
lettuce crop, plant the romaine cultivar "little gem," and small-rooted carrots 
such as "little finger" are successful in a box. 
</P>
<P>
The grandest thing about window boxes? For the little amount of time and effort 
you expend on them, they'll bring sparkle to your garden, and hours of pleasure 
each time you peek outside your window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A WINDOW BOX SAMPLER 
</P>
<P>
Selecting the flowers to fill a window box requires consideration of color, 
height, width and design scheme. A monochromatic color scheme would use flowers 
with similar colors, like pink chrysanthemums and rose pelargoniums. A 
polychromatic scheme mixes a combination of color, like red petunias, yellow 
marigolds, pink pelargoniums, blue china asters, white nasturtiums, lavender 
lobelia, stripped sweet <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> and scarlet snapdragons. 
</P>
<P>
A good mixture of height and width adds to the appearance of a flower box. The 
rule of thumb: Plants such as pelargoniums, geraniums, china asters, 
snapdragons add height. Lobelia, phlox, impatiens, petunias add width and 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of plant choices: 
</P>
<P>
Ageratum: Flat, fuzzy clusters of violet-blue flowers cover this foot-tall 
plant, which can be used as a good filler. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssum: It grows in low mounds of white, pinkish purple or dark purple 
flowers. Dwarf kinds are dense and stay under 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Aster: Growing to various sizes, flowers come in white or shades of blue, red, 
pink, lavender or purple, mostly with yellow centers. 
</P>
<P>
Begonia: Planted for texture, the multicolored foliage has saucer-size flowers 
and/or lacy clusters of smaller flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Cabbage, flowering: It is used for its highly ornamental, highly colored leaf 
rosettes that look like giant peonies in deep blue green marbled and edged with 
white, cream, rose or purple. 
</P>
<P>
Calendula: Besides familiar orange and bright yellow double, daisylike 
blossoms, there are more subtle shades of apricot, cream and soft yellow. The 
leaves are aromatic leaves and they grow one to two feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Candytuft: Low-growing mounts of narrow, deep green leaves are completely 
obscured by short spikes of white flowers in <DATE>spring</DATE> and early <DATE>summer</DATE>. Snowflake 
is an especially dense variety. A good filler among taller perennials, most 
grow a foot tall or less. 
</P>
<P>
Catmint: Soft, gray green, undulating mounds of lavender-blue flowers grow to 
two feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Celosia: There are two kinds, crested cockscomb with bizarre, contorted flower 
heads, and plume celosia with feathery plumes. There are varieties of each that 
grow from 1 to 3 feet tall and both come in outrageous shades of yellow, 
orange, gold and crimson. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysanthemum: Available in many flower forms, plant and flower sizes, they 
also come in a variety of colors including pink, white butter, yellow, red, 
orange, bronze, purple, lavender and multicolors. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlia: Miniatures stay under 1 1/2 feet and offer superb shades of yellow, 
orange, red, pink and white. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty miller: A coarse plant with distinctively cut gray leaves and pale yellow 
flowers, it grows to two feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Fuchsia: This popular, showy flowered plant comes in hundreds of varieties and 
colors. The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> fuchsia spreads to form loose stands of 2-foot flower 
spikes splattered with red in late <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Geranium: Not to be confused with pelargoniums, geraniums have snowflake leaves 
with deep purple, bright pink or blue flowers that grow from under a foot to 2 
feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Gerbera: These South African plants produce huge daisylike flowers in deep, 
warm shades of yellow, orange, red and pink. Clumps of dark green foliage stay 
under a foot tall. 
</P>
<P>
Golden fleece: A very dainty daisy flower with fine, threadlike foliage and 
soft, chamois-colored blossoms, it never grows taller than a foot. 
</P>
<P>
Impatiens: A varied group of striking bright flowers comes in a bewildering 
variety of colors from scarlet and deep purple to stripes or splashes of color 
mixes. Single-flowered kinds cover themselves neatly with a mass of flowers; 
doubles have attractive flowers like little rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
Love-in-a-mist: A pretty flower with thorny-looking leaves, it grows 20 inches 
tall, 12 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
Lobelia: Six-inch-tall plants, often with dark reddish foliage and bright blue 
to violet flowers, it is a good filler that contrasts nicely with <DATE>summer</DATE>'s many 
golden flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Marigold: The tiniest are the 8- to 10-inch signet marigolds that have almost 
ferny foliage and delicate little flowers in vivid yellow, orange or crimson. 
The mid-sized French marigolds come in single or double flowered forms, in 
yellow, orange and crimson, often marked with maroon. All are neat and tidy and 
low-growing, 8 to 14 inches tall. The taller American or African marigolds grow 
1 1/2 to 3 feet tall with the biggest flowers on sturdy stems. Most are shades 
of yellow or orange. 
</P>
<P>
Nemesia: These foot-tall plants are covered with yellow, orange or red flowers, 
and just about every shade in between. 
</P>
<P>
Pansy: Dark contrasting markings bloom in shades of blue, purple, yellow, 
maroon and apricot. 
</P>
<P>
Petunia: Best grown early in the season before <DATE>summer</DATE>'s heat and smog descend, 
there are single- and double-flowered forms. Grandifloras have large flowers 
and multifloras have more, smaller flowers and a neater appearance. Both come 
in shades of pink, red, salmon, purple, white and even pale yellow. All are 
under a foot tall. 
</P>
<P>
Portulaca: These low-spreading succulent plants have brilliant, shimmering 
flowers in shades of yellow, orange, red, cerise, coral and white. 
</P>
<P>
Salvia: Some new introductions from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> have shocking red or deep 
purple flowers and grow to three or four feet. 
</P>
<P>
Snapdragon: Available in an array of heights, types and colors, they grow from 
6 inches tall to 3 or 4 feet, in every color but blue and some that don't 
"snap." 
</P>
<P>
Speedwell: There are many kinds, and most have graceful blue spikes and grow no 
more than 2 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Stock: In muted lavender, pink and white, the flowers are sweetly scented on 1- 
to 2-foot-tall plants with grayish foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet William: These foot-tall carnation relatives have a decidedly 
old-fashioned look, with big clusters of flowers in shades of red, rose, pink 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
Verbena: These low-spreading plants have rounded clusters of white, pink, red 
or violet flowers and grow under a foot tall. 
</P>
<P>
Zinnia: The brightest of <DATE>summer</DATE> flowers, zinnias come in many sizes, forms and 
colors. The newest are dwarfs, most notably the foot-tall <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> Pan series, 
though there are zinnias even smaller. Tall zinnias reach about two feet tall. 
There are giant double types (the best known), giant tetra types (dahlialike 
flowers), and giant cactus types (lots of narrow, pointed petals). All come in 
brilliant shades.

<LEADPARA>  Q I have some acorns and I have visions of towering oaks. Is there any special
way to plant them? I don't even know which end should be facing upward.;    --
J.S., San Jose  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TOWERING OAK STARTS WITH ACORN PLANTED ON
ITS SIDE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mailbag  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A For best results the acorns should be picked from the tree. Those that have
fallen tend to dry out. Choose shiny big ones free of worm holes. If they have
been collected from the ground, soak them in a pail of water for 24 hours, and
discard those that float as they are diseased or have worms.;    You can store
the acorns in Zip-lock bags in the refrigerator until early <DATE>March</DATE>, the time to
plant them. Plant the acorns one inch deep and on their side. This solves the
problem about which end is up. If a new white root has started while in
storage, plant the acorn so the root is pointed down. Water the young oaks
that grow several times the first summer.;    Q Have you ever heard of a group
called Plant Amnesty? Do you know what they advocate? A friend mentioned the
group is involved with trees in some way.;    -- <PERSON>J. W.</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Morgan Hill</LOCATION>; A Plant
Amnesty is a liberation group dedicated to freeing trees and shrubs from the
mutilation of poor pruning practices. The group publishes a newsletter six
times a year. Dues are <MONEY>$10</MONEY>. For information, write them in care of <PERSON>Cass
Turnbull</PERSON>, 906 <ORGANIZATION>N.W. 87th St.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION> 98117.;    Q We planted a seed
lawn five years ago. Before that, there were a lot tree stumps, so we ground
them down and tilled in the chips. Now there appears to be sunken places where
the stumps have rotted and decomposed. Is there any way to fill in these
valleys without a major project? Can we throw dirt on top of the lawn to fill
in the valleys?;    -- <LOCATION>J.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>; A A modification of an old trick used on
golf course putting greens would do the trick. Make a mix of mostly sand and
some soil. Spread it into the low spots, leaving some grass still visible. You
should add no more than one-half inch because you don't want to cover the
grass and kill it. Grass will grow through if there is enough of the leaf
surface showing.;    You can tie a rope to each end of a heavy section of
2-by-12 and use this as a "float" to spread the mix and fill in the valleys.
When the grass grows through the mix and is cutting height add more of the
mix. Repeat the process of adding mix and letting the grass grow through until
the lawn is as flat as a billiard table.;    It really doesn't take that long
in the peak grass growing season to bring a lawn back to grade.;    Q I
brought my Christmas cactus inside before the freeze. It had been outside in
<DATE>summer</DATE> and was full of buds. Quite a few bloomed but the others dried up. What
can I do with it?;    -- <LOCATION>L.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    A Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera
bridgesii or Zygocactus truncatus) are old favorites that were brought to us
from the jungle where they often grow in trees. They need constant moisture
but not soggy soil and lots of food. Keep the soil moist and feed the plant
every week or so. Use a liquid fertilizer especially designed for
houseplants.;    To ensure bloom at the holiday season keep the plant in a
place with cool night temperatures and in complete darkness 12 to 14 hours per
day during the month of <DATE>November</DATE>. You will be rewarded with a profusion of
beautiful rosy-red flowers.;    Q I have leaf rollers on my violets. Can I cut
off those leaves and put them in the compost pile or should I spray them
first? I am saving leaves in plastic bags to use for mulch in <DATE>summer.</DATE>;    --
<LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>;    A Putting leaves into a properly cared for and maintained
compost heap should take care of the bugs and their eggs. A compost heap, when
it is "working," generates a lot of heat.;    Temperatures may reach 160
degrees and this will kill most insects, their eggs and most diseases
affecting plants. So if you have a good compost pile toss in your violet
leaves.;    Many people are reluctant to use sprays for fear of personal harm
or damage to the environment. Mailbag suggests that you consider using
insecticidal soap. If you have hard water add a dash of White King water
softener to the sprayer. Hard water limits the effectiveness of insecticidal
soap. This soap spray must contact the insect to be effective but you can use
it on any plant and as often as needed to kill unwanted insects.  </TEXT>

LUMMIS GARDEN BLOOMS FOR OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Time for a bit of horticultural free-associating. 
</P>
<P>
What do you think of when you hear the words water-conserving plants? 
</P>
<P>
Cactuses? Succulents? A sandy, austere and generally grayish landscape? 
</P>
<P>
If so, you are not alone. And the <ORGANIZATION>Historical Society of Southern California</ORGANIZATION> has 
a surprise for you. 
</P>
<P>
Its newly completed water-conserving garden, outside the <PERSON>Charles F. Lummis Home</PERSON> 
in <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION>, is lush with shoulder-to-shoulder greenery, blossoms of many 
hues and even a lawn of sorts. The garden, designed by landscape architect <PERSON>Bob 
Perry</PERSON>, will be the featured attraction at the society's third annual <ORGANIZATION>Lummis 
Garden Open House</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from 10 a.m. to <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Green Despite Heat 
</P>
<P>
"This garden in the middle of <DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September</DATE>, when it's really hot, still 
looks green and pretty," says <PERSON>Suzie Chamberlain</PERSON>, coordinator of garden 
volunteers. It demonstrates, she says, the number and variety of attractive 
blooming plants that are drought- tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
Begin at the gate -- recently moved down <LOCATION>Carlota Boulevard</LOCATION> so visitors must 
walk through the garden -- and you'll see the subdued colors of the Mexican 
sage up against the shock of orange that is the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> poppy. At their feet 
are delicate baby blue eyes, another spring-blooming <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> native. 
</P>
<P>
And that "lawn" in the center is actually dwarf pink yarrow (<LOCATION>Achillea</LOCATION> 
millefolium). Grown from seed, it can exist on a mere 15 minutes a week of 
<DATE>summer</DATE> watering and needs no watering in the <DATE>winter</DATE>. Left to its own, the 
yarrow would grow spiky pink flowers up to about 2 feet in height, but 
infrequent mowing can keep it down as a grass substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a surface you could walk on, sit on and, because the 
garden is cared for by volunteers, not have to mow on a regular basis," 
<PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Non-Native Plants Too 
</P>
<P>
Though the garden contains a number of plants native to this area, it also 
includes species that originate in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> 
-- "places with a climate like ours, with a long dry spell every year," says 
<PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-minute-a-week watering standard holds for the entire 1.8-acre garden. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to the usual flower-bed color provided by thirsty pansies, 
marigolds and impatiens, the Lummis Home garden offers herbs (rosemary, sage, 
thyme, lavender), poppies (such as the hardy, 5-foot-tall matilija poppy) and 
easily sown wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
Deceptively fragile-looking <DATE>spring</DATE> flowers adorn the abuse-tolerant rockrose, a 
low-growing shrub that can stand up to salt spray, frost, scorching heat and 
poor dry soil. "<LOCATION>Carmel</LOCATION> Sur" manzanita, <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> says, could take the place 
of ivy as a border planting. 
</P>
<P>
For shade, consider the Western sycamore tree, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> holly (or toyon), 
the yellow-flowered sweet acacia or the singleleaf pinon pine. 
</P>
<P>
Bulbs and even ferns also are represented in the water-conserving garden. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the species in the garden can be found at or ordered through retail 
nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drip-Irrigation System 
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the garden is the recently completed drip-irrigation system. 
Such a setup, <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> explains, can apply precious water right where it is 
needed, with virtually no evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Simple to install, the system involves plastic tubes laid on the ground and 
covered with mulch. It is practical for plants widely separated, but not for 
those crowded together as in, say, ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s open house celebrates completion of the 3-year project to redesign the 
major garden area. The effort was financed largely by donations from the <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Water District</ORGANIZATION>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor <PERSON>Tom Bradley</PERSON> is scheduled to speak at the open house at <TIME>1:30 p.m</TIME>. The 
event also will include tours led by botanists and naturalists, sale of 
hard-to-find plants and seeds, free refreshments and sale of books on gardening 
and local history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lummis Home 
</P>
<P>
The Lummis Home, called <PERSON>El Alisal</PERSON> (the Place of the Sycamore), is itself a 
chapter in <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION> history. With its rough-cut beams and granite boulders, 
the structure was built on the west bank of the <LOCATION>Arroyo Seco</LOCATION> around the turn of 
the century by <PERSON>Charles Fletcher Lummis</PERSON>, who, having walked from <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> in 
143 days, burst onto the local scene in <DATE>1885</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Enchanted by the Spanish roots of Southwestern culture, <PERSON>Lummis</PERSON> laid the stones 
himself for the house that became a museum of the <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> and a Spanish 
fantasy. A scholar, journalist, social activist and rabid <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> 
booster, the eccentric Lummis surrounded himself with artists and writers at 
Saturday-night soirees in <LOCATION>El Alisal</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although today it is headquarters of the historical society, visitors <DATE>Sunday</DATE> 
will see a house that has been largely preserved as <LOCATION>Lummis</LOCATION> knew it. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Lummis</PERSON> home is at 200 E. Avenue 43, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, just off the <LOCATION>Pasadena 
Freeway</LOCATION>. Admission to the event is free. Information: (213) 222-0546.

<HEAD>Cacti Part of Life on Wagon Train</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMBLEM, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old boy riding with the <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train</ORGANIZATION> fell face down in a cactus patch, one of the
hazards facing the modern-day pioneers on their month-long trek.
   It took a nurse roughly two hours <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to pluck most of the
cactus needles from the boy, said <PERSON>B.J. Wertz</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the
wagon train.
   ``He was running and he fell into cactus,'' she said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
``His whole upper body was covered.''
   Despite the painful experience, the boy ``was a little trooper.
Not one tear,'' <PERSON>Wertz</PERSON> said.
   Cacti are a common hazard on the <ORGANIZATION>Jim Bridger Trail</ORGANIZATION>, which the
wagon train is traversing. The travelers have been using shovels to
clear away the plants from sleeping areas each night.
   The wagon train left Casper on <DATE>June 2</DATE> to celebrate <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>'s
centennial by covering 260 miles of the trail. By <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, it had
covered about 215 miles.
   On <DATE>July 2</DATE>, the 78 wagons and 364 riders are scheduled to
conclude the trek by rolling into Cody.

GARDENING Q&amp;A: ROSE PETALS FOR SALAD CAN BE HOME-GROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: In the produce section of my grocery, I saw an expensive package of 
flower petals -- including roses -- for use in salads. Can I use roses from my 
own garden in salads? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: If you don't apply pesticides, by all means use your rose petals in 
salads. A stunning opener to a meal is rose petal salad, consisting of endive, 
rose petals and toasted pine nuts served with a garnish of slivered limestone 
lettuce and dressed with raspberry vinaigrette.

Bird of <ORGANIZATION>Paradise</ORGANIZATION>'s Place in the Sun 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the best location for a bird of paradise plant? Does it require an 
area where it will receive sun all-day long? 
</P>
<P>
A: A bird of paradise needs full sun in our beach areas; however, in the warmer 
inland valleys, it does best in partial or filtered sunlight.

<P>
Are Earthworms Good for Potted Plants? 
</P>
<P>
Q: If earthworms are good for the soil, are they also beneficial in my potted 
plants? 
</P>
<P>
A: Earthworms enrich the soil with their castings, and their burrowing assists 
in aerating and draining soil. But some people consider them a nuisance in 
lawns and in pots. If you have an excessive number, consider a commercial worm 
killer (available at some garden centers). In my own pots, I've noticed 
earthworms in the soil, but they don't seem to create any problem.

<P>
Using Less Fertilizer May Be Solution 
</P>
<P>
Q: Using rabbit droppings has increased leaf size and the size of plants but at 
the expense of flowers and crops. What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to an old copy of the <ORGANIZATION>Western Fertilizer Handbook</ORGANIZATION>, rabbit pellets 
or manure contains <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> nitrgen, <PERCENT>1.3%</PERCENT> phosphorous and <PERCENT>1.2%</PERCENT> potassium. If it were 
sold as a fertilizer it would say 2-1-1 on the label. That would make it a mild 
and balanced fertilizer but too much of anything is not a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of growth at the expense of flowers and fruit is simply too much 
fertilizer, nitrogen in particular. Simply use less, and give your extra to a 
neighbor who should be thrilled to get such a good fertilizer for free.

<P>
Excess Nitrogen</ORGANIZATION> Can Harm Epihyllums 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a small collection of epiphyllums and have always used <ORGANIZATION>Cactus Pete</ORGANIZATION>'s 
fertilizer on them. Now that he has retired, what is an appropriate fertilizer? 
The Sunset Western Garden Book indicates "low nitrogen." Do they mean low or 
no? 
</P>
<P>
A: Excess nitrogen can can cause small round areas of rot that later callous 
and become hard, but the orchid cacti do need nitrogen, so the answer is "low.' 
Use any houseplant fertilizer where the second two numbers on the label are 
larger than the first, such as 5-10-10. 
</P>
<P>
That first number is the nitrogen content. Fertilizers formulated this way are 
usually sold as promoting flowering so that information on the label is the 
tip-off. Also, use the fertilizer half-stregth, since epiphyllums are not heavy 
feeders. -- <ORGANIZATION>R.S. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Rotation May Help Boost Vegetable Yield</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
Q: Perhaps you can help me with a puzzling problem. I have planted a vegetable 
garden each <DATE>spring</DATE> for the last five or six years, however now the yield is way 
down, even though the plants are lush and green. I add amendments and 
fertilizer each time I replant, so what am I doing wrong? We live in a canyon 
area where sun is scant -- a maximum of about five hours per day. 
</P>
<P>
A: The problem could be not enough sun. Perhaps the trees have grown taller 
during the last six years. Too little sun would certainly cause plants to grow 
lush, but fruit poorly. You also might try fertilizing less, since that also 
promotes leafy greens at the expense of fruit, unless you are growing leafy 
greens of course. 
</P>
<P>
You might also try crop rotation. Many plants shouldn't be grown in the same 
spot year after year. This is even true of flowers, such as delphiniums. 
Harmful soil organisms build up in the soil where the plants grow, but moving 
them leaves these organisms behind. Put the tomatoes where the lettuce was, the 
lettuce where you grew carrots before and so on. -- <PERSON>R.S.

Espalier</PERSON> Planting at Long, <ORGANIZATION>Blank Wall</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
Q: We just moved into a newly constructed home that has a long, blank wall near 
the entry with only a foot of planting space. What can I grow in this space 
that will look attractive year round? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why not espalier a plant on a trellis or on plastic-coated wire in the 
European fashion? Some good shrubs for training are pyracantha, Parney 
cotoneaster, xylosma, photinia, <PERSON>Burford</PERSON> holly, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> holly, and twisted 
juniper. In European gardens, fruit trees like apple, pear and peach are the 
usual espalier subjects.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the <ORGANIZATION>California Assn. of 
Nurserymen</ORGANIZATION> on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
 For a late show of color, plant petunias, marigolds, zinnias and lobelia. 
</P>
<P>
Water roses well during hot weather and mulch to help soil retain moisture. 
Fertilize now if you want blooms into and through the <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Continue to mow the lawn at a high level. It helps keep the roots cool. 
</P>

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riding in a golf cart isn't the only way to enjoy the outdoors in this desert 
resort town. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can saddle up for leisurely horseback trips on trails that wind 
through unspoiled landscape to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most magnificent palm oases. 
</P>
<P>
Although <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>' rustic dude ranches have been replaced by golf courses 
and luxurious hotels, Smoke Tree Stables still keeps a corral of horses near 
the pristine Agua Caliente Indian canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree is the last public stable in <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>. Would-be cowboys and 
cowgirls have been renting horses there since <DATE>1929</DATE>, and city fathers recently 
gave owner <PERSON>Rod Johnson</PERSON> permission to keep his stable open for at least 10 more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Horse Trails 
</P>
<P>
The area has about 135 miles of horse trails that offer visitors close views of 
desert plants and wildlife. Hourlong rides go through mostly dry <LOCATION>Palm Canyon 
Wash</LOCATION> at the base of <ORGANIZATION>Smoke Tree Mountains</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But longer and more interesting outings lead to streams and shady palm groves 
in remote Andreas, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> and Palm canyons. You can stay in the saddle for two 
or four hours on the canyon rides, all guided by wranglers from the stable. 
</P>
<P>
To get to <ORGANIZATION>Smoke Tree</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, drive east on Interstate 10 to the <LOCATION>Palm 
Springs</LOCATION> turnoff, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 111. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the highway (also called <ORGANIZATION>Palm Canyon Drive</ORGANIZATION>) south through town. Soon 
after it swings east, turn right at Sunrise Way. Take La Verne Way and then go 
left on <LOCATION>Toledo Avenue</LOCATION> to the stable entrance at No. 2500, where the street 
meets <ORGANIZATION>Murray Canyon Drive</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
(Don't turn in at <ORGANIZATION>Smoke Tree Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, a residential development.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riders of <ORGANIZATION>All Ages 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree Stables</ORGANIZATION> welcomes riders of all ages. Parents can ride with a small 
child in the same saddle. Hours are <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> until dusk. One-hour rides are 
offered on the hour for <MONEY>$15</MONEY>; no reservations required. 
</P>
<P>
More popular are the two-hour trips to Andreas Canyon that depart at <TIME>8 a.m. and 
10 a.m.</TIME> and at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> and <TIME>3 p.m</TIME>. They cost <MONEY>$33.50</MONEY>, including the equestrian 
entry fee to the Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the experience and desire of the riders the horses will walk, trot 
or lope along the trail at the command of the wrangler who guides the trip. 
</P>
<P>
From the stable the path enters a sandy wash between <ORGANIZATION>Smoke Tree Mountain</ORGANIZATION> and a 
flood-control dike bordering the <ORGANIZATION>Canyon Country Club</ORGANIZATION> golf course. Then it 
narrows and crosses a couple of streams that carry the runoff of melted snow 
from higher elevations before entering <ORGANIZATION>Agua Caliente</ORGANIZATION> tribal land. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping at a booth to pay the admission fee, the wrangler leads horses 
and riders through a landscape of palo verde trees, creosote bush, jumping 
cholla and other cactus. Willow leaves rustle in the desert breeze and birds 
flit from their hiding places at the sound of hoofs striking rocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Canyons 
</P>
<P>
The trail twists toward a canyon of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> fan palms, botanically named 
Washingtonia filifera in honor of the first President. Many have survived for 
several centuries, including some with blackened trunks from a fire in <DATE>1980</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The horses usually pause to drink from an icy stream that nourishes the oasis 
of palms, cottonwoods, sycamores and thick undergrowth. There's not much time 
to linger before heading back to the stable, but you may find Indian caves and 
grinding rocks near the picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
On a four-hour horseback excursion to <ORGANIZATION>Murray Canyon</ORGANIZATION>, another oasis on Indian 
land, riders can dismount for a bring-your-own picnic lunch among the palms. An 
option is to forgo lunch and continue on a longer trail that circles back to 
the stable. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Murray Canyon</ORGANIZATION> trip must be arranged in advance and requires four or more 
riders. It costs <MONEY>$63.50</MONEY> each, including admission to the reservation. For the 
same price, horsemen can mount up with a wrangler for a four-hour outing to 
Palm Canyon, the area's largest palm oasis. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> trail rides, call Smoke Tree Stables at 
(619) 327-1372. 
</P>
<P>
Before or after your equestrian adventure, take an even closer look at desert 
plant life by visiting <ORGANIZATION>Moorten Botanical Garden</ORGANIZATION>. This is the 50th anniversary 
of a remarkable collection of desert plants that has grown to 3,000 varieties. 
</P>
<P>
From the stables, follow <ORGANIZATION>Murray Canyon Road</ORGANIZATION> west to <ORGANIZATION>South Palm Canyon Drive</ORGANIZATION>, 
then turn right (north) to No. 1701. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pat Moorten</PERSON> and her late husband, known as Cactus Slim, established the garden 
around their home as a result of botanical and geological expeditions that 
began in the <DATE>1930s</DATE>. They collected plants locally, in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A walk around the grounds is like a world tour, with specimens from a Baja 
boojum to an African thorn tree. Especially fascinating in the enclosed 
"cactarium" are plants with names such as "Snowball," "Old Man's Whiskers," 
"Mink Tail" and "Devil's Fingers." 
</P>
<P>
The thick vegetation has turned the property into a bird sanctuary, especially 
for about 200 mourning doves. Also look for the white temple doves from <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> 
that are part of wedding ceremonies held frequently at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Pat and her son, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, welcome visitors every day. Admission costs <MONEY>$1.50</MONEY> and 
includes a map for an informal tour of the grounds. The garden opens at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME>, 
<DATE>Sundays</DATE> at <TIME>10 a.m</TIME>. Some of the <ORGANIZATION>Moorten</ORGANIZATION>'s home-raised cactus plants are for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks north is <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 111, which you can rejoin to reach Interstate 10 
for the trip back to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> is 230 miles.

<LEADPARA>  ARE your plants alive -- or dead? There's no way to tell right now.;   
(check) Roses: They're hardy and, luckily, fully dormant right now, so there
should be no frost damage as long as they are well-watered. Do dormant rose
pruning this month.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GARDENERS ASK: WHAT ABOUT MY PLANTS?  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     (check) Jade: No matter how bad they look, leave them alone because if you
cut them to the ground now you'll lose them for sure. Cut damaged parts when
new growth begins.;    (check) Cactus: There is hope for larger cactus if the
main part is still alive. If it looks like there might be life left, cover it
with burlap or other cloth. Most small cactuses are gone, unless they were
sheltered.;    (check) Agapanthus, ferns, low-growing perennials: Although
foliage is badly damaged, the roots should be OK. Let the foliage flop over
because this insulates roots from further freezing. Cut out damaged foliage
when new growth begins.;    (check) Bedding annuals: Because they're fast
growing, most already have begun to put out new growth. Give them a good
watering. They'll need protection from further frost.;    (check) Vegetables:
Most winter vegetables actually taste better after a good frost. Burned leaves
are common, but that won't hurt the vegetables. Water everything well.;   
(check) Citrus, avocados: When growth begins, cut away the parts that look
dead. If a shoot has dead wood on part of it, but is healthy otherwise, don't
keep it. With the tree thinned out, you'll have a good chance of getting more
fruit, but expect a small crop for the next few years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Texas farmers burned the thorns off cactus to provide emergency
cattle feed in a drought called the worst in a half-century, while
growers in the <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> bemoaned <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s scattered showers as
little more than tantalizing.
   ``It's going to help a few farmers, but for most farmers it's
too little too late,'' said <PERSON>Dan Bowman</PERSON>, a meteorologist for
<ORGANIZATION>WeatherData</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Wichita</LOCATION>, after some <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> communities got more than
2 inches of rain and <PERSON>Joplin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION>, got 1{ inches <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
   Drought has plagued the nation's midsection, where it's as dry
as it's been since the Dust Bowl, and the Southeast, forcing
farmers to sell off cattle they can't afford to feed and to plow
under shriveled crops. The <DATE>June</DATE> shortfall of rainfollows a dry
<DATE>winter</DATE> and a parched <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s showers, said <PERSON>Herb Kinnear</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana Farm
Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, were ``just enough to settle the dust. But it's keeping the
sun from shining and baking things. That's one consolation.''
   Another consolation was an additional <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in emergency
state loans for up to 45,000 Hoosier farmers.
   Elsewhere, barges along the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> were stranded at
low-water bottlenecks, fires were on the rise in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, and ginseng growers in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> were discovering that
even they were suffering, although the exotic root thrives on arid
soil.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> appointed an interagency
committee to deal with the widespread drought.
   Texas ranchers in the <LOCATION>Lower Rio Grande Valley</LOCATION> are using propane
burners to remove thorns from prickly pear cactus to allow cattle
to graze on the water-retaining plants, said <PERSON>Kraig Gallimore</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>'s farmer assistance program.
   However, the drought has struck so deep in some areas that
ranchers have stopped the practice because even cactus is
shriveling, he said.
   In <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> said was
hit hardest, an agricultural economist predicted losses from three
major crops could total <MONEY>$2.7 billion</MONEY> this year.
   The estimate accounts for losses in federal deficiency payments
and turnover of the money in the economy, but not ``for the losses
we'll likely have on crops other than wheat, barley and oats,''
said <PERSON>Arlen Leholm</PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION>North Dakota State University</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bill Lytle</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> climatologist, said the state
normally gets 3-4 inches of rain in <DATE>June</DATE> and this year has only
received 0.3 inches so far for the month.
   ``It's worse than <DATE>'76</DATE>. I think it goes back to <DATE>'34</DATE>,'' said
<PERSON>Lytle</PERSON>, who blamed the drought on a large high-pressure ridge that
is diverting low-pressure storm systems north into <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Because
the system covers most of the nation's midsection, it's likely to
persist for some time, he said.
   Firmin Rettinghauf, 72, whose three sons farm his land near
<LOCATION>Gilbertville</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>northeast Iowa</LOCATION>, walked through his parched fields
and proclaimed: ``There ain't gonna be no crops. It's the worst
I've seen since <DATE>'36</DATE>.''
   In southwest <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, cattle farmers continued selling off herds as
pastures baked in the sun and feed prices skyrocketed.
   ``The man in the cow business is having to sell his factory, is
what it amounts to,'' said <PERSON>Gary Schwab</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>Lamoni</LOCATION> Livestock
Sales barn is reporting cattle sales <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> higher than a year
ago. ``I'd rather take a beating than talk to a man about selling
his herd.''
   Two convenience store owners in <LOCATION>Walford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, decided that if
farmers were going to take a loss, they would, too.
   The owners said their sign advertising ``Ice cream cones, <MONEY>25
cents</MONEY>, until it rains'' will stay up until the area gets a
drenching. Cones normally sell for <MONEY>40 cents</MONEY>.
   Dropping water levels in the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> rivers made
the waterways unnavigable <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, hurting the inland shipping
industry.
   A seven-mile stretch of the <LOCATION>Ohio River</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Mound City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>,
remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow
channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded.
   Meanwhile, nearly 700 barges in the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> were tied
up north and south of the <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, bridge because the
river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began
keeping records in <DATE>1872</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> reported an increase in forest fires due to
abnormally dry conditions.
   Hundreds of fires have broken out in the parched Ozark hills in
recent months, and <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> officials say it is the worst fire year
since the <DATE>1940s</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Mark Twain National Forest</ORGANIZATION>.
   The forest has seen 260 fires blacken 13,600 acres so far this
year, said <PERSON>Bob Willis</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION>Rolla</LOCATION>.
In an average year, 5,000 to 6,000 acres are burned, he said.
   More than 3,200 acres of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> forest land have been damaged
so far in <DATE>June</DATE>, exceeding a five-year average for the entire month,
said <PERSON>Bob Burns</PERSON>, a member of the fire control staff at <ORGANIZATION>Forestry
Commission Headquarters</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Macon</LOCATION>.
   Wisconsin ginseng growers, normally plagued by excess moisture,
said even they were thinking about irrigation.
   ``It's good news to be dry but it's no good to be a desert,''
said <PERSON>Lyn Heise</PERSON>, 51, who grows about 10 acres of the medicinal root
near <LOCATION>Wausau</LOCATION>. ``We like it much drier than the regular farmers who
grow corn or soybeans, but even for us it's going too long.''

SUCCULENTS PROVIDE BRILLIANT COLOR DURING THE COLDEST MONTHS, USUALLY THE

WHEN THE garden is most bleak -- in <DATE>December</DATE>, <DATE>January</DATE> and <DATE>February</DATE> -- many 
succulents burst into flower or turn shades of orange and red like the leaves 
of autumn (though their fleshy leaves don't fall off). Succulents blossom 
because winter is the rainy season, when these water-thrifty plants can afford 
the great energy expenditure needed for flowers; their leaves turn color as a 
defense against the cold. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Boyd Walker</PERSON>, a retired ichthyologist whose garden in <LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION> is 
almost solely succulents, says that winter is his garden's finest season. "It 
really doesn't have a down time," <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> says. "But it looks its best from 
<DATE>December</DATE> through <DATE>February</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the dramatic display in <ORGANIZATION>Walker</ORGANIZATION>'s winter garden greets visitors 
at the front door: the genus Echeveria. In this remarkable group are a number 
of plants whose large, thick leaves turn a fiery red or orange in winter. 
Walker grows them unusually well -- and they are large. Most of his plants are 
hybrids, and many of the biggest are only about 2 years old. He has found most 
of them at local nurseries (he is especially fond of a new hybrid, '<ORGANIZATION>Topsy 
Turvy</ORGANIZATION>'). To ensure that all energy goes to producing the leaves, <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> pinches 
back the echeverias' flowers, and every year he cuts rosettes from the stems, 
lets them dry out in the air for a few days, then re-roots them in empty pots. 
Once roots appear, he transplants them into soil. He picks a pot that is as big 
in diameter as the rosette; when the leaves overhang the sides by 2 inches, he 
moves it into a larger pot. His soil mix is simplicity itself: 1 part garden 
soil, 1 part sand, 1 part perlite and 1 part compost from his own pile. He 
fertilizes the plants several times a year. Old stems, by the way, are saved. 
Little plantlets sprout along the lengths of the old stems, and these are 
eventually severed off and rooted. 
</P>
<P>
Other, blue-green- and gray-green-leaved echeverias grow out in the garden's 
beds in mass plantings designed by <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Mary Ev</PERSON>. That use of the 
succulents sets this garden apart from all others. Says <PERSON>Boyd Walker</PERSON>: "Most 
people plant succulents in natural settings, but <PERSON>Mary Ev</PERSON> found that the 
traditional English perennial border is a better model." The echeverias in the 
garden are allowed to flower, and they do so in profusion. 
</P>
<P>
There are also mass plantings of the similarly shaped Aeoniums, most of which 
are native to the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION>. They enjoy the moisture of the <LOCATION>Pacific 
Palisades</LOCATION> air, and they don't mind the long months of overcast in the <DATE>spring</DATE>. 
The echeverias and the aeoniums out in the garden would grow atop tall stems if 
allowed, but they are cut from their stems yearly, left to dry and replanted. 
This keeps the ones in the garden low, neat and healthy, because rot and 
nematodes that get started in the old stems and leaves are discarded. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular flowers belong to the South African agave-like aloes, 
which bloom all <DATE>winter</DATE> long. 
</P>
<P>
Huge blooming crown of thorns (Euphorbia milii) makes a bright red-and-green 
backdrop for the border, and the Walkers have mixed in jade plant, another 
shrubby succulent that blooms in winter, along with clumps or colonies of other 
smaller crassulas. One unusual succulent flowering now, Bulbine stenopala, has 
spires of bright-yellow flowers arising from grass-thin fleshy leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular flowers, however, belong to the large South African group 
of agave-like aloes, which reliably bloom all <DATE>winter</DATE> long. "They have a very 
long season," says <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>. "Our favorites are the bicolors with red-and-yellow 
flowers. Most are hybrids developed by <PERSON>Dave Verity</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. We use them 
everywhere." Flowers can also be orange; sometimes the spiny leaves are tinged 
orange or red. 
</P>
<P>
All of these succulent plants are tough enough to take some drought. "We water 
them fairly often -- whenever they get completely dry -- and some get watered 
weekly, right along with the lawn," <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> says. "But when we want to travel, 
we can go off and leave them for weeks and they'll still be there when we 
return. They have their advantages."

<LEADPARA>  FEW PLANT enthusiasts can resist the magic of African violets in bloom, which
explains why these plants, really not true violets, are such favorites.;   
With bright blossom colors that include deep purple, fuchsia, burgundy, pink,
blue and pure white, all amid lush green foliage that may be flat or ruffled,
they compel attention.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AFRICAN VIOLETS CHASE WINTER GLOOM WITH TROPICAL
BLOOM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Available throughout the year in florist shops and supermarkets, these
charming plants are particularly appealing as gloom chasers on winter days.
Yet buyers often become frustrated when newly purchased plants turn into shy
bloomers (or fail to flower at all) soon after they are brought home.;    But
a little pampering will please the plants and sustain their blooming habit. It
helps to know something about their special needs, as well as their native
background, if only for clues to their cultural requirements.;    Not really
violets;  While known throughout the world as African violets, this identity
is only half correct. Their roots indeed are in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>, but they are not
violets.;    Found growing in the high reaches of tropical <LOCATION>East Africa</LOCATION> in <DATE>1892</DATE>
by a young German named <PERSON>Baron Walter von Saint Paul</PERSON>, the plants were
determined to be of a previously unknown genus, and were named Saintpaulia
after the baron. They are in fact members of the Gesneriaceae family, which
boasts such other impressive kin as the showy gloxinias.;    With the plant's
resemblance to the familiar violets, plus their African origin, however, it is
understandable how they became popularly known as African violets.;    The
original plants found in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> were blue, but intensive hybridizing, as well
as mutations, have widened their color range and even the form among the
thousands of varieties available today.;    Growing tips;  Being familiar with
the basic requirements remains the key to growing healthy plants eager to
flower. Here are some guidelines:;    (check) In <DATE>winter</DATE>, the plants will do
best in sunny windows, but in the <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE>, a north- or east-facing
window is suggested. Direct sun in <DATE>spring</DATE> and <DATE>summer</DATE> can be harmful. With too
little light, plants will turn pale and leggy, and flowering will cease. Many
violet fanciers grow their plants under fluorescent lights for better control
of light needs.;    (check) Plants naturally grow toward the light. For more
even growth, turn them occasionally to give all parts equal exposure.;   
(check) The amount and frequency of watering will vary with conditions under
which the plants are growing. Water often enough to keep soil moist. Apply
room temperature water at the edge of the pots to keep it off the foliage.;   
(check) Plants need high humidity, especially in winter. If necessary, it can
be attained by placing pots on pebbles in a saucer with water kept just below
the bottom of the pots.;    (check) Feed plants every two weeks with specially
formulated African violet food when watering.;    (check) The ideal
temperature range is 65 to 70 degrees. Higher than 80 and lower than 50 will
inhibit flowering. Keep plants away from drafts.;    How to repot;  When
repotting plants into decorative containers or to larger pots as they grow,
choose a soil mix that is light and porous and has excellent drainage.;    To
remove a plant from the old pot, turn the pot upside down and tap the bottom
gently to release the plant in your hand. Then place the plant on an inch or
two of potting soil and fill in the sides. Plant at the same depth, making
sure the crown is not covered.;    Rooting leaf cuttings in water or soil and
dividing older plants is a simple way to increase plants in one's collection.;
   New plants also can be propagated from seeds, a rewarding project for more
serious hobbyists with patience to nurture them for six months before they
produce flowering plants. Seeds are available from most major order firms,
including <ORGANIZATION>Thompson &amp; Morgan</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Jackson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> 08527, and <ORGANIZATION>Park Seeds Co.</ORGANIZATION>,

<HEADLINE>  EAT A BUG
THIS NURSERY FULL OF INNOCENT-LOOKING, EXOTIC
PLANTS IS A NOT-SO-LITTLE SHOP OF CARNIVORES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Under a blazing <LOCATION>Sonoma County</LOCATION> sun, 340 varieties spend their days
paralyzing, strangling, drowning and dissolving hapless bugs.;   The founder,
<PERSON>Peter D'Amato</PERSON>, has not escaped from these hearty eaters since <DATE>1965</DATE>. He was 10
when he found several specimens growing in a bog near his home in southern <LOCATION>New
Jersey.</LOCATION>;   "There's something hypnotic about them," he said. "They're always
involved in some kind of drama. I have to keep reminding myself that they
can't think.";   He is devoted not only to growing and selling carnivorous
plants -- many of which grow easily in <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> climates -- but also to
improving their image, which has been sullied in recent years by movies such
as "Little Shop of Horrors.";   None of his wares, however, bring to mind the
grotesque potted man-eater in that film. Rather, they appear deceptively
innocent.;   The bladderworts look fragile on the surface, with dainty
blossoms nodding on wire-thin stalks. But underground, fast-moving suction
cups are lapping up nematodes.;   The sundews seem equally innocuous. They
resemble scrawny, long-armed cactuses misted with glistening dew -- a "dew" so
gluey that insects rarely break away from its grasp.;   Once the dew secures a
victim, the plant's arm slowly curls around the creature and consumes it with
a secretion of digestive juice.;   Only the nepenthes (nuh-PEN-theeze), loopy
tropical vines strung with potato-size pods full of liquid enzymes -- look
capable of violence.;   Purple veins streak their pods, and rows of horizontal
thorns run up the corners of the pods, serving as tiny ladders that lead bugs
and sometimes mice to doom.;   Despite these aggressive meal-acquisition
tools, no one was sure plants could eat insects until the <DATE>1860s</DATE>, when <PERSON>Charles
Darwin</PERSON> began experimenting with botanical carnivores.;   Sundews, he wrote at
the time, interested him more "than the origin of all the species in the
world." He spent years figuring out what and how they consumed.;   "He'd feed
them hard-boiled egg, which they will eat," <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> said. "They'll even eat
chocolate and cheese, which gives them indigestion.";   Thanks to <PERSON>Darwin</PERSON>'s
discoveries -- and thanks to improved glassmaking and heating technology,
which made greenhouses possible -- Victorians took a fancy to carnivores in
general and nepenthes in particular.;   The voracious vines gorged on indoor
pests until fuel shortages in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> during World War I
killed all but a few collections.;   Interest in them flagged until the <DATE>1970s</DATE>,
when back-to-nature enthusiasts flirted with almost every form of interior
greenery. But carnivores did not enjoy a long return to the limelight, mainly
because they often disappointed their inexperienced owners by dying.;   "It's
tricky to get the conditions right: the soil, the water, the humidity, the
light," said <PERSON>Geoff Wong</PERSON>, a long-time collector of carnivorous plants and a
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Carnivores customer. His most frustrating possession is a nepenthes
that adapted to life 9,000 feet up in <LOCATION>Borneo.</LOCATION>;   "It's 10 years old and one
inch wide, and in its natural state, it would be 10 feet high," said <PERSON>Wong</PERSON>, who
is a research chemist in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. Although the plant is only a few inches
high, "people tell me I should be happy it isn't dead." D'Amato owns another
aged example of the same plant, also an inch wide and a few inches high.;  
"It's a matter of finding out what's important to them," said <PERSON>Bill Baumgartl</PERSON>,
a physician in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> who owns 30 carnivorous plants and frequents
<ORGANIZATION>California Carnivores</ORGANIZATION>. "They're very sensitive to soil pH, and you have to
water them with distilled water and you have to fertilize very carefully.";  
But <PERSON>Marilee Maertz</PERSON>, the greenhouse's general manager, who has accidentally
killed countless other houseplants and has mistaken the word "Dieffenbachia"
for a disease, finds carnivores easy to please. "Only once in a while do we
lose somebody," she said.;   She is a former ship inspector; <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> is a
former design engineer for <PERSON>Levi Strauss</PERSON>, and they have been friends since
<DATE>1973.</DATE>;   In <DATE>1989</DATE>, they displayed <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON>'s private collection at a garden show
in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, just for fun, and were swamped by purchase offers.;   To
sate the public's appetite, they set up a shop of carnivores. "We felt
terrible saying, 'Yeah, these are great, but you can't have any,' " she said.;
  According to the <ORGANIZATION>International Carnivorous Plant Society</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>California
Carnivores</ORGANIZATION> is the newest and one of the largest of the dozen all-carnivorous
retail nurseries in the country.;   Their 2,000-square-foot greenhouse stands
on the grounds of a winery; it once sheltered weeds used in allergy research.
It looks more like a botanical museum than a store: A half-dozen crowded
planters with long textual panels line one aisle, depicting the ways
carnivores can congregate in their natural settings.;   Several sundews spill
out of a green pottery horn of plenty. A baby sundew in the saddle of a pink
china horse will someday make its host resemble Pegasus.;   "Bizarre pots for
bizarre plants," said <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON>, who skips off in midsentence to mist a
nepenthes.;   School groups often tour the shop, as do the curious. Despite
the long hours of describing the wonders of carnivores and despite frequent
pleas to set off a Venus flytrap (requests that are usually ignored, since
flytraps hate to be teased), the staff members never tire of their subject.;  
"To this day," <PERSON>D'Amato</PERSON> said, "the simplest sundew still puts me in a state of
amazement."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; <ORGANIZATION>California Carnivores</ORGANIZATION> is located at <LOCATION>Mark
West Vineyards</LOCATION>, 7000 Trenton-Healsburg Road, <LOCATION>Forestville</LOCATION>, 95436; (707)
838-1630. The nursery is open daily <DATE>March through November</DATE>, but they recommend

<LEADPARA>  IN SPITE OF RESTRICTIONS on water use in California, landscape architects and
designers, gardeners, and spa and pool professionals say that with careful
planning, savvy planting and wise use of water, flowers and plants can
flourish and a garden can still be the perfect place for relaxation and family
recreation.;    The key to landscape planning, say the pros, is to rethink old
notions of the garden as simply a high-maintenance place with a large lawn and
beds of colorful but water-loving annual flowers. Weekends spent watering and
mowing may be almost a thing of the past, but tending flowers and taking care
of landscaping can still be one of the most pleasant pastimes.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GREEN THOUGHTS
NO MATTER HOW DRY WE ARE, WE CAN STILL HAVE
OUR GARDENS AND ENJOY THEM, TOO.  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  DIANE DORRANS SAEKS writes on fashion and design for West.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Creative gardeners will instead rethink their planting to take advantage of
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> native plants, perennials, and shrubs and ornamental trees that get
along from year to year without gallons of water.;    This doesn't mean you
have to resort to a rock garden with cactuses and succulents. Graceful roses,
swags of fragrant jasmine and bowers of wisteria are still possible, but
you'll have to learn to mulch deeply with fibrous plant material so that soil
retains water to feed the plants' roots.;    This <DATE>summer</DATE> it's also important
to become an expert on the imaginative gathering and use of "gray" water --
water you've previously used in rinsing salad lettuces or fruit, or shower
run-off you've collected in a plastic bucket. This "found" water can be used
for watering window boxes and flower pots, but not in the vegetable garden.;
POOL; AND SPA CARE; If you are fortunate enough to have a gleaming pool with a
bubbling spa, it is imperative to check with pool and spa maintenance
companies to be sure that water use is within bounds, and that no water is
wasted because of faulty equipment or incorrectly used chemicals. Careful pool
care and spa cleaning become crucial when water is in short supply. Be sure
that automatic pool cleaners and sweepers are in tip-top condition. If a wheel
on this silent but hard-working machine becomes loose, it cannot move easily
around the bottom of the pool, and walls and bottom of the pool will soon
become murky. Scoop up leaves and debris with a nylon net. Sweep the pool
surround so that fallen leaves do not blow into the pool.;    Some families
with pools have decided this year to get more enjoyment from the pool area by
adding a poolhouse or pergola, or simply a small trellis pavilion or gazebo
for shelter from the sun. In-pool spas make the pool usable even in the
evenings and during cooler weather.; WATER; AND LAWNS; Water restrictions in
some areas make acres of green lawns problematic or even impossible. Lawn
grass, particularly <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> blue grass, is the thirstiest grass of all.
Instead of this water-guzzler, landscape designers suggest planting
semi-tropical <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION> grass and a mixture of buffalo grass and blue
grama grass.;    Another alternative is to redesign the garden so that there's
a larger expanse of brick terrace, stone pathways or ornamental shrub beds.;
GARDEN; FURNITURE; Whether you prefer long-lasting classic teak wood,
easy-care plastic or durable and decorative metal furniture, there are many
style (and price) choices for outdoor chairs and tables this summer.;    For
state-of-the-art relaxation around your patio, nothing beats a sturdy chaise
longue. Designs range from chic plantation-grown teak styles to solid beech
deck chairs, lightweight non-yellowing resin, and inexpensive aluminum and
vinyl.;    While some poolside chairs and chaises come with all-weather
pillows, designers suggest adding comfortable and cool zip-off natural
off-white canvas pillows sprayed with water- and stain-repellent for
durability. Cover with towels for extra protection from wet swimsuits and
spilled lemonade.;    Other classic chairs to consider include the easy-going
Adirondack, painted in bright, long-lasting colors, natural wicker arm chairs,
space-saving inexpensive folding <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> park chairs in dark green, or newly
revived '30s Deco-style steel porch chairs.;    And don't forget
generous-sized natural canvas Italian market umbrellas to protect you (and
your cold drinks) from the midday sun. On days when temperatures inevitably
slide into the 90s, you can still relax comfortably outdoors under their
protection.; THE; OUTDOOR ROOM; One of the best ways to get more use from your
garden is to set up a table and comfortable chairs, and maybe a chaise longue
or two in a sheltered corner or a private, shaded terrace. Think of it as an
extra <DATE>summer</DATE> room, a summerlong spot for letter-writing, reading, lingering
over breakfast. Add easy-care pillows, some high-SPF sunscreens, a table for
your books and newspapers, a pitcher of iced tea and a collection of plastic
tumblers, some toys, and you and your family can relax there all day.;    On
warm evenings, plan a casual family dinner out in the garden with salad and a
variety of crusty breads and cheeses as the main attractions. On weekends,
invite friends for a barbecue and set up a buffet table so that everyone can
self- serve. Provide or improvise lawn games like croquet and you have the
makings of a memorable day in the sun -- without that drive to the coast.;   
Plan the setting so that it's open to the breezes but feels restful and
private. Plant wisteria or climbing roses over a pergola to provide shade and
a group of large terra cotta pots planted with tall flowers or boxwood to give
a sense of enclosure. "Carpet" your room with inexpensive and durable seagrass
or coir matting.;    Orient the "room" toward the best garden view or create a
view with a birdbath or small pool and fountain (with recirculating water) as
a focal point.; WATER-WISE; GARDENING TIPS; <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION> landscape designer <PERSON>LeAnn
Keaton</PERSON> (whose garden is shown on page 23) says that even with stringent water
restrictions, imaginative gardeners can still plan a beautiful show of flowers
and shrubs. Choosing plants that originated in the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>, like
varieties of lavender, ensures success in hot, dry weather.;    1. Around the
terrace, along a path or beside a front door, plant flowers and bulbs in large
terra cotta pots. Absorbent organic mulch (available at nurseries) helps the
soil to retain water. Artemisia, santolina and lavenders are fragrant and
hardy, and will grow abundantly with very little watering. Pots can be moved
around the terrace, even taken indoors for your enjoyment during the winter.; 
  2. Save "gray" water from your shower, drips from your garden faucets, rain
water, vegetable rinsing water, for flower pot watering.;    3. Zone garden
planting so that water-loving plants like azaleas and rhododendrons, foxgloves
and delphiniums and roses are grouped together. Use water conserving plants
for wind protection, shade, and for screening.;    4. Redesign the garden to
limit the lawn size. Enlarge a brick or stone patio, build a decorative stone
path through the garden and between the stones or bricks plant fragrant
creeping thyme, miniature chamomile or moss. This planting requires little
maintenance or water.;    5. This is a particularly good year to start a small
herb garden with an accent on hardy perennials. Varieties of thyme, oregano,
sage, rosemary, lavender all do well in sunny, dry climate. Cooks say that
leaves are more flavorful when plants receive less watering.;    6. For the
moment a new swimming pool may be postponed, but it's still possible to enjoy
an expanse of water in the garden. A small pond or decorative pool with a
recirculating fountain, or a decorative antique stone tub with a water lily
floating in it enrich the garden scheme and require little maintenance. Terra
cotta or stone statuary, even an antique birdbath can give the garden a new
look without more plants.;    7. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> native plants make sensible and
attractive choices -- and all are naturally drought-tolerant. Look for types
of salvia, bright orange <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> poppies, ceanothus, varieties of iris and
penstemon, and coral bells.;    8. Keep weeds to a minimum. They use up your
precious water.  </TEXT>

PROPER WATERING A KEY TO HEALTHIER PETUNIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Guffey is a free-lance writer living in Malibu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They look pretty in nursery packs and catalogues, and they bloom profusely in 
<LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>, but why do they wilt in my garden? Petunias are perplexing, so I 
began asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kim Bodger</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bodger Seed Co.</ORGANIZATION> began my inquiry by describing the development of 
petunias from the small multiflora types in the '50s to the huge grandiflora 
blooms of the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Breeders fueled the burgeoning bedding-plant industry with petunias that 
bloomed big and fast. But performance suffered. Bigger flowers didn't 
necessarily mean better plants. Enthusiasm for petunias waned. Impatiens, 
improved through hybridization into super-plants with long bloom and carefree 
culture, supplanted petunias as the most popular bedding flower. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to <PERSON>Bodger</PERSON>, "the petunia industry fought back." Hybridizers 
concentrated on more dependable but smaller-flowered types -- the old-fashioned 
multiflora petunias that grew 3 feet tall but managed to bloom all <DATE>summer</DATE> 
without any help. The industry goal was to retain the small petunia's sturdy 
constitution and prolific production but create more compact plants. We saw 
such series as Joy, Comanche, Sugar Plum and Carpet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blooms Grew Larger 
</P>
<P>
Hybridizers continued their efforts in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>. The newly designed multiflora 
petunias exhibited many of the excellent characteristics of the old 
multifloras, but the blooms were much larger -- so large that the name 
multiflora no longer seemed appropriate. So the petunia industry, like the rose 
growers, adopted a new generic description for this large-flowered but 
compact-growing class of petunias: floribunda. In this class, we find the 
popular Madness series (Summer Madness, <ORGANIZATION>Sheer Madness</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coral Madness</ORGANIZATION>, etc.). 
Surprisingly, the new floribunda blooms are almost as large as those of the 
modern grandifloras (including such series as <LOCATION>Daddy</LOCATION>, Supercascade, Flash and 
Supermagic), which are still the largest-selling of all petunia types. 
</P>
<P>
So where does that leave us petunia growers? In my garden the new floribundas 
are great in pots but in the ground they often wilt, along with the grandfloras 
and multifloras. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mike Vukelich Sr.</PERSON>, chairman of the board of Color Spot, the largest wholesale 
nursery of bedding plants in the country, says that the immune system of the 
petunia isn't strong enough for moist climates. Petunias succumb to soil 
viruses. His advice: sterilize the soil. That suggestion brought to mind 
visions of Chloroxing my flower beds or fumigating them with <PERSON>Vapam</PERSON>, repugnant 
thoughts indeed, so I pressed him for other ideas. He recommended trying 
petunias in a different location. In moist climates, he advised placing them in 
spots where they receive sun for most of the day and good ventilation. Planting 
them between houses is risky. And watering is critical. With petunias, keep 
them on the dry side. 
</P>
<P>
Lili Singer, horticultural consultant and radio gardening authority agreed that 
petunia problems are water related. Petunias are subject to root and crown rot, 
a result of uneven watering. "Like pansies," she says, "petunias must never be 
allowed to wilt, either from under- or overwatering. Once they wilt, it's all 
over." She advises providing good soil conditions, including preparation with 
organic materials and ample mulching. When watering, do it thoroughly and then 
allow petunias to dry out -- almost to the wilting stage. That appears to be 
the tricky part -- knowing when they are sufficiently dried out. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Susan Brozowski</PERSON>, color specialist at <ORGANIZATION>Sherman Gardens</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> del Mar, says 
that petunias like it hot and dry. That's why they thrive in the desert. At 
<ORGANIZATION>Sherman Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, where she plants hundreds of petunias in a coastal climate, a 
liquid fungicide is sometimes used at planting time. But her principal concern, 
shared by our other authorities, is watering. She warns against watering on a 
schedule. Always check the soil; if it's damp, don't apply water. 
</P>
<P>
Water and soil fungi often attack petunias as soon as seedlings are 
transplanted into the ground. This is the time to be most vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
Petunias may develop tiny holes in their blooms, a sign that budworms are 
present. Geranium and petunia buds are especially attractive to small white 
moths that lay their eggs at night. These eggs hatch into tiny caterpillars. 
The best defense is handpicking of the little caterpillars or spraying with 
B.t., a nontoxic and long-lasting biological control. 
</P>
<P>
To keep my 40 pots of petunias blooming most of the <DATE>summer</DATE>, I feed regularly 
and attempt to remove faded blooms. My petunias in pots provide dependable 
color for at least 10 weeks before conking out. In the ground, they are a 
gamble, but hope springs eternal, and next year I'll try a sunnier location and 
keep a light hand on the hose.

DON'T BLAME CACTUS FOR SLOW SALE OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To paraphrase <PERSON>Wordsworth</PERSON>: The brokers are too much with us. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing personal, mind you. Our broker happens to be professional and 
hard-working. 
</P>
<P>
But my wife and I have endured a 10-week odyssey into the nerve-wracking world 
of selling a home. We've undergone the pressure of a deadline for a 
cross-country move. We've hawked our house in a market that suddenly, 
maddeningly slowed to a crawl just as we jumped in. 
</P>
<P>
Our modest <ORGANIZATION>Sherman Oaks</ORGANIZATION> house has brought its share of drama right from escrow. 
Even before we closed on it <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, we drove up one day to find two 
young women sawing off branches from the majestic cereus cactus in our front 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought you'd want them removed," they lied. 
</P>
<P>
Stealing our succulents? Was nothing sacred in the <ORGANIZATION>Southland</ORGANIZATION>? 
</P>
<P>
A job promotion drove us back into the marketplace after months of hearing 
about soaring prices and multiple bids -- the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> housing gold rush. 
Even our handyman got nearly <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> for his grubby <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> bungalow, 
which the buyer demolished and replaced with an oversized monstrosity on a 
quarter-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waited for Bids 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We listed in early <DATE>May</DATE> and waited for the bids to come rolling in. And waited. 
And waited. 
</P>
<P>
"The house shows extremely well," our broker said so often it became a kind of 
mantra. But show was all it did; there was no winning with this place. 
</P>
<P>
As my departure date loomed, we lowered the price and tried not to take it 
personally when battalions of would-be buyers traipsed through our living room 
with nary a bid. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with our house?" my wife lamented. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that a generous offer won't cure," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bells went off, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alarms Routs Clients 
</P>
<P>
We were hiding in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> from yet another weekend open house. A friend 
had agreed to turn our alarm on and off (if they'll steal your cactus, why 
would they stop at the stoop?) so brokers could peddle "the property" in our 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
He was late one morning and a broker had arrived with clients, only to be 
driven away by a deafening siren that would not stop. 
</P>
<P>
I called to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients were serious buyers," the broker growled. "They really liked the 
property." 
</P>
<P>
"Surely, they'll come back for another look under quieter circumstances," I 
pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," he replied. "They said they want to see what else was around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remove Cactus in Back 
</P>
<P>
For 24 hours, my anger at my friend smoldered. Then my broker assured me that 
her colleague was probably extracting retribution; his clients were not 
interested, siren or no, if they failed to return to the scene of the crime 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
But she did have a suggestion: remove the 8-foot cactuses in the back that were 
more impressive than the ones out front. She said many potential buyers wanted 
a traditional grassy back yard, which we could provide, sans cereus. 
</P>
<P>
Since reluctantly inheriting the prickly desert denizens, we had grown fond of 
their delicate night-blooming flowers, their stoic grandeur and merciful 
self-reliance. The notion of hacking them up for resale was painful. We did not 
want to oversee their demise out back in departing after saving them in front 
upon arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we vowed to take them out if the new owner preferred sod to 
succulents. We lowered the price -- again. We even warmed yeast in the oven to 
create that homey smell of fresh-baked cookies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Like Dating' 
</P>
<P>
And we told ourselves there must be someone who would appreciate what we did 
about our home: the logical layout, the French doors and skylights, the serene 
covered patio, the fountain and roses, and gardenias. And, hopefully, even the 
cactus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like dating," I said. "It only takes one." 
</P>
<P>
That one proved to be a sweet couple seeking more space, a more outdoor life 
style, a place to cultivate orchids and plug in computers. They were spurred to 
quick action -- and a full-price bid -- by another offer that came in the same 
electrifying <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Money <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the cereus seem safe. Our buyers appreciate them, too. 
</P>
<P>
So we're off to the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> -- and more brokers. I hope no one takes it 
personally when we tromp through his or her home without buying it. I figure 
we'll know we've found the right place when bells go off. But I'm not promising 
my wife a cactus garden.

FT  27 APR 91 / Gardening: Time to take out the tubers - Why Arthur Hellyer
has been ferreting about in his loft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU dug up dahlia tubers last <DATE>autumn</DATE> and stored them for the winter in a
dry, frost-proof place you should be thinking now about starting them into
growth again.
My own went into the loft, which is well boarded. The loft gets sufficient
warmth from the hot water system to keep out frost but not so much as to
shrivel the tubers and that is ideal.
Most of the tubers will go straight back into the garden where they are to
flower this <DATE>summer</DATE>. This is not ideal because it is such a big change of
environment and there are hungry slugs and snails waiting to eat the dahlia
shoots. However, as a rule a good sprinkling of slug pellets in each
planting hole and also on the surface when planting is completed will look
after these enemies, and a covering of at least two inches of mixed soil and
either peat or compost will give adequate protection from the short-duration
frosts that are all we are likely to get now.
Nevertheless, it is safer to start dahlia tubers in soil-filled boxes or
large pots in a greenhouse or shelter of some kind where they can be
watched, watered and protected until early <DATE>June</DATE>, by which time they should
be growing strongly and no further danger from frost should remain.
If the old roots are large they can, with advantage, be split into several
pieces provided each piece has one or more tubers and also one or more
pieces of last year's stems, since the new growth buds are around the base
of these.
One of the advantages of starting tubers under cover is that these growth
buds can be kept under observation and, if a lot start to grow, just the
best four or five per plant kept and the rest rubbed out. As these shoots
lengthen they will branch and by the time flowers begin to appear in <DATE>July</DATE>
each plant will be sufficiently bushy to make a fine display which will
continue until stopped by frost. Yet these are niceties which can be
dispensed with, for dahlias are among the easiest of plants to grow given
sunshine and plenty of moisture to sustain their ample stems and flowers.
There is no limit to the number of years that dahlias can be grown on in
this way and I can think of no other sub-tropical plant that can be grown
with so little trouble and expense. I must have had some of my dahlia tubers
for at least 20 years and yet they show no signs of decline and I scarcely
have to spray them except, maybe, against greenflies for which there is an
aphicide named Rapid (it contains perimicarb) which has the merit of being
specific to members of the aphis family (greenflies, blackflies, etc) and so
extremely unlikely to affect anything else in the garden.
There are three possible ways of starting with dahlias: with seed, cuttings
or small tubers. Most of the seed that is sold is of bedding varieties bred
for their modest 2 to 2 1/2 ft height and single, semi-double or double
flowers of moderate size. They are so easily and cheaply raised from seed
and their tubers are often so unreliable about surviving the winter in store
that it is usual to re-sew them each <DATE>spring</DATE> and discard them at the end of
the flowering season.
Cuttings are now used mainly for the best varieties, those grown by dahlia
specialists many of whom exhibit them at flower shows. A few old tubers are
stored during the winter and are started growing in pots or beds of soil in
a greenhouse in <DATE>March</DATE> in a minimum temperature of 16`C (61`F).
The young shoots are then cut off with a sharp knife when 2 to 3 in long,
inserted as cuttings in small flower pots and rooted in a propagating frame
within the greenhouse. When rooted, the cuttings can be potted singly in 3
or 4 in diameter pots and gradually acclimatised for planting outdoors early
in <DATE>June</DATE>. Many varieties can be purchased in this way as young plants ready
to go straight into the garden.
This is the way favoured by many dahlia lovers because so many varieties are
available from specialist dahlia nurseries. However, garden centres usually
prefer to sell what are known as pot tubers, which are quite small tubers
grown from late cuttings and then packed dry in polythene bags.
These pot tubers can be sold dry in their bags at any time in the <DATE>spring</DATE>
and, according to precise time and convenience, can either be potted singly
in pots and started in a frost-proof greenhouse or on a sunny window-sill or
be planted direct outdoors where they are to flower.
You should wait until <DATE>May</DATE> to do this and even then you should put a couple
of inches of soil over them as protection from late frosts.
Dahlia tubers vary greatly in size and shape. Those that are long and thin
are easily broken off. The best for long life are those that are thick and
short-necked and packed into a compact cluster. They then give each other
protection and hang together for years. When deciding which dahlia varieties
to keep at the end of the season I always give this aspect of tuber shape
and character considerable thought.

<LEADPARA>  ORCHIDS may seem exotically delicate, but there is nothing fragile about the
nitty-gritty job of moving an orchid out of cramped quarters into a roomier
pot.;    "Repotting is a get-your-hands-dirty job," says Chalmers  Chambers of
the Santa Clara Valley Orchid Society. He grows hundreds of cymbidium orchids,
but his specialty is giving repotting demonstrations at orchid events.;    The
first step, Chambers says, is getting the orchid plant out of the pot, and
this can be harder than it sounds if the roots completely fill the pot.
Sometimes tapping the pot on a hard surface will loose the cramped plant, but
you may have to use a screwdriver to pry it out. A dry plant will pop out of
the pot easier than a wet one.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RITES OF SPRING
SOME PEOPLE THINK SPRING IS THE SEASON FOR
LOVERS. BUT FROM A GARDENER'S VIEWPOINT,
THIS IS THE SEASON OF NEW BEGINNINGS.
WHETHER YOUR FANCY IS FUCHSIAS, CACTUSES OR
ORCHIDS, IT'S TIME FOR IMPORTANT JOBS AS
PLANTS START THEIR NEW CYCLE OF LIFE.
ORCHIDS: REPOTTING GIVES PSEUDOBULBS MORE
ROOM TO STRETCH THEIR ROOTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See related articles this page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This is where the "dirty hands" business comes in. The roots are generally
in a solid ball and you will have to work your fingers through the rootball to
loosen and remove the planting medium. The roots feel like thick strands of
day-old spaghetti, and when you are done, there should be no old planting
medium left on the roots.;    Then, carefully pick through the dangling roots,
using your fingers to snap off roots that are withered, broken or dead.
Healthy cymbidium roots are creamy white in color and feel plump and brittle.;
   "Cut back the roots to a length equal to the depth of the new pot,"
Chambers says. After the healthy roots have been cut, and the plant is
positioned in the new pot, the roots should just brush to bottom of the pot.; 
  To divide the growth into new clumps, Chambers decides how many pseudobulbs
should be grouped in each new plant. Pseudobulbs are false bulbs that store
food and water, and are typical of cymbidium and dendrobium  orchids, among
others.;    Although some people may use a sharp knife or a razor blade to cut
apart the pseudobulbs, Chambers grabs the growth in his hands and works it
back and forth to snap apart the fleshy, rootlike rhizome between the
pseudobulbs.;    The idea is to end up with clumps of at least three, and as
many as five, pseudobulbs for replanting. Then use your fingers to groom away
dead roots at the center of the plant.;    There are a few choices to make
about the orchid's new home. Whether you decide on plastic or clay pots
depends on your personal choice -- and your pocketbook, Chambers says.
"Because I have so many orchids, I tend to use plastic simply because they
cost less," he says. A plastic pot is non-porous so the roots come out easier;
but a porous clay pot absorbs excess water so a plant doesn't sit in overly
wet soil.;    Size is another decision. "Go for smaller ones," Chambers says.
Remember the roots like a tight fit. There is no need to transplant three or
four pseudobulbs into a 12-inch pot -- that's far too much space, water and
planting medium.;    Some orchid books suggest putting some kind of filler
material -- bits of broken pottery or polystyrene pieces of packing medium --
in the bottom of the pot, but <ORGANIZATION>Chambers</ORGANIZATION> doesn't care to do that as long as the
pot has sufficient drainage holes. You can use a nail or ice pick to punch a
few more holes in a plastic pot.;    The proper way to water, he says, is to
soak thoroughly until water runs out the drainage holes. The planting medium
should remain slightly moist, but not soggy wet. Chambers says watering should
be done every eight to 10 days this time of year; in <DATE>July</DATE>, every three to four
days. Neither polymers in the planting medium nor self-watering pots seem to
work with orchids, he says.;    For a planting medium, <ORGANIZATION>Chambers</ORGANIZATION> favors
one-third each of lava rock, fir bark and potting mix, tossed together like
salad. Don't layer them one on top of the other.;    Here's how to put all the
pieces together, according to Chambers:;    (check) Hold the new pot nestled
in the crook of your hand. Position the pseudobulbs so the new growth will be
about level with the rim of the pot.;    (check) Pour in some planting medium
and tap the side of the pot to help the mix settle around the roots. Keep
adding a little more planting mix, tapping the pot to settle it each time.;   
(check) Finally, use your fingers to firm the mix in place.;    Chambers feeds
his orchids every time he waters. "That's year-round using an orchid food with
<ORGANIZATION>NPK</ORGANIZATION> numbers such as 22-11-17 or 28-14-19. There's no off season to orchids and
you can't take time off from their care," he says.;    The planting mix
eventually washes away, so you will probably have to do the whole thing again
in a year or two.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (box) Malihini Orchid Society show,

DID THE BOMB SQUAD REALLY RUSH OVER TO KEEP THE BIG CACTUS FROM EXPLODING?

THE URBAN MYTH, or fable, is like the mythical dragon that can't be killed: Cut 
off its head, it grows another. (If there is no such mythical beast, I have 
just invented it.) 
</P>
<P>
We keep hearing these fables: 
</P>
<P>
 -- About the jealous husband who poured the contents of a concrete mixer into 
his wife's lover's convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About the helpful driver (always a woman) who is told that to push-start a 
stalled car equipped with an automatic transmission, she must first get it up 
to a speed of 35 m.p.h. So she gets the rescue car up to 35 m.p.h. and bangs 
into the stalled car at that speed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About the compacted <ORGANIZATION>VW</ORGANIZATION> Bug -- with bodies enclosed -- that is found days 
later between the front ends of two trucks that collided at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
Such tales are so indestructible that it seems pointless to invent new ones, 
but they keep coming along. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dennis L. Jones</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Temple City</ORGANIZATION> writes to ask whether I believe the following: 
</P>
<P>
"It seems a couple bought a large potted saguaro cactus from a nursery. They 
had it in their home for a few days when they noticed it was moving. They 
called the nursery and questioned them about it. The nurseryman told them to 
leave the house immediately, call 911 from their neighbor's and explain what 
was happening to the police. They followed his instructions, and the police 
sent the bomb squad out, entered the home with full bomb gear on, covered the 
cactus with a large tarp and put it in the bomb container. The reason for all 
this was that tarantulas breed inside this type of cactus, (which has) been 
known to actually blow apart with tarantulas flying everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The most improbable thing about that story is that anybody would believe it. 
Jones says his daughter heard the story from a friend of the principals. It is 
never closer than that: a friend of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
The best urban fables are those that might be true; some even do have a grain 
of truth in them. A popular myth in recent years is that <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s sewers 
are infested with alligators -- the progeny of baby alligators dropped into 
toilets by vacationers who brought them back from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> as pets and tired of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In their book "There Are Alligators in Our Sewers" (Delacorte), <PERSON>Paul Dickson</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Joseph G. Goulden</PERSON> report an interview with a former sewers commissioner who 
said that in <DATE>1935</DATE> his men discovered 2-foot-long alligators in the sewer and 
cleaned them out with rifles and poison. 
</P>
<P>
In his book on urban fables "Curses! Broiled Again!" (<ORGANIZATION>Norton</ORGANIZATION>), <PERSON>Jan Harold 
Brunvand</PERSON> tells the apocryphal story of a wife who stopped her camper by the 
roadside for a moment, and then, not knowing that her husband had stepped out 
of the rear in his underwear, drove off, leaving him behind. 
</P>
<P>
That appears often as an urban myth, <PERSON>Brunvand</PERSON> says; yet it did happen to a <LOCATION>Red 
Bluff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, woman, whose husband stopped their camper at a gas station and 
then drove off, leaving her in a restroom with <MONEY>23 cents</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, it also happened to my recent acquaintance, <PERSON>Nardi Reeder Campion</PERSON>, 
who described the experience in Family Circle (<DATE>August, 1985</DATE>) under the title 
"Gas Station Blues." <PERSON>Mrs. Campion</PERSON> is the author of the much-pirated list of 
common conveniences invented after her <LOCATION>Wellesley</LOCATION> class of <DATE>1938</DATE> graduated -- or 
as she put it, things her class was before -- and I think of her as imaginative 
but believable. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mrs. Campion</PERSON> wrote that she and her husband were driving from <LOCATION>West Palm Beach</LOCATION> 
to <ORGANIZATION>Hobe Sound</ORGANIZATION> in a small rented car. She was asleep in the back seat when her 
husband stopped at a gas station to use the telephone. Without him seeing her 
leave, she got out and went to the women's room. He finished his call, got in 
the car and drove away. She waited impatiently for her husband to return. He 
did not. Having already missed the cocktail hour at <ORGANIZATION>Hobe Sound</ORGANIZATION>, she telephoned 
their host. He came after her. When they reached his house, her husband was 
already there, having a cocktail with their hostess. 
</P>
<P>
I not only believe <PERSON>Mrs. Campion</PERSON>'s story but I also believe that this same sort 
of thing must happen quite often -- too often to be called an urban myth. I 
might very well have driven off from a gas station and left my wife behind, 
except that she sleeps in the front seat, not the back, so I would probably 
have missed her sooner or later. I wonder, though, whether husbands don't 
sometimes drive off and leave their wives behind deliberately. Or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
However, a saguaro exploding with tarantulas is too improbable, it seems to me, 
even to be included in a book of fables. And that reporting such a fear to 911 
would get you the bomb squad is about as likely as getting a plumber on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  THE problem with plant rustlers goes beyond the Bay Area. In New York City,
for example, the "crack" cocaine epidemic has spurred the theft of begonias,
azaleas and other plants from yards and porches.;   The general view is that
drug users sell the hot plants for enough to make small purchases of crack, a
vial of which can be bought for just a few dollars.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     While a missing begonia is annoying, the loss of rare plants is a serious
matter. The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> says it recently loss seven <PERSON>Mead</PERSON>'s milkweed
plants only three inches high from the <ORGANIZATION>Shawnee National Forest</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Illinois.</LOCATION>;  
Because this milkweed is endangered, there's a <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the thief.;   Rare and endangered
cactuses and other desert plants are disappearing from their native habitat in
the <LOCATION>Mohave</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sonora</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> deserts. Spurred by the popularity of the
<LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION> look along with increasing use of low-water-using xeriscape
landscapes in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, thieves are looting the desert regions and
selling the plants on the sly. This widespread illegal collecting has resulted
in some species being added to the list of threatened or endangered cactuses.;
  In <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, looters are digging up the cycads -- particularly
Sago palms -- because they bring a high price. The trunk size determines the
Sago palm's worth. A small Sago costs about <MONEY>$400</MONEY>, but a 5-foot-tall specimen
could run as high as <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>.;   The theft of some rare cactuses resembling
stones from the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Botanic Garden</ORGANIZATION>'s educational greenhouse caused the
institution to place the remaining plants behind glass.  </TEXT>
