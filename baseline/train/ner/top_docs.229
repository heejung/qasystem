<LEADPARA>  It was the Montreal Olympics of 1976, in which the East German women's team
won 10 of 13 possible gold medals, that knocked the United States off its
throne as the world's supreme swimming power.;    But the '92 Olympics in
Barcelona, Spain, may see the United States restored to its former place atop
the swim hierarchy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women won their first world championship since <DATE>1978 last January</DATE>,
and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> men made the meet in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> their sixth straight title.;    "I
think you can read quite a bit into that," said Stanford swimming coach
<PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON>, who coached the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic team three years ago in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>South Korea.</LOCATION>;    Quick said the world championships were "the major focus of
the year for our premier athletes, and they were against the best athletes in
the world. I think that we're in pretty good position" for Barcelona.;    On
the brink of greatness?;  Part of the story in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> were world records
set by <PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON> (200-meter breaststroke) and <PERSON>Melvin Stewart</PERSON> (200
butterfly). Part was the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women's performance in recovering from a
disqualification in the 800 freestyle relay, in which they finished first, to
still top the medal and points standings.;    And part was the decline of a
reunited <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which suffered rather than gained from the change.;   
Although there are doubters -- notably '84 Olympic gold medalist <PERSON>Rowdy Gaines</PERSON>,
now a television commentator -- that the world championships and this week's
strong performances at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION> are indicative of
Olympic success, many coaches such as Quick see the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at the brink
of greatness.;    'You just don't know'; "A 16-, 17-year-old girl who set the
world on fire in <DATE>January</DATE> of '91 could be over the hill by the time <DATE>March</DATE> (date
of the Olympic trials) rolls around in <DATE>'92</DATE>," <PERSON>Gaines</PERSON> said. "You just don't
know. Look at <ORGANIZATION>Anita Nall</ORGANIZATION>. Who the heck is she? She came out of nowhere.";   
Actually <PERSON>Nall</PERSON>, 14, came out of <LOCATION>Towson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, and <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Spring
Nationals</ORGANIZATION>, she twice lowered the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> record in 200 breaststroke to the
second-fastest time in the world. The last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> woman to hold the 200
breaststroke world record was <PERSON>Catherine Ball</PERSON> in <DATE>1968.</DATE>;    <PERSON>Nall</PERSON> wasn't even on
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team at the world championships. That team was led by <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>,
who won two gold medals and one silver.;    <LOCATION>The U.S.</LOCATION> man-from-nowhere this
week is <PERSON>Joe Hudepohl</PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>, whose 100 freestyle was the
eighth-fastest in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, though only good enough for third place. He
wasn't at the world championships, either.;    <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> men hold world records in
six of 11 individual Olympic events: <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> (50 freestyle), <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>
(100 freestyle), <PERSON>Dave Berkoff</PERSON> (100 backstroke), <PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON> (200 breaststroke),
<PERSON>Pablo Morales</PERSON> (100 butterfly) and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> (200 butterfly). Only <PERSON>Morales</PERSON> is not
longer competing.;    After <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who holds three world records (400, 800 and
1,500 freestyle), the only ones by an active <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> woman, the top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women at
the world championships were <PERSON>Nicole Haislett</PERSON>, who won the 100 freestyle in
national-record time, and <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, winner of the 200 butterfly.;    The
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women topped the medals table 12-9 over <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the gold medal count 6-4
over <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, and team scoring 395-374 over Germany.;    "I think a lot of
(<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s decline) is the fact they were such rivals before (reunification),"
<PERSON>Gaines</PERSON> said. "It's going to take them a long time to jell as a team.;    "Then
you've got to remember <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> doesn't have the drugs behind them that
they used to, which was quite obvious at the worlds.";    A German magazine
recently documented <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s extensive illegal drug program.;    <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Swimming, the sport's national governing body, has reoriented its entire
training program toward producing gold medals at <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, including changing
the <ORGANIZATION>Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION> from the usual 25-yard short course to an international
50-meter course.;    That has upset some coaches and meet directors who
believe it will hurt national age-group development programs and take
big-name, ticket-selling swimmers away from <DATE>summer</DATE> meets.;    "I disagree,"
Quick said. "I think the focus of <ORGANIZATION>United States Swimming</ORGANIZATION> needs to be the
Olympic Games for elite-level athletes. Success at the Olympic Games will do
more for age-group swimming than anything I can think of."  </TEXT>

WHARTON BREAKS U.S. RECORD IN 400 MEDLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>David Wharton</PERSON>, competing in his home pool, set the first record of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Swimming Long Course National Championships</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton lowered his American record in the men's 400-meter individual medley to 
4 minutes 15.93 seconds in the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION> pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan star is competing at this meet in the name of <PERSON>Team Foxcatcher</PERSON>, his 
club team back home in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. But he will be back at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> as a junior in 
the <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Eric Namesnik</PERSON> pushed <PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> to the record, staying with <PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> through the 
fastest butterfly leg <PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> has ever recorded. Namesnik took the lead on the 
backstroke leg, stayed close through the breaststroke and pushed <PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> to his 
fastest freestyle leg ever. 
</P>
<P>
And that's pretty fast, considering <PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> once held the world record in the 
400 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> said that his first priority was to win the event and secure a berth on 
the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> team that will be competing in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> next month. "I was kind of 
nervous because I hadn't made the team yet," <PERSON>Wharton</PERSON> said. "Getting the record 
was an added bonus I'll certainly take. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt smooth tonight . . . Coming home I felt really strong." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton won the silver medal in this event in the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic Games, finishing 
behind <PERSON>Tamas Darnyi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Darnyi</PERSON> set the world record of 4:14.75. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will be taking special notice of <PERSON>Darnyi</PERSON>'s time in the upcoming 
European Championships in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wharton</LOCATION> smiled. "Of course," he said. "What 
he's done isn't out of my ballpark yet. . . . My objective will be to go faster 
in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton holds the American records in both the 200-yard and the 400-yard 
individual medleys and has been voted <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
swimmer of the year the <DATE>last two years</DATE>. He said that with the experience he has 
had in international swimming in the last few years, he is starting to feel 
more confident in that arena, too. 
</P>
<P>
He will be swimming the 200-meter individual medley here <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. "I'll be 
a lot more relaxed and confident for the 200, now that I've made the team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team</ORGANIZATION> won her second national title 
of the meet, in the 400-meter freestyle. But her 4:06.73 was no threat to the 
world record -- 4:03.85 -- that she set in winning the gold medal in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Heike Friedrich</PERSON> of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> chased her in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. And no one chased her 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. She is going to have to get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
Olympians <PERSON>Betsy Mitchell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dan Veatch</PERSON> both came out of retirement to win 
backstroke titles <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> won the women's 100-meter backstroke in 1:02.37, and <ORGANIZATION>Veatch</ORGANIZATION> won the 
men's 200-meter backstroke in 2:02.09. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>'s performance was especially impressive considering that her time, 
after only a few weeks of training, beat the 1:02.53 she swam here in '84 to 
win the Olympic silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell at one time held world records in both the 100- and 200-meter 
backstrokes and still holds the record in the 200. She was about as burned out 
as a swimmer can get when she scratched from the 200 during the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic 
trials last <DATE>summer</DATE> in her own <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> pool and then, after 
finishing fourth in the 100 in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, scratched from the medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling that would come up," <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> said. "I thought that would 
probably look pretty bad. I wasn't making a statement or anything with that 
scratch. I just felt like I wasn't going to go faster than <PERSON>Beth</PERSON> (<PERSON>Barr</PERSON>) was 
going to go. She was going faster at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the end of a really long rope . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really horrible being at the Olympics, but things were really 
different for me once I was a world record-holder. To tell you the truth, it 
was probably me assuming that people were putting the pressure on me. . . . 
Tonight I had fun swimming for the first time in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON>, 23, had been coaching at her alma mater, the <ORGANIZATION>Mercersburg Academy</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, when she decided in early <DATE>July</DATE> that she wanted to swim again. She 
drove to <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> in her jeep to work out with her former college coach, 
<ORGANIZATION>Richard Quick</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Brent Lang of Club Wolverine</ORGANIZATION>, a member of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic team as a relay 
swimmer, won the 100-meter freestyle in 50.17. <PERSON>Nichole Haislett</PERSON> won the women's 
100-meter freestyle in 56.15. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The last time <PERSON>Carrie Steinseifer</PERSON> competed in a championship final in the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> 
pool, she finished in a tie with <PERSON>Nancy Hogshead</PERSON> to win the <DATE>1984</DATE> Olympic gold 
medal in the 100-meter freestyle. Steinseifer finished in a tie for sixth place 
with <PERSON>Janel Jorgensen</PERSON> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. . . . <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> tuned up for his 50-meter swim 
against <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> by swimming the 100-meter freestyle <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. He 
finished third in 50.4, earning a spot on the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> team. The top four 
finishers in the 100-meter freestyle make it in order to fill the 400-meter 
freestyle relay. . . . Longhorn Aquatics led the team competition after the 
third day, leading also in both the men's competition and the women's 
competition.

   Big Splash at Ooey-Pooey

<LP>
   Indianapolis -- Perhaps the best measure of the strength
of the U.S. Olympic swimming team that was selected by trial
of water here last week was a quip that Eddie Reese, who will
coach the men's team at Barcelona next July, made Friday
morning, after his roster was all but filled. Reese knew he
would have in his charge no fewer than six reigning world
record holders, yet he was able to say, almost
straight-facedly, that he'd "offered Mark Schubert (the
women's team coach) money if he'd switch jobs with me."
   Added Reese, eyes atwinkle: "Most of the talk here has
been about the women, and how tough they look. And, hey, I
agree. I'd have to think hard before I'd put my boys against
them head-to-head."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the talk was about the women because a couple of
them did their world-record busting at the <ORGANIZATION>Phillips 66
National Swimming Championships</ORGANIZATION> on the campus of <ORGANIZATION>Indiana
University-Purdue University-Indianapolis</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>IUPUI</LOCATION>), which
natives of the Hoosier metropolis shorten to "Ooey-Pooey."
The meet doubled as the Olympic Trials, with the top two
finishers in each event qualifying.
   Last <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the event's first day, <PERSON>Jenny Thompson</PERSON>, 19, a
blue-eyed blonde from <ORGANIZATION>Stanford U.</ORGANIZATION> via <LOCATION>Dover</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, churned
the 100-meter freestyle in the unprecedented :54.48. The next
day <PERSON>Anita Nall</PERSON>, a stuffed-owl-loving, 15-year-old wunderkind
from <LOCATION>Towson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, took the 200-meter breaststroke, in a
record 2:25.92. Before the waves died down on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
two more American women's records fell and two others were
nudged severely.
   But this is not to say Our Boys did poorly. Charmin'
<PERSON>Melvin Stewart</PERSON>, a voluble Tennessean, on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> swam
the 200-meter butterfly in 1:55.72, just .03-second above his
own world mark, and a couple hours later <PERSON>Jeff Rouse</PERSON>, a
bespectacled Stanfordian, missed his 100-meter backstroke
record by .14-second, at :54.07.
   And in the highlight of a memorable evening-indeed, maybe
of the whole meet-Matt <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, the giant (6-foot-7) hero of
the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> (he won seven medals, five of them
gold), edged world-record-holder <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> by .05-second in
the 50-meter freestyle final, with his time of :22.12 pacing
the fastest eight-man field in the history of the event.
   "Our goal in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>?" Reese would echo. "To win all the
medals, of course. Although we probably won't do it."
   Chances look good, though, that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers will do
better at <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> than they did at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, where their
18-medal haul was this country's lowest in 28 years. The rosy
outlook stems partly from the demise of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, which
dominated the women's side of the sport in the <DATE>1976</DATE>, '80 and
'88 Games.
   When the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall came down, so did the wall of silence
that surrounded steroid use by East German athletes, and the
fact that <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nall</PERSON> broke records formerly held by
East Germans was cause for some breast-beating here. "It's
good to see that drug-enhanced records have been broken by
our girls, swimming clean," said <PERSON>Dennis Pursley</PERSON>, national
team director for <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming</ORGANIZATION>, the sport's domestic
governing body. When pressed, <PERSON>Pursley</PERSON> admitted that drugs
still may be present in the sport. "Techniques to cheat
remain ahead of techniques to test," he allowed. But he
added, "I know our people, and know they'd never use them."
   While <PERSON>Pursley</PERSON> didn't mention it, one American woman,
sprinter <PERSON>Angel Myers</PERSON>, tested positive for steroids after
qualifying for the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic team, and was barred from the
Games. <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> has maintained she never used the drugs. Now 24
years old, married and last-named <PERSON>Martino</PERSON>, she's back in the
sport after serving a suspension. She qualified in the
50-meter free-style and 400-meter free-style relay, but said
that restoring her reputation was not her motive. "I don't
think about that (the <DATE>1988</DATE> incident)," she said quietly.
"Maybe I block it out."
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers hope they'll have a couple of other things
going for them. One will be the extra training that team
members can glean from having the Trials in early <DATE>March</DATE>,
nearly five months before the Games. The '88 Trials were just
six weeks before the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> fest, and it turned out that some
swimmers couldn't hold their competitive peaks that long. But
it should be recalled that the '88 format seemed like a good
idea at the time.
   Probably more important will be the results of the
increased financial help available to top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic
hopefuls over the last quadrennium; whatever other adjectives
might apply to swimmers, "poor" no longer is one of them.
Last year, <DATE>1988</DATE> triple-gold-medal winner <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>,
breaststroke world-record holder <PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>
each collected more than <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> in aid, and 17 other
swimmers got <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> or more. The upshot is a <DATE>1992</DATE> men's team
that averages 23 years old, and a women's crew that averages
20, both about two years above <DATE>'88</DATE>.
   "I'm here because I love the sport . . . and can afford to
keep pursuing it," affirmed <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, 26, who qualified for the
50and 100-meter freestyles and the 400-meter freestyle relay.
   The 20-year-old <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> will be back, too, having won the
400- and 800-meter freestyles that she captured at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, but
having failed to qualify in the 400-meter individual medley,
which she also won in <DATE>'88</DATE>. Along with <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nall</PERSON>, much
of the women's spotlight fell on <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, a
19-year-old Californian. She qualified impressively in four
individual events and earned other accolades as well.
   "This is not only our best women's team ever, but also the
best looking," declared <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON>. "I'd be willing to grovel
for a date with Summer."
   "Melvin?" responded the dark-haired <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> when informed
of the above. "He hardly talks to any of the girls."
   Swimmingwise, experience was a stronger theme among the
men. Qualifiers included 27-year-old <PERSON>Pablo Morales</PERSON>, whose
<DATE>1984</DATE> world record in the 100-meter butterfly still stands but
who failed to qualify for the '88 team, and <PERSON>David Berkoff</PERSON>,
25, a silver medalist in the 100-meter backstroke at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>
who disgustedly quit the sport for a time after the
underwater technique he'd pioneered was banned.
   But they also include <PERSON>Joe Hudepohl</PERSON>, an 18-year-old
<LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> high schooler, who won the 200-meter free-style
and later showed there was something else to be said for
youth. Did the "pressure" make the Trials a trial, he was
asked. "Not really," he responded. "Our high school meets are
like this."

BARROWMAN RECORD BRINGS WORLD-CLASS STATURE TO OPENING DAY

<P>
Hoping for at least one world record <DATE>Friday</DATE> to give Goodwill Games II 
credibility as a world-class athletic competition on its opening day, 
organizers were rewarded for their blood, sweat and deficit-spending with 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Because all three records came in the same race at the <ORGANIZATION>King County Aquatics 
Center</ORGANIZATION>, the impact was somewhat limited. But it was one great race. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> senior from <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, won the 
200-meter breaststroke in 2:11.53, bettering the previous record he set last 
<DATE>August</DATE> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> by a staggering 1.36 seconds. No other swimmer had improved the 
record in the event by more than that since <DATE>1976</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Although they did not challenge <PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kirk Stackle</PERSON>, a recent <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Texas</ORGANIZATION> graduate from <LOCATION>Penasquitos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Sergio Lopez</PERSON>, a Spaniard who 
competes for <ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, also broke the old record of 
2:12.89. They tied for second place in 2:12.24. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman, 21, said that he was surprised by his time but not by the fact that 
the race produced a world record. He trains with <PERSON>Lopez</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> under 
Hungarian Coach <PERSON>Jozsef Nagy</PERSON> and knew from recent workouts that they both were 
ready for a fast swim. Lopez's time earned a European record, a first for a 
Spanish swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend and I have trained a lot harder than we did <DATE>last summer</DATE>," <PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON> 
said. "This is the first time I ever came into a competition not being nervous, 
completely relaxed. Something inside said I knew I was going to swim well and 
don't worry about it. That's very unusual for me. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am very surprised by the time. If somebody had asked me before the race, 
I would have said that we might swim 2:12.88. I would have been happy with 
anything under 2:12. But 2:11.53 is not something I thought was a reality. It 
was more like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a record to be set on the opening day of the 17-day, 21-sport 
Goodwill Games, organizers anticipated it most likely would come in swimming's 
first event, the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the race's co-favorites, <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>, have 
broken the record in the event eight times since <DATE>1985</DATE>, no one who values his 
money would have bet against it. 
</P>
<P>
In 19 meetings at either 50 meters or 50 yards since <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Jager</PERSON>, formerly of 
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and now of <LOCATION>Tijeras</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, had won 13 before <DATE>Friday</DATE>. But <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, who 
graduated from <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> and now lives in <LOCATION>Castro Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, won the big one at 
the <DATE>1988</DATE> Summer Olympics in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. He also won six other medals, five golds. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the sellout crowd of 2,472 were still filing into the new arena between 
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION> when <PERSON>Jager</PERSON> and <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> were scheduled to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for some of the late arrivals, there were two false-starts by 
anxious rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"That was their only chance," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said, dismissing <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Nils 
Rudolph</PERSON>'s beating both him and Jager this month in <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, <PERSON>Jager</PERSON> had won the last four meetings with <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> and led in this 
one for about 25 meters. But <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> overtook him and then held off a late surge 
about 10 meters from the finish to win in 22.10 seconds. Jager was second in 
22.31, well off his world record of 21.81. Rudolph was fourth in 22.61. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, who has complained because swimmers are not being paid for competing 
here while athletes in some other sports are receiving thousands of dollars, 
valued the victory as an advertisement for the "Dash for Cash" match races that 
he and Jager are staging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for me and for the sport of swimming that I'm seen as a viable 
contender in the 50," he said. "Tom's been beating me up pretty bad. It's good 
for me and for the sport to know that I can beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Interrupted Jager, "It was all planned." 
</P>
<P>
In the other featured event, the women's 800-meter freestyle, <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>' only 
problem came about 10 meters into the race, when she lost her goggles. She won 
in 8:28.47, and second place <PERSON>Anke Moehring</PERSON> of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> swam 8:33.44. 
</P>
<P>
A closer race was expected. Evans, the gold medalist in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, was joined by 
silver medalist <PERSON>Astrid Strauss</PERSON> of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> and bronze medalist <PERSON>Julie 
McDonald</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. McDonald was fourth and <PERSON>Strauss</PERSON> fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the field might have been faster," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> sophomore 
from <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>. "I kind of hoped it would be more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> were stars of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimming team in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON> 
was one of its few disappointments. After setting an American record in the 200 
breaststroke at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trials in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, he was favored to win at the 
Olympics. But he finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the pain has been eased by the three world records he has set since 
then in the event. But he has not forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it continues to haunt me," he said. "If it stops, that means it's time 
to stop swimming. Setting records helps, but I hope it still burns down there."

<P>
<PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON>, a silver medalist in the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympics, said he wants to prove that 
older swimmers can compete in a sport dominated by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, 24, who works as an aquatics director in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>, showed 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> that he is fast enough to win major competitions with a victory in the 
50-meter freestyle during the third day of the <ORGANIZATION>International Swim Meet of 
Champions at Mission Viejo</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who was edged by <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> for the gold medal in the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic 50, 
was clocked in 23.74 seconds. <PERSON>Brian Kurza</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> finished second in 24.15 and 
<PERSON>Brian Jacobson</PERSON>, 15, of the <ORGANIZATION>Bellflower Aquatic Club</ORGANIZATION> was third in 24.35. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have scrambled a bit much in my race, and that might have slowed me down 
a bit," said <PERSON>Jager</PERSON>, whose 23.60 was the top qualifying time in <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 
<TIME>morning</TIME>'s preliminaries. Jager, who wants to break <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>'s world record of 
22.14 set during the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Games, said he decided to continue competing to 
serve as a role model for younger competitors as well as help find ways for 
athletes to stay in the sport after they complete their college careers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot still needs to be done in the sport," <PERSON>Jager</PERSON> said. "United States 
Swimming (the sport's governing body in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>) needs to take better 
care of our athletes than they are doing now so we can continue to train and 
stay in the sport after they complete college." 
</P>
<P>
Still a teen-ager, <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION> need only worry about winning, 
which she did twice <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Evans, the world-record holder in the 400-meter 
freestyle, won that event in 4:13.55. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Laurence Bensimon</PERSON> finished second in 4:19.65 and <PERSON>Francie O'Leary</PERSON> of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Click Tucson Swim Club</ORGANIZATION> was third in 4:19.65. 
</P>
<P>
Evans held off <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo High School</ORGANIZATION> senior <PERSON>Suzi Burt</PERSON> to win the 200 
backstroke in 2:18.53. Burt, who stayed with <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> during the first half of the 
race, ns was second in 2:22.27, and <ORGANIZATION>Natalie Norberg of Industry Hills</ORGANIZATION> was third 
in 2:23.51. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who won the 400-meter individual medley but 
finished fourth in the 200 butterfly <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter freestyle, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s Artur Wojdat scored his third 
victory of the meet by edging <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat, who battled with <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> for the lead for most of the race, had a 
strong last 100 meters to win. Wojdat was timed in 3:55.09, <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> 3:56.63. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat's fellow <ORGANIZATION>Pole and Mission Viejo Nadadore</ORGANIZATION> swim club teammate <ORGANIZATION>Mariusz 
Podkoscielny</ORGANIZATION> was third in 3:57.77, and <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON>Lars</PERSON>, was 
fourth in 4:00.80.

A BUSY EVANS TO COMPETE IN MEET BEGINNING TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, who took very little time off after the Olympics in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> <DATE>last 
September</DATE> before getting back into her incredible training regimen, somehow 
managed to train, handle a crush of requests for appearances, parades and award 
dinners and still compete for <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High School</ORGANIZATION> and her 
<ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team</ORGANIZATION>, knocking off distance swim records all along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
She's tough over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
Today, just one day after her high school graduation ceremonies, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is 
opening her long-course season in the Swim Meet of Champions at <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION>. 
Evans will swim the 800 at <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> and will compete every day in the meet that 
continues through <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also plans to swim the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, 
200-meter breaststroke, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, 
400-meter individual medley and the 400-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Finals start at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday, Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will be attending Stanford in the <DATE>fall</DATE> and swimming there under the 
direction of <PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON>, former Olympic coach and former women's coach at 
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>, has been working with <PERSON>Don Wagner</PERSON>, the new coach of her 
<ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Aquatics</ORGANIZATION> team. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>, a former assistant at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>, replaced <PERSON>Bud 
McAllister</PERSON>, who coached <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> to three Olympic gold medals before moving on to 
a club in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> broke the 1,650-yard freestyle record that had been set by 
<ORGANIZATION>Olympian Tiffany Cohen</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>. She lowered it from 15 minutes 46.54 seconds to 
15:44.98. And in <DATE>March</DATE>, at the <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION> 66/U.S. <ORGANIZATION>Swimming Short Course Nationals</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, she broke <PERSON>Cohen</PERSON>'s American record in the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. She lowered that record from 9:28.32 to 9:25.49. 
</P>
<P>
It may take her a meet or two to get up to speed in this long-course season, 
but <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is planning to compete in all the major meets. She is one of the 
stars that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming is planning to use both in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> 
meet, and in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, against the Soviets, just days later. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can do it . . . 
</P>
<P>
The annual meet at <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION> has recently acquired <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> as a sponsor, 
which could mean that it will again be able to pay travel expenses for the top 
caliber swimmers who used to be attracted to the meet when it was sponsored by 
Seventeen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the swimmers on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> are competing either in the <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> 
meet <DATE>July 7-9</DATE> or in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Invitational <DATE>July 13-16</DATE>. East Coast 
swimmers will be competing in the <LOCATION>Charlotte Ultra</LOCATION> Swim Invitational <DATE>June 22-25</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Invitational</ORGANIZATION>, which will be held at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, has drawn not only 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, but also Olympian Sylvia Poll of <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. USC Olympians <PERSON>Dave Wharton</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Dan Jorgensen</PERSON> are also scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Invitational</ORGANIZATION> will be televised by <ORGANIZATION>TBS</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
All of the early <DATE>summer</DATE> meets are tuneups for the Phillips 66/U.S. <ORGANIZATION>Swimming 
Long Course National Championships</ORGANIZATION>, which also will be held at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>July 
31-Aug</DATE>. 4. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> is not ready to say when he plans to race again, but there is 
little doubt that he will. Somehow, somewhere and no doubt for some profit, 
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> will sprint against his old nemesis, <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> chooses to skip the long-course national meet and, therefore, the <ORGANIZATION>Pan 
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> meet, it is likely that he will swim a match race with Jager -- a 
prospect that no doubt would attract network television. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi quit the national water polo team last week just before reporting to the 
<LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> for the filming of a <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> project in which, of course, he swims with the 
dolphins he has grown to love. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> has not raced since his final Olympic event last <DATE>September</DATE>. He swam the 
butterfly leg for the 400-meter medley relay that won gold, and then announced 
that he would be putting all of his athletic efforts into making the national 
water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the water polo team has kept him in shape, and he would certainly 
be of value to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team -- especially on the relays -- if he did decide to 
qualify for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> meet. As <PERSON>Jeff Dimond</PERSON> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming put it: "If 
<PERSON>Matt</PERSON> decides to swim again, we'll be turning cartwheels." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pat Hines</PERSON> will defend her title as women's champion in the <LOCATION>United States Ten 
Mile Swim</LOCATION> in this year's ocean race along a course that runs between <LOCATION>Huntington 
Beach</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Seal Beach</ORGANIZATION>. Hines is using the race to gain attention for her quest 
to make an endurance swim an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to see a 10-mile swim become a demonstration event in <DATE>1992</DATE> and a 
medal event by <DATE>1996</DATE>. According to <LOCATION>Hines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming and its masters program 
have submitted the event for Olympic consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Endurance swimming deserves Olympic status," she says. "It is an international 
sport, it demands the highest levels of skill and training, and it is 
incredibly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> sent a team of swimmers to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> for a meet at 
<LOCATION>Tallinn</LOCATION> <DATE>June 2-4</DATE> and the young women fared surprisingly well. They won nine 
gold medals, seven silver and one bronze in the 16 events, including an upset 
gold in the 400-meter medley relay. <PERSON>Pam Minthorn</PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION>Gaithersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, who 
swims for <ORGANIZATION>Curl-Burke Swim Club</ORGANIZATION>, won the 200-meter freestyle in 2:02.32, the 
100-meter butterfly in 1:01.5, and the 200-meter butterfly in 2:13.18. Summer 
<PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION>Roseville</LOCATION>, who swims for the <ORGANIZATION>California Capital Aquatics</ORGANIZATION>, won 
both individual medleys. . . . <PERSON>Don Gambril</PERSON> has been named coach of the men's 
team and <PERSON>Dick Shoulberg</PERSON> has been named coach of the women's team for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan 
Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION>, the Alamo Cup and the World Cup meet to be held in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>January</DATE>.

<P>
"I had a sense of where he was, but I never really looked at him." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse made an error on his final turn. "I jammed the wall," he said. "I was

14th. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Brent Lang</PERSON>, who won the 50 freestyle on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, was disqualified

   It's quiz time again. 
How many of you can name three famous sporting Blanchards? 

   Of course, there's "Doc" -- real first name <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> -- who won the <DATE>1945</DATE> Heisman Trophy playing fullback for the <ORGANIZATION>U. of Army</ORGANIZATION> football team. 
And <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON>, who played catcher and outfield on a lot of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' championship baseball teams of the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and '60s. 
But how about the third? 

   As of last week, you'd have to include <PERSON>Mary Ellen Blanchard</PERSON>, <PERSON>Doc</PERSON>'s 16-year-old granddaughter. 
She showed up at the <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION> 66/U.S. 
Swimming Long Course Championships here and came away with a full medal packet: A gold for winning the women's 200-meter breaststroke, a silver for taking second in the 100, and a bronze for a third place in the 200-meter individual medley. 

   Freckled <PERSON>Mary Ellen</PERSON>, from <LOCATION>Norcross</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, emerged not only bemedaled but also bedecked with praise from none less than <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s three-golds aquatic queen of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
Still giggly despite having achieved the advanced age of 17, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> won four races here, three of them by furlongs instead of body lengths, but edged <PERSON>Blanchard</PERSON> and second-place <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, also 16, by only one second and change in the 200 IM. 

   "That was a race]" <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> enthused after the win. 
"It was neat having someone near me at the finish." 
She said she entered the 200, her shortest event ever in a national meet, because she knew that she'd get heat from <PERSON>Blanchard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>. 
She added: "Usually, the kids who do well the year after an Olympics hang around for the next three years. 
That definitely should include <PERSON>Mary Ellen</PERSON> and <DATE>Summer</DATE>." 

   That this is, indeed, the first (and usually quietest) year of the four-year Olympic cycle that governs swimming and other sports that come to popular life only quadrennially was apparent from a glance at the meet's surrounding. 
Its site was the 50-meter outdoor pool on the campus of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION>, where up to 14,000 people crowded high-rise bleachers for the swimming segment of the <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Olympics of <DATE>1984</DATE>. 
Now the bleachers are gone, and despite four California-perfect days, the pool's permanent seating of about 2,000 was mostly more than adequate to accommodate the usual complement of parents and teachers. 

   Sad to say, a goodly portion of the throng that showed up on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the final day, went home feeling cheated. 
The day's -- and perhaps meet's -- main event was to be a rematch in the men's 50- meter freestyle between <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>, the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic titlist and world's record holder, and <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON>, the runnerup at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> and the ex-record holder. 
But one false start disqualified Jager and another removed <PERSON>Todd Pace</PERSON>, the fourth-fastest qualifier, cutting the field to six. 
And when the race finally did get off, the 6-foot-7 <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> started a whit slowly, maybe enough to have cost him another mark. 
His winner's time of 22.36 seconds was .22-second over his standard, and he later remarked that his first two starts were better. 

   It's worth noting that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> rule on false starts differs from the international one, which gives fields two misfires before heads are lopped. 
It's also worth noting that a rules issue detracted from another event, the backstroke. 
<PERSON>David Berkoff</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> student, revolutionized that stroke's 100-meter race, and set a world's record last year, by swimming the first 30 or so yards underwater. 
But after the Olympics, the sport's killjoy world governing body, <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION>, decreed that, henceforth, backstrokers must surface by the 10-meter mark. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> retains the crowd-pleasing unlimited-underwater rule for domestic use, but used the <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION> statute here because the Nationals were the qualifying race for a team that will compete in the international <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> meet in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> later in the month. 
Still, the no-false-starts rule wasn't altered. 

   "If we went with <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION> on the backstroke, why not on the starts, too?" asked Jager afterwards. 
He'd remonstrated with officials after he got the hook -- while fans chanted "Let him swim]" -- but later cooled off and called his disqualification "part of the game." 
No one, however, could answer his question about the rules hodgepodge. 

   As is typical of most post-Olympic-year meets, the swim nationals were contested by a mix of vets and newcomers, and the vets generally posted the best times. 
The stopwatch highlight was a new world's record of 2:12.90 in the men's 200-meter breaststroke by <PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> student who'd finished fourth in the event at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
He did it in the <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> prelims, and while his time in the afternoon finals was nearly two seconds higher (he said he got water in his goggles) it still earned him a first. 

   "My mother, father and girlfriend hated me this <DATE>summer</DATE> for spending so much time in the pool, but this makes it worthwhile," the slim <PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON> said of his mark. 

   Spending a lot of time in the pool is what swimming is all about. 
It seems like a drag, but some of the returning vets, including <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, a seven-medal winner at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, admitted that life without laps wasn't what he thought it might be, so he ended a post-O Game retirement to swim again here. 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who has grown two inches (to 5-foot-6) since <DATE>last year</DATE> and soon will enter <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, said she still enjoys being wet even though she hasn't trained as intensively as she did in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 

   But rest assured that the killer instinct of <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who plans to stick around through <DATE>'92</DATE>, is intact. 
Asked what she thinks about when she turns for home pool-lengths ahead of rivals, she said, "How to get farther ahead." 

   <PERSON>Mary Ellen Blanchard</PERSON> was one of a batch of other teen-aged winners among the women, but if genetics count she well might turn out best. 
Besides grandpa <PERSON>Doc</PERSON>, father Tony and brother <PERSON>Rhett</PERSON> play or played football and mom <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> and sister <PERSON>Lee Anne</PERSON> are tennis aces. 
"In my family, it's compete or die," she smiles. 
At 5-foot-9 and 127 pounds she has the size of a pool champ, and the proper interests. 
Her hobbies? 
"Music, reading, doing laps."

THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT FOR STANFORD'S SANDERS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the anthropology professor explained that the expectation level is the 
primary difference between humans and monkeys, a few students skimmed The 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford Daily</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Others thumbed through the syllabus, making notations for a research paper that 
had just been assigned. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, though, the professor made a declaration that caught the attention of 
<PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, the lanky blonde in the 15th row of the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings live in a world that doesn't exist," he said. "A world of worries 
and dreams that have not occurred yet. Monkeys live only in the present, not in 
the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, there is no better time than the present. If her freshman year at 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> is anything like her freshman year -- which she calls the best year of 
her life -- at <ORGANIZATION>Oakmont High</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Roseville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, she has it made. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if she thinks ahead to this weekend's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Open or the World Swimming 
Championships in <DATE>January</DATE> or the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympic Games, she'll go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"You only have so much worrying in you," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. "I hate worrying and 
being nervous for races. I like to talk and laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> can excuse the swimming world for wanting to press fast 
forward. Expectations are high since her triple gold-medal performance in the 
Goodwill Games last <DATE>July</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' clocking of 2 minutes 9.46 seconds in the 200-meter butterfly was the 
second-fastest ever by an American and the fastest in the world in <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Despite qualifying last in the 200 individual medley, she struck gold again in 
2:14.06, the fastest time by an American since <PERSON>Tracy Caulkins</PERSON>' effort in the 
<DATE>1984</DATE> Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
And in the meet's biggest upset, <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> handed <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> her first defeat 
since <DATE>1986</DATE>, knocking an astonishing 8.68 seconds off her 400 individual medley 
best. <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' clocking of 4:39.22 is the fastest in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Though <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> is 3.12 seconds shy of <PERSON>Petra Schneider</PERSON>'s <DATE>1982</DATE> world record, 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford Coach Richard Quick</ORGANIZATION> believes <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> eventually will break it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no question in my mind," said Quick, who also serves as 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national team women's coach. "Summer <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> has the potential in the 400 
individual medley to go under the world record." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> despises that event, a sequence of 100 meters of butterfly, 
backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle that some coaches call the toughest race 
because of the stroke versatility and stamina it demands. "If I never swam 
another 400 IM in my life, I'd probably be the happiest person in the world," 
<PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. "It is the hardest thing ever." 
</P>
<P>
Like many medley swimmers, <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> was an age-group breast-stroker. A pulled 
muscle prevented her from training in the breast-stroke for a few months and 
sparked her interest in and mastery of the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Her butterfly rivals the efficiency of <PERSON>Mary T. Meagher</PERSON>," Quick said of the 
world record-holder in the 100 and 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' second leg was a weak link. But her club coach, <PERSON>Mike 
Hastings</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>California Capital Aquatics</ORGANIZATION>, developed her into a national-caliber 
backstroker. 
</P>
<P>
The third leg, breaststroke, has always been a strength. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains for <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> to improve is her freestyle, a segment that most 
medley swimmers don't struggle with because much of their training is in 
freestyle. Although <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' freestyle is above average, it doesn't compare to 
her other strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Her ability to stave off <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, the world record-holder in three distance 
freestyle events, was a breakthrough. "(Rivals) always pass me," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. 
"I've been passed many times." 
</P>
<P>
The most painful of those occurred at the <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympic</ORGANIZATION> trials in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Tex</LOCATION>. Sanders led by a body length with 50 meters left when <PERSON>Mary Wayte</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Whitney Hedgepeth</PERSON> passed her and became the two representatives the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> sent to <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>Oakmont High</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' classmates staged a rally that cheered her up, 
despite her reluctance to be in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about the rally," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said, "because if I'd known about it, 
I wouldn't have shown up. I was kind of embarrassed. I started crying up there 
in front of the whole school. I felt (foolish). But it was nice. . . . I was 
real honored." 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> yearns to be accepted, she wants the option of being 
unconventional. That is what binds her family in their own definition of 
togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' parents divorced when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what it was," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. "All I remember is that my friend's 
parents had just gotten divorced. Her parents were buying her all these toys so 
when my parents told me they were getting divorced I said, 'Yes. Toys! Woo!' I 
had no idea what a divorce was." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders found out soon enough that it meant moving from one parent's home to 
the other every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I would move from one house to another, I seriously probably 
couldn't talk for a day," she said. "I was so sad. I'd sit there and cry for 
about most of the day. You get so used to coming home and there's your dad and 
you do certain things with him, and then you all of a sudden move and your dad 
is not there. And me with my swimming, I didn't see him that much, you know. I 
maybe talked to him a couple times a week. We'd go out to dinner every once in 
a while and go to a movie, but it wasn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
It became more difficult at 15 when her older brother, <PERSON>Trevor</PERSON>, stopped making 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of a bummer when I had to leave him," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. "But I like 
going to my mom's so I kept at it." 
</P>
<P>
That has been the key to <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' sunny disposition, maintaining warm 
relationships with her father, her mother, her brother and her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really close to all the parts of my family," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. "I think I want 
my kids to have the same family I do. God, they're so laid back. You know, it's 
not like you have to do this, otherwise you'll be a bad person. Like, if you 
want to, you can. It is totally up to us. When I think about church, it was up 
to us. My swimming was up to me. " 
</P>
<P>
Summer <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, nickname Scum, reveals nothing about swimming on the canvas of 
collegiate personality, her dorm room walls. 
</P>
<P>
They are plastered with <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON> posters and she wears Air Jordans that 
<PERSON>Trevor</PERSON> gave her on graduation day, the ones she slept in that night. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' roommate didn't even know she was living with a world-class swimmer 
until one of <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>' swimming friends told her. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is equally eager to conceal her academic prowess. She makes no mention 
of her <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming Academic All-American status. Sanders is intimidated by 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, I was real worried because people were using these huge 
words, and I'm into the simple kind of stuff," she said. "One day my friend <PERSON>Lea 
Loveless</PERSON> and I were walking down the hall when someone said something about 
mendicants. 
</P>
<P>
"I said <PERSON>'Lea</PERSON>, my vocabulary is not very good, what is mendicants?' and she 
said, 'Oh God, <DATE>Summer</DATE>, it is a singing group.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is not something she's going to worry about, however. Sanders tries not to 
look back or forward. 
</P>
<P>
Her faithful watch ever on her wrist, she simply follows her demanding academic 
and athletic schedule, including predawn swims while the rest of the campus 
sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
Her idea of a good time? Whatever is going on right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I could just sit here in my dorm room looking at my pictures," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. 
"I could listen to music. I could read this Homer book ('The Iliad') . . . oh, 
just kidding."

<LEADPARA>  It took three years to do it, but Angel Martino, who was disqualified from the
1988 Olympic team, is once again a national champion.;    Martino, of
Tuscaloosa, Ala., won the 50-meter freestyle in the U.S. Swimming Spring
Nationals on the final evening of the meet Sunday in 25.88 seconds.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MARTINO A NATIONAL CHAMPION -- AGAIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     She was making her comeback in this meet after serving a suspension for a
positive steroid test following the '88 Olympic trials, when she was unmarried
<PERSON>Angel Myers</PERSON>. Martino had led the first half of the 100 freestyle <DATE>earlier this
week</DATE> but faded to fifth. She was sixth in the 100 butterfly.;    After both
races, she said that lack of training and competition during and after her
16-month suspension had cost her endurance. But the 50, a no-turn dash from
one end of the <ORGANIZATION>King County Aquatics Center</ORGANIZATION> pool to the other, proved to be her
distance.;    "I'm getting there," said <PERSON>Martino</PERSON>, 23, one of the oldest
swimmers at the meet. "I feel old.";    She'll drop the 200 individual medley,
previously one of her best events, from her program because of her age, she
said. But she'll try to qualify for the '92 Olympics in the three races she
swam in this meet.;    <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> won her fourth event of the meet with a
time of 16 minutes, 11.22 seconds in the 1,500 freestyle, the 10th-fastest
time ever. Evans holds four of the top 10 1,500 times, including the world
record at 15:52.10 set at the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic trials. She also earned sixth place
in the 200 backstroke and was the highest point-scorer of the meet, with 80.; 
  "I'm excited to get back to training hard," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who is leaving
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> to concentrate on the '92 Games. "I know what I want, I'm going to
work hard for it, and I'm willing to do that.";    No world records fell in
the meet despite it being the qualifier for three <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> teams being sent to
international meets this <DATE>summer</DATE>: the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Championships</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>,

After breezing to another national title in the women's 400-meter individual 
medley <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night in the <LOCATION>Phillips</LOCATION> 66/U.S. <ORGANIZATION>Swimming Long Course National 
Championships</ORGANIZATION>, 17-year-old <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> said that she was starting to feel old. 
</P>
<P>
Not that she was aching in her bones or gasping for breath. But it's not the 
same as it was in the old days, when she swam in her first long course national 
meet at age 13. When she was a new kid and hung around with the other new kids, 
gawking at the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Now when she walks from the awards stand to the interview room, little girls 
follow along to peek in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's the star. 
</P>
<P>
The down side to stardom is that there is no one to push her. 
</P>
<P>
She had some competition when she won the gold medal in the 400 IM during the 
Olympic Games in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, enough to push her to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> record of 4 minutes 37.76 
seconds. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, she won in 4:39.36 with <PERSON>Michelle Griglione</PERSON> almost eight 
seconds behind her. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, her first of this meet, puts her on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team that will 
compete at the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and then in a dual meet against the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard racing against the clock," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "I like to have 
competition. But what can you do? . . . I want to go faster at <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. But there 
probably won't be anyone there, either. I'll have to do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested that she might get some competition when she meets the 
Soviets in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, she brightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," she said. "There is a Soviet girl who has a really fast 400 IM. I 
hadn't thought about that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the excitement and the competition of the Olympic Games made 
everything else seem like a letdown, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> answered with her trademark smile 
and shrug: "The Olympics only come around every four years, and there are a lot 
of other meets in between that." 
</P>
<P>
Two 16-year-olds won the other women's events <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mary Ellen Blanchard</PERSON> (granddaughter of <DATE>1945</DATE> Heisman Trophy winner <PERSON>Doc 
Blanchard</PERSON>) won the women's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:31.59, and <PERSON>Julie Kole</PERSON> 
(who had won the 1,500-meter freestyle <DATE>Monday</DATE>) won the women's 200-meter 
freestyle in 2:00.95. 
</P>
<P>
Rich <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON>, 27, a swimmer who could tell <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> what it is to feel old on 
the deck, won the men's 100-meter breaststroke. <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON>, who won a gold medal 
with the 400-meter medley relay team in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, has left his job as an 
accountant with <ORGANIZATION>Price Waterhouse</ORGANIZATION> to become a carpenter. He prefers the physical 
work to the hours behind the desk. But his hours for weightlifting and training 
are still limited. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he continue to swim? 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to do it because I thrive on competition," <PERSON>Schroeder</PERSON> said. 
"Physically, I don't think I was ready to go 1:02.4, but, boy, I don't like to 
get beat, so I did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (the younger guys) like me hanging around, but I want to keep 
them honest. They'll pass me eventually, but they'll have to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Doug Gjertsen</PERSON>, 22, who won two gold medals on relay teams in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, has 
completed a suspension for his limited involvement in the mask-napping caper in 
<LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, and is again competing for <ORGANIZATION>Longhorn Aquatics</ORGANIZATION>. Gjertsen beat fellow 
Olympian <PERSON>Melvin Stewart</PERSON> in the men's 200-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wade King</PERSON>, who won the men's 100-meter butterfly, heard <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> saying that she 
felt old and commented: "How does she think I feel?" King is 22 and is just now 
starting to make his mark. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrilled with his national title and the prospect of competing for the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. So far, the highlight of his career has been competing for the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Am</ORGANIZATION> Games in <DATE>1987</DATE> -- while <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> and company were competing at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
King, who swam for the <ORGANIZATION>University of South Carolina</ORGANIZATION>, explains that swimming 
there is not as "intense" as swimming in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he planned to retire soon, he said: "Not now. Placing the way I did, 
I'll get a lot more financial support. I'll definitely be able to stay in 
swimming another year." 
</P>
<P>
Wade's time (53.72 seconds) was better than the 54.58 recorded in the 
consolation final by <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic gold medalist <PERSON>Anthony Nesty</PERSON>. Because he is 
from <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION> and is not a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen, <PERSON>Nesty</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> 
swimmer, was not seeded into the final of this <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
Competition will continue here through <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
This meet is the selection meet for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Championships</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Aug. 
17-20 and most of the swimmers will go directly from <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> for the 
<DATE>Aug. 24-26</DATE> meet (the Alamo Cup) against the Soviet team. The Soviet swimmers 
will be coming from the European championships in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>. . . . 
<PERSON>Mike Bottom</PERSON>, 33, who won the <DATE>1974</DATE> men's national title in the 100-meter 
butterfly with a time of 55.5 seconds and went on to a berth on the <DATE>1980</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Olympic</ORGANIZATION> team, made the consolation final of the 100-meter butterfly <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 
night swimming for the <ORGANIZATION>Walnut Creek Aquabears</ORGANIZATION>. He finished 15th in 55.44 -- a 
tick faster than his '74 time. . . . Olympian <PERSON>Dan Jorgensen</PERSON> of Blue Fin Swim 
Team (and USC) was fourth in the men's 200-meter freestyle.

UCLA WOMEN AIM FOR HIGH PAC-10 FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The seventh-ranked <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> women's team is on a roll going into the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 
Conference swimming meet today through <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>East Los Angeles College</ORGANIZATION> 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins defeated <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago, 86-54, and Coach <PERSON>Cyndi Gallagher</PERSON> is 
hoping for a top-three finish this <DATE>weekend</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to equal last year's performance," she said. "We have four girls 
qualified (for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> meet in <DATE>March</DATE>) and hope to get a lot more. We were 
third last year and will challenge (<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>) for that again." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the nation, and <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION>, No. 4, will probably contend for 
the team championship. UCLA, <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> will battle for the next 
spots. Oregon dropped its swimming program in <DATE>1986</DATE> so only nine teams will 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, 7-2 overall and 3-2 in the conference, finished in a sixth-place tie with 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> at last year's NCAA meet. The Bruins have five All-Americans and 
several other swimmers who can score in championship meets. 
</P>
<P>
For the Trojans, the performance against the Bruins was encouraging, despite 
the defeat. Going into the meet, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Darrell Fick</PERSON> knew that winning would 
be difficult because <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> was giving away so many points in diving. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has a much stronger diving program than <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, and because two diving events 
are included in dual meets, and scored like the swimming events, the Trojans 
were starting with a 14-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th-ranked Trojans (9-6 and 0-5) have three All-Americans and several 
freshmen who have potential to score at the conference and <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> meets. They 
finished fourth in the Pac-10 meet last year and 25th in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Fick is optimistic that <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> will finish in the top <DATE>five this weekend</DATE> but will 
not be disappointed with a lower placing. Several of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s top swimmers have 
qualified for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> meet and they will not be shaving for the conference 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be aiming for third or fourth," <PERSON>Fick</PERSON> said. "<LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> are just 
too deep, but we'll be in with <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Fick thinks the <ORGANIZATION>Trojans</ORGANIZATION> will improve on last year's <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> performance, and 
expects his swimmers to finish in the top 10. The team was dealt a setback, 
however, when Australian distance swimmer <PERSON>Janelle Elford</PERSON> changed her mind about 
attending <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> after competing in last month's Commonwealth Games. 
</P>
<P>
Elford, the last person to have beaten <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> in a distance 
freestyle event at a major meet, won a gold, a silver and a bronze at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> games, and <PERSON>Fick</PERSON> was counting on her to help the Trojans in both 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
USC's men's team defeated <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, 69-44, and finished the regular 
season unbeaten in 11 meets. The Trojans are ranked second in the nation going 
into the Pac-10 meet <DATE>March 5-7</DATE> at <LOCATION>Belmont Plaza</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. UCLA, which is 
tied with <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> for fourth, finished its regular season at 9-4 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s fifth consecutive victory over <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. USC had two scorers out of a 
possible three in seven of the 11 individual events, including the 1,000- and 
200-yard freestyles, in which it placed first through fourth. 
</P>
<P>
After <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> had swept <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago, the Bruin-Trojan meet 
looked to be one of the top duals of the year. But the week after the sweep, 
<ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> had disciplinary problems and five swimmers were suspended for meets 
against <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. In addition, freshman backstroke ace <PERSON>Geoff 
Cronin</PERSON> missed those meets and the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> meet as well because of poor attendance 
at practice. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> will meet again in 50-yard freestyle match races next 
month at <LOCATION>Nevada Las Vegas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>. They will swim <DATE>March 2</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>UNLV</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Buchanan 
Natatorium</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$4,500</MONEY> in prizes, <MONEY>$2,500</MONEY> going to the winner. That race will be 
held in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Short Course</ORGANIZATION> championships. 
</P>
<P>
Meet director <PERSON>Dave Marsh</PERSON>, the coach of <LOCATION>Las Vegas Gold</LOCATION> swim team, has also lined 
up a 200-yard butterfly race between retirees <PERSON>Tracy Caulkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Meagher</PERSON>, 
and a 100-yard freestyle race between <PERSON>Rowdy Gaines</PERSON> and Australian <PERSON>Mark 
Stockwell</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Caulkins won 48 national championships and <PERSON>Meagher</PERSON> is still the world 
record-holder in the 100-and 200-meter butterfly events, and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
record-holder in each the 100- and 200-yard butterfly. Each won three gold 
medals at the <DATE>1984</DATE> Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The race between <PERSON>Gaines</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stockwell</PERSON> pits the <DATE>1984</DATE> Olympic gold medalist 
against the silver medalist for the first time since those games. In their last 
meeting, <PERSON>Stockwell</PERSON> charged that <PERSON>Gaines</PERSON> jumped the start and should have been 
disqualified. Videotapes showed that <PERSON>Gaines</PERSON> did not come to a full stop before 
the starter started the race but the result stood. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>March 28</DATE>, when they meet at <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> and Jager will be joined by <PERSON>Tom 
Williams</PERSON>, the 50-meter freestyle champion at the <DATE>1987</DATE> Pan-American Games. 
</P>
<P>
The race, which will be held in conjunction with the U. S. Swimming Junior 
Olympic championships at the <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> field house, will have a prize of <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> for 
the winner. As an added incentive, any swimmer who beats 19 seconds will win a 
new car. Biondi holds the American record of 19.15 seconds. Jager and <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> 
have swum 19.24 and 19.64 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi beat Jager in the first match race in <DATE>December</DATE> at <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Last month at the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Auckland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> sophomore 
<PERSON>Gary Anderson</PERSON> won gold medals in the 200-meter individual medley, the 200-meter 
backstroke, and a silver medal in the 100-meter backstroke while competing for 
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. . . . Also at the Games, <PERSON>Glenn Housman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> became the second 
swimmer to break the 15-minute mark in the 1,500-meter freestyle, winning in 
14:55.25. In the same race, 16-year-old <PERSON>Kieren Perkins</PERSON>, also of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, 
became the third swimmer with a time of 14:58.08. <PERSON>Vladimir Salnikov</PERSON> of the 
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> holds the world record, 14:54.76.

Less than 24 hours after receiving her diploma from <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High School</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> conducted business as usual <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the first day of the <ORGANIZATION>Mission 
Viejo International Meet of Champions</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Marguerite Recreation Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the first of eight events in which she is scheduled to compete, 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> was hardly challenged as she scored an easy victory in the women's 
800-meter freestyle with a time of 8 minutes 39.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Laurence Bensimon</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, finished second in 8:55.58. 
<PERSON>Sarah Anderson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION> was third (9:00.93). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who last year set her world record of 8:17.12, took an early lead and 
then pulled away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a workout swim for me," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who will attend <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> in 
the <DATE>fall</DATE>. "I just tried to keep getting ahead of my competition and see how far 
along I am in my training. I was happy with the way I swam." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will compete in the 400-meter individual medley and 200-meter 
butterfly in the Mission Viejo meet today, the 400-meter freestyle and 200 
backstroke on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and the 200-meter individual medley, 200 breaststroke 
and 200 freestyle on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her graduation experiences the night before, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said: "Picking 
up my high school diploma was a little different for me. It was a sad 
experience for me but I was also happy. I'm going to miss high school but I'm 
real excited about starting college at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 800-meter freestyle, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s Artur Wojdat survived a strong 
challenge from <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo</ORGANIZATION> teammate <ORGANIZATION>Mariusz Podkoscielny</ORGANIZATION> to win in 8:08.62. 
</P>
<P>
Podkoscielny, who stayed with Wojdat until the final 200 meters, was second in 
8:10.79. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympian <PERSON>Dan Jorgensen</PERSON> came in third in 8:14.86. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to go about 8:10, so I was happy with my time," <PERSON>Wojdat</PERSON> said. "I'm 
right now where I expected to be when the season started." 
</P>
<P>
Said Podkoscielny: "I'm happy with what I did. I led at the halfway point, but 
I didn't lead by enough, and he won the race with his speed at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat and Podkoscielny, who competed for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, and 
<PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON>, were among four Olympians in the men's event. <PERSON>Lars Jorgensen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dan</PERSON>'s 
brother and <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S.</ORGANIZATION> team member, finished fourth in 8:19.70.

TIMES GET FASTER AFTER HER HEART SLOWS

<P>
It would strike at any time -- the middle of the night, the beginning of 
practice, en route to class on the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> campus. Without warning, <PERSON>Megan 
Holliday</PERSON>'s heart would begin to race, up to 170 beats a minute. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman distance freestyle swimmer from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, was born with 
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, and has an extra muscle fiber connected to the 
upper and lower chambers of the heart that conducts impulses. When the 
pea-sized extra fiber was functioning, it forced <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON>'s heart to beat too 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday noticed the symptoms when she was 11. The rapid heartbeats lasted from 
several minutes to more than an hour, although months would pass without an 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor told her it was only a nuisance that she might grow out of, but 
after <ORGANIZATION>Loyola Marymount</ORGANIZATION> basketball star <PERSON>Hank Gathers</PERSON> collapsed and died of a 
heart condition last <DATE>spring</DATE>, <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Susan</PERSON>, ordered more tests for 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The tests revealed that <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> is in a high-risk group and could suffer a heart 
attack at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock," <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> said. "I thought all along it wasn't a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
She was given three options: medication, a catheter ablation procedure or open 
heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday decided on the catheter ablation procedure, which would destroy the 
superfluous tissue, because it would not require a lengthy recovery. On <DATE>Aug</DATE>. 
20, a Canadian doctor performed the operation, but he was inexperienced with 
the technique and it failed. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> tried medication, but it 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"I had attacks more often and I was dizzy so the university pulled me out of 
the water," said <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON>, who had 12 episodes in four days. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom frantically called around to find a doctor who could do the catheter 
ablation procedure. We found one in <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> who had a cancellation, and I 
went on two days' notice." 
</P>
<P>
In a 14-hour procedure, the surgeon, <PERSON>Warren Jackman</PERSON>, positioned a small metal 
electrode into the heart via a catheter. Using a high-frequency electrical 
current, he destroyed the extra fiber. Five days later, <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> was back in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really thought about it as my life being in danger," she said. "The 
funny thing is, I only worried about not being able to swim. Everyone else 
worried about my health." 
</P>
<P>
Although the procedure was apparently successful, there remains cause for 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I still get it going too fast, but after a couple of beats it stops," <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> 
said. "I talked to my doctor (in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>). He said because I'm tuned to my 
heart so well I'm going to be on the alert for anything abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
During Christmas vacation or <DATE>spring</DATE> break, <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> will be retested. Her heart 
will be stimulated to race to make sure the fiber has not grown back. There is 
an <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> recurrence rate, but according to <PERSON>Jackman</PERSON>, there is no recurrence after a 
second procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, <PERSON>Holliday</PERSON> is concentrating on swimming. 
</P>
<P>
As a 15-year-old, she won two bronze medals for <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1987</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Pan American 
Games</ORGANIZATION>, but since <DATE>1989</DATE> she had leveled off -- until <DATE>last weekend</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Even after missing a month of practice, she improved her time by 45 seconds in 
the 1,650-yard freestyle in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> National Grand Prix meet at <LOCATION>Belmont Plaza</LOCATION> 
in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's <PERSON>Sarah Anderson</PERSON> swam a meet-record 16 minutes 22.82 seconds in winning the 
1,650 freestyle <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in the Grand Prix meet. Anderson also won the 500 
freestyle handily at 4:46.32, and the third-ranked Bears won in the women's 
division, beating <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, which is ranked fifth nationally, 1,249.5 to 948.5. 
</P>
<P>
Cal and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> split the four relays, thanks to a strong finish by <ORGANIZATION>Cal</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Amy 
Tidball</PERSON> in the last event of the meet, the 400 freestyle relay. <PERSON>Tidball</PERSON> was 
caught by Trojan anchor <PERSON>Lisa Dorman</PERSON> at the final turn, but <PERSON>Tidball</PERSON> inched ahead 
in the last 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I just held my breath and it really speeded me up," <PERSON>Tidball</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
All was not lost by <PERSON>Dorman</PERSON>, however. She won the 100 freestyle in 50.87 and set 
a school record in the 50 with a 23.18. 
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> beat <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, 1,111 to 1,022.5. The Trojans were 
without five of their top swimmers. Four were benched by Coach <PERSON>Peter Daland</PERSON> for 
missing practice and Olympian <PERSON>Dave Wharton</PERSON>, preparing for the World 
Championships, swam only in the relays.

<P>
The individual highlight on the men's side was <PERSON>Glenn Peoples</PERSON>' 1:59.70 in the 
200 breaststroke. The time would have placed him 15th in last season's <ORGANIZATION>NCCA</ORGANIZATION> 
meet, a promising effort so early in the season.

Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> had a sore throat and finished fifth in the 400 individual medley 
and seventh in the 200 freestyle at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Open in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> <DATE>Nov. 30-Dec</DATE>. 
1. . . . In the 100 butterfly, <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Brian Alderman</PERSON> upset <DATE>1988</DATE> 
Olympic gold medalist <PERSON>Anthony Nesty</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Surinam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Marcel Gery</PERSON>, who is 
ranked No. 2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Arcadia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Natalie Norberg</PERSON> has come a long way since the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming senior 
nationals in <DATE>August</DATE>, in which she finished 44th in the 200 freestyle in 
2:06.46. At the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Open, the 16-year-old from the <ORGANIZATION>Industry Hills</ORGANIZATION> team won the 
silver medal in 2:02.83. . . . <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> sophomore <PERSON>Erika Hansen</PERSON> will not be able to 
compete in the World Championships because of a virus. Longhorn teammate <PERSON>Katy 
Arris</PERSON> will replace her in the 400 freestyle and <PERSON>Julie Kole</PERSON>, who recently made 
an unwritten commitment to attend Stanford next year, will swim the 800 
freestyle in her place. 
</P>
<P>
Succeeding <PERSON>James</PERSON> (Doc) Councilman is like trying to replace <PERSON>John Wooden</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bear 
Bryant</PERSON>, or <PERSON>Woody Hayes</PERSON>. It hasn't been done successfully by the initial 
successor. No wonder the going is rough for <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s new coach, <PERSON>Kris Kirchner</PERSON>. 
For the first time since <DATE>1956</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Hoosiers</ORGANIZATION> lost a dual meet to <LOCATION>Purdue</LOCATION>. . . . 
<PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>, <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eric Hansen</PERSON> competed in <LOCATION>Flagstaff</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, <DATE>last 
Saturday</DATE> in two heats of the 50-meter freestyle before 325 at the <ORGANIZATION>Northern 
Arizona Natatorium</ORGANIZATION>. Organizers hoped for a world record, but the fastest time 
was <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s 23.08, well off Jager's world-record 21.81.

TEAM'S SPECIALTY IS GOING THE DISTANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national team of distance swimmers broke the <LOCATION>Long Beach-to-Catalina</LOCATION> 
channel relay record <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE>, taking one-hour shifts and completing the channel 
swim in 7 hours 2 minutes 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jay Wilkerson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jim McConica</PERSON>, <PERSON>Martha Jahn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Karen Burton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chad Hundeby</PERSON> and <PERSON>Erica 
Reetz</PERSON> shattered the previous record of 12 hours 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
So, which is more of a surprise? That the record was broken by more than five 
hours or that there is, indeed, a national team of distance swimmers? 
</P>
<P>
"People really don't know what we're doing in distance swimming," <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Coach 
Penny Dean said. "Since we set the record as a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team, I've had 15 or 20 
athletes contact me saying that they would like to be considered for the 
national team for the World Championships. These are athletes who didn't even 
know we had a team." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the team is still forming. 
</P>
<P>
To select a team for the <LOCATION>Catalina</LOCATION> crossing, Dean held a 25-kilometer qualifying 
race and then kept the top three men and the top three women. She worked with 
that group for a week, taking them to different beaches in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> 
area, teaching them to deal with kelp and with swimming in the dark -- things 
that lap swimmers don't have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers training for distance and there are several 
more who would like to be included on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team that will compete in the 
distances swims scheduled to be included with the swimming events at the World 
Championships in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION>, the international governing body for swimming, will be meeting then and 
might vote to include distance swimming as an Olympic medal event in <DATE>1992</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dean, <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION> could decide to add the 800-meter freestyle relay for 
women to the pool events as well as adding a 16-mile swim (not a relay) for 
individual men's and women's medals, even though it would probably be a 
competition that the men and the women swim concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, who currently holds the individual records for both the English Channel 
swim and the <LOCATION>Catalina Channel</LOCATION> swim, has had to retire from distance swimming 
because of a problem with her left arm. She is the women's swim coach and water 
polo coach at <ORGANIZATION>Pomona College</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A team of women representing the <ORGANIZATION>Dolphin Club</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> set the women's 
relay record for swimming the English Channel last week. The <ORGANIZATION>Channel Swimming 
Federation</ORGANIZATION> confirmed their time of 10 hours 49 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Karen Drucker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Susan Cobbe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carol McGrath</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joani Beemsterboer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Susan Allen</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Lisa Smith</PERSON> raised the money for the trip and for the official pilot and pilot 
boat (about <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY>) and set out on what they considered an adventure and a 
longshot at the record. <PERSON>Karen Drucker</PERSON> in her phone call home to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to 
announce the successful crossing said that it was "interesting." 
</P>
<P>
USC will be the host of a college invitational swim meet, the <LOCATION>Grand Prix</LOCATION>, <DATE>Dec</DATE>. 
1-3 at the <ORGANIZATION>Belmont Plaza Pool</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Darrell Fick</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> women's 
coach, said that he expects to have 10 schools each in men's and women's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
So far the men's teams committed are <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Arizona 
State</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cal State Long Beach</LOCATION>, and he expects to add <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. The 
women's teams committed are <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>, 
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Colorado State</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Fick is attempting to put together a 50-yard match race between <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>, but he has a mountain of red tape to work through on that project. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> women's swim team will include <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, who has made several 
appearances at the <LOCATION>Belmont Plaza</LOCATION> pool in the past as a <ORGANIZATION>Placentia El Dorado High 
School</ORGANIZATION> swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>' sweep at the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> last month followed by her sweep 
in the Alamo Cup competition against the Soviet team in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> stretched her 
victory streak to 25. She hasn't lost a national or international race (the 
only ones <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimming is counting or the list would be longer) since <DATE>August 
of 1987</DATE> when she lost the 800-meter freestyle in the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans lowered her world record in the 800 during the last <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION>, 
swimming an 8:16.22. Her world record was the second for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team on the 
day that the swimmers set an unprecedented four. 
</P>
<P>
There have never before been four world records set on one day, although there 
were three set <DATE>July 19, 1976</DATE>, during the Olympic Games in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON> started it when he lowered his own world record in the 200-meter 
breaststroke to 2:12.89. <PERSON>David Wharton</PERSON> got his world record back with a 2:00.11 
in the 200-meter individual medley, and Jager got his world record back when he 
swam a 22.12-second 50. 
</P>
<P>
Jager had lost his world record to <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> during the Olympic Games last 
fall in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> when <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> won the gold and Jager won the silver. They have now 
passed the world record in the 50 back and forth five times. 
</P>
<P>
Jager and <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> have raced only once since the Olympics. They were scheduled 
to meet in the national long course meet at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>, but <PERSON>Jager</PERSON> was 
disqualified for a false start and had to leave the starting blocks to the boos 
and angry chants of a capacity crowd who thought the official had erred. 
</P>
<P>
The disqualification of Jager from the 50-meter freestyle at the national long 
course meet in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> last month brought to mind a similar unpopular false 
start call against <PERSON>Mark Spitz</PERSON> -- who was disqualified from a much-anticipated 
100-meter race against <PERSON>Frank Heckl</PERSON> the last time the national meet was held at 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1970</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team victory over the Soviet team in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> ran the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
team's record to 6-0 over the Soviets in dual meets. The series dates back to 
<DATE>1971</DATE>. In the <ORGANIZATION>Alamo Cup</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> men won their competition, 91-78, and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
women won, 106-56. 
</P>
<P>
Hired to attract corporate sponsorship and sell advertising in the official 
program, the <ORGANIZATION>Mazza Marketing Group</ORGANIZATION> generated <MONEY>$20,850</MONEY> in connection with the 
Phillips 66/U.S. <ORGANIZATION>Swimming Long Course National Championship</ORGANIZATION> swim meet held at 
<ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> last month. Most of that money will go to the swimming program at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some controversy in the past weeks over whether <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> is required 
to open the pool on its campus to the public. The pool was built by <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION>'s 
on <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> land for the <DATE>1984</DATE> Olympic Games, and, at the time, there was the 
understanding that although <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> would control use of the pool after the Games, 
there would be some public use. No one has been able to find that stipulation 
in the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
USC has made the pool available to many local swimming organizations for both 
training and meets and does allow serious lap swimmers use of the pool from <TIME>11 
a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> daily. However, there is no recreational swim time. Swimmers 
must provide proof that they are 16 or older and they must pass a swimming 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. <PERSON>Jim Dennis</PERSON>, vice president of student affairs at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, explains that the 
pool does not meet standards for a public recreational-use pool. There is no 
shallow area. It is a 50-meter pool that ranges in depth from 6-feet-7 to 17 
feet. And the lane markers are almost always in place. Users are required to 
pay <MONEY>$25</MONEY> a semester to help cover the cost of operation.

content with silver at the <DATE>1986</DATE> world championships in <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION>
World Cup in <DATE>1987</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympics.;    They took a year off in <DATE>1989</DATE> and
made a comeback for this meet.;    "It's great to be back," they said, in
perfect unison, after their win.;    As for the races, the top effort in the
second day of competition came courtesy of <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, who
captured a silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle, and the men's 800
freestyle relay, which also earned silver medals. Former San Jose resident and

a heavy favorite in the 400 freestyle and <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> the  prohibitive pick in
the men's 100 freestyle.;    <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, the star of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic swim team in
<LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, had a rematch with Olympic conqueror <PERSON>Anthony Nesty</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Surinam</LOCATION> in the
100 butterfly. But <PERSON>Nesty</PERSON> instead battled <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Michael Gross</PERSON> to the wire

<LEADPARA>  WITH THE world and NCAA championships now past, the next swim meet with
Olympic implications -- and the most important meet of the year in this
country -- is the U.S. Spring Nationals beginning Wednesday in Federal Way,
Wash., near Seattle.;    Stanford's Janet Evans, a double-gold medalist at the
January worlds in Perth, Australia, is one of three world-record holders
entered, along with Mike Barrowman of Michigan and Melvin Stewart of
Tennessee. The meet will draw more than 1,000 swimmers.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SPRING NATIONALS NEXT FOR EVANS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Olympic Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Evans, the world's fastest woman in the 400-, 800- and 1,500-meter
freestyle, will be accompanied by Cardinal teammate <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, who won
the 200 butterfly in <LOCATION>Perth.</LOCATION>;    Even though the <ORGANIZATION>Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION> is the last
competition of a tough three-month stretch, it's important because it
qualifies swimmers for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> teams sent to the remaining three
international meets of this year.;    The top two swimmers in each event go to
<LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>, in <DATE>August</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Championships</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Pan
Pacific</ORGANIZATION> competition, organized by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and held every two years, requires that those four nations commit their
best swimmers. Also eligible to compete are the nations of <LOCATION>South America.</LOCATION>;   
After the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific</ORGANIZATION> team is selected, the next two swimmers in each event
qualify for the Pan-American Games, also in <DATE>August</DATE>, in <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. The
Pan-Ams are the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>'s mini-Olympics and are held only in a
pre-Olympic year. The next two swimmers who are eligible are assigned to the
national team for the <ORGANIZATION>World University Games</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July</DATE> in <LOCATION>Sheffield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England.</LOCATION>;  
 Because of the international implications of the meet, it has been switched
from the short-course (25-yard pool) format previously used in non-Olympic
years to the long-course (50-meters, about twice the short course) pool used
last year for all aquatic competition at the Goodwill Games. International
meets are held in the long-course format.;    Swimmers for the <DATE>1991</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Olympic Festival</ORGANIZATION> are also drawn from the <ORGANIZATION>Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming, the
sport's national governing body, uses the Olympic Festival, to be held <DATE>July
12-21</DATE> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, as a development event. The 104 swimmers chosen must be
18 or under and never named to a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national team.;    Ex-Cal swimmer <PERSON>Matt
Biondi</PERSON>, who holds the world mark in the 100-meter freestyle, decided not to
enter the <ORGANIZATION>Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION> and will instead use his exemption as a member of
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team at the worlds to qualify for future national teams based on his
times at Perth.;  <PERSON>JENNER</PERSON> GETS JOYNER-KERSEE: <PERSON>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</PERSON>,
world-record holder in the heptathlon, says she will compete at the <PERSON>Bruce
Jenner</PERSON> Classic on <DATE>May 25</DATE> at <LOCATION>San Jose City College.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Joyner-Kersee</PERSON>, who will
be concentrating this year on <ORGANIZATION>The Athletics Congress</ORGANIZATION> national meet in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
in <DATE>June</DATE> and the world track and field championships in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>,
withdrew from last year's <PERSON>Jenner</PERSON> meet with an injury.;    The Pan-Am Games
don't figure in her plans, partly because they're scheduled too soon before
the world championships, but also because of continuing concern among <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
athletes over problems with setting up a drug-testing system in <LOCATION>Havana.</LOCATION>;   
"You can't take chances with that, especially when the procedures are not set
up right," she said. "People are not going to investigate it and read through
it and say they did not have it set up right. Your name is smeared now. You
urinate in a plastic bottle that -- who knows what's going to happen to it
now?";  BREAKING THE ICE: <PERSON>Julie Parisien</PERSON>'s giant slalom victory in <LOCATION>Waterville
Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, last week was the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' first World Cup victory since
retired ace <PERSON>Tamara McKinney</PERSON> won a <DATE>1987</DATE> slalom.;    The four-year drought was
the longest period in World Cup history without a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> victory.;    <PERSON>Eva
Twardokens</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> was sixth and San Leandro-native <PERSON>Edith Thys</PERSON> was
23rd.;    <PERSON>Toni Standteiner</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Olympic Valley</LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Colorado</ORGANIZATION> ski team, won a silver medal in the giant slalom <DATE>earlier this month</DATE>
at the <ORGANIZATION>Winter World University Games</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sapporo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan.</LOCATION>;  SOLICITING GOODWILL:
The site selection committee for the <DATE>1998</DATE> Goodwill Games, which founder <PERSON>Ted
Turner</PERSON> promises will be held despite huge losses on the first two runs in
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, has invited <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> to submit a bid.;    Thirty-one
other cities in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> are being solicited. There's no
word on any city other than <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> expressing interest in having the event.
The '94 Goodwill Games will be in <LOCATION>Leningrad</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>

Those were some of the spoils that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>

and a bronze. So, perhaps naturally, both were a little bewildered with the 
notion that they had to prove themselves again <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>King County 
Aquatics Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And when the third day of the Goodwill Games ended, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> did not appear much 
more excited about her victory than <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> felt depressed about his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's far too much pressure to win in American sports," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said, 
shrugging off the loss but not his sub-par performance. 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, it seems as if more attention has been focused in the <DATE>last two 
years</DATE> on one of the two gold medals he let get away in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> than on the five 
he won. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-meter butterfly, he had a clear lead until the finish, when he 
misjudged his stroke into the wall and was out-touched by <LOCATION>Surinam</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Anthony 
Nesty</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi had an opportunity to even the score <DATE>Sunday</DATE> when he met <PERSON>Nesty</PERSON> in the 
same event for the first time since <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, but he failed. 
</P>
<P>
As for <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, one of the rare disappointments of her career came <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, when 
she lost for the first time in four years in the 400-meter individual medley. 
The surprise winner was fellow <ORGANIZATION>Californian Summer Sanders</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> did not react well to the theme of vindication suggested in 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s newspapers, she did have an opportunity to continue her winning streak 
in the 400-meter freestyle. She has not lost in that event since <DATE>1987</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Her task did not appear simple because one of her competitors was 200-meter 
world record-holder <PERSON>Heike Friedrich</PERSON> of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> held off 
two surges in the last 50 meters of the 400 freestyle by <PERSON>Friedrich</PERSON> to win the 
gold medal in a world-record time of 4:03.85 that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> did not approach that <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, although her time of 4:05.84 was enough to 
win the race and tie for the fourth-fastest ever. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise silver medalist, <PERSON>Haley Lewis</PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, finished almost 
five seconds behind in 4:10.78. Friedrich finished seventh in 4:18.32. 
</P>
<P>
So <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is back? 
</P>
<P>
Where did she go? 
</P>
<P>
Even though she lost the day before, she said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that she was more pleased 
with that silver medal -- which came with a time that was only two seconds off 
her personal record in the 400 individual medley -- than she was with the gold 
medal in the 800 freestyle that she won <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. She was 12 seconds behind 
her personal record in that race. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a news conference <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to describe her <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said 
she went to a movie, dinner and bed. "It was nothing different," she said. "You 
just have to put that (the loss) behind you, and you have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she asked a reporter, "What did people expect me to do, go back to the 
room and bawl my eyes out?" 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> was her same, cheerful self <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just hopping around and supporting the team," he said. "I don't know 
why, but it seems like more people were interested in her loss yesterday than 
in her win today. Certainly, more people are talking about her loss than <PERSON>Summer 
Sanders</PERSON>' win." 
</P>
<P>
Nesty can empathize with <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>. His victory in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> is better known as 
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>'s loss. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Nesty</PERSON>, who swims for the <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION>, said he was thinking about that 
before the start of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s rematch, which <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> was expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous, I couldn't stand it," <PERSON>Nesty</PERSON> said. "I was big-time nervous. I 
guess that's what <PERSON>Matt</PERSON> does to me." 
</P>
<P>
It showed in the first 50 meters, when <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, who was just off the 
world-record pace, had the lead. But <PERSON>Nesty</PERSON> caught him with 25 meters remaining 
and won a clear victory. His time was 53.42 to <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>'s 53.82. The difference 
between them in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> was .01. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said that the loss did not upset him because <PERSON>Nesty</PERSON> has proved himself as 
better in the butterfly. But <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> was upset with their times. Those same 
times in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> would have placed them fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I lost in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> helped me to train better in the butterfly, and 
I did," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said. "I got up at <TIME>5:45 every morning</TIME> and would swim six hours a 
day, all for this moment. Then it happens, and I didn't swim anywhere near as 
fast as I expected. That's what makes this so disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
But the sun was still shining, something to be thankful for in the <LOCATION>Pacific 
Northwest</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> could still laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's look at the good side," he said. "I did finish a lot better than I did 
in <DATE>'88</DATE>."

Less than 24 hours after she received her diploma from <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High School</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> conducted business as usual <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the first day of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo Chrysler Motors International Swim Meet of Champions</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the first of eight events in which she is scheduled to compete 
during the four-day meet, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> won easily in the 800-meter freestyle with a 
time of 8 minutes 39.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Laurence Ensimon</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, finished second in 8:55.58, 
followed by <PERSON>Sarah Anderson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Riverside</LOCATION>, who had a time of 9:00.93. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who last year set the world record of 8:17.12, took an early lead and 
pulled away from the field to win by 25 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a workout swim for me," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who will attend <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> in 
the <DATE>fall</DATE>. "I just tried to keep getting ahead of my competition and see how far 
along I am in my training. I was happy with the way I swam." 
</P>
<P>
Evans will compete in the 400-meter individual medley and 200 butterfly today; 
the 400 freestyle and 200 backstroke <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the 200 individual medley, 
200 freestyle and 200 breaststroke <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her graduation the night before, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said: "Picking up my high 
school diploma was a little different. It was a sad experience for me, but I 
was also happy. I'm going to miss high school, but I'm real excited about 
starting college." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the men's 800 freestyle, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s Artur Wojdat overcame a strong 
challenge from fellow <ORGANIZATION>Pole Mariusz Podkoscielny</ORGANIZATION> to take the event with a time 
of 8:08.62. Both swim for the <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo Nadadores</ORGANIZATION> team. 
</P>
<P>
Podkoscielny, who finished second in 8:10.79, stayed with Wojdat until Wojdat 
edged ahead with 200 meters left. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympian <PERSON>Dan Jorgensen</PERSON> finished third in 
8:14.86.

<LEADPARA>  If Jeff Rouse's clumsiness extended from staircases to the swimming pool, his
career might be in jeopardy.;    Rouse, whose junior season at Stanford was
shortened after he broke his left wrist falling down the stairs at home, is
doing just fine in the pool. On Friday, he solidified his status as one of the
world's top backstrokers by beating a loaded field in the 100 meters at the
Santa Clara International Invitational Swim Meet.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DIFFERENT STROKES
DESPITE WRIST, ROUSE HAS ROUSING WIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Rouse's winning effort, 56.59 seconds, was witnessed by an estimated 2,800
fans at the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara International Swim Center</ORGANIZATION> and came against five of the
world's top 17-ranked 100-meter backstrokers.;    And aside from <LOCATION>Rouse</LOCATION>, ranked
No. 2 in the world, others turning top performances included:;    (check)
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, capturing the women's 400 individual medley in 4
minutes, 51.14 seconds.;    (check) High school phenom <PERSON>Joe Hudepohl</PERSON>, winning
the men's 200 freestyle in 1:51.23.;    (check) Soviet <PERSON>Sergei Marinuk</PERSON>, setting
a meet record of 4 minutes, 21.42 seconds in the men's 400 <LOCATION>I.M</LOCATION>. In all, the
Soviets won three of the eight individual events, and its men's 800 relay team
set a meet record of 7:37.34.;    <ORGANIZATION>Rouse</ORGANIZATION>'s victory, however, was perhaps the
most impressive individual accomplishment because of who he beat.;    Among
his competitors were <PERSON>Alexander Popov</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> (57.01), an
up-and-comer who was the fastest qualifier in the event; <PERSON>Mark Tewksbury</PERSON>
(57.99), a member of the <DATE>1988</DATE> Canadian Olympic team who entered ranked No. 3
in the world; <PERSON>Vladimir Shemetov</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> (58.17), the bronze
medalist at last year's Goodwill Games; <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> teammate <PERSON>Derek Weatherford</PERSON>
(58.27), ranked 17th in the world; and <PERSON>Vladimir Selkov</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>,
the world's 15th-ranked backstroker who was disqualified after a false start.;
   And <PERSON>Rouse</PERSON> did it with a wrist that's still not <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT>. He broke it in
early <DATE>February</DATE>, shortly after winning the world championship in the 100
backstroke in Australia.;    He returned in <DATE>March</DATE> to win the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> title but
skipped the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> to rest the wrist.;    "If
anything," he said, "the injury gave me another type of goal -- the extra
motivation to overcome this.";    The victory didn't come easily because Popov
stayed with <PERSON>Rouse</PERSON> the entire race.;    "I didn't know what to expect from
him," <PERSON>Rouse</PERSON> said of the world's 14th-ranked backstroker. "I didn't know how
fast he could go."; <LOCATION>ETC.</LOCATION>: <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> finished sixth in the men's 100
butterfly at 57.08. . . . <PERSON>Kyoko Iwasaki</PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, was second in the
women's 200 breaststroke at 2:35.99. . . . <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Yoko Tsukashima</PERSON> defended

<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> swimmers who starred in 
the Olympics at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, are among 10 finalists for the <ORGANIZATION>Sullivan Award</ORGANIZATION>, given 
each year to the outstanding amateur athlete in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming was the only sport with two finalists when the list was cut down from 
46 by the <ORGANIZATION>Amateur Athletic Union</ORGANIZATION>'s selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be announced <DATE>March 6</DATE> in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who took only a brief break from swimming after the Olympics, is back 
competing for <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High School</ORGANIZATION>. On <DATE>Jan. 16</DATE> at <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, she 
set a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> record in the 1,650-yard freestyle at 15 minutes 44.98 seconds, 
taking more than a second and a half off the nearly 6-year-old record set by 
<ORGANIZATION>Tiffany Cohen</ORGANIZATION>, 15:46.54. 
</P>
<P>
Look for more American records to fall now that <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> will be swimming some 
major meets in yards, distances unique to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Since <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> broke her first world record in <DATE>July, 1987</DATE>, the major meets have 
been long course (meters) in preparation for the '88 Olympic Games. But the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers will be competing in yards in some major meets, including the 
<ORGANIZATION>Phillips 66-U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 
21-25</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
At that meet, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> is expected to swim the 400-yard individual medley, the 
500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard individual medley and the 1,000-yard 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1,650 record already in hand, she will skip that event in <LOCATION>North 
Carolina</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi isn't doing any competitive swimming these days, but he has been staying 
in shape to be ready for the tryouts for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> water polo team, to be held 
at <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> <DATE>Feb. 4</DATE> and 5. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the water polo team retired after the <DATE>1988</DATE> Games, Coach <PERSON>Bill 
Barnett</PERSON> has a lot of spaces to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Besides doing speaking engagements and some commercial appearances, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> was 
back in the waters off the coast of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, swimming with dolphins for an 
ABC-TV special with <PERSON>Curt Gowdy</PERSON> that shows an apparent special communication 
between dolphins and children with Down's syndrome. ABC will televise the 
special <DATE>April 2</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> also has been kept pretty busy accepting awards and still has a few more 
to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi already has been named <ORGANIZATION>United Press International</ORGANIZATION>'s sportsman of the 
year and the <ORGANIZATION>United States Olympic Committee</ORGANIZATION>'s sportsman of the year. Not to 
mention being named Italian-American man of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Included in a long list of appointments is his <DATE>Feb. 3</DATE> date at <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, 
for a basketball slam dunk contest against the likes of <PERSON>Carl Lewis</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is staying busy, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> isn't cashing in on his 7 medals. When he 
passed through <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> on a tour of 12 cities in 8 days, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> 
told <PERSON>John Nelson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> that he was in the wrong sport for 
making big bucks. And, he said, <DATE>1988</DATE> wasn't the best Olympic year for cashing 
in, either. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to get rich from these Olympics except maybe <PERSON>Flo Jo</PERSON>, if she 
plays it right," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said, referring to track star <PERSON>Florence Griffith Joyner</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many controversies -- steroids, television, the boxing -- and 
then there was the time difference. I think people got kind of turned off. 
Advertisers realize that. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one advertiser's quote. He said, 'Our company would rather sponsor 
events than athletes, because events don't do drugs or beat their wives.' It's 
getting harder for the athlete instead of easier." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why swimming isn't as potentially lucrative as other Olympic sports 
such as boxing or figure skating, and why swimmers don't draw top endorsements, 
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said: "The Olympics is only once every 4 years, and for that magical 
week, everybody is watching and reading about it. But to stay on top, you have 
to be heard from a little more often than that." 
</P>
<P>
USC and <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> are undefeated in swimming this season. USC is 6-0 and already has 
10 swimmers qualified for the <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION> meet. That's 
the most the Trojans have ever qualified before the Pac-10 meet. 
</P>
<P>
Helping build that total are the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympians on the <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> team, who missed the 
first semester because of the trip to <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> but are allowed to use Olympic 
times for qualifying times. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans are competing this weekend in the <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> Classic at <LOCATION>Southern 
Methodist</LOCATION>, swimming against <ORGANIZATION>SMU</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (7-0) already have Mark Dean qualified for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> meet. Dean 
qualified for the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:47.25 in a meet against 
<ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Jan. 13</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Bruin team is breaststroker <PERSON>Andrea Cecci</PERSON>, who was the Italian 
national champion in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans and the Bruins are both 2-0 in the Pac-10. They will not meet until 
<DATE>Feb. 25</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> women's swim team is 5-4 and has four women qualified for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 
meet. <PERSON>Leslie Daland</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathy Hettche</PERSON> have qualified in the 1,650 -- <LOCATION>Daland</LOCATION> at 
16:33.63 and Hettche at 16:37.93 -- as well as <PERSON>Leslie Seward</PERSON> in the 200-yard 
breaststroke and <PERSON>Terri O'Loughlin</PERSON> in the 100-yard butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> women are 8-1 after a big victory at <LOCATION>Cal</LOCATION> <DATE>last weekend</DATE>. The Bruin women 
have lost only to <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, which is as strong as usual. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming, in keeping with its philosophy of getting international 
experience for a wide range of swimmers, is sending a team of 6 to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola International Meet</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> <DATE>Feb. 3-5</DATE> and the Meetings Arena at <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 10-12</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
On the team will be <PERSON>Steve Crocker</PERSON> of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Matt Rankin</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Click Tucson</ORGANIZATION> 
team, <PERSON>Beth Barr</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Pensacola Swim Team</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Whitney Hedgepeth</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia Assn. for Competitive Aquatics</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ann Mahoney</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Wichita Swim Club</ORGANIZATION> 
and <PERSON>Jenny Thompson</PERSON> of the Seacost Swim Team. <PERSON>Jay Fitzgerald</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara 
Swim Club</ORGANIZATION> is going as the coach.

DID CHINA USE DRUGS TO WIN?;

SWIMMING: SUDDEN SUCCESS PROMPTS SPECULATION THAT ITS FEMALE ATHLETES MIGHT

National swim team coaches from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> 
suspect the Chinese women's team of using steroids in the wake of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s 
world-best performances during last month's Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON>, coach of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national team and <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> women's team, said 
he felt obligated to speak out after the Chinese produced three times that rank 
No. 1 in the world this year and three others that are No. 2 during the 
competition at <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of whispering about it with the East Germans, and I'm not going to 
whisper about it with the Chinese," Quick said during the weekend. "I think 
they've improved very quickly. I know some coaches who have watched them, and 
their ability to recover in practice is phenomenal. It is either extremely 
sophisticated training with the proper nutrition and massage, or it is with 
artificial aids." 
</P>
<P>
Said <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s national team coach, <PERSON>Bill Sweetenham</PERSON>, who worked with the 
Chinese as recently as <DATE>February</DATE>: "I hope they are not doing it (using 
steroids), but I question their rapid improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a very positive advocate of the Chinese, their strict discipline and the 
Spartan attitude toward their training. Their high-altitude training is very 
significant, as is the socialist system. You are dealing with people who have 
nothing, and all of a sudden if they perform well they get something." 
</P>
<P>
The suspicions have been fueled by the quick improvement of the Chinese 
performances and what the coaches consider a familiar pattern. "It seems like 
we're seeing the same rapid improvement the East Germans had, and they (the 
Chinese) had help from the East Germans," said <PERSON>Sweetenham</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s Olympic 
coach from 1980-88. 
</P>
<P>
According to Coach <PERSON>David Haller</PERSON>, whose <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> national team swam against the 
Chinese during the Asian Games, the Chinese women have made significant weight 
gains and developed deep voices. Those are common side effects of steroids, 
muscle-building drugs that some consider to be performance-enhancing. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s national team coach, <PERSON>Yunpeng Chen</PERSON>, denied the allegations from <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," <PERSON>Chen</PERSON> said. "In <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, our swimming association forbids it, and you 
know at the Asian Games we have serious doping control." 
</P>
<P>
None of the Chinese swimmers tested positive for any banned substance at the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Chen</PERSON> said his team has had East German help. East German Coach <PERSON>Klaus Rudolf</PERSON> 
went to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> for eight months to share training techniques. Chen also 
learned from the Americans during 1979-80 when he studied at <ORGANIZATION>Springfield 
College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, and from the Australians in <DATE>1983</DATE> when he observed 
Coach <PERSON>Dennis Pursley</PERSON>'s methods. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about the East German system of weight training, high-altitude 
training, dry-land and aquatic training," <PERSON>Chen</PERSON> said. "Then I mixed the 
Australian, <LOCATION>U.S.A.</LOCATION> and East German training methods to make the Chinese 
method." 
</P>
<P>
Pursley, because of his current position as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national team director, would 
not address the question of steroids with regard to the Chinese. However, he 
did attend the Asian Games and was willing to share his views of the Chinese 
program, which <ORGANIZATION>Chen</ORGANIZATION> said has about 25,000 swimmers. The Chinese population is 
estimated at 1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that really surprised me is that they really haven't scratched the 
surface," <PERSON>Pursley</PERSON> said. "They have a small number of swimmers and they don't 
have sophisticated talent identification or networking methods." 
</P>
<P>
In a report <PERSON>Pursley</PERSON> prepared for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming, he wrote: "It doesn't appear 
that the success of the Chinese program can be attributed to any 'secret' 
training methods that are unknown to the rest of the world. The training 
program is based on a solid work ethic and utilizes traditional methods of 
preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Quick also credits the Chinese training, saying that the swimmers could not 
improve on artificial aids alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The major benefit from steroids is that you can train so much more effectively 
so many more times," he said. "So you can get off them in time before the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Quick added that female swimmers benefit from steroids more than males. 
</P>
<P>
"And (improvement) has come in the power events first, the shorter events, the 
100s, and then the 200s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dr. Robert Voy</PERSON>, former chief medical officer of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympic Committee</ORGANIZATION>, 
gives credence to Quick's belief that steroids have a greater impact on women. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have male hormone receptor sites that require very little male hormone 
to fill," Voy said. "They can get that by using smaller doses and getting 
bigger gains." 
</P>
<P>
Chen, however, offered several reasons for the success of the women as opposed 
to the men, including the belief that the fastest women can train against 
faster men while the fastest men have no one to push them. 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the average height of Chinese women is only an inch 
shorter, at 5 feet 8, than the average height of female finalists in the <DATE>1988</DATE> 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
He says the average height of the Chinese male swimmer is 5-11, three inches 
shorter than the average height of male Olympic finalists in <DATE>1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to power events, the only world record the Chinese women have is in 
the shortest event, the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wenyi Yang</PERSON>, who set the mark at 24.98 seconds in <DATE>1988</DATE>, has gone as fast as 
25.51 this year and is one of five Chinese women with world-best times in <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The others are: <PERSON>Yong Zhuang</PERSON> in the 100 freestyle (55.12), <PERSON>Xiaomin Huang</PERSON> in the 
100 breaststroke (1:09.70), <PERSON>Xiaohong Wang</PERSON> in the 100 butterfly (58.87) and <PERSON>Li 
Lin</PERSON> in the 200 individual medley (2:13.16). Wang's time and the 58.89 turned in 
by teammate <LOCATION>Hong Qian</LOCATION> represent the second- and third-fastest times in history 
behind the world record of 57.93 set by <PERSON>Mary T. Meagher</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in 
<DATE>1981</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has seven individual world bests this year -- four by 
freestyler <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, two by butterflyer-medleyist <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON> and one by 
100 backstroker <PERSON>Betsy Mitchell</PERSON>. This year's other bests are by Hungarian 200 
backstroker <PERSON>Kristina Egerszegi</PERSON> and 200 breaststroker <PERSON>Elena Volkova</PERSON> of the 
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Quick fears steroid users will not be caught through the testing procedures at 
the World Championships or the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympic Games in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
One former member of the East German women's team acknowledged in a <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> Sun 
article recently that she used steroids and said that many of her teammates 
used the banned substances, but none of the swimmers tested positive during 
competition. During the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic trials in <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Angel Myers</PERSON> tested 
positive for a banned substance and was taken off the team, but those cases are 
generally the exception. 
</P>
<P>
Said Voy: "Only someone who misjudges a dose or gets greedy and takes too much, 
a la <PERSON>Ben Johnson</PERSON>, is going to get caught. With an eight- to 10-week cycle they 
can get off within two weeks of the competition date and still get a lot of the 
positive effects of the drug."

<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, who won three gold medals swimming in the Olympics, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 
she has signed a letter of intent to attend <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High School</ORGANIZATION>, has been besieged by recruiters in 
recent weeks. She said she chose <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> for its academics and its strong swim 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal women's team won the <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION> swim 
championship. Stanford also won the title in <DATE>1983</DATE> and has never finished lower 
than third since <DATE>1977</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I feel I've recruited one of the greatest athletes in American 
history," said <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> women's swimming coach <PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON>, who was coach of 
the <DATE>1988</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympic</ORGANIZATION> swimming team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard time deciding," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and Stanford all have 
good programs. But I really like girls on the team at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. I liked the 
school and I can get a good education there." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said she plans to major in communications. 
</P>
<P>
"I like working with people and I would like to do something in broadcasting," 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to swim in the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympics in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds world records in the 400-meter individual medley, 400 freestyle and 
800 freestyle. She won gold medals in all three events <DATE>last September</DATE> at the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Her victories in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> brought numerous endorsement offers. However, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said 
that she turned down the offers to maintain her amateur standing. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was tempting, but I've always wanted to swim in college," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> 
said. "I didn't want to forfeit my education. I'm 17, I want to be a kid for a 
while longer." 
</P>
<P>
Evans began gaining attention in <DATE>1986</DATE> as she won two bronze medals at the 
Goodwill Games in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Her small stature (5-foot-4, less than 100 pounds) and unorthodoxed style of 
swimming, which <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado Coach Tom Milich</ORGANIZATION> once likened to a Cuisinart, made 
her unique. <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said she takes 52 strokes of freestyle per 50-meter pool. 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming Open</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> set world records in the 400 freestyle 
(4 minutes 5.45 seconds), 800 freestyle (8:24.71 seconds) and 400 individual 
medley (4:39.75). She later lowered her time in the 400 freestyle to 4:03.85. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first American woman swimmer to hold three world records at one 
time since <PERSON>Debbie Meyer</PERSON> held four in <DATE>1968</DATE>. The last women swimmer to hold three 
was <PERSON>Kornelia Ender</PERSON> of <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her international success, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> continued to swim for her high school 
team. Last year she set national high school records in the 500-yard freestyle 
(4:37.30) and 200 individual medley (2:00.72). 
</P>
<P>
She is favored to win those event again <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in the Southern Section 3-A 
finals at <LOCATION>Belmont Plaza</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest decision I ever had to make," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "My parents said 
they would support whatever decision I made. I weighed the pros and cons and 
picked <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. I'm really happy with the decision and think it's for the 
best."

<DESCRIPT>  PAST; OLYMPICS; CELEBRITY; SWIMMING; RACING; RESULT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mark Spitz didn't even come close to beating Olympian Tom Jager in a 50-meter
butterfly match race Saturday, the first test of the 41-year-old swimmer's
comeback try.;    Spitz, the winner of seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer
Olympics, finished 1 1/2 lengths behind Jager, 26.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SPITZ'S COMEBACK GETS A SLOW START
'72 OLYMPIC STAR IS NO MATCH FOR JAGER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Jager, the world champion and world-record holder in the 50 freestyle,
earned <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> for the victory. Spitz got <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>.;    Jager got a strong
start and swam across the pool in 24.92 seconds. Spitz finished in 26.70.;   
"I don't think the loss was disappointing," <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said. "I hate to admit that
I was probably swimming for second, but I thought I could swim in the low
25s.";    <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> called it nerves.;    "I think I could have walked across the
pool faster than I swam across it, the nerves were so great," <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said.;   
<PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> lagged at the start, then briefly caught Jager just before the 25-meter
mark. After that, <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> almost appeared to be swimming in slow motion.;    "I
got it handed to me nicely and decisively by the fastest guy in the world,"
<PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said. "I'm sure I'll feel a lot more relaxed now that I've got one under
my belt.";    It was the first time in 18 1/2 years that <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> had raced
competitively. The last time was at the '72 <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> Olympics.;    A year and a
half ago, he made the improbable announcement that he was starting to train
again with the hope of making the '92 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic team in the 100 butterfly.;
   He enlisted the help of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> swimming coach <PERSON>Ron Ballatore</PERSON>. Ballatore agreed
with <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> that nerves were a factor in the race.;    "I feel that if he were
to have relaxed more and kept his stroke he would have done a lot better,"
<PERSON>Ballatore</PERSON> said. "He hasn't looked like that at all in practice.";    Neither
<PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Ballatore</PERSON> disclosed practice times, but <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said he has swum at
least a second faster in practice and believes he can do so in his next match
race.;    On <DATE>April 27</DATE>, he will meet <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON>, a <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic silver
medalist in the 100 butterfly. The winner will take home <MONEY>$35,000</MONEY> of a <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>
purse.  </TEXT>

<PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> set a world record in the men's 200-meter 
breaststroke <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, in a time of 2:11.53.

<P>
<PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON> bettered his own record of 2:12.89 set <DATE>Aug. 20, 1989</DATE>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Pan

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> defeated fellow <ORGANIZATION>American Tom Jager</ORGANIZATION> in the 50-meter 
freestyle for the first gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, who won five gold medals at the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> <DATE>Olympics two years ago</DATE>, swam the 
fifth fastest time ever in the 50 in beating his archrival. Biondi won in 22.10 
seconds. Jager was second in 22.31, far off his world record of 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the seventh time <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> has beaten Jager in 19 meetings in the 50. 
<PERSON>Vladimir Tkachenko</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was third in 22.57. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's volleyball team overcame a slow start to defeat <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> at 
<LOCATION>Spokane</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, as the round-robin tournament began with a rematch of the 
teams' <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic silver-medal encounter.

<P>
In another match, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> beat <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, 15-5, 15-2, 15-3.

<P>
"<LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> was a big game. This was for friendship, so we were not so nervous," 
Chinese player <PERSON>Li Guojun</PERSON> said. "This game was not as tough, but we both could

</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, with four players from the Olympic squad, suffered from a lack of

The Stanford women's swim team continued to dominate the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 10 women's 
swimming and diving championships, winning five of seven events <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> 
at <ORGANIZATION>East Los Angeles College</ORGANIZATION>. Stanford extended its lead over <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to 
1,160-858. UCLA is third at 782 points, followed by <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> with 700. USC 
is fifth with 569. 
</P>
<P>
After <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> won the 200-yard medley relay, freshmen <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, <PERSON>Janel 
Jorgensen</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Lori Heisick</PERSON> led the Cardinal by winning three of the first four 
individual events. 
</P>
<P>
Evans caught teammate <PERSON>Michelle Griglione</PERSON> at the 150-yard mark of the 400-yard 
individual medley and went on to win in a meet record of 4:15.26. <PERSON>Lorenza Munoz</PERSON> 
of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was second, and <PERSON>Griglione</PERSON> was third. All three were under the 
<ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> trailed in the beginning, she never worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I've swum so many 400 <ORGANIZATION>I.M.</ORGANIZATION>'s against <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> I wasn't worried," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, 
who won three gold medals at the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> joined <PERSON>Connors</PERSON> and <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> as double winners when she won the 100-yard 
butterfly. <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON>, who was on the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic team with <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, led from the 
beginning, finishing well under the qualifying mark with a time of 54.33. 
<PERSON>Kristin Stoudt</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> was second and <PERSON>Terri O'Loughlin</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> was third. 
</P>
<P>
Cal junior <PERSON>Sarah Anderson</PERSON> stopped <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s winning streak with a victory in 
the 200-yard freestyle. Andersen, who caught and passed <PERSON>Jeanne Gibbons</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> 
at the halfway point, set a meet record with a time of 1:47.83. Gibbons held on 
for second place, followed by <PERSON>Anna Hansen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. The top two qualified for the 
<ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championships, which will be held <DATE>March 15-17</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Heisick concluded the <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> freshman triple by winning the 100-yard 
breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
In the final individual event of the session, <PERSON>Kristin Kuhlman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 
swam away from the field with an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> qualifying time of 56.87. <ORGANIZATION>Sherri White of 
USC</ORGANIZATION> was second. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford ended the night with a victory in the 800-yard freestyle relay. The 
Cardinal foursome of <PERSON>Jody Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, <PERSON>Karen Kraemer</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> swam a 
national leading time of 7:18.79. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> continued to swim well, despite <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s dominance. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked up three more qualifiers <DATE>today</DATE> and a relay that will seed us very 
high at NCAAs," Bruin Coach <PERSON>Cyndi Gallagher</PERSON> said. "Point-wise we're not getting 
better, but more people are swimming faster." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans did not add any more qualifiers, but Coach <PERSON>Darrell Fick</PERSON> was 
impressed with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our unshaved swimmers are swimming their best unshaved times of the season, 
and I think we are a couple of tenths (of a second) away from an exceptional 
meet," <PERSON>Fick</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pac-10 diving championships, being held at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> senior <PERSON>Katie 
Connors</PERSON> defeated <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Janae Lautenschlager</PERSON>, 481.95-472.10, in the 
women's three-meter springboard. USC's <PERSON>Brian Earley</PERSON> defeated <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Chris 
Dudka</PERSON>, 547.00-499.05, to win the men's one-meter springboard title.

<LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION>, and I feel like I'll get better," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who is leaving <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> to
concentrate on the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympic Games.;    <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>' 4-minute, 44.07-second
victory was far off her 4:37.76 record swim at the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, but it was
comfortably ahead of the disappointing 4:46.05 she swam to finish fourth in
the <DATE>January</DATE> world championships.;    "My breaststroke is becoming my worst,

by more than two seconds after the breaststroke leg. "In the <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION>, they say
you either have it all, or if one stroke is just a little off, you'll lose."; 
  Part of <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>' reason for leaving <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, in addition to restricted
training rules being instituted by the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>, is dissatisfaction with her
training under <ORGANIZATION>Coach Richard Quick.</ORGANIZATION>;    She gave further insight into that
issue after the <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION> when she said her college training has focused too much
on freestyle.;    "I feel like I haven't trained much <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION>," she said. "I have
not worked enough on fly and breast, but I was pleased with tonight because I
held the end of a long taper," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said.;    <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>' I.M. performances had
fallen so much that Cardinal teammate <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON> beat <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION> at
the worlds (<ORGANIZATION>Sanders</ORGANIZATION> was third) and the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championships, where they finished
1-2.;    <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, whose time at the world meet qualified her for the national
team at the next big international meet, the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Championships</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>August</DATE>, skipped <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s race.;    "I hate it," said <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, a sprinter. "It
hurts more than any race I do.";    It hurt <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>, too, but her finish in
4:47.67 was still the sixth fastest by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> woman.;    "It's probably the
most pain I've ever felt in a 400 <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>, who beat <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> by nearly
four seconds in <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>'s preliminaries. "It's the first time on a
400 I.M. I really pushed on every stroke, and it was my fastest time by five
seconds.";    <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Northridge</LOCATION>, finished second in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s 200
breaststroke to 14-year-old <PERSON>Anita Nall</PERSON>, who won in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> record time, and both

A FALSE START FORCES JAGER OUT AS BIONDI WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympian <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> and a depleted field of challengers left the starting 
blocks for the 50-meter freestyle <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to a chorus of boos -- a first 
for <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> after all his years of international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the standing-room-only crowd of 2,500 attending the Phillips 66/U.S. 
<ORGANIZATION>Swimming Long Course National Championships</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> were expressing their 
disappointment because the meet's premier event was altered when <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> was 
disqualified for a false start. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, swimming in his first major meet since winning seven medals in the <DATE>1988</DATE> 
Olympic Games, was disappointed, too. After winning the national title in the 
50, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said: "I've never felt so empty about a victory. I think I felt the 
same way most of the people felt. 
</P>
<P>
"When the race was over, I think there were about four people clapping. 
Everybody else was sitting there thinking, 'We got robbed.' This was not what I 
came here for." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi came here to swim against Jager, the one swimmer who has beaten him 
often at this distance. 
</P>
<P>
He came to revitalize their rivalry. He and Jager -- the silver medalist at 
<LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> -- have been trying to attract attention to their sport, and they finally 
had drummed up interest. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were on their feet and cheering when the swimmers walked onto the 
deck, but silent for the start. Then, as the eight swimmers left the blocks, 
the starter beeped, signaling a false start. 
</P>
<P>
There were groans as the swimmers made their way back to the blocks. But the 
groans became shouts of protest when referee <PERSON>Annalise Eggert</PERSON> walked down the 
line behind the swimmers, passed Jager, and then turned around and came back to 
tab him as the one who was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
While Jager argued, the crowd broke into a chant: "Let him swim! Let him swim! 
Let him swim." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like that," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said. "I thought we were going to 
have anarchy. It was obvious that everyone wanted him to be there. But these 
things happen in sport. We're all human. We can all make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Eggert might have made a mistake. A TV replay showed that if anyone went early, 
it was <PERSON>Steve Crocker</PERSON>, in Lane 5. Jager was in Lane 4. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Crocker</PERSON> said he didn't go early. He believes he just had a wonderful start. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi suggested that swimming officials should consider using the instant 
replay as does the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> when a call comes into question. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who said he has not been disqualified for a false start in at least 12 
years, did nothing unusual on his start. And when Jager reviewed the videotape, 
he thought everyone was still. The rule states there can be no movement. 
</P>
<P>
By the time <PERSON>Jager</PERSON> spoke with reporters, he had cooled considerably. <PERSON>Jay 
Fitzgerald</PERSON>, coach of Jager's <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara Swim Team</ORGANIZATION>, had stopped him in the 
hallway to suggest using restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Jager is a competitor who relies heavily on his psyche. This time, all that 
pent-up energy was initially unleashed in the direction of <LOCATION>Eggert</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably should apologize for some of the things I said," <PERSON>Jager</PERSON> said. "I was 
pretty keyed up. I'm not proud of the things I said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't take back anything about the way they've got to learn to start 
the race. They have eight big guys up there about to make a decision by 
hundredths of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Jager said that he didn't expect to be disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"She passed me up and I didn't really think about it, but when she started 
coming back, everyone had to be scared. She was just as scared as anyone. . . . 
Once she made a decision, more than anything, she didn't want to back down from 
her original decision." 
</P>
<P>
On the restart, <PERSON>Todd Pace</PERSON> was disqualified for a false start. 
</P>
<P>
The six swimmers left were cautious during the third start. Still, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> was 
pleased with his winning time of 22.36 seconds -- not bad considering that he 
had started serious training only <DATE>six weeks ago</DATE>, after leaving the national 
water polo team. The time was a pool record, but it fell short of his 
22.14-second swim in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, which broke Jager's world record and earned the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Crocker</PERSON> was second in 22.47. 
</P>
<P>
Neither <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION>Jager</ORGANIZATION> will represent the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in the 50 at the <ORGANIZATION>Pan 
Pacific Games</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> has scheduling conflicts and will not attend. And now 
Jager isn't qualified to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Jager will, however, swim the 50 in the preliminary heats in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in what the 
swimmers call their "money swim." If he doesn't keep himself ranked in the top 
six in the world, he loses training money. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't break the world record," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> told him. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. There will be other high-profile matchups of the world's best 
sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> reminded everyone: "We have a special event here, probably the most 
exciting event in swimming. Tom and I have one of the best rivalries in all 
sports. Anything can happen on any day." 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, nothing happens, as was the case in the national final. And 
heavyweight boxing fans thought they got robbed when the last <PERSON>Mike Tyson</PERSON> fight 
was called after 93 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jager returned later in the evening to anchor the men's 400-meter medley relay 
for <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, which was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Longhorn Aquatics ran away with team honors, winning both the men's and women's 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The men's high-point winner was <PERSON>Dave Wharton</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Team Foxcatcher</ORGANIZATION>. 
Wharton added the men's 200-meter individual medley title <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to 
finish ahead of <PERSON>Dan Jorgensen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Fins Swim Club</ORGANIZATION>. Dan was more 
than 11 seconds behind his brother, <PERSON>Lars</PERSON>, in the men's 1,500-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Fullerton Aquatic Sports Team</ORGANIZATION> won her fourth national title 
of the meet and broke the pool record that <PERSON>Tiffany Cohen</PERSON> set during the <DATE>1984</DATE> 
Olympic Games, taking the women's 800-meter freestyle in 8:22.11. 
</P>
<P>
Evans holds the world record of 8:17.12, a mark she set early in <DATE>1988</DATE> before 
winning the gold medal in the event.

QUANCE MOVES A BIG STEP CLOSER TO FULFILLING OLYMPIC DREAM;

SWIMMING: NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGER'S EFFORT IN LONG COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS LANDED HER 
ON A NATIONAL TEAM THIS SUMMER AND SHOULD EARN HER A BERTH IN THE '92 OLYMPIC

Until last week, <PERSON>Kristine Quance</PERSON>'s Olympic goal was a secret, something she 
pondered on long, silent swims to avoid being mesmerized by the black line on 
the bottom of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>, 15, from <LOCATION>Northridge</LOCATION>, let the cat out of the bag <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> and 
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>U. S. Swimming National Long Course Championships</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the qualifying times will not be released until the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming 
convention <DATE>Sept. 16-23</DATE> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>'s efforts in the 400-meter 
individual medley (4 minutes 49.52 seconds) and the 200 breaststroke (2:33.52) 
are expected to be well under the qualifying standards for the Olympic Trials 
in <DATE>March, 1992</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, her third-place finishes in those races put her within striking 
distance of the first- or second-place performance she'll need to make the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
team that will travel to <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, to compete in the Games of the XXVth 
Olympiad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kinda been in the back of my mind, but I've never told anyone," <PERSON>Quance</PERSON> 
said of her Olympic aspirations. "I still don't want to tell anyone. I don't 
want to be bragging about the Olympics, but it's a little more realistic now." 
</P>
<P>
Quance made it more realistic with a drastic improvement during the past 12 
months. Her 400 IM time was seven seconds better than her previous best and a 
whopping 15 seconds faster than her best time of a year ago. In the 200 
breaststroke, her clocking was three seconds faster than what she swam unshaved 
and unrested at the <ORGANIZATION>Olympic Sports Festival</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE>, and 
seven seconds quicker than her <DATE>1989</DATE> best. 
</P>
<P>
"At her first nationals <DATE>last summer</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> we weren't expecting her to make it 
and she had an awkward time," said <PERSON>Steve Reardon</PERSON>, her coach with the <ORGANIZATION>Valley 
Aquatic Swim Team</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second one in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> <DATE>last March</DATE> she did her best times in the 
<TIME>morning</TIME> (preliminaries) but she didn't come back (well) at night (in the 
finals). It was a sign that she was too excited by her morning swims. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, she had great races in the morning and she came back and made some 
adjustments and swam even better times at night. She feels like she belongs at 
this level now." 
</P>
<P>
Already <PERSON>Quance</PERSON> has earned a berth at yet another level. This <DATE>weekend</DATE>, she will 
make her international debut in the Legion of European Nations Cup in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty excited about going to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Quance</PERSON> said. "I've never been 
anywhere with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming except <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minneapolis</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I like traveling with swimming, I really don't have a problem getting 
homesick. It's really exciting, but it can get tiring because of the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the intimidation. Quance is still in awe of Olympian <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> 
as well as <ORGANIZATION>Summer Sanders</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Mary Ellen Blanchard</PERSON>, among others. But the 
difference between her first national championship meet last <DATE>summer</DATE> and her 
last is that now she can race with the best in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the individual 
medley and the breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
"I kinda still do idolize them because they are so awesome, and when I first 
started going to nationals they were so much more awesome, " <PERSON>Quance</PERSON> said. "But 
now I'm getting closer and closer. I didn't really expect to place here and it 
still hasn't sunk in." 
</P>
<P>
While <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>'s inexperience was painfully obvious in the 200 breaststroke, her 
talent was equally apparent. She reached the first wall ahead of the field, 
established a personal best at the 100 by turning in 1:13.00 and maintained the 
lead through 150 meters. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the more experienced <PERSON>Blanchard</PERSON> (granddaughter of Heisman trophy 
winner <PERSON>Doc Blanchard</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Jill Johnson</PERSON> passed her and <PERSON>Quance</PERSON> held on for third. 
</P>
<P>
In the individual medley, she picked up time on all four strokes, but still 
suffers from a weak backstroke leg. 
</P>
<P>
"Her backstroke is something we've worked on from <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> (last <DATE>March</DATE>) until 
now," <PERSON>Reardon</PERSON> said. "It has helped her cause. She still falls behind the 
leaders, but in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, she fell behind the whole field." 
</P>
<P>
On her best leg, the breaststroke, <PERSON>Quance</PERSON> makes up for lost time, but that 
takes its toll on the final freestyle portion. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes her 25 meters to recover because she goes so hard on the 
breaststroke," <PERSON>Reardon</PERSON> said. "But all those things will work out. I guarantee 
her next nationals she'll be more competitive on the backstroke and the 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she has a taste of what it's like to be in a race like that." 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Ed Spencer</PERSON>, coach of the <ORGANIZATION>Industry Hills Aquatic Club</ORGANIZATION>, it's that 
ability to race that sets her apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes athletes only do about two-thirds of what they need to do," <PERSON>Spencer</PERSON> 
said. "Some of them work hard in the pool, but up on the blocks they are not at 
all cut out for the perfect race. 
</P>
<P>
"Others are great racers, but they are not willing to pay the price in 
workouts. Kristine is going all out in workouts and weight training on her own, 
and when she gets up on the blocks, she's all business." 
</P>
<P>
Though <PERSON>Quance</PERSON>, who began swimming at age 10, has reached the age when 
boy-watching and shopping with friends compete with the early hours, cold 
temperatures and monotony of her sensory-deprivation sport, <PERSON>Reardon</PERSON> believes 
she can withstand distractions. 
</P>
<P>
For now. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't been swimming that long so everything is really fresh and new to 
her," he said. "And she's having too much fun doing what she's doing, 
especially coming to a meet like this and getting third. 
</P>
<P>
"After <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, she said she didn't want fifth and sixth any more, and now 
she doesn't want third. She's constantly upgrading her goals." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the risk, it appears, of someone finding out.Associated Press

RAPID RISE SURPRISES MISSION VIEJO'S ERIC DIEHL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rise of <PERSON>Eric Diehl</PERSON> has begun. He has gone from promising young swimmer to 
one with a national reputation, all in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the next step is close at hand. In a month, <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> will compete at the 
Goodwill Games in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A strong showing there would give him a foothold on the international level. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has happened so fast, it's kind of caught me by surprise," said 
<PERSON>Diehl</PERSON>, who will be a senior at <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo High School</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>fall</DATE>. "But I want 
to compete in the Olympics. That's my long, long term goal. I need to get more 
experience against elite swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl figures to get plenty of that in the next several weeks. Besides the 
Goodwill Games, he will swim in the Swim Meet of Champions, which begins 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Marguerite Recreation Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mission Viejo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, which continues through <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, will feature several top American 
swimmers, including <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, plus members of the East German national team. 
</P>
<P>
It will give <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> a chance to test how far he's come since winning the 
1,000-meter freestyle at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming Short Course National Championships</ORGANIZATION> 
in <DATE>March</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to swim fast, but all my focus is on next month," <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> said. "But this 
meet will give me another chance to see where I stand. It will give me an idea 
of how well I will swim at the Goodwill Games." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Diehl</PERSON>, who swims for the <ORGANIZATION>Mission Viejo Nadadores</ORGANIZATION>, will compete in the 800-meter 
freestyle in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. He qualified for the games by winning the 1,000 freestyle 
at the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 8 minutes 58.26 seconds was a personal best and made him the only 
swimmer to finish under nine minutes in the event at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised by my performance," <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> said. "I expected to do 
well, especially in that event. But I expected the college swimmers to be much 
faster. I really thought I was a long shot to win." 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> will win <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the 800 freestyle. First, he 
hasn't tapered his training for the meet. Second, he'll be facing stiff 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Artur Wojdat, who also swims for the Nadadores, and <PERSON>Sebastian Wiese</PERSON> of <LOCATION>East 
Germany</LOCATION> also are entered in the event. Wojdat, who competes for the <ORGANIZATION>University 
of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>, was a member of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s Olympic team in <DATE>1988</DATE> and <PERSON>Wiese</PERSON> is ranked 
fifth in the world in the 800 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"The meet will be faster this year," <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> said. "Especially the 800. With 
Artur alone, it will be faster. But there are a lot more quality swimmers in 
that event this year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 800, <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> also will compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 1,500 
freestyles. It will be his last meet before tapering for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON>'s <DATE>summer</DATE> of competition will not end in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. After the Goodwill 
Games, he will go to <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming Long Course Senior 
Nationals</ORGANIZATION>, which also will be the qualifying meet for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' World 
Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl will compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong showing at the nationals could only enhance <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON>'s reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see how I do at the Goodwill Games," <PERSON>Diehl</PERSON> said. "Then I'll know how 
successful my year has been." 
</P>
<P>
Swim Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
The only events <DATE>Thursday</DATE> will be the men's and women's 800 freestyle. The 
finals are scheduled to begin at <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> . . . A group of 18 East German 
swimmers will compete, nine men and nine women. Besides <PERSON>Wiese</PERSON>, who also is

BIONDI KNOWS YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL
SOVIETS FINISH 1-2-3 IN MEN'S 50 FREESTYLE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Well, for the second day in a row <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> showed he is mortal,
finishing fourth in the 50-meter freestyle at the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara International
Invitational</ORGANIZATION> Swim Meet before an estimated 4,000 fans at the <LOCATION>Santa Clara
International Swim Center.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, the former world-record holder and <DATE>1988</DATE>
Olympic champion in the event, finished in 23.47 seconds, behind the Soviet
trio of Alexander Popov (22.78), <PERSON>Gennadi Prigoda</PERSON> (22.82) and <PERSON>Vladimir
Tkachenko</PERSON> (23.18).;    <ORGANIZATION>Popov</ORGANIZATION>'s time set a meet record, one of three individual
meet records set. The others were by <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Janel Jorgenson</PERSON> in the women's
100 butterfly (1 minute, 2.38 seconds) and Soviet <PERSON>Elena Rudkovskya</PERSON> in the
women's 100 breaststroke (1:10.30).;    The Soviets, who won four of 10 events
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, won six of 10 events <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Their men's 400 relay team set a meet
record of 3:24.09.;    The main reason for the Soviet domination is that their
swimmers are in top racing form after peaking for their national championships
three weeks ago.;    The top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers, such as <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, are unshaven and
won't begin tapering their practice workouts until next month when they train
for the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific Championships</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Aug. 22-26</DATE> in <LOCATION>Canada.</LOCATION>;    Tapering is the
process in training in which swimmers cut their workout load so they can peak
at major competitions.;    "It's a big advantage for them," <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said.
"They've got stronger, fresher legs, and they can hold tempo. It means
everything.";    Still, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> added, he feels as if he has to win every race
to live up to fans' expectations. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, he finished sixth in the 100
butterfly.;    "It's hard," he said. "I get a nice introduction, and people
expect me to win big. I don't want to let them down. But if I win <DATE>today</DATE>, I'm
not doing my job for tomorrow.";    <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON>, who swims the 100 freestyle today,
wants to remind people that in <DATE>1988</DATE>, he finished second in the 50 and 100
freestyles at this meet before winning those events at the Olympics.;    And
considering his training stage, <PERSON>Biondi</PERSON> said, he wasn't unhappy with his times
<DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. Today, he'll be looking for another good time, regardless
of where he finishes.;    "I wouldn't be surprised if I lost," he said. "The
key is to have a good time and a good swim.";      <LOCATION>ETC.</LOCATION>: Preliminaries for
today's events begin at <TIME>9:30 a.m.</TIME>, with finals set for <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME>  </TEXT>

AUSTRALIAN HAD HIS TIMING DOWN, BUT HIS RECORD BID IS UP IN THE AIR

<TEXT>
<P>
After 100 meters in a preliminary heat of the 1,500-meter freestyle at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Australian Commonwealth Games</ORGANIZATION> trials last week, <PERSON>Glen Housman</PERSON> knew something 
special was happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was in front of a world-record pace and thought, what the heck, let's 
go for it," <PERSON>Housman</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Sydney Morning Herald</ORGANIZATION>. "I just put my head down 
and kept swimming and swimming." 
</P>
<P>
When the race was over, <PERSON>Housman</PERSON>'s time was 14 minutes 53.59 seconds, which was 
1.17 seconds under Soviet swimmer <PERSON>Vladimir Salnikov</PERSON>'s world record of 14:54.76. 
However, <PERSON>Housman</PERSON>'s finishing touch did not stop the electronic timing system, 
so his time was not recognized by <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION>, the sport's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Most timing systems at big meets are equipped with a backup electronic timing 
device that starts with the gun and is stopped by the timers at the end of the 
race; however, this meet had no electronic backup. Housman's time was 
determined by taking the middle time of the three timers' hand-held 
stopwatches. The times were 14:53.57, 14:53.59 and 14:53.60. 
</P>
<P>
Because the times on the watches were so close and the time was considerably 
under the existing mark, the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Institute of Sport</ORGANIZATION> filed a petition 
with <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION> to have the record allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"We will undertake every possible action to see that the record is acknowledged 
by the world governing body," <PERSON>Craig McLatchey</PERSON>, executive director of the 
Australian institute, told the <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the <ORGANIZATION>FINA</ORGANIZATION> technical committee, <PERSON>Roger Smith</PERSON>, was the meet director, 
and he will endorse the petition. "I have been officiating swimming carnivals 
for the past 30 years and I have never struck this kind of thing before," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Housman</PERSON>, 18, became the second swimmer to go under 15 minutes in the 1,500. 
Salnikov, who won the 1,500 in the <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, has been under 15 
minutes four times. Several swimmers have been close, including <PERSON>George Dicarlo</PERSON>, 
who holds the American record of 15:01.51. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of this year's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Open, held <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Justice Aquatic Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Orlando Fla.</LOCATION>, was the return of <PERSON>Troy Dalbey</PERSON>. Swimming 
for the first time since last year's <LOCATION>Seoul Olympics</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> won the 100-meter 
freestyle and was second in the 200-meter freestyle, with times close to what 
he swam to make the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON>, a double gold-medalist in <DATE>1988</DATE>, was banned from competing in <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> Swimming-sanctioned meets for a year after he was caught taking a statue 
from a bar in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Because he had been away from competitive swimming for so long, <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> was 
unsure of how he would perform in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important meet for me, as far as my confidence went," <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> said. 
"If I didn't do well there, I wasn't sure I'd ever have enough confidence to 
win again." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> has also returned to school. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>1987</DATE> NCAA meet, as a freshman at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> was runner-up to <PERSON>Matt 
Biondi</PERSON> in the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyles. His time in the 200 made him 
the second-fastest performer in that event. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> took the next year off to train for the Olympics. When he returned, he 
decided that he did not want to re-enroll at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Instead, he enrolled at 
<ORGANIZATION>BYU</ORGANIZATION>. After living in <LOCATION>Provo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, for two months, he decided that the area was 
not to his liking. His next stop was <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>, where he is now. 
</P>
<P>
He did little training initially but has been in the water regularly this 
semester. <PERSON>Ron Johnson</PERSON>, the Sun Devil coach, is glad to have <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the type of swimmer who can make a program by himself," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. 
"He can swim anything but is especially good in the middle-distance freestyles 
and on the relays." 
</P>
<P>
Under <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rules, <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> could not compete for <ORGANIZATION>ASU</ORGANIZATION> this semester. Starting with 
next semester, he has 1 1/2 years of eligibility left. Dalbey lost a year 
because <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> would not release him from his scholarship. ASU is petitioning 
the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> to have one year of eligibility restored on the basis of an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rule 
that states if an athlete takes a year out of school to train for the Olympics 
and makes the team, the year does not count against him. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, <PERSON>Dalbey</PERSON> is having fun swimming again. He plans to help <ORGANIZATION>ASU</ORGANIZATION> do as 
well as it can and keep swimming toward the next Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, <PERSON>Mark Spitz</PERSON> announced that he was returning to swimming and aiming 
for a spot on the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympic team in the 100-meter butterfly. Because <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> 
is interested in just the one event, and possibly a relay, he enlisted the help 
of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> men's Coach <PERSON>Ron Ballatore</PERSON>, one of the top sprint coaches in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After five months, <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> says he is progressing well, training five days a week 
at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing fine. The big thing is not to get into (training) too quickly," 
<PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said. "I've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Spitz last raced was in <DATE>1972</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Montreal Olympics</LOCATION>, where he won four 
individual events and was on three winning relay teams. Spitz chose the 
100-meter butterfly because it was his best event. His world record in 
<LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION>, 54.27 seconds, stood until <DATE>1977</DATE>, when <PERSON>Joe Bottom</PERSON> swam 54.18. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz expects to enter his first race sometime in the <DATE>spring</DATE> but won't be 
concerned with how he does. "In swimming, you don't really get your act 
together until the end of the season," <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said, "and since I'm shooting for 
<DATE>1992</DATE>, I've got a long way to go." 
</P>

JANET EVANS THRIVING AT STANFORD

<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> knew she was going to be asked, again, about the Olympics, and her 
eyes glazed over a little. After a long afternoon's workout at deGuerre Pool 
she would rather have talked about the here and now -- about <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s meet 
between <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the No.-1 and No.-2 women's swimming teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm really psyched up for it," said <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, holder of three 
world records, three American records and three gold medals from the <DATE>1988</DATE> 
Olympics. "If we do well against <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, it'll help our mind-set for the NCAAs, 
something we're all looking forward to." 
</P>
<P>
Evans talked about her first year with the Cardinals -- she has won 16 of her 
22 races and finished no lower than third. Not coincidentally, she is 6-0 and 
has won 13 straight dual meets, dating back to the <DATE>1988</DATE> season. The team, rated 
No.-1 in women's swimming all year, is coming off lopsided 104-36 and 117-16 
wins over <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns, 7-0 this season, are ranked second in the nation. They are led 
by <PERSON>Leigh Ann Fetter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Amy Shaw</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andrea Hayes</PERSON>, who will likely swim against 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> in the longer freestyle races. Handicapping the meet, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said, "We 
have to swim as fast as we can, and I think we'll be able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But then the subject turned, out of her hands, toward the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics in 
<LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, when <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> was the designated pixie of the press, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Sweetheart, 
the high school senior from <LOCATION>Placentia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, who went from three gold medals 
to being Grand Marshal of both the <ORGANIZATION>Macy</ORGANIZATION>'s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the 
<LOCATION>Fiesta Bowl</LOCATION>. Those were the days when TV mini-cams would chase her around the 
campus at <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High</ORGANIZATION> to get quotes, remembered <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who opted to come to 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> after being wooed by a dozen schools, including <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've come here I think the craziness has really died down," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, 
18. "Sometimes someone will recognize me -- I can see them say to themselves, 
'Is that her?' -- but they leave me pretty much alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy training with the team," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, adding that emotion for 
the dual meet against <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> is running high. "It's just as intense as it was at 
the Olympics, even more intense. The difference at the Olympics is you're just 
swimming by yourself -- here it's the whole team, you're all in it together." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 5-6, 110, has qualified for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> finals in four events since coming 
to <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION> -- the 500, <DATE>1000</DATE> and 1650-yard freestyle and the 400 individual 
medley. She has improved from a time of 2:08.35 in the 200 fly on <DATE>Jan. 6</DATE> to a 
time of 2:04.61 two weeks later, from a time of 2:03.53 in the 200 free in 
<DATE>December</DATE> to a time of 1:50.71 on <DATE>Jan. 26</DATE>, and from a time of 9:45.41 in the 
<DATE>1000</DATE> freestyle <DATE>Jan. 6</DATE> to a time of 9:32.63 against <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> <DATE>last weekend</DATE>, only 
seven seconds off her American record. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Arizona I was swimming my best," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who practices up to five 
hours a day, a regimen she's maintained for six years. To keep from drowning in 
boredom on the endless laps, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> will talk to herself, "sing a song, think 
about how much homework I've got to do when I get back ..." 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way ever since junior high, she explained -- while her friends 
went to drive-ins and <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> dances, she would be making another circle 
around the pool. "I used to think, 'Look at all the things they get to do,' but 
then look at the things I've been able to do that they haven't, so it kind of 
balanced out." 
</P>
<P>
Evans wasn't sure she was good enough to be a top swimmer until she went to the 
Goodwill Games in <DATE>1986</DATE> and barely missed making the world team. That's when she 
realized "I really enjoy competing, seeing the rewards of working hard," said 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, adding, "For some reason I've always been better at distance. I've never 
been a sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she won gold medals at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> in the 400 individual medley, the 
800-meter freestyle and the 400-meter freestyle -- setting the world record -- 
that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> sat up and took notice, and ever since then <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> has been trying 
to get things back to normal. "I'm surprised at how genuine she is," said 
swimming coach <PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON>. "She doesn't have one bone of prima donna in 
her." 
</P>
<P>
At the time <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> signed a commitment to come to <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION> <DATE>last May</DATE>, Quick said, 
"Obviously, I feel we've recruited one of the greatest athletes in American 
history ... the things that she has already accomplished are without precedent 
in <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> swimming." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, he's even more impressed since <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> has come to <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, 
explained Quick. "I've never seen anybody so consistent in the hours she puts 
into practice. She puts more time into swimming than anyone I've ever heard of" 
</P>
<P>
Every serious swimmer puts in a lot of hours, said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, but it takes more 
than that. "A lot of it is in your head. You've got to have the confidence you 
can do it. I think <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of it is in your head ... believing you can win."

OLYMPIANS TO GET TIME TO BREATHE

<TEXT>
<P>
It has long been said, only somewhat in jest, that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic trials 
constitute the toughest swim meet in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask <PERSON>Andy Coan</PERSON>. The world record-holder in the 100-meter freestyle in <DATE>1975</DATE>, 
he did not qualify for the Olympic team in <DATE>1976</DATE>. For that matter, he didn't 
make the eight-man field for the trials final. 
</P>
<P>
The limit on entries, two per event, and the depth of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimming conspire to 
make the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trials more difficult than the Olympic Games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
That is expected to change at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Swimming Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> next 
week when the 600-member <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> votes to confirm <DATE>March 1-6</DATE> as the 
dates for the <DATE>1992</DATE> U.S. Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team was selected only three or four weeks before the 
Olympic Games. The <DATE>March</DATE> dates, an adaptation of the Australian system, will 
give the team almost four months of training together before the <DATE>1992</DATE> Games in 
<LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the old system, some coaches believed, was that to make the 
highly competitive <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team, swimmers were tapering -- easing up on their 
training and shaving their body hair -- for the trials, then repeating the 
process a few weeks later for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The second time, many believe, the taper doesn't take as effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes such a big effort just to make the team and then we were asking them 
to bounce back for the Games a month later," said <PERSON>Doug Ingram</PERSON>, date selection 
chairman. "It's tough to come off that emotional high from the trials that 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
But some coaches contend that the early selection process penalizes the "hot" 
swimmer, the one who peaks at the trials and continues to pick up speed through 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram believes that sacrifice will have to be made. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel what's best for the group outweighs the potential loss of an 
individual who comes on at the last minute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new system also has a major impact on collegiate swimming, since the trials 
will be held three to four weeks before the women's and men's <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> Division I 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll take some focus away from the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championships, but what came across 
in our meetings with college and club coaches is that in an Olympic year they 
are willing to put aside their local concerns and put the focus on the national 
concern," said <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON>, who coaches the men's team at <ORGANIZATION>Southern Illinois 
University</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The conference championship meets will be affected even more, since potential 
Olympians won't taper for them. Instead, they will train hard up to and during 
the conference meets so that they can taper before the Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some conferences, including the Pac-10 and the <LOCATION>Southeastern</LOCATION>, are 
considering moving their conference meets from <DATE>March, 1992</DATE>, to <DATE>December, 1991</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"That takes the pressure off an individual who might feel that he was letting 
his team down by focusing on the Olympic trials," <PERSON>Ingram</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The system will be tested in <DATE>January</DATE>. For the first time, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> picked a 
national team several months in advance. The World Championships team was 
selected in early <DATE>August</DATE> and will compete <DATE>Jan. 7-11</DATE> in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mission Bay swimming program appeared on the scene in <DATE>1985</DATE> by hiring 
away <PERSON>Mark Schubert</PERSON> from the Mission <PERSON>Viejo Nadadores</PERSON>, it appeared to be 
patterning itself after a Nadador program that had won 44 national team titles. 
The club, in <LOCATION>Boca Raton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, had the facilities, the funding and the coaching 
to attract swimmers from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Just <DATE>two years later</DATE>, it lost <PERSON>Schubert</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> women's 
program and the affiliated Longhorn club. Now his successor, <PERSON>Steve Bultman</PERSON>, an 
assistant on the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympic team, is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think <LOCATION>Mission Bay</LOCATION> is probably the best training facility in the 
country, but I do think coaching changes have not had a stabilizing effect," 
<PERSON>Schubert</PERSON> said. "It is not on as solid a footing as it appeared to be at the 
beginning. The budget cuts have hurt. It never lived up to the dream it was 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Schubert's Longhorn club is up to 250 members, an increase of 40. More swimmers 
are expected with the recent addition of a satellite facility, a 50-meter pool 
in the Circle C section of <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> are vying to be the 
host of the <DATE>1992</DATE> Olympic trials, although late bids will be accepted before the 
voting at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming convention <DATE>Sept. 23</DATE> in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION>. . . . Voting 
will be held there for performance of the year. <PERSON>Tom Jager</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Barrowman</PERSON>, 
the only <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> swimmers to set world records in <DATE>1990</DATE>, appear to be the best 
bets. Jager, the former <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> star, lowered the 50-meter freestyle mark twice on 
<DATE>March 24</DATE> in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> with a final clocking of 21.81 seconds. Barrowman 
bettered the mark he set in <DATE>August 1989</DATE> in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> by a whopping 1.36 seconds, 
the most improvement of the 200 breaststroke record since <DATE>1976</DATE>. . . . Finalists 
for swimmer of the year are <PERSON>Barrowman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Jager</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Matt Biondi</PERSON> , <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, <PERSON>Melvin 
Stewart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eric Namesnik</PERSON>, <PERSON>Leigh Ann Fetter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nicole Haislett</PERSON>. <PERSON>Jon Urbanchek</PERSON> of 
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>, formerly coach at <LOCATION>Cal State Long Beach</LOCATION>, was named 
coach of the year by the <ORGANIZATION>American Swimming Coaches Assn.</ORGANIZATION> at itsconvention last 
week in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. Urbanchek is credited with having developed Barrowman. . . 
. Olympic gold medalist <PERSON>Mark Spitz</PERSON> is at the <ORGANIZATION>Olympic Training Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, for tests at the <ORGANIZATION>International Center for Aquatic 
Research</ORGANIZATION>. Spitz plans to swim in the flume, the only swimming treadmill in the 
<LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>. His stroke efficiency and swimming economy, a gauge of how 
efficiently he uses oxygen, will be measured and compared to future tests. . . 
. On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> and members of <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>'s six <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championship teams, <DATE>1968</DATE> 
through <DATE>'73</DATE>, will meet in <LOCATION>Bloomington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind.</LOCATION>, for a reunion.

<LEADPARA>  She has seen the 3-year-old videotape so many times she's almost sick of it.
For a while, every time company came over to her house in Roseville, her
father would pop it in the VCR and she would have to relive the race again.;  
 "The more I saw it, the more I thought it was so close," said Summer Sanders,
who's finishing her freshman year at Stanford with three Goodwill Games, one
world championship and three NCAA swimming titles since this time last year.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SANDERS LOOKS AHEAD TO OLYMPICS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Then here these people are in the Olympics, and I think I should have been
there.";    She could have been there, swimming for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1988</DATE>, but at the Olympic trials that <DATE>spring</DATE> she
finished third in the 200-meter individual medley -- one place from the
Olympic team but captured for posterity on Dad's videotape.;    Fifty meters
from the finish, turning from breaststroke to freestyle for the final time
down the pool, 15-year-old Summer <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> had been first.;    "I turned my
breast-free turn and took a breath my first stroke and looked and there was
just nobody there," <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> said. "They all hadn't made their turns yet. I
knew I was up with the leaders, but I didn't know I was ahead. I thought, oh,
my gosh. I had an Olympic gold medalist in the 200 freestyle (<PERSON>Mary Wayte</PERSON>)
right beside me, and when people are 15-year-olds, you know . . .";    Yes, we
know. Fifteen-year-olds either have no idea of the significance of what
they're about to accomplish, and they shock the world and themselves, or they
understand and psych themselves out.;    <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> knew. Sanders faded.;    Yet,
in those three years, other things have faded as well. Mostly her anonymity.; 
  "She is an odds-on favorite to make the <DATE>1992</DATE> U.S. Olympic team," Coach
<PERSON>Richard Quick</PERSON> said when he signed her for Stanford.;    As superstitious as
she is, <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> wishes he had never said those words, but she beat the world
in the 200 butterfly -- her favorite event -- in <DATE>January</DATE>, was second in the
200 I.M. and third in the 400 <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION>;    She has rested this week at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Swimming Spring Nationals</ORGANIZATION>, dodging those events to win the 100 butterfly and
swim for her old club, <ORGANIZATION>California Capital</ORGANIZATION>, in the 400 medley relay.;    She'll
take the next week or two off and then begin training for the Olympic trials a
year from now in <LOCATION>Indianapolis.</LOCATION>;    "The Olympics are my ultimate goal," she
said. "That's the highest step you can make in amateur athletics.;    "When I
look back (at the '88 trials), I'm not really disappointed. If I had been to
the Olympics, what would my goals have been after that? Would my confidence
still be up?";    Perhaps not, because <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON>, while willing to put in the
work, is not someone such as former <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> teammate <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, who lives
to marinate in chlorine.;    She hates the pain of the 400 <LOCATION>I.M.</LOCATION>, her longest
event, and even 200s bother her.;    "My goal is by my senior year to be down
to 50s and 100s," she said. "When you have a bad 400, it's really bad. There's
four minutes of hell in there that just doesn't go by quick. A hundred is only
a minute. That's not so bad.";    Plus, if she screws up, the videotape is
short, too.  </TEXT>

<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, a triple gold-medal winner in the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympics, scored two 
victories <DATE>Friday</DATE> as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> continued to dominate the <ORGANIZATION>Pan Pacific 
Swimming Championships</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Evans won the women's 400-meter individual medley in meet-record time, then 
pushed the 800-meter freestyle relay team to a meet-record victory. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team won six of nine events in the 
50-meter <ORGANIZATION>Yoyogi National Olympic</ORGANIZATION> swimming pool. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> 
each won one race. 
</P>
<P>
In the 400-meter individual medley, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> took the lead after 100 meters and 
easily won in 4 minutes 39.38 seconds for her 20th straight victory. 
</P>

<P>
The events and the years change, but the results are always the same for 
USDHS's <PERSON>Alison Terry</PERSON>. In every individual event she has entered in the <LOCATION>San 
Diego Section</LOCATION> swimming finals, she has not only won but set a record. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a junior, went into <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s swimming and diving championships at <ORGANIZATION>Mt. 
Carmel High</ORGANIZATION> having already set section marks in four events, two as a freshman 
and two as a sophomore. This year, <PERSON>Terry</PERSON> set her sights on two new events -- 
the 200-yard individual medley and 100 butterfly -- and broke the records in 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
Terry's was not the only repeat performance -- the <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> boys and girls swam 
away with team championships for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Poway had four individual boys' winners and scored 322 points to second-place 
Mt. <LOCATION>Carmel</LOCATION>'s 205. The girls won the first event of the day, the 200 medley 
relay, and had 11 entries in the individual finals. None of its swimmers 
finished higher than second, but all of them either held or improved qualifying 
positions as the Titans defeated <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Buena Vista</ORGANIZATION>, 254-199. 
</P>
<P>
Terry swam the 200-yard IM in 2 minutes 5.71 seconds, bettering the 2:06.02 set 
by <ORGANIZATION>Hilltop</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Tami Bruce</PERSON> in <DATE>1985</DATE>. Later, <PERSON>Terry</PERSON> swam the 100 butterfly in 57.24, 
more than two seconds faster than any of her opponents, to bring down the 
longest-standing girls' mark of 57.52 set by <ORGANIZATION>Point Loma</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Leslie Mendez</PERSON> in 
<DATE>1978</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman in <DATE>1988</DATE>, <PERSON>Terry</PERSON> set marks in the 50 freestyle (24.09) and the 100 
backstroke (58.55). Last year, she broke records in the 200 freestyle (1:49.62) 
and 100 freestyle (50.56). She now owns section records in six of the eight 
girls' individual events. About the only question that remains: Will <PERSON>Terry</PERSON> come 
back as a senior and attack the 500 freestyle and 100 breaststroke? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't decided yet," she said. "I already swam the 50 and 100 back faster 
than the record times. I hear there's a freshman coming to our school next year 
that does a 1:52 in the 200 free. If that's the case, I might do that. I like a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that would challenge <PERSON>Terry</PERSON>, who competed for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Junior National</ORGANIZATION> 
team at an event in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> during the winter, is the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a goal to be there in '92 (in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION>) or <DATE>'96</DATE>," she said. "No pain, 
no <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. That's my slogan." 
</P>
<P>
Poway's boys got two victories each from <PERSON>Marc Fairon</PERSON> (1:58.03 in the 200 
individual medley and 59.0 in the 100 breaststroke) and <PERSON>Trevor Jamison</PERSON> (51.84 
in the 100 butterfly and 21.72 in the 50 freestyle). Of the 11 <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> swimmers 
to reach the finals, seven placed in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked tired the last couple of events," <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Dennis Moore</PERSON> said. 
"They're so competitive. I think a lot of our kids used most of their energy in 
the prelims (<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and <DATE>Thursday</DATE>). They don't like to lose." 
</P>
<P>
USDHS's girls, who finished fourth with 151 points, won five finals. <PERSON>Leah 
Schraeder</PERSON> qualified third and sixth in the 50 and 100 freestyles, but won both. 
USDHS's 400 freestyle relay, anchored by <PERSON>Terry</PERSON>, qualified third but won in 
3:39.34. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Alison Terry</PERSON>'s time in the 200 individual medley qualified her for All-American 
honors from the <ORGANIZATION>National Interscholastic Swim Coaches of America</ORGANIZATION>. . . . <PERSON>Mira 
Mesa</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Mike Picotte</PERSON>, who set section records in the 200 freestyle (1:38.44) and 
100 freestyle (45.21) last year, won both races again this year but was slower: 
1:40.47 and 45.64. . . . <LOCATION>San Dieguito</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Kari Lyderson</PERSON> claimed championships in 
the girls' 200 freestyle (1:51.5) and 500 freestyle (4:54.17).

<P>
What do you give a girl who has nearly everything? How about a teddy bear? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, world-class distance swimmer, treasures a stuffed animal as much 
as the three gold medals she won in the <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> Olympics last <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The teddy bear was a present from one of her teammates at <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado High 
School</ORGANIZATION>. But the entire team presented it to her at the Southern Section 3-A 
finals in <DATE>May</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was from my secret pal on the team," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "Everyone on the team has 
one, and we give each other little gifts before every meet. But this one was 
from everyone. They all signed a card and gave it to me. It was neat." 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, The Times' Orange County girls' swimmer of the year, the gift marked 
the end of an illustrious high school career. 
</P>
<P>
While at <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> competed in four <ORGANIZATION>Southern Section</ORGANIZATION> championship meets. 
Including relays, she won 10 Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked the Southern Section meet," said <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who will attend 
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> on a swimming scholarship in the <DATE>fall</DATE>. "It was fun to compete with a 
team. I like being with my peers." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> has had few of those in the pool, especially on the high school level. 
She holds national high school records in the 200-yard individual medley and 
500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>1989</DATE> 3-A meet, <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> broke her national high school record in the 200 
individual medley with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. She also won the 500 
freestyle in 4:38.34, missing her national mark by a second. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also helped <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado</ORGANIZATION>'s 200 medley relay team finish first. The Golden 
Hawks finished second at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place finish is <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>' fondest memory of her high school 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really exciting," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "It was the highest <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION> has ever 
finished. That was special. I'm glad I was a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
For <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, the high school season was a welcome break from the rigors of 
international competition. It was a chance to be with her friends and have a 
little fun. She regularly swam in events other than her specialties in dual 
meets, as well as swimming on relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to swim the 100 backstroke and 100 breaststroke during dual meets," 
<PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "I could never do that on the international level. I'm a distance 
swimmer; there's no way I could beat the best in the world in the 100-meter 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school swimming, I get to be with my friends. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
It may sound odd, but <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> has actually lost a high school race in the 
Southern Section championship meet. Of course, that was back in those 
pre-legend days when she was a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing in the 200 individual medley in <DATE>1985</DATE>, she has won every individual 
championship race. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's over already," <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> said. "High school went by so fast. 
It's hard to imagine not swimming in high school anymore. It's a little sad."

The Stanford women's swimming team won four more events <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to seal 
their fourth consecutive Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championship at 
the <ORGANIZATION>East Los Angeles College Pool</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford totaled 1,717 points. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> finished second with 1,238, followed 
by <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> (1,143), <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> (1,075) and USC (936). 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's first victory came in the first event when freshman <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON> 
lapped the field in the 1,650-yard freestyle, setting a conference record of 
15:53.77. 
</P>
<P>
Although victories are almost becoming routine for <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, who had won two 
events in earlier sessions, she was excited by her effort. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to go under 16 minutes and I was very happy to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Susannah Miller</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> senior, led a Cardinal sweep in the 200-yard 
backstroke. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, who touched with an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> qualifying time of 2:01.29, was 
followed by <PERSON>Jody Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dede Trimble</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kristin Stoudt</PERSON>, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, won the 100-yard freestyle with a 
conference record of 49.93. <PERSON>Michelle Thompson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> was second. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Stoudt</PERSON>, who won the 50-yard freestyle <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, swam her best time ever. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to break 50 seconds," <PERSON>Stoudt</PERSON> said. "I'm confident going to <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION>'s 
because I know I can go faster." 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, the 200-yard breaststroke, <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> freshman <PERSON>Lori Heisick</PERSON> 
led from the beginning on the way to her second championship with a time of 
2:15.82. Her teammates, <PERSON>Jill Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bethanne Lambert</PERSON>, were second and 
third, respectively. Heisick won the 100-yard breaststroke <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's final victory came when freshman <PERSON>Janel Jorgensen</PERSON> joined <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> as a 
three-event winner with a victory in the 200-yard butterfly. <PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON>'s time 
of 1:58.75 was just off <PERSON>Mary T. Meagher</PERSON>'s conference record of 1:57.4, but well 
under the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> was happy with the victory, but had hoped for <ORGANIZATION>Meagher</ORGANIZATION>'s record. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about the record, but I wasn't sure if I could get it tonight," 
<PERSON>Jorgensen</PERSON> said. "We'll see, with a couple of weeks of rest, whether I can get 
her other marks." 
</P>
<P>
Meagher also holds the American records in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly 
events. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA added another championship by winning the 400-yard freestyle relay with a 
time of 3:23.29. Stanford was second and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> third. All three teams qualified 
for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> championships to be held <DATE>March 15-17</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
For <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>, the relay was merely icing on the cake. Stanford, the defending 
national champion, is top-ranked this year, and after this weekend's 
performances is in good position to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
For <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>, the result of the relay was a great way to end the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great Pac-10's," <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Cyndi Gallagher</PERSON> said. "The last relay 
just topped it off." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pac-10 diving championships, <PERSON>Jill Campbell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> won the 
10-meter platform event, defeating <PERSON>Kristin Jensen</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, 360.30-350.50, 
at the <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's Swim Stadium</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Katie Connor</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, who won the 
one- and three-meter springboard championships, was third. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brian Earley</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> won the men's 10-meter platform with 543.80 points. The 
victory was <ORGANIZATION>Earley</ORGANIZATION>'s second of the meet; he won the three-meter springboard 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. <PERSON>Chris Dudka</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> finished second.

L.A. INVITATIONAL SWIM MEET;

<P>
The <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Invitational Swim Meet tied together the past and the present of 
American women's swimming <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and, in so doing, unwrapped what looks to be a 
bright future. 
</P>
<P>
The past: <PERSON>Carrie Steinseifer</PERSON>, who won a <DATE>1984</DATE> gold medal in the 100-meter 
freestyle but later quit swimming altogether, won the 100-meter butterfly 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> as the four-day invitational ended. 
</P>
<P>
The present: <PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, three-time gold medalist at the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, won 
the 200-meter individual medley by four seconds after finishing second in the 
100-meter backstroke, an event she hadn't competed in since she was 10. 
</P>
<P>
The future: <PERSON>Steinseifer</PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON>Evans</PERSON>, 17, were among a handful of swimmers to 
qualify for <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senior Nationals</ORGANIZATION> which will be held <DATE>July 31-Aug</DATE>. 4 right back 
at <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION>'s Olympic Swim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Just <DATE>three months ago</DATE>, it not only appeared that <PERSON>Steinseifer</PERSON> wouldn't qualify 
for nationals, but it also appeared that she didn't much care. She had quit 
swimming for eight months because she says the sport ceased being fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I left with the intention of never coming back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she did return, much to the dismay of those opponents she blew out of the 
water in the 100-meter butterfly <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with a 1:03.78. The only swimmer to 
stay close was top-qualifier <PERSON>Francie Oleary</PERSON>, who finished with a 1:04.07. 
<PERSON>Steinseifer</PERSON> also won the 100-meter freestyle on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to see her hungry again," said <PERSON>Pierre LaFontaine</PERSON>, her coach. "I 
don't think she ever lost the taste for winning." 
</P>
<P>
Steinseifer began training again in <DATE>April</DATE>, putting her a little behind in 
training, but, as this weekend proved, a little ahead of her competition. She 
has flourished as a member of the Phoenician Swim Team, a group that refuses to 
keep quiet whenever she swims. 
</P>
<P>
"I just missed swimming," <PERSON>Steinseifer</PERSON> said. "It had provided a lot of 
excitement and happiness in my life. . . . I still think there are a lot of 
good swims left in this body." 
</P>
<P>
In other events <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Andrea Cecchi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, who set a meet record in the 
100-meter breast-stroke with a time of 1:04.45 in the preliminaries, was 
disqualified before the finals for failing to check in after the preliminaries. 
<PERSON>Richard Schroeder</PERSON>, who finished fourth in the event at the <DATE>1988</DATE> Olympics, won 
with a time of 1:04.84. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200-meter individual medley, <PERSON>Ray Looze</PERSON> set a meet record at 
2:07.10, and <PERSON>Joyce Lightfoot</PERSON> and Olympian <PERSON>Lars Jorgensen</PERSON> won the 1,500-meter 
freestyles.

EAST GERMANS MAY BE HEARING SWAN SONG; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING: NOT ONLY IS THEIR SYSTEM CHANGING, BUT U.S. WOMEN APPEAR TO BE 
GAINING GROUND.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a scene all too familiar to the opponents of East German women swimmers 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Having won the gold and bronze medals in a race, two East Germans stood on the 
victory stand <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night during the Goodwill Games at the <ORGANIZATION>King County 
Aquatics Center</ORGANIZATION> and listened to their national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
As practiced early during their training in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s elaborate system of 
sports schools, they stood at attention, forbidden to sing the words in public, 
appearing emotionless. But that is all it was, an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that when I heard the national anthem, it did make me feel sad," 
said <PERSON>Heike Friedrich</PERSON>, who finished third in the 200-meter freestyle, behind 
gold medalist teammate <PERSON>Manuella Stellmach</PERSON> and silver medalist <PERSON>Nicole Haislett</PERSON> 
of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it is one of the last times I will hear it. Even though there were 
things wrong with our system, there were things that worked for us." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was ultimately important, and many in the country argue today that 
it was not, one thing that worked extremely well was <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>'s sports 
system. In no sport did the so-called "Miracle Machine" achieve more success 
than in women's swimming. 
</P>
<P>
After emerging as a power in the <DATE>1974</DATE> World Championships, East German women 
won gold medals in 11 of 13 events at the <DATE>1976</DATE> Olympics. Twelve years later, 
after two Olympics tainted by boycotts, East German women won gold medals in 10 
of 15 events at <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In the Goodwill Games swimming competition, which ended <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, East 
German women won gold medals in only three of 17 events. <PERSON>Stellmach</PERSON>'s victory in 
the 200 freestyle was their only individual gold. They won two relays, but, for 
the first time since <DATE>1978</DATE>, they also lost one, finishing second to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
<DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in the 400-meter medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
"The Goodwill Games is not the most important competition for us," <PERSON>Friedrich</PERSON> 
said. "We are goal-oriented toward the World Championships in <DATE>January</DATE>." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the next breath, <PERSON>Friedrich</PERSON> admitted that she fears the East Germans 
will not fare much better at the World Championships in <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
That could be their last major international competition as a separate team, 
although, considering the speed with which East and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> are merging 
their political systems, it is possible that the Goodwill Games was the last. 
</P>
<P>
"The political changes have affected us," <PERSON>Friedrich</PERSON> said. "It will definitely 
be worse in the next six months. It will be worse than it has been in the last 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, 20, was a heroine in her country after she returned from <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION>, 
where she won a gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
But when the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall began coming down, the veil of secrecy surrounding the 
sports system followed. Resentful when they learned of the privileges 
successful athletes received, many East Germans blamed the athletes. 
Friedrich's West German car reportedly was vandalized last <DATE>December</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through a six-week trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to train and compete here, 
<PERSON>Friedrich</PERSON>'s coach, <PERSON>Joachim Rother</PERSON>, learned that he had lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
His sports club in <LOCATION>Chemnitz</LOCATION>, known as <PERSON>Karl Marx Stadt</PERSON> until earlier this year, 
lost much of its funding and decided to retain only four swimming coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been gone for six weeks and wasn't there to defend his position," 
<PERSON>Friedrich</PERSON> said. "While he was gone, others grabbed up all of the spots." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting to be swallowed by the more financially stable West German system, <LOCATION>East 
Germany</LOCATION>'s sports committee has withdrawn support from most of the sports 
schools and clubs. Only those that have managed to enlist corporate sponsors 
are thriving. East German coaches and athletes are faced with finding jobs 
outside athletics in order to support their training. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go home, we don't know if we will have any training opportunities at 
all," <PERSON>Stellmach</PERSON> said. "Up to now, training has been made available to anyone 
who qualified. Now we have to go out and find sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Their rivals from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> have been taking it all in, although not so 
gleefully as might be expected considering the beatings they've taken in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Their coaches and swimmers are really worried about what will happen when they 
get back home," <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> freestyler <PERSON>Stacy Cassiday</PERSON> said. "They're sort of in a 
panic. They call home almost every day to see what has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Considering their youth, talent and depth, the young Americans -- "The New Kids 
on the Block" -- might have been ready to overtake the East Germans regardless. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women won 11 gold medals and nine silvers in 17 Goodwill Games events. 
<PERSON>Janet Evans</PERSON>, still only 18, won three gold medals and two silvers. In the 
200-meter butterfly <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <PERSON>Summer Sanders</PERSON>, 17, won her third gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"The East Germans are down a little bit in this meet," <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> women's <ORGANIZATION>Coach 
Richard Quick of Stanford</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>last weekend</DATE>. "Anyone can understand why from a 
political point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know that it's over for the East Germans. They may not be called 
East Germans, but they'll be back. They're just great athletes."

HOMESTEAD'S TAYLORS READY TO MAKE BIG SPLASH IN
CCS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  High School Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Karli and <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON> not only have continued the family aquatics tradition at
<LOCATION>Homestead</LOCATION>, but they also are regarded as two of the finest swimmers in the
<LOCATION>Central Coast Section.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Karli</PERSON>, a senior, and <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON>, a freshman, will be
among the favorites in their events at the CCS Swimming and Diving
Championships this weekend at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>'s deGuerre Pool.;   The swimming trials
begin <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <TIME>10:30 a.m.</TIME> Diving competition starts <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME>,
followed by the swimming finals at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME>;   <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> won the 200-yard individual
medley and 100 backstroke titles at last year's section meet, and she is the
choice to repeat in those events.;   She also probably would have been the
favorite in the 100 freestyle, but swimmers are limited to two individual and
two relay events in the section finals.;   <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON>, who has been among this
year's top CCS swimmers in the 100 breaststroke, 500 freestyle and individual
medley, said she will swim the breaststroke at the CCS meet but hasn't decided
whether her other event will be the 500 free or 200 I.M.;   If she chooses the
200 I.M., she will compete against her sister.;   "I wouldn't mind beating
<PERSON>Karli</PERSON>," <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON> said. "But it would be difficult. She is much stronger in that
event than I am.";   <PERSON>Karli</PERSON>'s fastest swim in the 200 I.M. is 2 minutes, 7
seconds, her winning time in last year's CCS meet. <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON> said her best is
2:10.29, in <DATE>April</DATE> at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Swimming meet.;   The sisters, both of whom
compete for the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara Swim Club</ORGANIZATION>, also will be part of <ORGANIZATION>Homestead</ORGANIZATION>'s 200
medley and 400 free relay teams.;   <PERSON>Paul Taylor</PERSON>, the father of <PERSON>Robin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Karli</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Ryann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kyle</PERSON>, a sophomore water polo player and swimmer at <LOCATION>Homestead</LOCATION>, said
the <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> family is in its third generation of producing swimmers.;   "The
first two generations of Taylors swam for Redford High in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Paul
Taylor</PERSON> said. "One of my brothers is still competing in <LOCATION>masters.</LOCATION>;   "There has
yet to be a Taylor swim in college -- but it looks like <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> will be the
first.";   <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Southern Cal</LOCATION> and UC-Santa <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> have expressed
interest in her. She said she will be making a recruiting visit to <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> this
month.;   "That has been one of my goals, to swim in college," she said.;  
How long her swimming career lasts, however, may depend on how her shoulders
hold up.;   "My shoulders have been giving me problems," she said. "I have
loose (shoulder) joints and that causes pulling on the tendons.;   "Doctors
have told me that surgery would be the only way to correct the problem, but
that would mean I would be out for three to four months. So I swim with pain
and take medication to reduce the swelling.";   <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> also coaches the
Homestead team on <DATE>Tuesdays</DATE>, when head coach <PERSON>Theresa Hessler</PERSON> is unable to get
away from her job as a nurse at <ORGANIZATION>El Camino Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View.</LOCATION>;   "I
kind of look at <LOCATION>Karli</LOCATION> as my assistant coach," <PERSON>Hessler</PERSON> said. "She is the
captain of the team and a leader with a strong personality. The girls respect
her, and I feel very comfortable about leaving her in charge when I'm not able
to be there.";   <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> said her goals at the CCS meet are to improve on her
200 I.M. time and eclipse the meet 100 backstroke record of 57.73 seconds, set
in <DATE>1977</DATE> by <PERSON>Linda Jezek</PERSON> of Homestead. Karli just missed <PERSON>Jezek</PERSON>'s mark last year
while winning the event in a personal-best 57.80.;   "<PERSON>Linda</PERSON> owns the oldest
record in the CCS meet," <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> said, "and I want to break it.";   When the
high school season ends, <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> said, she will be concentrating on reaching the
Olympic trials in <DATE>March</DATE> in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ind</LOCATION>. Last <DATE>August</DATE>, she finished second
in the 200-meter backstroke and third in the 200-meter I.M. and 100-meter fly
in the Junior Olympics at <LOCATION>Mission Viejo.</LOCATION>;   "I feel I have a shot at making
the trials in the 200 back and possibly the 200 I.M. and 100 back," she said.;
  <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> credits her improvement over the <DATE>last two years</DATE> to <PERSON>Jay Fitzgerald</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara Swim Club</ORGANIZATION> coach.;   "He has really motivated me," she said. "He is
very demanding. He has made me tougher mentally and physically. He sets my
standards very high and makes me believe I can achieve them.";   <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON>, who
also credits <PERSON>Fitzgerald</PERSON> for making her a better swimmer, said she believes she
has a chance to win a title this weekend in the 100-yard breaststroke.;   "But

breaststrokers in the CCS.";   As for <PERSON>Ryann</PERSON>'s future in the sport, <PERSON>Karli</PERSON> said,
"I can see her going far. I think she will score (finish among the top eight
swimmers) at senior nationals before she gets out of high school. And I think
the <DATE>1996</DATE> Olympics in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> are within her reach."  </TEXT>
