   Some chant. Some meditate. Some

   Every year hundreds of devotees of the occult trek to <LOCATION>Giza
Plateau</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped
inside the pyramids of the pharaohs <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chephren</PERSON> and Mycerinus.
   Pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills, give glimpses into
the future, provide a better night's sleep, even halt aging _ all
for the price of admission, three Egyptian pounds (<MONEY>$1.20</MONEY>).
   Until now.
   Under new rules, pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more
_ a lot more.
   <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>'s director general, said groups of up
to 15 now are allowed ``to meditate or seek extrasensory powers''
in the pyramids for 1,000 Egyptian pounds (<MONEY>$400</MONEY>) and only outside
normal tourist hours. Each extra participant pays <MONEY>50 pounds</MONEY> (<MONEY>$20</MONEY>).
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to
conduct seances inside the pyramids. Most want either to spend the
night inside or to enter at the first rays of dawn.
   ``In the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and elsewhere you have a lot of people with
problems, and these people are seeking solutions. They look to the
supernatural, and they think of the pyramids,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``But we can't let these groups interfere with tourists wanting
to look at the pyramids from a historical or architectural
standpoint.''
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said the most active pyramid-visiting mystical groups in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> are several from <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and from
the <ORGANIZATION>Edgar Cayce Foundation of Virginia Beach</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, named after the
American psychic who died in <DATE>1945</DATE>. Cayce taught that the secrets of
Atlantis and knowledge of the future are buried under the right
front paw of the Sphinx at the foot of <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>.
   In addition to Americans,theme cruises are organized in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
and growing numbers of Japanese tours come to <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> especially to
``tap pyramid power,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``This pyramid power stuff is really big,'' he said. ``People
want to believe in magic, and big structures give an air of magic.
I'm sure if I called myself the Pyramid Prophet I could have a
following larger than the most famous Indian guru.''
   Built about 4,600 years ago, the pyramids remain enigmas to
scientists as well as to seekers of the unknown.
   The first person to enter the Great Pyramid of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> in
post-pharaonic times was the caliph of <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Abdullah</PERSON> al-Ma'mun,
in 820 A.D. He forced his way in by heating rocks, then breaking
them by pouring on vinegar.
   As generations of scientists and tourists, eccentrics and
treasure hunters followed him, pyramid mystique grew over the ages.
   Perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the
occult was <PERSON>Napoleon Bonaparte</PERSON>, who spent the night of <DATE>Aug. 12,
1799</DATE>, inside <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken.
   He went to his grave in <DATE>1821</DATE> without telling what he experienced.
   ``No! What's the use,'' <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> was said to have told a friend.
``You wouldn't believe me anyway.''
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said many people, especially in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, have
ideas and theories about the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids, particularly <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>'
Great Pyramid.
   ``They read that <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> is made of 2.3 million blocks, each one
weighing 2{ tons to 15 tons, each side at an angle of 51 degrees,
50 minutes and 35 seconds,'' he said.
   ``They think nobody on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> could have built this. That the
pyramids were built by people from outer space, or survivors from
the lost continent of Atlantis.
   ``They never look at what's attached to the pyramids, the
structures, the organization necessary to build them, the cult of
the king.''
   He said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been
published in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, ``but fewer than half a dozen
contain any science of value.''
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>, who has a doctorate in Egyptology from the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> and has lectured throughout <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> about the
pyramids, said he'd never heard of pyramid power until he went
there in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   ``I was speaking to an audience in <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, and as I
began to talk everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his
head. I asked, `What are you doing?,' and they explained about
power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid.
   ``OK. I try to be open-minded. When I returned, I tried some
experiments.''
   The first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve
bodies.
   ``I bought some meat and put part of it in my office, part
inside <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>. The meat inside my office lasted longer than inside
the pyramid. That was one (myth) down.
   ``If the ancient Egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by
placing a corpse under a pyramid, then why did they invent
mummification?''

<TEXT>
   Even death couldn't free some workers
from their bosses, archaeologists are finding in a newly discovered
cemetery near the pyramids.
   It's the first burial ground ever found for the Egyptian working
man of 45 centuries ago.
   Five other cemeteries with 4,000 tombs flank the pyramids, on
the horizon above. But all 4,000 were reserved for royalty, their
families and officials, said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, director-general of
antiquities for the pyramids area and the new dig's excavation
chief.
   ``What we haven't found until now is the working class,'' said
<PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>. ``We were shocked when we looked at inscriptions of who was
buried in the new tombs. Overseers holding their sticks. And
behind, skeletons of workers.''
   He said it appears the workers were members of the foremen's
crews.
   The first eight tombs, three miles south of the Sphinx, lie at
the base of sand hills stretching endlessly into the desert. <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>
said the cemetery undoubtedly extends deep into the dunes.
   Tombs date from the fourth dynasty - 4,600 years ago when the
<LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids were built - until the sixth, 300 years later. It's a
mysterious period when legend says workers grew tired of almighty
pharaohs and of building pyramids for them.
   Because no middle-class burials had been discovered on sacred
<LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> plateau, some Egyptologists have theorized that the afterlife
was perceived as off-limits to the working man. But the new
cemetery proves that pharaonic blue-collar workers prepared for
eternity as their betters did, being buried with amulets, limestone
tablets, offering tables, pottery vessels and more.
   The largest tomb, built for a fifth-dynasty overseer named
Ptah-Shepses, is 20 feet by 6{ feet with an arched ceiling.
   To the rear of the tomb, in a honeycomb of compartments,
excavators found six skeletons buried in the fetal position. <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>
said they were members of one work crew.
   Ancient Egyptians didn't practice human sacrifice, so the
workers were not killed and buried at the same time as their
bosses. And <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said there's no indication so far how a foreman
chose the workers to be buried near him.
   ``Perhaps they were his favorites. Or perhaps we'll find others
when we keep digging,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. ``We have no idea how many
people an overseer would have had on his staff.''
   Foremen handled day-to-day administration of the pharaohs'
estates, with responsibilities comparable to farm managers or
assembly-line supervisors in today's world. ``They dressed better,
ate better and wanted better tombs than the men who worked for
them,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``They looked at the pyramids and the fancy tombs of the
officials. They knew they couldn't afford such luxury. Still they
wanted a nice place to spend eternity.''
   More information about the ancient blue-collar workers will come
from medical tests Egyptian doctors are performing on the
skeletons. Data is expected to indicate the workers' general
appearance, their height and weight, what they ate, what diseases
bothered them, even what killed them.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> and Egyptologist <PERSON>Mark Lehner</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION>
began a search for homes of workers who built the three <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>
pyramids. At a site some distance from the monuments, they
uncovered ruins of a business center and other artifacts.
   They stopped excavating in early <DATE>1988</DATE>. The recently discovered
tombs lay undetected only a few feet away.
   But early last <DATE>summer</DATE>, a tourist hired a saddle horse for a ride
around the pyramids. During the tour her horse fell through the
sand, ending on top of what proved to be the roof of the first
tomb.
   Nobody got the tourist's name, and chances are she still doesn't
know her outing made history.
   For years, riders heading for the most spectacular view of the
pyramids have passed in front of the Sphinx and through an ancient
stone gate into the desert.
   No records existed to explain the gate.
   But ``once we found the cemetery we understood,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
``The gate divided the world of the pharaohs from the world of the
average man.''
   He explained that the foremen and their crews lived and were
buried in their own world behind the gate. By day they passed
through the gate into their pharaoh's sacred world, then returned
at sunset to work on their own tombs.

   Treasures even greater than those in <LOCATION>King
Tut</LOCATION>'s tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, director
of the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids area outside <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> and the huge ancient
cemetery of <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of what's
buried. After all, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut</ORGANIZATION> _ was found almost
intact in <DATE>1922</DATE> by the British archaeologist <PERSON>Howard Carter</PERSON>.
   It took <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Valley of the
<LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Tutankhamun</PERSON> was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of <LOCATION>Pharaoh Cheops</LOCATION>, whose pyramid on <LOCATION>Giza
Plateau</LOCATION> is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the <LOCATION>New
Kingdom</LOCATION>, the era of Tutankhamun and the <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 <ORGANIZATION>B.C. Records</ORGANIZATION> say he wanted to be
buried in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Siwa Oasis</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to <LOCATION>Siwa</LOCATION> to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the <ORGANIZATION>Siwan Oracle</ORGANIZATION>.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said <PERSON>Sayed
Tawfik</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in <DATE>September</DATE>.
   In <DATE>January</DATE> five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION>. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In <DATE>March</DATE> a mummy of a young woman, her <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON> smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>'s East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
<LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
<PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``In <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. These caches, which may explain the
<ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION> statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> find the <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

   The Great Pyramid of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, the most
famous of ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s royal tombs, was declared safe for
tourists and reopened <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for the first time in nine months.
   A Dutch woman and an American student were the first of the
scores of tourists who waited under the hot Egyptian sun to tour
the pyramid.
   Since <DATE>August</DATE>, workers had been sealing cracks, reinforcing
limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of
the magnificent structure, which now boasts television monitors.
   The restoration project was the first step in a five-year plan
to transform the pyramid area, including the Sphinx, into an
open-air museum.
   Gasping after the 155-foot climb to the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s Chamber, <PERSON>Sophie
D'Lang</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Rotterdam</LOCATION> said she and her husband were spending the <DATE>last
day</DATE> of a vacation in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   ``I didn't think we had a chance to see inside <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>,'' said
<PERSON>Mrs. D'Lang</PERSON>, who waited more than three hours for the re-opening.
``I think what they've done is great.''
   <PERSON>Michael Saxton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, said he waited four hours. ``For
me the pyramid has special meaning because of the way it's built.
It's amazing.''
   The Great Pyramid is <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s top tourist attraction, and tourist
officials protested when it was closed <DATE>Aug. 15</DATE>.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> prevailed with the
argument that newly discovered cracks in blocks lining interior
passages and a half-inch layer of salt on inside walls had to be
fixed without interruption by tourists.
   With a base of 13.1 acres, it stood at 481.4 feet when it was
built 4,600 years ago. Today, it is 31 feet shorter after losing
about a dozen layers and its capstone. It also has lost almost all
its outer facing of hard, white limestone, stripped for use in
stone bridges, irrigation canals, houses, walls and buildings.
   <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, director general of the pyramids area, said nothing
had been done to restore the pyramid's interior since it was opened
in the late 1830s.
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said in removing salt from the limestone walls, restorers
found weak and cracking rock throughout the pyramid.
   In the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Gallery</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said, 500 limestone blocks were
restored and 16 granite slabs reinforced with stainless steel bars.
``Some of these slabs were in critical condition,'' he said.
   Cheops' lidless red granite sarcophagus, soiled by the touch of
generations of tourists, was cleaned of soot, grease and other
filth, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   He said insects and rats, which had invaded the pyramid, were
exterminated. Television monitors were installed to ensure that
visitors behave themselves.
   During the renovation, rubble was cleared and lighting added to
a chamber winding 396 feet beneath the pyramid, opening it to
tourists for the first time.
   Of the seven monuments listed as Wonders of the World by Greeks
of the second century <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION>, only <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> and the other two large
<LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids remain intact.
   The remaining monuments on the list _ the statue of Zeus in
<LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Artemis</ORGANIZATION>' temple in <LOCATION>Ephesus</LOCATION>, the Colossus of <LOCATION>Rhodes</LOCATION>, the
mausoleum of <LOCATION>Halicarnassus</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Asia Minor</LOCATION> and the Pharos lighthouse
in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> _ were destroyed by warfare or earthquakes.

   A tomb built 4,300 years ago for a
palace official and his two wives has been found in the shadow of
the <LOCATION>Giza Pyramids</LOCATION>, the first unknown tomb discovered on the plateau
since the mid-1950s.
   ``This is the first time we've seen such a tomb,'' said <PERSON>Zahi
Hawass</PERSON>, director general of the pyramids area. ``We can find no
parallel to this tomb during the Old Kingdom.''
   Giza inspector <PERSON>Mahmoud Hassan Afife</PERSON> found the new tomb in
<DATE>October</DATE> when he chanced upon the edge of a limestone wall. ``We
looked at the old records to see what early excavators had recorded
in this spot. There was nothing.''
   Hieroglyphics revealed the tomb owner's name, that he was a
``purification priest'' who handled religious rituals, and that he
was a palace official.
   Hawass dates it to the end of the <ORGANIZATION>Fifth Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>, about 200 years
after the death in <DATE>2528</DATE> B.C. of <LOCATION>Pharaoh Cheops</LOCATION>, builder of the
Great Pyramid.
   Built of limestone blocks, the 26-foot by 66-foot oblong tomb,
called a mastaba, stands over a shaft 23 feet deep that was sealed
with mud bricks after bodies were lowered into it. The mastaba had
no inner chambers.
   On one side, ancient artists carved two false doors with the
owner's name, Per-N-Ankh. The doors face a courtyard with six
limestone columns describing him and his wives <PERSON>Mitrt Nefer</PERSON> and
N-Hwy.
   The winter archaeology season was a month old when Afife found
the tomb, and vigorous excavation has continued since. On a recent
morning, a sandstorm so engulfed the dig that workers used rubber
buckets to shield their heads from the sand. Debris cascaded onto
the tomb's base faster than diggers could dig.
   Suddenly, from deep in a shaft, a workman yelled, ``gumgumah,''
Arabic for ``skull.'' As a man above slowly turned a pulley, a
reddish-gold skull creaked its way up the pit. It appears to be a
female's, in excellent condition.
   Such a find testifies to the site's value. Nearby pits have
yielded piles of pottery shards, bones and wooden pieces that
officials said might be part of a bed or other funerary furniture
to accompany the dead into the afterlife. In an adjacent tomb were
two limestone statues of wives of pharaonic officials.
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said he knew valuable leftovers would emerge from
re-excavation of the vast <ORGANIZATION>Western Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>, begun in the fifth year
of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' reign. Officials and their families used the cemetery
over the centuries, building limestone and mud-brick tombs along
avenues of various sizes.
   ``Some Egyptologists thought the area wouldn't give anything
else, but they're wrong. Early excavators were in a hurry, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>
Jones-style. Some even used dynamite,'' he said. ``This tomb lies
at the edge of the cemetery. Earlier this century archaeologists
dumped their dirt onto these hills without checking to see if
anything interesting lay underneath.
   ``Chances are even more tombs still lie just over there.''
   Excavating leftovers is ``never a waste of time, never
busywork,'' said <PERSON>Amal Samuel</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>'s chief inspector, who estimates
that as many as 4,000 tombs and pits exist in the area known as the
<ORGANIZATION>Western Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>. ``When people dug in the past they only searched
for treasure. Today, we're looking for history. We never think if
we'll find something or not.''
   Last <DATE>spring</DATE> archaeologists clearing another part of the cemetery
found the well-preserved, gypsum-masked head of a female mummy from
about the same period, her faint smile reminiscent of the <ORGANIZATION>Mona
Lisa's</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Giza Plateau</ORGANIZATION> has two great cemeteries: the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, between the
Great Pyramid and the <LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION>, and the Western, wedged between the
pyramids of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Chephren</ORGANIZATION>. Generally, queens and royal
offspring are buried in the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>, officials and their
families in the Western.
   The cemeteries of mastabas were arranged in parallel rows
several feet apart, with ownership planned carefully. Everybody
wanted to be buried in the pyramids area, seeking special benefits
in life after death. Over the years, as demand increased, the
symmetry went askew. Small tombs of officials and priests were
placed among the once neat rows until the area was honeycombed.
   ``We have to think of these cemeteries as a community that
surrounded the king with the same feeling as when he was alive,''
said <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>. ``At the top of his pyramid is the pharaoh, the head
of his country. Around him lay those who would have been near him,
his family and officials. ... Those closest are in the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
cemetery, just like in a palace.''

<HL> Sewage Identified As Main Threat To Egypt's Sphinx --- Investigation After Chunk Fell From Ancient Statue Blames Village, Hotel </HL>

<DATELINE> GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Specialists investigating why the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village and a hotel favored by the rich and famous. 

   Cries of alarm were raised in early <DATE>February</DATE>, after a chunk of limestone fell from the 4,500-year-old statue's right shoulder. 
Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as evidence the monument was near collapse. 

   A committee of specialists from <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> probed, scraped and tested the stone for four months to see what is happening to one of the world's best-known ancient monuments. 

   The answer is quickened decay, and the reason is sewage, said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, an Egyptologist and director general of the pyramids area where the Sphinx has crouched since the <LOCATION>Old Kingdom</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hawass</PERSON> blamed sewage water flowing freely from the nearby tourist village of Nazlet al-Samman and an inadequate sewage system at the well-known <ORGANIZATION>Mena House Hotel</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Once a sleepy town at the edge of the desert, <ORGANIZATION>Nazlet</ORGANIZATION> al-Samman has mushroomed in the past 20 years with an injection of funds earned by locals in the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> oil countries. 
The town boasts an ever-sprouting array of tourist shops selling pharaonic bric-a-brac, with names like <PERSON>Moses</PERSON>' Place, Pharaoh's Perfume Factory and <PERSON>Cleo</PERSON>'s Bazaar. 

   Just to the northwest is the <ORGANIZATION>Mena House Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, built in <DATE>1868</DATE> with 150 rooms to house dignitaries assembled for the opening of the <ORGANIZATION>Suez Canal</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The stately hotel's reputation grew over the decades, as it hosted <PERSON>Charlie Chaplin</PERSON>, British Field Marshal <PERSON>Bernard Montgomery</PERSON>, Presidents <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Winston Churchill</ORGANIZATION> and others. 
In <DATE>1974</DATE>, 400 rooms were added. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hawass</PERSON> said that no sewage system was installed to meet the needs of the bustling village and that the hotel's system was inadequate for its expanded size. 
Thus, excess waste water entered the water table and undermined the Sphinx. 

   Before the recent study, <PERSON>Mr. Hawass</PERSON> said, it was assumed the statue was deteriorating because of changes in the underground water table, caused by the <ORGANIZATION>Aswan High Dam</ORGANIZATION>'s regulation of the <ORGANIZATION>Nile River</ORGANIZATION>'s flow. 

   Now that the cause of the damage is determined, he said, work will begin on repairing it. 

   Egyptian specialists are being joined by others from <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Louisville</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to formulate a long-term save-the-Sphinx plan. 

   The government already has allocated <MONEY>$2.3 million</MONEY> for a new sewage system aimed at halting the dirty-water flow beneath and around the Sphinx, <PERSON>Mr. Hawass</PERSON> said. 

   A committee set up to oversee repairs met yesterday and approved plans to have a masonry support of limestone blocks laid just below where the chunk of rock fell in <DATE>February</DATE>, then to replace the rock on <DATE>July 9</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hawass</PERSON> said restoration work in recent years, especially an effort that began in <DATE>1982</DATE> and that was stopped when the latest piece fell, didn't match ancient attempts to protect the monument. 
The first on record was a patch-up campaign that began 1,000 years after the Sphinx was created about 2,500 B.C. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Hawass</PERSON> said cement used to secure loose rocks after <DATE>1982</DATE> had turned the limestone to powder. 
"The cement didn't allow the rocks to breathe," he said. 
"Now we're removing all the cement and testing gypsum mixed with rocks from <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION> itself to see if the mix can't protect sensitive areas." 

   The team of local and foreign specialists also is to study the effects on the Sphinx of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s air pollution, which on most days can be seen from <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> hovering in layers above the city of 12 million. 

   Next to the <LOCATION>Cheops Pyramid</LOCATION>, the Sphinx is the most popular among <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s thousands of monuments. 
But as Egyptians laugh at many of the modern world's tribulations, they have chuckled at the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s sewage problem through newspaper cartoons. 

   In one cartoon, the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> has lost his ever-present subtle smile and says, "I don't care whether they call it waste water or sewage runoff, this stuff stinks." 

   In another cartoon, pharaohs <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Chephren</PERSON> and Mycerinus, builders of the world's three most famous pyramids on the plateau behind the Sphinx, stand before an immigration officer, obviously ready to leave town. 
"We don't care what country you choose," one pharoah says, "as long as it has a sewage system."

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Pyramid of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>'s director-general for the
pyramids area. ``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize
the outer stones, there could be a tragedy.
   ``People have a tendency to think that pyramids will be here
forever because they're so massive, but each is suffering from wind
and sand erosion, rain and salt (and) ... to a great extent because
of the hands of man.''
   Work began inside the <LOCATION>Great Pyramid</LOCATION> <DATE>last winter</DATE> to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone and accumulated along passageway
walls. The work on the outside began in late <DATE>August</DATE>.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In <DATE>1976</DATE>, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.
   Historical records and legends indicate the first man-made
damage occurred as early as 500 years after the death of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>,
the second pharaoh of ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>. The Egyptians
were in revolt against tyrannical and oppressive practices of the
past, hacking and destroying statues and monuments from the earlier
days of the pharaohs.
   Less than a century later, the 12th-dynasty <PERSON>Pharoah Amenemhet</PERSON>
took many stones from <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' pyramid complex to build one for
himself at el-Lisht, south of <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>. Teams from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s
Metropolitan Museum, who excavated <PERSON>Amenemhet</PERSON>'s pyramid, found
hundreds of the decorated pieces.
   Nobody knows when or why, but the Great Pyramid at some time
lost 30 feet of height, leaving it still enormous at almost 453
feet. Its outer surface originally was covered with a protective
layer of fine, hard limestone, only traces of which survived
desecration and looting.
   Thousands of its stones were stolen over time, but the pyramid
remained structurally intact until the late ninth century, writes
<PERSON>I.E.S. Edwards</PERSON>, the British Egyptologist acknowledged as the
authority on Egyptian pyramids.
   At that time, Arab raiders broke a large hole just below the
main entrance and entered the monument in a vain search for
treasure, <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> wrote in his showpiece work ``The Pyramids of
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.''
   ``Subsequently it became a copious and convenient quarry,
providing the stone required for bridges over irrigation canals,
houses, walls and other buildings in the neighborhood of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>,'' he wrote.
   In the <DATE>early 19th century</DATE>, the <PERSON>Albanian Mohammed Ali</PERSON>, credited
with creating the modern Egyptian state as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Ottoman
Empire</ORGANIZATION>, thought nothing of using blocks from <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> and other
pyramids for construction.
   The English Egyptologist <PERSON>Flinders Petrie</PERSON> wrote in the 1880s of
watching as a steady stream of camels, hundreds daily, carried
massive blocks into <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> from nearby Abu Rawash pyramid, built by
<ORGANIZATION>Cheops</ORGANIZATION>' successor Djedefre.
   Today the pyramid area is littered with toppled building blocks.

<HEAD>Sewer Workers Discover Remains of Cheops' Long-Lost Temple</HEAD>

   NAZLETT EL-SAMMAN, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> (AP) _ Sewer workers have discovered
remains of a temple that <PERSON>Pharaoh Cheops</PERSON> built for his funeral 4,600
years ago, and Egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more
about the mysterious pharaoh of the <LOCATION>Great Pyramid</LOCATION>.
   The discovery this month of Cheop's <ORGANIZATION>Valley Temple</ORGANIZATION> confirms
theories about the layout of <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION> for the 70-year period in
which the pharaoh, his son and grandson built their three pyramids
and monuments nearby.
   Nazlett el-Samman lies at the foot of the plateau, facing the
Sphinx, and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause
of the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s dangerous deterioration. A U.S.-financed sewage
project began last year, and Egyptologists were assigned to monitor
construction because of the probability of finding antiquities.
   They were on hand in early <DATE>March</DATE> as diggers began uncovering
mammoth granite and limestone blocks, a flint knife, Roman brick
walls and other relics.
   By mid-March, more remains were turning up, and finally the main
prize _ a 59-foot-long row of basalt rocks. The experts identified
it as the floor for <ORGANIZATION>Cheops' Valley Temple</ORGANIZATION>.
   Because basalt is difficult to carve and expensive, the stone
was reserved for royal use, often as flooring for sacred places.
   Although his pyramid was the largest ever built, <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> left few
other glimpses of his life or his 23-year reign, which ended in
<DATE>2528</DATE> B.C.
   ``With what we're finding now, we can piece together <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>'
history and reconstruct how this part of the pyramids area would
have looked,'' said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities
Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   The newly found ruins lie 13 feet below street level, partially
covered with sewage.
   Getting to them will not be easy. Diggers already are excavating
two Roman-era sites in a Nazlett el-Samman alley only a foot from
village houses. Archaeologists have to contend with children at
play, donkeys and angry villagers worried that antiquities
officials might invoke their legal authority to force them from
their houses.
   <ORGANIZATION>Cheops' Valley Temple</ORGANIZATION> is proving an even greater challenge.
Engineers for the sewer project are pumping water from the drainage
ditch where the basalt flooring was found.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Giza Pyramids</ORGANIZATION> and the structures around them are thought by
some Egyptologists to be part of an elaborate blueprint for the
dead, precisely planned and executed. But their exact roles in the
death and resurrection of the pharaohs are debated.
   Burial was an elaborate ritual to ensure that neither the
pharaoh nor <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> would ever die.
   The journey to eternity began in the <ORGANIZATION>Valley Temple</ORGANIZATION>, where the
pharaoh's body was taken for ritual purification, perhaps
embalming. For the final rituals, the body was carried up the long
causeway to a mortuary temple next to the pyramid.
   Early travelers' descriptions of the pyramids area had given
modern egyptogists a good idea where <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' temple should be found.
   In the <DATE>fifth century B.C.</DATE>, the Greek Herodotus wrote that he saw
<LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' causeway, covered and decorated with carved animal scenes.
The German scholar <PERSON>Karl Richard Lepsius</PERSON> said only traces remained
of the ruined causeway by the early <DATE>1840s</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   The falling of a piece of rock from
the crumbling body of the Sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate
over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s other
ancient treasures.
   The principal casualty of the uproar has been <PERSON>Ahmed Kadry</PERSON>,
formerly chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
<PERSON>Farouk Hosni</PERSON>, of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly
on <ORGANIZATION>Kadry</ORGANIZATION>'s stewardship of the Sphinx and the other relics of
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s rich past. Hosni did not reply to the accusation.
   The limestone slab fell from the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s right shoulder on <DATE>Feb.
7</DATE>, six days after a sandstorm buffeted <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>.
   A restoration plan is in the works. The Sphinx has been fitted
with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early
stages of the effort, and a committee of experts has taken rock
samples for analysis to help decide what steps to take.
   The Sphinx, which is 66 feet high and 160 feet long, has the
head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion. Many
Egyptologists think the face is that of <LOCATION>Chephren</LOCATION>, son of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> and
builder of the second pyramid on <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION> next to <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' Great
Pyramid.
   A similiar accident six years ago brought down <ORGANIZATION>Kadry</ORGANIZATION>'s
predecessor, <PERSON>Fouad Oraby</PERSON>, and a Sphinx-restoration project that
<PERSON>Kadry</PERSON> began as antiquities chairman remained unfinished when the
latest rock fell.
   <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, general director of the pyramids area and
archaeology adviser to <LOCATION>Hosni</LOCATION>, will direct the latest restoraton and
conservation efforts.
   The earliest restoration of the Sphinx began 3,600 years ago.
   ``Two hundred years from now all our monuments will be
finished,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``In the past the monuments were safe from many factors that
destroy them because they were buried in the sand. The monuments
were not subjected to pollution, the environment, tourists, the
things that are ruining them now.''
   The emergency work on the Sphinx should be finished by late
<DATE>March</DATE>, with fallen pieces of limestone replaced and weak places
beneath the neck and shoulders treated, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. Made of weaker
limestone than other parts, the neck long has been considered a
chronic problem.
   After the emergency work, experts will draw up an overall
restoration plan, <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said.
   A major problem, said <PERSON>Omar el-Arini</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> representative of the
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>National Science Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, is that previous
restorers have not learned why the Sphinx continues to decay.
   ``In a nutshell, we have been looking at symptoms of the
problems, not the problems themselves,'' he said.
   ``We have been treating it as a rock carved 4,600 years ago, but
the limestone is 40 million years old. Our approach should be to
look at an object of 40 million years.''
   One of the problems facing the team will be how to rid the
monument of salt, which is visible on many portions of the body.
   <PERSON>Shawky Nakhla</PERSON>, chief restorer for the <ORGANIZATION>Antiquity Organization</ORGANIZATION>,
said restoration efforts in the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and <DATE>1950s</DATE> added to the
<ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s salt problem.
   ``They used cement, and a lot of salt started appearing,'' he
said. ``We don't know if a high water table level below the Sphinx
is a real cause of the salt problems, or whether the salt is coming
out of the limestone itself.''

   Experts have started conducting tests
to determine how to repair the Sphinx, the ancient monument that
lost a chunk of stone from its right shoulder.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE>, six days after a
sandstorm buffeted <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>.
   Damage to the Sphinx caused heated political and scientific
debate over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s
other ancient treasures.
   The main casualty of the unrest was Ahmed Kadry, until early
<DATE>February</DATE> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
<PERSON>Farouk Hosni</PERSON>, of staging the rock fall to reflect badly on <ORGANIZATION>Kadry</ORGANIZATION>'s
stewardship of the Sphinx and, by extension, the other relics of
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s rich past.
   Restoration work began on the Sphinx on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   The monument was fitted with sandbags for support and
scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort.
   A committee of experts took rock samples to test for salt
content and damage and to see whether the stone is strong enough to
hold iron bars that will be inserted to strengthen it.
   Tests also are being conducted to determine what kind of mortar
should be used to cement the rock in place.
   ``We're not in a hurry. We want to do things right,'' said <PERSON>Zahi
Hawass</PERSON>, general director of the pyramids area and director of the
restoration.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching
lion. Many Egyptologists think the face belonged to <LOCATION>Chephren</LOCATION>, son
of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> and builder of the second pyramid on <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION> next to
<LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' Great Pyramid.
   Any damage to the pyramids or the Sphinx _ symbols of the past
with deep emotional overtones for modern Egyptians _ brings instant
outcries in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s national press. The rock fall proved no
exception, to <ORGANIZATION>Kadry</ORGANIZATION>'s chagrin, and charges of incompetence and
corruption flooded the newspapers.

<HEAD>Experts Still Not Sure How to Keep Sphinx from Falling Apart</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a year of scientific debate,
archaeologists still can't figure out how to keep the Sphinx from
falling apart.
   It's been almost six months since workmen made emergency repairs
and replaced a stone that fell <DATE>Feb. 7, 1988</DATE>, from the crouching
lion's right shoulder.
   But the experts can't decide what to do next.
   ``Scholars from <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and around the world have given us good
advice, but not one has been able to come up with a sure way to save
our wonderful Sphinx,'' said <PERSON>Sayed Tawfik</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s top
archaeological official.
   As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> is
caretaker of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s enormous treasurehouse of the past.
   ``In all the world there's only one Sphinx like this,'' he said.
``We love him and don't want to do anything to injure him. This is
why we have an international panel studying where to go from here.''
   The Sphinx, with its wide-eyed stare and smug expression, has
undergone the jabs and probes of restorers almost since anonymous
artisans sculpted the half-man, half-beast 4,600 years ago at the
base of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>'s pyramids plateau.
   None of the intermittent remedies has been able to stop
occasional rock falls.
   Major falls touch off political uproars in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   A tumbling rock in <DATE>1982</DATE> cost the job of the antiquities chairman
at that time.
   Last year's rockfall brought the departure of Ahmed Kadry,
pressured out of office because of a vocal and highly public row
with his boss, <PERSON>Farouk Hosni</PERSON>, the minister of culture. Tawfik was
appointed to replace him in <DATE>December</DATE>.
   Such sensitivity illustrates the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s monumental importance
to the Egyptians. Ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> was a cat-worshiping country, and
the Sphinx remains a very personal and popular cat.
   At times mostly buried in desert sand, at times not, the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>
has survived into the <DATE>late 20th century</DATE> as one of world's best-known
relics, although bruised and battered.
   Nobody knows how or why or when it lost its nose and pharaoh's
beard, but they are the most obvious reminders of the unseen
stresses at work.
   Tawfik said he believes the ancient stonemasons knew the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>
wouldn't survive as long as the pyramids of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>, which form a
backdrop against the horizon.
   Some of the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s building blocks are as strong as those of
the pyramids, he said, but others, especially in the neck, shoulder
and rear haunches, are weaker.
   ``Perhaps they knew after 4,000 years or so the Sphinx couldn't
survive any longer,'' said <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON>, an archaeology professor. ``I
think the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> is a decoration of <ORGANIZATION>Giza Plateau</ORGANIZATION>, a unique one, not
a monument for eternity as were other monuments.''
   The first known effort to help the <LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION> was 3,400 years ago. As
recorded in stone, the prince who would become Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV
followed an order that came to him in a dream during a daytime nap
to remove the sand from the <LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION>. He did so and, as promised in
the dream, the Sphinx repaid him by arranging for him to usurp the
throne of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   Fourteen centuries later, Roman technicians performed emergency
restorations at a time when the pyramids and the Sphinx already were
drawing tourists from around the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>.
   In modern times, foreign and Egyptian teams have had a go at
stopping the decay. Applying mudpacks to remove salt clusters and
injecting glue down its throat didn't work. More drastic suggestions
like reburying the monument in sand or encasing it in glass arise
from time to time.
   In the year since the stone fell, experts from <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other countries have given
advice on how to proceed.
   Egyptian geologists are studying rock samples. Specialists are
monitoring desert winds that blast the Sphinx. Pollution experts are
studying the effects of dirty air. Water and soil technicians are
testing the water table level on and near <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>, checking
whether subterranean water is causing salt to weaken the limestone.
   Even so, the <ORGANIZATION>Giza Plateau</ORGANIZATION>'s antiquities director, <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>,
remains optimistic.
   ``I believe for the first time in its history we are able to save
the Sphinx,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said, explaining that advanced scientific
findings in many fields are being applied to archaeological work.
   But for the Sphinx, he said, time is passing fast.
   ``He's like a suffering old man who needs an operation. But what
kind? When the rock fell (last year), it was kind of a red flag,''
<PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. ``At that time the government appointed a committee to
decide what to do. We're still meeting.''
   And it will continue to meet, he said, until it comes up with a
plan that won't repeat the earlier restoration efforts that harmed
the Sphinx more than they helped.

   <PERSON>Lanny Bell</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Chicago House</ORGANIZATION>, a special arm of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Chicago's Oriental Institute</ORGANIZATION>, has wrestled for 11
years with how to save decaying monuments in southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>
area, the greatest concentration of monuments on earth.
   Using photography and hand drawings, <ORGANIZATION>Chicago House</ORGANIZATION> is recording
some of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s best-known monuments before they disappear.
   ``In many respects the modern Egyptians live in a huge outdoor
museum, and museums are to be visited,'' <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said. ``The question
remains one of finding the best way to display an artifact, even an
artifact as large as a temple, to best advantage.''
   Most Egyptian monuments were built as places of worship with
restricted entry. <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said the dilemma for antiquities officials is
keeping monuments in their natural settings while insulating them
against tourist hordes.
   ``Tourism is both necessary and desirable,'' he said. ``But if
the present rate of decay continues, as it has for 100 years, there
will be no need for tourists 200 years from now to visit <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> for
its monuments.''
   <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, who controls <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s best-known
tourist area, is trying to make it safer both for tourists and its
monuments, the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids and the <LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION>. He hopes television
monitors being installed inside the pyramids can stop tourist antics
that began 1,100 years ago when treasure hunters forced their way
into <LOCATION>Cheops Pyramid</LOCATION>.
   ``For the past 100 years this place has been a zoo, and for the
past 50 years antiquities authorities have had no plans to protect
the monuments from tourists,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. ``Our biggest problem in
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is we have no concept that a monument should be a national
park, where people come to enjoy but behave.''
   Tourism has become <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s second largest earner of foreign
currency, with almost 2 million visitors in <DATE>1988</DATE> spending more than
<MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY>. The <ORGANIZATION>Tourism Promotion Board</ORGANIZATION>'s Moussa wants to double the
number within a few years.
   Moussa said officials recognize the appeal of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s monuments
but must look beyond history to encourage mass tourism.
   ``If you're thinking of coming to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> only for its monuments,
you can always put it off, because the monuments will still be
here,'' he said.
   ``Our best bet to help both tourism and monuments is to provide a
number of alternative sites throughout the country, drawing tourists
away from congested monuments. We also can help find ways to stem
the tourist flow into popular sites.''
   Tourism officials and the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> have devised a plan they say
will ease congestion in the temples and tombs on <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION>.
It includes new roads and a visitors' center that will control
visits to the main attractions by computer.
   Two of the most famous tombs in the Valley of the Kings _ Seti I
and Tutankhamun _ are endangered but remain open to the public.
   A year ago the frail tomb of Seti I was reopened after
restoration. A few weeks later, a zodiac design painted on its
ceiling, unique among Egyptian monuments, came crashing to the floor.
   Workers are restoring the zodiac behind a rope barrier, because
``every time we close Seti, we get objections from tourist
agencies,'' said Upper Egyptian antiquities director <PERSON>Balboush</PERSON>.
   In <PERSON>King Tut</PERSON>'s tomb, visited every day of the tourist season by
2,500 and more, scientists found in <DATE>November</DATE> that bacteria were
eating away the colorful wall paintings.
   To accommodate tourist traffic, plans were made for restorers to
apply an antidote to the infested walls before and after hours. Once
they saw how serious the infestation was, however, experts decided
to work nonstop for three days.
   Tourists didn't hamper the work: the antidote smelled so foul
that once visitors took a whiff, they rushed out, leaving restorers
to their work.

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ancient mummy of an aristocratic
young woman, her <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON> smile frozen in a plaster death mask, has
been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the <ORGANIZATION>Great Pyramid of
Cheops</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``She's really lovely,'' said <PERSON>Aly Hassan</PERSON>, director of pharaonic
monuments for the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>. Hassan dated
the mummy as 4,400 years old, one of the earliest ever found in
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   Egyptologists expressed surprise at <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s discovery, noting
the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids area has been looted repeatedly since antiquity
and excavated by some of the greatest archaeologists of the last two
centuries.
   Hassan said the seals of the grave were intact when an
antiquities inspector accidentally found the burial shaft.
   Officials who entered the grave found the mummy. She wore a
bronze crown covered with gold leaf on her head and jewelry around
her neck.
   Jewelry, pottery, wooden items, a piece of glass, flint,
obsidian, a clove of garlic and more than a dozen teeth lay nearby.
The wood and garlic may have been placed in the grave to keep
insects away.
   The mummy was not identified, but <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> said the woman's
nobility was established both by the finery buried with her and the
site of her burial, a cemetery reserved for officials of the ruling
court.
   She was about 22 years old when she died and stood five feet
tall, <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> said. He said the body dates from the <ORGANIZATION>Fifth Dynasty</ORGANIZATION>,
which lasted from <DATE>2465</DATE> B.C. to <DATE>2323</DATE> B.C. He said he dated her body
from that dynasty because other bodies in the cemetery were from
that period.
   Her body is so dried out that it has been wrapped in foam for
protection and bound beneath the head.
   <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, director general of the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> area, said the new
mummy might have been an important person reburied for safekeeping
in the shaft where she was found.
   Two vast cemeteries lie under <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>, one with royal tombs
to the east of the <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> pyramid. To the west lies the one with the
new mummy, put into use five years into the reign of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> 4,600
years ago.
   Inspectors have identified the owner of the complex in which the
shaft was found as S-ankh Ptah, but his position under the pharaohs
and his relation with the mummy remain mysteries.
   Egyptologists hope the mummy can provide clues into early
mummification, an art of preservation that spanned more than 3,000
years of Egyptian history into Christian times.
   ``Any find in the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> area in such a condition is a great
addition to archaeology,'' said <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON>. ``This mummy changes our
concept of preservation and mummification and provides a new date
for (it).''
   The earliest true mummy is that of Waty, found in the tomb of a
court singer called Nefer at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>. Waty's mummy dates from the
late <ORGANIZATION>Fifth Dynasty</ORGANIZATION> and was preserved so well by resin-soaked
bandages that even a callus on the sole of a foot is visible.
   Egyptians mummified their dead for thousands of years and was
refined over the ages using a solution of naturally occurring
preservative compounds.
   An obstacle to unraveling mysteries that still surround the
mummification process is that the ancients left incomplete pictorial
records of the embalming ritual.
   Some say the art of mummification was too sacred to be revealed.

<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists have unearthed Egypt's oldest bakery, where bakers laboring in
smoke-filled rooms turned out thousands of loaves every day for hungry

feed 30,000 people a day," said Egyptologist Mark Lehner of the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER RUINS OF COLOSSAL BAKERY
THAT FED PYRAMID BUILDERS
DISCOVERY ILLUMINATES LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The well-preserved bakery, with a hearth, dough vats and bread pots, dates
from <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>'s pyramid-building days, which began with the fourth dynasty
in <DATE>2575</DATE> B.C. Experts say it's the oldest bakery found in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, perhaps in the
world.;   To ancient Egyptians, king or commoner, bread was an everyday
staple, taken with a bit of onion or garlic and a swig of beer. Money didn't
exist, and bread was doled out as partial payment to those who inched massive
stones into the towering pyramids that still evoke awe after 4,600 years.;  
14 kinds of bread; Records from the period describe at least 14 kinds of
bread. So far the team of American and Egyptian Egyptologists working 1 1/2
miles from the <LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION> has found three kinds of bread molds: small and large
bell-shaped, and flat trays. The largest earthenware molds weigh 22 pounds.;  
The dig began in <DATE>October</DATE>, financed by business executives <PERSON>David Koch</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bruce Ludwig</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. Diggers found the bakery in <DATE>November</DATE>.
After the season's work ends this month, team members plan to study the art of
bread-making using ingredients available then.;   "I have to admit I'm not a
baking expert, which would help," said <PERSON>Lehner</PERSON>, the excavation's co-director.
He said tomb artists left some baking clues, though much was left to the
imagination.;   Bread-baking is pictured on tomb walls of a fifth-dynasty
official named Ty in the cemetery of <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> south of the pyramids.;   "We
didn't know for sure until now that this scene was real. We didn't have a
bakery to compare it with," said expedition co-director <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, in charge
of antiquities in the pyramids-Sakkara area.;   Baked in clay pots; A room in
the bakery contains three large earthenware vats beside rows of grooves for
bread pots lined up like eggs in a carton.;   The excavation has revealed
generally how bakers did their work. They took a "bedja," a heated, greased
bread pot, and put the rounded end into a baking pit. They poured in the dough
and placed an inverted pot on top. Both pots were covered with heated coals
and ash, causing the dough to rise and bake.;   For those making the bread,
working conditions were nightmarish.;   Heat was intense. Smoke was so thick
"these rooms would have been like a night sky filled with rain," <PERSON>Lehner</PERSON> said.
"We've dug through 1 1/2 feet of black-velvet, built-up ash."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  RENOWNED tourists spots are almost invariably disappointing. The Mona Lisa
bakes under glass, and reflections of tourists elbowing toward her ruin her
famous smile. The Grand Canyon is usually shrouded in haze. To get into the
Empire State Building, you have to maneuver past shady characters hawking
phony Rolex watches. The Tower of Pisa is closed, and London Bridge has been
moved to Arizona. Six of the seven original Wonders of the World no longer
exist.;    But the pyramids are still magic. Provided you get there before
dawn.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Why get out of bed so early? Because at <TIME>5:45 a.m.</TIME>, you have 4,500 years of
history all to yourself. If 100,000 workers can lug 2.3 million stone blocks
without so much as a wheel, then you can get up before sunrise to see them in
their pastel beauty.;    Don't take my word for it. The guard says that
Egyptian President <PERSON>Hosni Mubarak</PERSON> often takes visitors to the site at <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME>
because that is when the Sphinx and the Pyramids of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> are in their best
light.;    In the cool desert before dawn, there's just enough moisture to wet
the back of a parched throat. As dawn approaches, a lone soldier, wrapped in a
sheet like a modern-day mummy, stands in front of the Sphinx. Behind the
66-foot-tall half-man, half-lion stand three dark, huge, mysterious triangles
eerily jutting out into the <TIME>night</TIME>. Soon the sun would rise from the desert
floor facing the Sphinx, and the Pyramids of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> would turn a soft golden
brown.;    Slipping in;  The tourist books tell you the pyramids open at <TIME>8
a.m</TIME>. But with a little baksheesh -- or tip -- you can go earlier.;    After <TIME>9
a.m.</TIME>, the desert begins to sizzle and the buses containing caravans of
invading tourists arrive. Tourists make fools of themselves trying to look
comfortable posing for photos on bony camels.;    The best views are those
with a little height, but climbing the pyramids is prohibited. That is, unless
you are there early and the night watchman offers to guide you to the top of
the pyramid for a little baksheesh. The views are stunning, although the
climbing is steep. The Great Pyramid of <LOCATION>Khufu</LOCATION>, or <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>, rises 450 feet. Be
sure to bring bottled water, for once the sun emerges, it quickly gets hot.;  
 The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids to be tombs to preserve the bodies
of their kings. Believers in the occult say that mystical vibes are trapped in
the pyramids.;    But all is not well at this seventh wonder of the world. The
Sphinx, buried and unburied throughout the centuries, is deteriorating, having
been exposed to moisture, winds and traffic fumes. The pharaoh's beard is
gone, its nose has crumbled and its skin is pockmarked. Part of its right
shoulder caved in in <DATE>1988.</DATE>;    Serious business;  Egyptians don't take these
things lightly. A <DATE>1982</DATE> rockfall cost the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities
Organization</ORGANIZATION> his job. Now specialists say measures taken to help the Sphinx
may have hurt more than helped. So an international commission was formed to
save the Sphinx.;    Repairs are under way, but the poor <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> now has
instruments attached to its rear end to monitor air pollution, wind and
moisture. National Geographic reports that, if you probe below the limestone
base, "a red powder appears, as if the Sphinx were bleeding.";    But, at
least, peddlers are no longer allowed on the pyramid grounds. They just wait
outside for the <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> starting time.;    An early-rising peddler spies an
American leaving the grounds, and says, "Ah, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, very good." He
reaches into his pocket and pulls out a silver-plated medallion of the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>.
"I want to give this to you to take to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, a souvenir," he says. "I want
to shake your hand. Can you give me a souvenir of some American dollars?" he
says.;    The <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war was disastrous to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s tourist industry. "So
far it hasn't picked up," says <PERSON>Hamdi Saad El-Din</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Tourist Authority</ORGANIZATION>. "People were afraid. But we have never had one incident of
terrorism involving an American. <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is a very strong ally. You get the best
value in the world here now because we floated the Egyptian pound.";    <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>
is remarkably inexpensive. For example, the cost for a car and driver for
three hours was <MONEY>$7.</MONEY>;    A deluxe hotel room at the Intercontinental with a
balcony overlooking the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> is <MONEY>$100</MONEY> a night. Silver goods cost one-third of
prices in the States. A pair of engraved silver earrings goes for <MONEY>$9</MONEY>, a good
meal <MONEY>$10.</MONEY>;    At the pyramids, as <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> nears, it's time to go. The sun is
already beating down on camel drivers, and the shopkeepers squint as they open
their stores. One Egyptian man kisses his camel for the cameras, hoping for a
tip. Another naps near the chairs set up for the evening's sight-and-sound
light show.;    We beat the traffic back into town and have breakfast near
tourists headed to the pyramids.;    Outside, the Nile shimmers and the buses
stutter inch by inch up the avenue toward the pyramids, just outside the city.
It's only <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME>, but there's another appointment to keep. It's at the health
club for a massage to soothe the aching muscles. Another bargain -- <MONEY>$6</MONEY> for an

<DATELINE>SOUTH SAKKARA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 4,200 years ago, <PERSON>Pharaoh
Pepy</PERSON> I heard one of his queens was plotting against him. He sent
Weni the Scribe to find out.
   Weni did. History didn't.
   Guilty or innocent? Cunning or faithful?
   Pepy's hapless queens have been suspects ever since.
   Now a French-Egyptian archaeological team, digging and recording
a queenly pyramid field 20 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, is on its way to
unraveling one of ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s most tantalizing intrigues.
   ``We have mention of three Pepy queens'' in ancient texts, ``and
now we have three burials,'' said <PERSON>Vassil Dobrev</PERSON>, a Bulgarian-born
Egyptologist on the team led by French historian <PERSON>Jean Leclant</PERSON>. ``As
we search on, we'll find the answers.''
   Which was the queen in question, and did she do it?
   Weni went to his grave with the secret, leaving a record of his
investigation that ended: ``I know the truth.''
   The scribe's silence did not enhance the pharaoh's reputation.
Pepy I, who died in <DATE>2255</DATE> B.C. after a 34-year reign, is remembered
for two things: an ability to keep <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s far-flung, troublesome
colonies in line and an inability to do the same with his queens.
   Early grave robbers, peasants revolting against the pharaohs and
generations of stone thieves left few clues to the alleged
conspiracy intact. The pyramids of Pepy's queens were so completely
ransacked that restorers work alongside archaeologists to minimize
the danger of falling walls.
   Generations of sycophantic tomb artists depicted ancient
Egyptian queens as perfect mates: beautiful, submissive, adoring.
   Egyptologist <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON> said the story of Pepy and his queen
shows that some ancient royal marriages were less than ideal,
especially since pharaohs had to deal with multiple wives and had
both major and minor queens.
   A pharaoh's chief queen, as consort of a god, received special
privileges, including the title ``great royal wife.'' Because of
the numerous other royal offspring, a young pharaoh-to-be often
married his sister to enhance his right to the throne.
   A few queens even managed to rule <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   ``We can understand the queens' importance by their tombs,''
said <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>, who directs the pharaonic cemeteries of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> to the south. ``The largest was the pharaoh's tomb. After
all, he ruled <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. His tomb had to show that power.
   ``But directly after his tomb in size came the queens', then the
princes', then the nobles' and officials'; a cemetery easily shows
their ranks in life.''
   Allegations of a palace plot by a main queen was taken so
seriously that Weni was allowed inside the forbidden harem to
investigate the rumors. <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said <PERSON>Weni</PERSON> left no record of the
queen's name, referring to her only as a ``main consort'' of the
pharaoh.
   Until this dig, the only Pepy wives whose names were known were
Ankh-nes-meryre I and Ankn-nes-meryre II. Both were recorded by an
official named <PERSON>Khui</PERSON>, who said the king married two of his family
members. It is unlikely either sister would have been the main
queen because their blood wasn't royal enough.
   So who was the alleged plotter? <PERSON>Dobrev</PERSON> and his colleagues, who
are at the end of the dig for the season, hope the answer lies in
the third pyramid.
   The French-Egyptian expedition first came to <LOCATION>South Sakkara</LOCATION>, site
of the pyramids of Pepy I and his pharaoh sons Merenre and Pepy II,
in <DATE>1965</DATE>.
   Its task was to record the last of the Old Kingdom's great
pyramid complexes on the edge of a 3-square-mile stretch of desert
graves spanning 3,000 years.
   Pepy I's pyramid proved particularly important because of
intricately carved texts of spells, rituals and myths designed to
help propel the soul of the dead pharaoh into the afterlife.
   For two decades, archaeologists were too busy to look for his
queens, but by <DATE>1988</DATE> high technology was available to help. Experts
combed 50 acres of rubble-strewn dunes adjacent to <ORGANIZATION>Pepy</ORGANIZATION>'s pyramid
with ultrasound equipment developed in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   Soundings monitored by French technicians pinpointed two good
possibilities. The team started digging, and found two queens'
pyramids.
   A portion of a third pyramid was discovered last year, wedged
between the first two and roughly the same size, about 66 feet tall.
   Three pyramids. Three queens.
   Diggers began excavating the new pyramid early this year,
uncovering pottery shards, a chapel, a passageway and a burial
chamber.
   By the time digging ended <DATE>March 28</DATE>, there were two important
clues that could help solve the mystery of the accused queen.
   One was the name Nub-Unet on wall reliefs. The queen was unknown
to Egyptologists and may have been the royal wife Weni described.
She was buried in the eastern pyramid.
   The second clue was an empty basalt sarcophagus, its lid buried
beneath two massive boulders that once closed the burial chamber of
the middle pyramid.
   Dobrev hopes the lid, when uncovered, will bear the name of the
queen and something about her, but that is next season's work.
   Hawass thinks he knows what Weni the Scribe left unsaid about
Pepy's queen.
   ``Weni bragged that he alone investigated and he alone knew the
truth,'' the cemetery director said. ``He had solved the problem.
That's where the tale ends.
   ``I think Weni told Pepy his queen was not guilty, because Pepy
would never have allowed her to be buried next to him if she had
done something so evil.''

   ``Pyramid,'' a PBS special on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, is
about some world-famous monuments dedicated to the notion that you
CAN take it with you.
   Based on <PERSON>David Macaulay</PERSON>'s <DATE>1975</DATE> book, ``Pyramid'' combines
location shots of some of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s greatest wonders with an animated
cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues
and speculation on how the tombs were built, some of them more than
4,000 years ago.
   The show clearly explains the details of construction, although
plot twists in the animation, a kind of ``docudrama'' historical
cartoon strip, tend to get a little too convoluted.
   From 3,000 to 1,100 <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> was ruled by kings called
pharaohs. The Egyptians believed that when pharaohs died they became
gods, so their tombs were the largest and most elaborate of all.
   The ancient Egyptians also considered death the beginning of a
new life in another world. This life would last forever, they
believed, if certain precautions were taken, including preserving
corpses by mummification.
   A pyramid's burial chamber held the mummy and all the objects,
actual and symbolic, that would help the person's spirit, known as
the ka, survive in the afterlife.
   ``One of the reasons we have such a rich legacy of artifacts and
information, much of it about everyday life, is that much of it was
entombed for use in the next world,'' said <PERSON>Macaulay</PERSON>, who has
published 14 other books, including his latest, ``The Way Things
Work.''
   The show includes a visit to a museum with an exhibit of a
replica taken from a pyramid of an Egyptian cattle dealer. He
``wanted to take his business with him,'' said <PERSON>Macaulay</PERSON>, who serves
as the show's host and guide, ``and so he did _ in a model. He even
had some accountants in the model to make sure he wasn't
shortchanged.
   ``The models were as important as real life. They were the real
thing; they weren't just models in the minds of the Egyptians,''
<PERSON>Macaulay</PERSON> said in an interview.
   Macaulay spent several weeks on location in <DATE>February 1986</DATE>. ``We
were given access to all sorts of things that people are not
normally given access to,'' he said. ``We had, for instance, the
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> museum to ourselves for three nights running.''
   The film goes beyond the book by showing the urban sprawl that is
encroaching on the historical sites. There are, for example, some
glimpses of pyramids near modern residential neighborhoods of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>,
a suburb of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   ``You can get shots of them from the desert side, and it looks
like there's nothing around them. But if you shoot them from the
building side, you end up with little buildings that are five or six
stories high in front of these pyramids and for the first time you
really get a sense of the scale of these pyramids.''
   The great pyramid at <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> is 481 feet high or about the size of a
40-story office building. It was built with more than 2 million
blocks of stone, some weighing 15 tons, and covers the equivalent of
seven square blocks of midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. It stretches 755 feet on
each of its four sides and is so close to geometric perfection that
the difference between the longest and shortest side is only 7
inches.
   In the book, the pyramid and complex of surrounding temples and
tombs are imaginary. They are, however, based closely on several of
the pyramids and temples still standing in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   The show's script was written by <PERSON>Marc Olshaker</PERSON>, who also was
producer, in cooperation with <PERSON>Macaulay</PERSON> and a group of five
Egyptologists from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   ``Pyramid'' is the third PBS production by <ORGANIZATION>Unicorn Projects</ORGANIZATION>,
which also did specials on two previous Macaulay books,
``Cathedral'' in <DATE>1986</DATE> and ``Castle'' in <DATE>1983</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Chunks of stone that fell from the
4,500-year-old Sphinx have been returned to their place, and the
statue will undergo emergency restoration at five other weak
points, an official said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   Besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over
the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right
shoulder of the half-man, half-lion, the statue also has been
victim of a ``bad restoration project,'' which had further worsened
its condition, said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, director general of the Pyramids
area.
   ``The Sphinx is like a suffering old man who needs an
operation,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said of the world-reknowned statue, which lies
near the three famed <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids on <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s western outskirts.
   ``There are five weak points where stones can fall off any
minute,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. The worst problems, he added, stem from a
rising water table and a restoration project that ended just last
year.
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>, who was appointed to his post in <DATE>1987</DATE>, estimated the
repair cost at <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>.
   Since the Sphinx was built of limestone around a large rock
about 2,500 <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION>, it has alternated between being buried under the
sand or subjected to restoration projects that were begun by
ancient Egyptian pharoahs.
   About 3,000 years ago, Tuthmosis IV saw in a dream a suffering
Sphinx buried under the sand, which promised him rule of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> if
he cleaned up the area. Tuthmosis had the sand covering the statue
removed and soon afterward he became pharoah.
   Restoration work on the statue also was done during the
Greco-Roman era 16 centuries ago, and by enthusiastic foreign
Egyptologists in the <DATE>early 20th century</DATE>. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> pitched in between <DATE>1982</DATE> and <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   Close-up, the proud-looking statue is a patchwork of the results
of the various restoration operations. The Greco-Roman and early
20th century attempts involved giving the vulnerable parts of the
statue a second protective skin of limestone.
   The restoration that ended last year included giving the Sphinx
a 10-inch thick coat of limestones, using cement and gypsum to
stick them together.
   It is this last operation that <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> and other Egyptologists
have attacked, saying the cement and gypsum did not allow the
limestone to breath. Another problem, they said, was a rising water
table that caused salts to weaken the limestone structure.
   ``It was a very bad restoration project,'' said <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON>. ``We
have to remove this layer, but when we tried that, we found that it
will hurt the original body of the Sphinx. So now we do not know
what to do.''
   He said that Egyptologists and scientists were trying to develop
a chemical mixture to serve as mortar to hold the stones together
while allowing them to breathe.
   Hawass stressed that no damaging cement or gypsum were used in
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s restoration. The stones will be held in place with a wall
of dovetailed pieces of limestone.

   Two small pyramids built for the wives of <PERSON>Pharoah
Pepi</PERSON> I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists
who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>
more than 2,000 years before <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> was born.
   The discovery was announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> by members of the <ORGANIZATION>French
Archaeological Mission</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> and scientists from <LOCATION>Electricite
de France</LOCATION>, the state-owned utility which conducted a high-tech
exploration at the site about 20 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> site contains the step pyramid built by <PERSON>King Zoser</PERSON>,
said to be the first stone structure in history, and other
pyramids. The discovery of the queens' tombs brings to 85 the
number of known pyramids in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain
subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said
<PERSON>Jacques Montlucon</PERSON>, who led the utility's team.
   In the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, the 50-acre <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> site served as a quarry
from which stone was taken for building in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. For the last 25
years or so, extensive digging around the pyramid of Pepi I has
left a field of rubble at the site.
   ``It looks like a battlefield there,'' said <PERSON>Montlucon</PERSON>, adding
that the pyramids were covered by ``eight meters (about 26{ feet)
of rubbish.''
   ``In such disturbed land, it would be practically impossible to
find anything, to know where to begin to dig, without our current
technology,'' he said.
   Last <DATE>summer</DATE> Montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts
retrieved from the wreck of the Titanic.
   He said the electromagnetic tests used at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> were developed
by the French utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential
nuclear reactor sites.
   Using test results, the team put together a map pinpointing five
possible pyramid sites. Three sites were then excavated.
   The first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba, or tomb, of
a dynastic official. Weeks passed before workers finally hit the
stone of a pyramid on <DATE>Feb. 12</DATE>.
   ``I was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in
shouting `Mabrouk!' (congratulations),'' <PERSON>Montlucon</PERSON> said. ``I felt
so happy I could have cried.''
   Workers dug out a ``buttonhole'' through which they could see a
segment of the pyramid wall, smooth and gold in color. The French
archaeological team will ask permission from the <ORGANIZATION>Eygptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> to begin full excavation next year on the
pyramid, thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base.
   The find is ``a big gain for Egyptology'' and ``will allow us to
know more, possibly a great deal more, about the 6th Dynasty'' that
ruled the <ORGANIZATION>Nile Valley</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>2420</DATE> to <DATE>2258</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>B.C.</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Montlucon</PERSON> said.
   Archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic
inscriptions that can be added to the Pyramid Texts, the oldest
writings known to man. The archaeologists also hope the writing
will reveal the name of the pharaoh's wife, shrouded by the
centuries, who is buried there.

   Tourists can still see the subtle
smile but little else of the Sphinx, the half man, half beast
crouched in the desert sands guarding the pyramids.
   The smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected to
envelop the chest of the ailing 4,600-year-old statue as Egyptian
authorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one of
the world's best-known monuments.
   The effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbaned
workers prying rocks from his massive paws, sticking sensors into
his backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle.
   Scaffolding first appeared at the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s right shoulder in the
<DATE>spring of 1988</DATE>, shortly after a rock broke off and tumbled to the
ground. More weak spots were discovered, and now the framework is
being extended across the famous frontal view.
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Atef Sedki</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> made an official inspection
visit, seeking to determine whether restoration begun in <DATE>1982</DATE>,
which covered the front paws and other portions with concrete
blocks, helped or harmed the Sphinx.
   ``There's no threat to the Sphinx,'' <PERSON>Sedki</PERSON> said after the visit.
But he added: ``Although I'm not a technical man, I can see with my
eyes that former restoration work was wrong.
   ``The government will not deny any financial support that the
new restoration work requires. The important thing is to save the
statue that symbolizes the Egyptian civilization.''
   Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>,
said the latest effort calls for removing all large restoration
stones attached since <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   Restoration was being done on the Sphinx at least 3,000 years
ago. But Tawfik, climbing atop the front paws, said a key
difference in the current project is that for the first time,
restorers will try to ensure that the repaired Sphinx looks like
the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier restorations in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, he said, simply coated
endangered areas without regard to the shape the ancients carved.
   ``There's a 10-centimeter (four-inch) difference in the original
shape of the paws and in restoration stones that cover them,''
<PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> said. ``You can't even imagine how the Sphinx should look. ''
   He said the Egyptian-born artist and sculptor <PERSON>Adam Henein</PERSON> has
been brought from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to help restore the body to its original
form.
   ``We're studying hundreds of pictures taken since the middle of
the <DATE>last century</DATE>, even when it was almost totally buried, for clues
to how the Sphinx looked,'' he said.
   Concrete blocks have been numbered and are being carried from
the site as smaller replacement stones from the <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION> are
installed. Greeks and Romans restoring the monument more than 2,000
years ago also used small blocks, and <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> said their work is
better than any by modern restorers.
   ``Restoration begun in <DATE>1982</DATE> proved awfully bad because large
stones were used that completely damaged the Sphinx,'' said <PERSON>Zahi
Hawass</PERSON>, director of the pyramids area.
   ``Also, they used cement and gypsum, so now not only are we
looking at bad rock that has always been in the Sphinx but also at
rock that's been damaged from bad restoration.''
   Criticism of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> restoration has been common for years and
the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> has become a political issue as well as a scientific one.
   The latest controversy began in mid-November with stories in
newspapers speculating that mischief felled the chunk of stone from
the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'s right shoulder on <DATE>Feb. 7, 1988</DATE>.
   Tawfik and other experts responded by saying scientists studied
the rockfall for a year before deciding it occurred in a section of
limestone weakened by salt, wind and other natural phenomena. The
dispute raged for weeks.
   The Sphinx is likely to have little peace for quite a while.
   ``The Sphinx is like <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, with militias tearing at each
other,'' said <PERSON>Omar el-Arini</PERSON>, a member of the antiquities
organization's scientific committee and a science officer at the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``He's a 50-million-year-old man, because that's how old the
rock is. How do you restore him? Do you rejuvenate him? Do you
treat his ailments?
   ``What's missing here is a general plan.''

<DATELINE>MIT RAHINA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finding a new home isn't easy if you're
30 feet tall and weigh 50 tons. But if your name is Ramses the
Great, welcome mats come out all over.
   The question for Egyptian antiquities officials was which mat to
choose and they now have decided the proper thing would be to bring
<PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> back home from <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> to this quiet village on the edge of the
desert, known in <LOCATION>Ramses</LOCATION>' time as <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>.
   The rose granite colossus of the warrior <PERSON>Pharaoh Ramses II</PERSON>, who
reigned in 1292-1225 <LOCATION>B.C.</LOCATION>, was taken from <LOCATION>Mit Rahina</LOCATION> in <DATE>1954</DATE> to a
platform in front of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s bustling central railway depot on
orders of <PERSON>Gamal Abdel Nasser</PERSON>, who had taken power in a coup two
years before.
   That decision proved a headache for the officials, however. They
worried that exhaust fumes from heavy motor vehicle traffic would
cause the statue to crumble and that the vibration from railroad and
subway trains beneath it would cause it to crack.
   In the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> talk turned to saving it. One suggestion was to
move <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> to the <LOCATION>Giza Pyramids</LOCATION> and another was to put him on an
artificial island in the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>.
   In early <DATE>June</DATE>, however, a different course was decided.
   ``We decided to take him home, back where we got him,'' said
<PERSON>Sayed Tawfik</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>.
   When <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> left <LOCATION>Mit Rahina</LOCATION> for the square renamed for him, <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>
was a city of tree-lined boulevards. Today it's a megacity of 12
million people and growing.
   ``Poor Ramses,'' <PERSON>Egyptologist Gamal Mokhtar</PERSON>, a former chairman of
the antiquities organization, said in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   ``He was brought here at the request of ... President <PERSON>Nasser</PERSON>, who
had overthrown the monarchy and wanted a symbol of ancient Egyptian
power. Nobody questioned it. You didn't at that time. Nobody thought
whether being in the city center was good for the statue. It isn't.''
   Nasser died in <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   The statue has to be moved not only for its safety but also the
Pharaoh's dignity, <PERSON>Mokhtar</PERSON> said.
   ``Such statues never belonged in a public square,'' he said.
``They belonged in temples, facing the people, as a warning and
reminder of the Pharaoh's might.
   ``When you come into <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> from the north, you see <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>'
backside. That was never meant to be on public view. For one of
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s greatest Pharaohs, this isn't proper.''
   <LOCATION>Mit Rahina</LOCATION> is a fitting place for <ORGANIZATION>Ramses</ORGANIZATION>. It is rimmed with date
palms and swaying halfa grass, which, when it was called <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>,
brought fear and dread to adversaries throughout the ancient world.
Memphis was <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s first true capital and later its military
headquarters.
   Ramses II brought great power and wealth to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. He built more
buildings and more colossal statues than any other <LOCATION>Pharaoh</LOCATION>.
   He had other capitals, but <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> had special affection for
<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, 17 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. Memphis is thought to have begun
life as no more than a tiny fortress beside the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>, protected by a
white wall. In its heyday it stretched for miles and incorporated
military barracks, temples, palaces, shipyards, weapons factories
and craftshops.
   Its cemeteries extended for 50 miles and included the <LOCATION>Giza
Plateau</LOCATION>, home of the pyramids. Historians record that its <ORGANIZATION>Temple of
Ptah</ORGANIZATION>, the creator god and <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>' patron, was a third of a mile
long and a quarter-mile wide and fronted by monumental statues of
<LOCATION>Ramses</LOCATION>.
   How many colossi of Ramses graced <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> is not known, but
records say at least 15 were at the Ptah temple alone. A fallen
statue that would have stood about 45 feet, with fingernails the
size of hands, lies toppled on its back.
   A third colossus is the centerpiece of the <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> exhibit now in
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, at the end of a tour of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   Pieces of other statues lie among ancient <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>' ruins, red
granite torsos and heads mingled haphazardly with weeds. Some are
covered with dirt for protection from village children, who use the
ruins for playgrounds.
   For part of the year the sacred texts, column bases and statues
are trapped in marshes, salty water rising as high as 6{ feet,
soaking and decaying all in its path.
   Tawfik said he believes the return of <ORGANIZATION>Ramses</ORGANIZATION> will mark a new
beginning for the ancient city.
   ``When visitors come to <LOCATION>Mit Rahina</LOCATION>, they stay only 30 minutes or
so, just enough to see the fallen <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> and the monuments on
display,'' he said. ``We want to provide enough to keep them here
all day.''
   He said <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> suffered because it was too important for too
long. Lived in for 1,700 years by <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON>' time, the city was built
largely of perishable mud-brick. Generations built on the fallen
mud-brick houses of their forbears so that ``what we have now are
ruins, not a complete city,'' <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> said.
   Except for the remnants of the once-magnificent temples, little
of old <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> remains in <LOCATION>Mit Rahina</LOCATION>.
   ``The ancient Egyptian ... was mainly interested in the
netherworld, the afterlife. This is where he put his major
efforts,'' <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> said. ``This is why we have left so many examples
of monuments for eternity but not so many for life.''

EGYPT MAY PUT WALL AROUND PYRAMIDS, SPHINX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because too many people want to see the 5,000-year-old Pyramids and the <LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION>, 
Egyptian officials are considering building a wall around the ancient 
monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Not to keep the tourists out, but rather to help save the structures for future 
generations to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, a rising water table in the <LOCATION>Nile Valley</LOCATION>, pollution and 
the spread of settlements have threatened the monuments. 
</P>
<P>
A wall -- as unobtrusive as possible and preferably built with local materials 
-- would be built around them to control visitors and limit encroachment from 
nearby Nazlet el-Semman, a village whose main industry is catering to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
A network of asphalt roads crisscrossing the plateau on which the monuments 
stand would be removed and replaced with tracks of stabilized sand. Motor 
traffic would be virtually banned. 
</P>
<P>
All modern buildings within the wall would be razed, including a museum housing 
an ancient boat interred beside the Pyramid of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> and unearthed several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Egyptian government, the wall is expected to take 1 1/2 
years to complete. Whether it will stand for 5,000 is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
More than a pinch: According to the latest edition of "Ford's Freighter Travel 
Guide," which apparently keeps track of this sort of thing, if all the salt in 
all the world's oceans were crystallized, there would be enough to cover the 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> with a layer 45 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics: The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> travel and tourism industry generates more revenue from 
foreign dollars than that generated from exports of automobiles, agricultural 
goods or chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this year will spend an estimated <MONEY>$48 billion</MONEY>, 
according to <PERSON>Rockwell A. Schnabel</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>'s undersecretary for 
travel and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The travel-tourism industry generates revenues of about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> a day, he 
said, adding that about 41 million foreigners will visit the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1989</DATE>, travel and tourism revenue reached a surplus for the first time, 
meaning that foreigners spent more in this country than <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> residents spent 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
There's no catch: If you happen to be in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday, June 9</DATE>, and want 
to drop a line into the water, feel free to do so. That's the state's "free 
fishing day," when no license is required. 
</P>
<P>
Staying out of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>: Tourism overtook coffee and tea exports as <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s top 
foreign exchange earner two years ago, but a decline in the number of visitors 
to the East African country has officials there worried. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of the (tourist) industry to the economy cannot be 
overemphasized," vice president and finance minister <PERSON>George Saitoti</PERSON> told 
delegates to a national tourism seminar in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> advised citizens against traveling to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 
after two Americans were killed in an attack on a tourist bus. It has not 
rescinded the advice, despite high-level appeals. Nor is it likely to, 
diplomats said, until <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> offers proof of a reduction in crimes against 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>'s Indian Ocean coast, meanwhile, has lost European tourists after a 
series of health scares involving cerebral malaria, AIDS and even cholera. 
</P>
<P>
Rail lines: That silver-and-blue flash you see streaking across the French 
countryside could well become a familiar sight before too long. 
</P>
<P>
French railways expects to have its high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) 
operating on at least three routes: from <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> 
and, most intriguing of all, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> via the train tunnel being built 
under the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The TGV recently set a world speed record for a train by clocking 320 m.p.h. 
during a test run. 
</P>
<P>
The French have also sold the TGV to the <ORGANIZATION>Spanish National Railroads</ORGANIZATION>, which 
plans to use it on runs between <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION> dreams: <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> is hoping to offset an economic crisis by encouraging 
foreign investors to develop resort hotels that will lure the tourist dollar 
(or mark or yen or pound or whatever). 
</P>
<P>
The newly inaugurated Sol Palmeras Hotel in <LOCATION>Varadero</LOCATION>, 60 miles from <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, is 
the first of eight beach resort hotels to be built with private foreign 
investment and government money in the cities of <LOCATION>Varadero</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> de <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish, Finnish and Soviet investors are working with <ORGANIZATION>Cubanacan</ORGANIZATION>, the Cuban 
government tourism developer, to build the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thousand more hotel rooms are expected to be ready by the end of the year. 
Most of them will be in four-star hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Quick fact: <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, which has a population of about 10 million, attracted 14.5 
million tourists in <DATE>1989</DATE>, including a <PERCENT>27%</PERCENT> increase from <DATE>1988</DATE> in the number of 
visitors from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Olympian effort: In an effort to persuade the 90-member <ORGANIZATION>International Olympic 
Committee</ORGANIZATION> to award <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> the Summer Olympics in <DATE>1996</DATE>, Greek officials have 
drawn up detailed plans to rebuild much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major projects are a new international airport costing <MONEY>$220 million</MONEY>, 
two underground railway lines costing <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> and the completion of two main 
roads costing <MONEY>$750 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics note that such plans have been around for years. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>IOC</ORGANIZATION> meets in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE> to choose the <DATE>1996</DATE> host city. Other 
candidates are <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Quick facts: <ORGANIZATION>The American Society of Travel Agents</ORGANIZATION> would like you to know that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A total of 38.5 million foreign visitors came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1989</DATE>, 
or an average of 73 per second. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The year before, foreign visitors spent <MONEY>$56,000</MONEY> per minute in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The federal government receives more in tax revenues from foreign visitors 
in four days than it spends on the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration</ORGANIZATION> in 
one year.

<TEXT>
   After years of controversy and public debate, a
renovated and sparkling Louvre museum opened today, crowned by a
tall glass pyramid at its new entrance.
   After President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> cut the ribbon at the
inauguration ceremony and toured the collection, hundreds of people
crowded in for a look.
   ``It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said <PERSON>Martine
Bieri-Duminy</PERSON>, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid, designed by
American architect <PERSON>I.M. Pei</PERSON>, being built.
   ``In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it.
They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said.
   The dark, dingy Louvre most tourists remember is now a thing of
the past. In its place is what is called the ``Grand Louvre,'' a
splendid ultramodern and high-tech facility.
   The six-year, <MONEY>$850 million</MONEY> overhaul is the first part of a vast
project to turn the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>, once a medieval fortress and then a
royal palace, into the world's largest museum _ a distinction now
held by the <ORGANIZATION>American Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   The Louvre project will be completed when the museum's northern
wings, occupied by the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> for the past 100 years,
open to the public in <DATE>1993</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>Grand Louvre</LOCATION> is a unique blend of grandeur, history and
convenience.
   Visitors who once wandered looking for the museum's entrance
can't miss the new one _ a 70-foot, transparent pyramid soaring out
between the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s main wings and flanked by three small pyramids
and fountains.
   At the ground-level entrance are escalators and a graceful
spiral staircase leading down to a vast, light-drenched lobby
featuring ticket windows, the museum bookstore, boutiques,
restaurants and a 400-seat auditorium.
   The lobby itself can handle 6,000 people time without crowding.
Escalators leading to other parts of the museum branch out from the
lobby, like spokes in a wheel, and shorten the routes to works like
the <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Winged Victory</ORGANIZATION>.
   The baroque architecture of the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> built under <PERSON>Napoleon III</PERSON>
looms large against the ever-changing <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> skyscape.
   ``I used to pray for sun,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said in an interview.
``Afterward, I realized that the pyramid is even more transparent
on a gray day when it takes on the moodiness of the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> sky.''
   A visit to the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> is a trip back in time. Visitors now have
direct access to the vestiges of the medieval castle built by <PERSON>King
Louis Philippe</PERSON> in <DATE>1200</DATE> to protect <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> from invaders from <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.
   Also on show is a history of the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> documented by thousands
of artifacts dug up in the <LOCATION>Napoleon</LOCATION> courtyard. They bring to life
the daily routines of Parisians from the 15th to the 19th centuries.
   With about 650,000 square feet of additional floor space,
hundreds of paintings will have been dusted off and displayed for
the first time.
   On view for the first time since <DATE>1963</DATE> are four mammoth murals by
<PERSON>Charles Le Brun</PERSON> (1619-1690) titled ``L'Histoire d'Alexandre.''
   When the <LOCATION>Grand Louvre</LOCATION> is completed in <DATE>1993</DATE>, it will house about
4,000 items, nearly double what it displays today.
   Pei's pyramid, in specially manufactured slightly tinted glass,
was the most controversial aspect of the renovation.
   ``Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said. ``Not many people
would have bet on this project.''
   Backed strongly by <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, who initiated the project, <PERSON>Pei</PERSON>
perservered. The public was won over when a full-size model was
erected on the spot.
   ``All through the centuries, the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> has undergone violent
changes,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said. ``The time had to be right. I was confident
because this is the right time.''

   To save <ORGANIZATION>Ethel St. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION> from the aneurysm
pressing on her brain, doctors ``killed'' her for 40 minutes. They
put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and
drained her body of blood.
   St. <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON> was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls ``a
cotton-pickin' miracle,'' a sort of suspended animation that lets
surgeons cure hard-to-reach, high-risk aneurysms that once were
considered inoperable.
   ``It is everything that technology can possibly offer,'' said
her neurosurgeon, <PERSON>Dr. Robert Spetzler</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Barrow Neurological
Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   ``It may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding
poses the greatest risk to the operation,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Julian E.
Bailes</PERSON>, a neurosurgeon at <ORGANIZATION>Allegheny General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> here who
studied with <PERSON>Spetzler</PERSON>. ``That's the biggest cause of death in
surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended
animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field.''
   In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived
of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the
aneurysm _ a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood
vessel _ and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive
bleeding and certain death.
   Of 15 patients who have undergone the procedure at <LOCATION>Barrow</LOCATION>, only
one has died, <PERSON>Bailes</PERSON> said. Most had ``excellent'' results, a few
reported some weakness but otherwise did well, and most remained in
a coma no more than five days.
   But the risks, including that the heart won't restart, are too
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately
do the job.
   And because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical
death for the operation to succeed, doctors approach it with ``a
lot of respect,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Steven Shedd</PERSON>, a Barrow
neuroanesthesiologist who worked on <ORGANIZATION>St. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>St. Lawrence</ORGANIZATION>, a 61-year-old <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> secretary, had surgery <DATE>June
6</DATE>. She now needs no medication and the severe headaches are gone,
though she still is unable to fully open her eye.
   <PERSON>Cecilia Duffy</PERSON>, a 76-year-old <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> woman, hasn't come out
of the coma induced <DATE>Aug. 31</DATE> to remove an aneurysm. Her brain
activity is improving, there is no evidence of brain injury, and
she moves her legs when stimulated, but doctors don't know why she
doesn't wake up.

CULTURE: EGYPT'S ATTEMPTS TO BOOST TOURIST REVENUES USING THE ARTS FAIL AGAIN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Choreographer <PERSON>Maurice Bejart</PERSON> stood at the Pyramids and imagined a tableau of 
dancers swooning to the rhythms of the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, framed only by the starry <TIME>night</TIME> 
sky, the tombs of ancient kings and, like an eerie, whirling backdrop, the 
Egyptian desert. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, he set about creating a mystic, sensual ballet to 
give movement to the splendor of ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and the modern Islamic faith. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian promoter <PERSON>Michel Reculez</PERSON> contracted with an Egyptian company to 
construct the stage. Costumes and set backdrops were flown in. Sophisticated 
new lighting equipment was leased. Tickets were sold to travelers from all over 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> for what was to be one of the cultural events of the decade here: the 
premiere of <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON>'s "Pyramid" on the Pyramids Plateau of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians had visions of their own, however: Customs wanted a <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> duty on 
the imported equipment. Tax authorities wanted <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> for each of the eight 
scheduled performances as an advance. The antiquities organization wanted 
royalties of <MONEY>$3,800</MONEY> per performance, plus another <MONEY>$11,300</MONEY> deposit, and demanded 
150 free tickets each night. Then, two days before last month's premiere, the 
contractor announced the price for building the stage was not <MONEY>$211,000</MONEY>, as 
promoter Reculez believed, but <MONEY>$566,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
In the subsequent dispute, 200 police officers blocked access to the site and 
the performance was called off. 
</P>
<P>
Reculez flew back to <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and declared bankruptcy. A visibly shaken <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON> 
announced that the ballet would go on, but only at <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s downtown opera 
house, not at the Pyramids. Angry ticket-holders unsuccessfully demanded their 
money back. The lighting company directors hired an Egyptian lawyer to try to 
get their <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> worth of equipment out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Kafka -- no, it's worse than <LOCATION>Kafka</LOCATION>. It's state robbery," declared 
one Belgian government official who tried to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The fiasco was but the latest setback in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s attempts to capitalize on its 
legendary archaeological treasures as modern cultural institutions. Seeking to 
boost tourist revenues and bring new life to the ancient monuments, Egyptian 
promoters have sponsored concerts at the Pyramids and lavish productions of the 
opera "Aida" at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>, and they have attempted to organize a music 
festival at temples up and down the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the events have been enthusiastically received in the arts community, 
most have been fiscal flops, resulting in months of finger-pointing, lawsuits 
and recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is a great lure, but we've had so many of these disasters," complained 
<PERSON>Magda Saleh</PERSON>, former director of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s opera house. "The government is 
behaving as if, no matter what happens, we want our pound of flesh. Well, they 
got their pound of flesh, but the (promoter), for whatever reason, got ruined. 
. . . There's quite a history of this sort of thing, and it's a pity. It's like 
killing the goose that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
Well-known Egyptian opera singer <PERSON>Hassan Kamy</PERSON>, who produced "Aida" at the 
Pyramids in <DATE>1987</DATE>, complained in a special column: "It is obvious now that we 
will never be capable of having such a big cultural event in our beautiful 
country unless we get rid of all this bureaucracy and realize the enormous loss 
we have sustained by killing the <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON> project." 
</P>
<P>
Kamy's interest was rekindled by more than the publicity over the <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON> 
production and by his own memories of haggling with tax and customs officials 
over "Aida," which eventually drew an audience of 27,000. After imposing 
customs duties on the <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON> production, authorities checked their records and 
determined that no similar duties had been assessed to Kamy in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Three 
weeks ago, he got a letter demanding <MONEY>$106,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian government officials admit that productions at archaeological sites so 
far have been money losers, but blame the losses on Western producers who don't 
bother to learn how to work the system in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect to do things as they do in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>; they expect 
everything to go a la West, and then they make enormous mistakes," <PERSON>Tarek Ali 
Hassan</PERSON>, current director of the <ORGANIZATION>Cairo Opera</ORGANIZATION>, complained in an interview 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"I reject out of hand these claims that the system is inefficient, the system 
is unfair. It is not. Somebody has not done their homework properly. A lot of 
planning is needed -- a lot of groundwork. As it happens, Westerners are used 
to the normal channels, and the normal channels do not apply here." 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Egyptian arts community privately say that Reculez, a travel 
company owner with no previous experience producing a major cultural event, 
should have familiarized himself better with the Egyptian bureaucracy before 
launching so large an undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
But Reculez says he could not have anticipated the last-minute demand by the 
contractor building the stage that effectively tripled the price. The 
contractor, who has declined interviews, has told the Egyptian courts that he 
had informed Reculez from the beginning that the price was to be charged in 
dollars, not Egyptian pounds -- and thus Reculez should have anticipated the 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was further complicated when the subcontractor supplying the wood 
for the stage suddenly demanded an extra <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY> in case it was decided to 
make the stage permanent rather than dismantle it after the performance. 
Reculez put up a check to cover the demand as a deposit, pending resolution of 
the dispute after the performances. The contractor attempted to cash it, and 
when it bounced, the Egyptian authorities seized not only the theater, but also 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of leased electronic equipment that 
was already installed. 
</P>
<P>
Reculez, his own house in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> mortgaged to cover the advance costs, went 
home having spent <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>, without a cent of revenue to show for it. Bejart's 
<LOCATION>Ballet Lausanne</LOCATION> performed at the opera house free of charge -- confident, 
perhaps, that the production will earn money later at European performances. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost everything," <PERSON>Reculez</PERSON> said in an interview. "It's a very big scandal, 
you know. The problem in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is that nothing is easy. Nothing, nothing, 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, you receive with a smile all authorization. 'Yes, come, come.' After 
that, everybody -- everybody -- asks to be paid. In advance. For tax. For 
customs. For everything you have to pay in advance, and when there is a 
problem, you don't find anyone able to find a solution. You find nothing." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bejart</PERSON>, meanwhile, has declined to comment publicly on the matter, calling it a 
business dispute between the promoter and the contractor. At a news conference 
<DATE>last week</DATE>, he said he was glad at least to be able to open the production at 
the opera house. 
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose was to give an Egyptian performance to the Egyptian public, 
and we find a lot of the possibilities to make (it happen)," he said. "We want 
to give our view of this wonderful civilization, to give it to the world, and 
mainly to the Egyptians." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't like to lose. So maybe I lose the Pyramids, I lose the 
desert, I lose everything, but the public's not going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Kamy</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON> privately was "in deep pain," and Kamy himself refused to 
attend any of the seven performances at the opera, which concluded last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one-third of something is better than three-thirds of nothing," he 
said. "But as an artist, I feel wounded like him. I see what's in his face, I 
hear his voice. I did not go. I did not want to see it. I did not want to see 
one-third of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
Though the government remains committed to producing cultural events at <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s 
historic sites, <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> said, the <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON> performance was a success even within 
the confines of the opera house -- in part, he said, because it was among the 
first theatrical works produced in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> that forced Egyptians to examine and 
question their identity as the heirs of both <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> and Mohammed, <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after the performances, columnists began asking about <PERSON>Bejart</PERSON>'s 
mystic view of Islam and wondering whether it did not lean more toward his own 
<LOCATION>Shiism</LOCATION>, rather than the Sunni Islam that most Egyptians adhere to. Some 
criticized his depiction of the beloved Egyptian diva, <PERSON>Om Koulthoum</PERSON>, as 
"grotesque." But despite scanty costumes and veiled Muslim women in punk 
sunglasses, there were none of the usual complaints from Islamic fundamentalist 
quarters that frequently occur at Egyptian cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is this production, with its richness and its greatness, has 
set a lot of people thinking -- it has created healthy controversies," <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> 
said. "People were transformed, as if by magic, when they left. People that 
don't know each other were talking to each other, people were set wondering, 
questioning. This, I think, was one of the greatest gains of the experience, 
whatever else happened."

<TEXT>
   Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist
area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues
of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a
potential gold mine of historical data.
   Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the
famous <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Nile River</LOCATION> city about 450 miles
south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   ``There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of
them are showing,'' <PERSON>Sayed Tawfik</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>. ``We will know more when we dig them up.''
   He said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities
from a 750-year period that ended about 500 B.C., shortly before the
Persians conquered <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   Displaying the find to President <PERSON>Hosni Mubarak</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Egyptologist Aly Hassan</ORGANIZATION> described it as ``the most important of the
end of the <DATE>20th century</DATE>.''
   Notable from the <DATE>first half of the century</DATE> are the discovery of
the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun across the <ORGANIZATION>Nile River</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1922</DATE>; a fabulous golden trove found in the <ORGANIZATION>Nile Delta</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Tanis</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1939</DATE>; and a dismantled full-size boat found beside the
4,600-year-old pyriamid of <LOCATION>Pharaoh Cheops</LOCATION> in <DATE>1954</DATE>.
   Hassan said the <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION> discovery turned up by chance on
<DATE>Jan. 22</DATE> during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the
temple's Amenhophis III courtyard, rimmed by towering and majestic
columns.
   Three of the five statues found so far have been identified, he
said.
   One is an 8-foot quartzite statue of Pharaoh Amenhophis III, who
ruled <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> in 1391-1353 B.C. and founded the existing <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION>.
The others are life-sized or larger.
   Another statue, 5{-feet long and made of black diorite, depicts
the cow-headed goddess <PERSON>Hathor</PERSON>, guardian of women, beauty and love.
The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General
<PERSON>Haremhab</PERSON>, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of
the 18th dynasty after <PERSON>Tutankhamun</PERSON> and his caretaker Aya died.
   He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were
cleaning.
   ``Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so
many tourists each day,'' <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> said.
   Until <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the cache remained covered and under guard.
Antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would
damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns.
   <ORGANIZATION>Luxor Temple</ORGANIZATION>, an island of stone beauty beside the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>, is
considered the most endangered monument in the <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> area,
undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water
flowing beneath it.
   During its construction, the temple underwent continual changes
and additions, including changes ordered by <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamun</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>
and Alexander the Great.
   After the reign of Amenhophis III, ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s religion
underwent major upheaval when his son and successor <ORGANIZATION>Akhenaten</ORGANIZATION>
ordered that a new god, <LOCATION>Aten</LOCATION>, be given precedence over the existing
array of deities. His agents hacked the name of Amun, the
long-favored god of <LOCATION>Thebes</LOCATION>, from monuments throughout <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   The new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence, as the name
Amun was chiseled from Amenhophis's statue. Egyptian officials said
the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of
religious frenzy and violence.
   Antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by
temple priests.
   ``We can expect to find such caches from time to time,'' said
<PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, archaeological adviser to the culture minister and
director of <ORGANIZATION>Giza Plateau</ORGANIZATION>. ``We think these objects were buried by
priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring
throughout the country.''

   He was an ancient Egyptian turncoat,
backbone of the pharaoh's government one day and strong right arm
of the conquering Persians the next.
   Most of what the world knows of Udjahorresnet comes from
inscriptions on his statue in the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> collection, which boast
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him.
   But it's a tale without an end _ the finale missing, the last
lines obscured.
   Now, in the depths of a desert burial maze, Czechoslavak
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s dastardly personalities.
   Almost 60 feet down, at the foot of a central shaft cut through
soft petrified clay and filled with sand, the team discovered a
burial chamber.
   ``What a shock to see his name, Udjahorresnet, in such an
unexpected place, away from his home'' in the <ORGANIZATION>Nile delta</ORGANIZATION>, ``away
from his Persian connections,'' said <PERSON>Miroslav Verner</PERSON>, head of
Egyptology at <ORGANIZATION>Charles University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION>.
   ``It was thrilling,'' <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> said. ``His name is what all
Egyptologists learn first when they study the Persian takeover of
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. ... He was a dark personage, a man known for his betrayal.''
   <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> has been field director since <DATE>1976</DATE> of a Czechoslavak
archaeological mission in Abusir, an ancient burial and religious
center 18 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   Mission scientists discovered a series of rubble-filled shafts
in <DATE>1981</DATE> on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid
ruin. <PERSON>Verner</PERSON>'s 10-man team and colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> began excavating last <DATE>November</DATE>.
   Udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death. The
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
<LOCATION>Persia</LOCATION> conquered <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> in 525 <ORGANIZATION>B.C.
   Little</ORGANIZATION> is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, <PERSON>Cambyses</PERSON>' son, put down internal
strife,'' <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the <LOCATION>Giza
Plateau</LOCATION>, Abusir became one of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> with the <PERSON>Roman Emperor Hadrian</PERSON> early in
the <DATE>second century</DATE>.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at <ORGANIZATION>Tivoli</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. <PERSON>Verner</PERSON> said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.

FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: An acquired taste for the pyramids - Patricia Morison
reviews 'Egyptomania' at the Louvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Robert Venturi</PERSON> put jokey little coloured lotus-columns outside the <ORGANIZATION>National
Gallery</ORGANIZATION> extension and <ORGANIZATION>IM Pei</ORGANIZATION>'s glass pyramid now squats in the forecourt of
the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>. But although post-modern architects now and then use ancient
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> as a source for references, repro-Pharaonic seems to have had its day.
It barely survives, except in the tourist gift-shops of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> which are
still crammed with pyramid paperweights and busts of Tutenkhamun.
Egyptomania, the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s clever, complicated, but indigestible new
exhibition, opens a chapter in the history of taste. It shows the many forms
for which over two centuries, from <DATE>1730</DATE> to <DATE>1930</DATE>, western art and
architecture gleefully and unselfconsciously adapted artistic motifs from
the land of the Pharaohs.
Although repro-Ramessian is nowadays rejected as kitsch, Egyptian style was
once extremely influential. It was more exotic than Greco-Roman, more
accessible than Etruscan, and highly prestigious. Egyptian style was
enormously versatile, associated with eternity, manliness, sexiness,
exoticism, non-Christian piety, and patriotism.
As an architectural style, it was also relatively simple and cheap in
comparison with classicism. So it was used extensively, for garden design,
prisons, cemeteries, in bourgeois villas, Russian palaces, and the
staterooms of <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> cruisers.
The exhibition will travel to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>, although not all 300
exhibits appear at each of the venues. Yet there is something undeniably
special about seeing it in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> one is just a step away from
the magnificent obelisk looted from the temple of <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Thebes</LOCATION>. Close by
are squares where grotesque ceremonies were staged in which huge statues of
<ORGANIZATION>Isis</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Goddess Nature</ORGANIZATION>, expressed jets of wine from her breasts into the
cups of thirsty revolutionaries. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> even has the best claim to be called
the cradle of Egyptology, born on <DATE>September 27, 1822</DATE> when <PERSON>Champollion</PERSON>
announced that he had discovered how to read hieroglyphics.
How will the exhibition look elsewhere? At the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>, the organisers have
gone for style over comfort. Tiny video-screens displayed at the cases show
pyramids and obelisks in gardens and play extracts from <ORGANIZATION>Mozart's Magic
Flute</ORGANIZATION>. The overall design is a pitch-black labyrinth as if it was intended
to evoke some ancient ritual. I found it claustrophobic and tiring.
On the other hand, it made possible a great bit of theatre. Dotted through
the darkness are white rooms containing the 'real thing', famous pieces from
the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s Egyptian galleries. Some pieces are Egyptian and some are
Egyptianising Roman sculptures, chosen not just because of their intrinsic
merits but because they inspired later artists.
The most remarkable of these antique pieces is the exceptionally beautiful
pink marble statue from <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>. It is one of the famous series which <PERSON>Emperor
Hadrian</PERSON> ordered to be made to immortalise his lover, Antinous, drowned in
the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>. Because eclectic <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> was so enamoured of her Egyptian colony, it
seemed quite natural that <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> should order the gorgeous youth to be
represented as the god Osiris. From the mid-16th century, this sculpture
could be seen by visitors to the <PERSON>Villa Albani</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, setting a standard
for Egyptian art (as Antinous was thought to be).
The variety and quality of exhibits is overwhelming, with paintings,
furniture, architectural drawings, ceramics, sculpture, jewellery, and
fashion accessories. Theatre design gets a corridor to itself. There are
important set and costume designs for the Magic Flute, for <ORGANIZATION>Rossini</ORGANIZATION>'s Moses,
and for <ORGANIZATION>Verdi's Aida</ORGANIZATION>, although, as we are reminded, it was the <PERSON>Egyptologist
Mariette Bey</PERSON> who deserves so much of the credit.
Apart from occasional treasures like <PERSON>Schinkel</PERSON>'s Magic Flute designs and
<PERSON>Boullee</PERSON>'s project for a warrior's grave, there is almost nothing in the show
to which I would give house-room. Not for me the model obelisks and sphinxes
for the mantelpiece, the tremendously elaborate clocks made to look like
Egyptian temples or Nubian slave-girls.
Anyone less insensitive to pseudo-Egyptian furniture will discover rare and
fabulous pieces. Among the most remarkable are two 18th-century bookcases,
one for a French civic library and one commissioned by an Austrian abbot.
Painstaking copies of Egyptian temple style, they were made expressly to
hold the 25 volumes of the celebrated Description de l'Egypte. Remarkable
too, is a late 19th-century grand piano made with two statues of pharaonic
noblemen to each leg.
The selection of paintings is quite as remarkable, including many comically
ghastly 19th-century specimens many of which look still worse for being
badly lit and in such solidly Egyptian company. They make the point well,
however, that successful painters needed to read up Egyptology if they were
to tackle popular subjects like <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Bullrushes</LOCATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION>Death of
Cleopatra</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>John Martin</PERSON>'s 'Seventh Plague of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>' and <PERSON>David Roberts</PERSON>'s 'Departure of
the Israelites' vie to express the sense of grandeur of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. Many of the
most successful painters and paintings of the age were Egyptian-minded;
<PERSON>Gustave Moreau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hans Makart</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Elihu Vedder</PERSON>'s 'Man Questioning the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>'
of <DATE>1863</DATE>. Sir <PERSON>Edward Poynter</PERSON>'s epic vision of forced labour, '<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>', is pure Hollywood and too exhausting to look at for more than a
minute at a time. Images of <ORGANIZATION>Cleopatra</ORGANIZATION> have a separate section in which the
supreme horror is <ORGANIZATION>Cabanel</ORGANIZATION>'s Salon painting of Cleopatra trying out poisons
on her slaves. Fascinating, too, to see the notorious sado-erotic shocker of
<DATE>1865</DATE>, <PERSON>Federico Faruffini</PERSON>'s 'Sacrifice of an Egyptian Virgin to the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>'.
Luc-Olivier <PERSON>Merson</PERSON>'s 'Rest on the Flight into <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>' is another impressively
awful example of a painter taking <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> seriously. In fact it is a copy made
in <DATE>1880</DATE>, the year after the original had enraptured visitors to the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>
Salon. On a moonlit night, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> lies flat out on the sands and the <PERSON>Virgin
Mary</PERSON> sleeps between the paws of the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>. The unearthly radiance emanating
from the <LOCATION>Christ Child</LOCATION> in her arms inspired the novelist <PERSON>JK Huysmans</PERSON> to dub
the picture, 'Virgin and <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION>, Jesus and mayonnaise.'
Egyptomania continues at the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> until <DATE>April 18</DATE>, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Fondation
Electricite de France</ORGANIZATION>. It then travels to <LOCATION>Ottawa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION>.

   A giant groundbreaking party, ``The Big
Dig,'' is set for the Great American Pyramid sports and
entertainment arena, which is being touted as a prime tourist
attraction when it opens in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
   ``It's the first pyramid of consequence to be built in 5,000
years and it just happens to have an arena in it,'' said <PERSON>Sidney
Shlenker</PERSON>, who helped develop <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>'s Astrodome in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and is
working on the pyramid.
   Groundbreaking is scheduled for <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, complete with
parades, street parties and fireworks. It will feature a
75-foot-long arrangement of lights in the shape of a shovel, and a
light and laser display showing the size of the future pyramid.
   That display will be formed by stringing lights from a
321-foot-tall industrial crane at the center of the pyramid site,
said <PERSON>Henry Turley Jr.</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> real estate developer helping
organize the groundbreaking, called ``The Big Dig.''
   With music traditional to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> playing over loudspeakers along
the downtown riverfront, a police helicopter will deliver the
75-foot ``shovel'' to signal the beginning of a fireworks display,
<PERSON>Turley</PERSON> said.
   Comedian <PERSON>Dan Aykroyd</PERSON> will perform at the <LOCATION>Mud Island</LOCATION> party with
other members of the <ORGANIZATION>Blues Brother</ORGANIZATION> review, a rock 'n' roll band
featured in a movie by the same name starring <PERSON>Aykroyd</PERSON> and the late
<PERSON>John Belushi</PERSON>.
   Local government is paying for the <MONEY>$56 million</MONEY> arena. <PERSON>Shlenker</PERSON>
has an agreement to operate it, take the lion's share of any profits
and pay the money back over 25 years.
   He also has a contract giving him control of a nearby <MONEY>$63 million</MONEY>
tourist park the city built in <DATE>1983</DATE> on a 3-mile-long <LOCATION>Mississippi
River</LOCATION> sandbar called <LOCATION>Mud Island</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Shlenker</PERSON>, a former owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Denver Nuggets of the National
Basketball Association</ORGANIZATION>, runs four <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> corporations, which he
groups under the name of <ORGANIZATION>The Pyramid Companies</ORGANIZATION>. He and his principal
financial partner, international businessman <PERSON>John Tigrett Sr.</PERSON>,
expect to spend some <MONEY>$80 million</MONEY> developing the pyramid-park project.
   The pyramid began with plans four years ago to provide a new
basketball arena for <ORGANIZATION>Memphis State University</ORGANIZATION>. The idea grew of
building a pyramid-shaped arena to play on <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>' link to its
namesake, the ancient capital of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> which stood beside the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of bitter debate, President <PERSON>Francois
Mitterrand</PERSON> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> reopened the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> as a gleaming,
high-tech museum capped by a controversial glass pyramid at the
main entrance to the medieval palace.
   Visitors poured in for their first look at the six-year, <MONEY>$850
million</MONEY> overhaul designed by American architect <PERSON>I.M. Pei</PERSON> and still
in progress. When renovations are finished in <DATE>1993</DATE>, the
centuries-old building will be the world's largest museum.
   ``The interior of the pyramid is even more extraordinary than
the exterior. I think the modernism goes very well with the
classical style,'' said <PERSON>Franck Domingue</PERSON>, a Parisian who fought his
way inside the museum that is now known as the ``Grand Louvre.''
   ``It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said <PERSON>Martine
Bieri-Duminy</PERSON>, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid go up.
   ``In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it.
They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said.
But now that it is completed, ``it's good for the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>, it's good
for <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, it's good for <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,'' she said.
   Visitors who once lost their way in dark, dusty painting
galleries on their way to the ``Mona Lisa'' or ``Winged Victory''
are sure to appreciate the spacious and air-conditioned interiors
illuminated by skylights.
   The days of searching for the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s entrance also are over.
It's hard to miss the 70-foot transparent pyramid rising gracefully
between the museum's two main wings in the center of the <LOCATION>Napoleon</LOCATION>
courtyard.
   Flanked by three smaller glass pyramids and night-lighted
fountains, the pyramid crowns a vast, underground lobby featuring
ticket windows, boutiques, an expanded bookstore and a 400-seat
auditorium with top-quality acoustics.
   From there, escalators branch out like the spokes of a wheel,
connecting the pyramid to other portions of the museum and reducing
the distance visitors once had to trek from one end of the <LOCATION>U-shaped
Louvre</LOCATION> to the other.
   ``The sense of orientation is the primary concern when
redesigning an encyclopedic museum,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said in an interview.
``The pyramid is the center of gravity, and one radiates from there
to the Italian, French and antiquities collections very easily.''
   The view from below is breathtaking. The baroque achitecture
added to the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> in the <DATE>19th century</DATE> looms against the
ever-changing <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> skyscape.
   ``I used to pray for sun,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said. ``Afterward I realized
that the pyramid is even more transparent on a gray day when it
takes on the moodiness of the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> sky.''
   The pyramid links visitors to the underground vestiges of the
first Louvre castle built by <PERSON>King Philippe Auguste</PERSON> in <DATE>1200</DATE> as a
military stronghold to protect <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> from English invaders.
   From specially built wooden walkways, visitors can stroll among
the restored ruins, including the base of the castle keep and
rounded turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it.
   Remodeled as its royal habitants demanded more comfort and
luxury, these vestiges were unearthed during recent excavations
under the <ORGANIZATION>Cour Carre</ORGANIZATION> and are displayed under soft, yellow lighting.
   Also on display is a history of the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> itself, documented by
thousands of artifacts dug up in the <LOCATION>Napoleon</LOCATION> courtyard. They bring
to life the daily routines of Parisians over the centuries.
   Lovers of <DATE>15th century and 17th century</DATE> French art will enjoy
airy high-ceilinged galleries on the third floor overlooking the
Cour Carre and the pyramid. The paintings have been cleaned,
reframed and hung at eye-level against gray walls illuminated by
skylights.
   ``This is a gigantic transformation,'' said <PERSON>Pierre Rosenberg</PERSON>,
the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s head curator of paintings. ``The real issue is
creating rooms where one can both learn and enjoy.''
   One hundred paintings have been taken out of storage. On view
for the first time since <DATE>1963</DATE> are four mammoth murals by <PERSON>Charles Le
Brun</PERSON> titled ``L'Histoire d'Alexandre.''
   When the <LOCATION>Grand Louvre</LOCATION> is completed in <DATE>1993</DATE>, it will house 4,000
items, nearly double what it displays today. With 650,000 square
feet of additional floor space, hundreds of paintings will have
been taken out of storage and shown publicly for the first time.
   Pei's pyramid _ in specially manufactured, slightly tinted glass
to be cleaned twice a month by Alpine climbers _ was the most
controversial aspect of the renovation project initiated by
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>.
   ``Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said. ``Not many people
would have bet on this project.''
   But <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> held firm, and the tide turned in their
favor when a full-size cable model was erected on the spot.
   ``All through the centuries, the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> has undergone violent
changes,'' <PERSON>Pei</PERSON> said. ``The time had to be right. I was confident
because this is the right time.''

<HEAD>After California Quake, Egyptians Wonder About Aswan High Dam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Earthquakes in the past disfigured one of
<ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>'s colossal faces at <PERSON>Abu Simbel</PERSON> in southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, toppled
<LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>'s Pharos Lighthouse and destroyed some of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s most
beautiful mosques.
   But they've failed to faze the oldest of the great monuments,
the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids or, so far, the newest, <PERSON>Gamal Abdul Nasser</PERSON>'s
Aswan High Dam, which began operating in <DATE>1971</DATE>.
   In <DATE>October</DATE>, when the killer earthquake struck northern
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, followed by another closer to home in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>,
Egyptians began to worry about the High Dam's safety.
   Seventeen times the size of <LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION>' Great Pyramid, the
Soviet-built <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> is the world's largest rock-filled dam and it
holds back the world's second largest man-made lake, 310-mile-long
Lake Nasser.
   A serious breach of the dam would send a huge wall of water _ an
estimated <MONEY>110 billion gallons</MONEY> _ roaring through the <LOCATION>Nile River</LOCATION>
valley, where almost all <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s 55 million people live.
   Rushing toward the <LOCATION>Mediterranean Sea</LOCATION>, it would sweep away much
of ancient and modern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and reach <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> in three days.
   ``When I'm asked if the <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> High Dam is safe from earthquakes,
I can say it is, up to magnitude 7 on the Richter scale, because
we've made a mock-up of the dam and tested it,'' said geophysicist
<PERSON>R.M. Kebeasy</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s leading dam expert.
   ``Even if an earthquake were to occur beneath the dam itself, it
would withstand it to this level. Still, we're taking no chances.
We monitor seismic activity 24 hours a day.''
   On <DATE>Nov. 14, 1981</DATE>, a 5.6 quake centered 40 miles to the south of
the dam and a series of aftershocks startled <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>'s residents.
   It was the strongest in living memory at <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>, and all of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>
shared <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>'s concern.
   ``Even though this earthquake was not a major concern for us, we
took earthquakes seriously from that time,'' <PERSON>Kebeasy</PERSON> said. Within
months <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> had its first seismic station at <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>, equipped with
U.S.-supplied equipment and advisers.
   Pressure on the dam and the surrounding geology is daunting.
   Every year for eons, an estimated 134 million tons of sediment
made its way down the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> to the sea. Now it is captured behind
the dam, adding that much more weight to the lakebed.
   Water levels and pressure shift constantly, accommodating
differences in wind direction, flow northward from <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION>,
temperature and other factors.
   Kebeasy said geologists weren't at all surprised when
earthquakes started occurring as the lake began to fill.
   ``We thought the largest ones would appear when water is
highest,'' he said. ``They don't. The strongest ones coincide with
drought.''
   He predicts that earthquake activity will diminish as the dam
area conditions itself to its new geological feature: a huge lake.
   But other experts, such as <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>'s Egyptian-born
Farouk el-Baz, advise caution.
   ``You have an immense weight of water, and you have water
seeping through faults acting as a lubricant,'' he said. ``People
should neither sit around worrying about it nor forget it. You have
to be on the alert.''
   An early critic of the dam was geologist <PERSON>Farkhonda Hassan</PERSON>, a
former member of parliament, now a professor at <ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   She and others still question whether the <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> earthquakes are
caused by the weight of the lake or, more dangerously, by faults
like the <LOCATION>San Andreas</LOCATION> that caused the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> quake that measured
7.1.
   The dam was built, she noted, in <LOCATION>Nasser</LOCATION>'s time.
   ``You couldn't criticize. If you did you were branded a bad
Egyptian,'' she added.
   ``There were scientists in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> willing and able to do in-depth
geological surveys of the area, but we weren't included.
   ``I believe the dam would have been built anyway, but I would
like to have seen it built with more science.''

EGYPT'S MINISTER OF CULTURE KEEPS EYE ON THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"For most foreigners, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s culture is in the past. For us, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is not of 
the past, it is the future," said <PERSON>Farouk Hosni</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s minister of culture, in 
an interview over the <DATE>weekend</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s past is unrivaled and unparalleled. In the present it has many rivals 
and many cultures surpass it, but <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> also aspires to have a strong presence 
in the contemporary world." 
</P>
<P>
People who don't know <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> well are surprised to learn about the vitality of 
its contemporary arts, he said. "We are trying to find the means to express 
this richness." Following in the footsteps of writer <PERSON>Andre Malraux</PERSON> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> 
and actress <PERSON>Melina Mercouri</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hosni</LOCATION>, a painter, is among the rare 
breed of artists who serve their countries as high-level administrators. On his 
first visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> -- a 12-day jaunt that includes <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> -- <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> was a guest of the <ORGANIZATION>Getty Conservation Institute</ORGANIZATION> 
for four days in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an artist doesn't just mean that you create things but that you are a 
person of vision and imagination," said <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON>, speaking through a translator in 
his hotel room in <LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> del Rey. The difficulty for artist-administrators is 
that they are inclined to be "idealistic perfectionists," he said, but they 
also have an advantage: an ability to dream. "The problem is not the artist's 
visionary point of view but the means -- the material tools -- to carry out his 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
A dashing figure who might be mistaken for a film star, <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said his 
childhood dreams were formed by Hollywood movies. While his visit to <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles</LOCATION> returned him to "the old days of American cinema" (in part through a 
tour of Universal Studios), his official purpose was to shape <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s cultural 
future. To that end, his itinerary was packed with meetings with museum 
administrators, ceremonial meals, visits to local cultural institutions -- the 
<PERSON>J. Paul Getty Museum</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Getty Conservation Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of 
Contemporary</ORGANIZATION> Art -- and a conference on "The First Egyptians: Pyramid Age and 
Before" at the <ORGANIZATION>Natural History Museum</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s writers, composers and plastic artists are the strength of the 
country's contemporary culture, <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said. The formerly vital Egyptian film 
industry, whose products have been widely distributed in the Arab world, has 
declined for reasons not unique to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>: the rise of video and an increasing 
emphasis on making movies for profit, he said. Movie theaters have closed 
because Egyptians watch movies at home. "Every home has a VCR, if not two or 
three," <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said, and most of them show imported movies. Asked if a Muslim 
fundamentalist movement had also crippled the film industry, <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said that 
"at a certain point, about two or three years ago, it was a menace to the 
arts," but that threat has now "collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said his primary challenge in promoting the arts is to find ways to put 
them on a sound economic footing and even turn them into money-making ventures. 
"The arts can be a real source of income by attracting tourism," he said, 
insisting that spotlighting the arts is also a way of raising quality. "If the 
quality is good, the art is wanted." He calls the concept "the 
industrialization of culture" and noted that other countries have found culture 
to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to show the civilized face of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>" to tourists, said <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON>, who 
wants that face to include more than spectacular monuments. He envisions -- and 
has already begun to work on -- performing and visual arts centers located at 
archeological sites. Contemporary artists' work would be cast in the impressive 
light of history, while "forlorn and forgotten" archeological sites would come 
to life again as venues for arts exhibitions, performances and other programs. 
Hosni plans to hit "every target. Any building or site that has its own 
character can be turned into a cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even the most forward-looking minister of culture cannot forget the 
past. The needs of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s disintegrating monuments are enormous -- and these 
ancient treasures demand foreign expertise and resources. The <ORGANIZATION>Getty 
Conservation Institute</ORGANIZATION> has come to the rescue of the 3,500-year-old tomb of 
<PERSON>Queen Nefertari</PERSON>, across the <ORGANIZATION>Nile River</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. An 
international team headed by Italians is salvaging wall paintings that were 
gravely endangered by water and salts. The tomb, which has been closed since 
the <DATE>early '50s</DATE>, will reopen to tourists in <DATE>1991</DATE>, <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Such success stories are tempered by the fact that <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> has about 10,000 
archeological sites that are deteriorating at an ever-increasing rate. Urban 
encroachment, pollutants, changing water tables and tourism are all taking 
their toll. Conservation of the <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>, including pyramids and the 
<LOCATION>Sphinx</LOCATION>, is a <MONEY>$50-million</MONEY> job, according to <ORGANIZATION>Hosni</ORGANIZATION>. But the project is 
"completely feasible," he said. Saving "the world's first Surrealist statue" is 
"no problem," <PERSON>Hosni</PERSON> said with visionary optimism. "All we need is material and 
scientific resources."

<HEAD>Antiquities Director Dies of Heart Attack at 54</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sayed Tawfik, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s chief archaeologist
and chairman of antiquities, has died of a heart attack at age 54,
friends and newspapers reported <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Tawfik, a former dean of archaeology and professor of Egyptology
at <ORGANIZATION>Cairo University</ORGANIZATION>, was the author of a half-dozen books on
Egyptian antiquities.
   As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION>, he was in
charge of all restoration and conservation work on <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s vast
legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by
time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.
   But among Egyptologists, <ORGANIZATION>Tawfik</ORGANIZATION> is remembered most as an
excavator, especially for his work on a windblown bluff overlooking
the ancient royal burial grounds of <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   He began the excavation eight years ago. In <DATE>1985</DATE> he uncovered an
unknown burial ground from the time of <ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>, tombs
hidden 33 feet below the desolate hillside that yielded a rich
store of data about some of the most important officials of the
<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> of 3,250 years ago.
   Friends said <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> was at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. That night he
suffered a heart attack and died instantly.He was buried on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Tawfik spoke of his love for Egyptology and excavation in an
interview on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, his last.
   ``Each time I excavate, I'm rewriting history,'' he told <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. ``Imagine that before I began the dig in <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>,
we never knew <ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION> had a history there. History is a puzzle,
and I'm helping to write new chapters.''
   Tawfik became chairman of antiquities in <DATE>December 1988</DATE> after a
10-month battle over who or what caused a boulder to fall from the
shoulder of the Sphinx, which cost <ORGANIZATION>Tawfik</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor his job.
   Widespread concern persists over the future of the half-man,
half-beast statue at the foot of <LOCATION>Giza Plateau</LOCATION>.
   But Tawfik remained optimistic to the end that the Sphinx would
survive. He made weekly visits, including one <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>.
   ``I think the restoration work going on at the <ORGANIZATION>Sphinx</ORGANIZATION> is
wonderful. I'm so happy with it,'' he said.
   ``Some weeks I go once to the Sphinx, sometimes three times. If
I don't go to make sure everything is going well, the Sphinx might
sleep. And one day I'll go and it'll be gone. I must be vigilant,
fight to save the Sphinx.''
   Despite his workload, <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON> refused to abandon his love for
excavation.
   ``Excavation is life, and what's so wonderful is each time you
go down, you are a discoverer,'' he said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Survivors include <PERSON>Tawfik</PERSON>'s German-born widow, <PERSON>Frieda</PERSON>; his son
Tarek, an Egyptology student at <ORGANIZATION>Cairo University</ORGANIZATION>; and daughter,
<PERSON>Sophie</PERSON>, a pupil at a German school in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.

CONTROVERSIAL NEW PYRAMID ENTRANCE TO THE LOUVRE OPENS IN PARIS

<TEXT>
<P>
There were plenty of pre-birth jitters and confusion <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> under the 
controversial new glass pyramid at the <LOCATION>Louvre Museum</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
As repair crews and cleaners made last-minute patrols through the acres of 
gleaming underground marble topped by the jutting 70-foot glass peak, 
distinguished American architect <PERSON>Ieoh Ming Pei</PERSON> was seen appealing to a museum 
guard to let him into a roped-off area of the new building. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am the architect," argued <PERSON>Pei</PERSON>, fumbling with his wallet in search of 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
Pei was eventually rescued by a blushing museum official. But he remained as 
nervous as an expectant father until his friend and admirer, French President 
<PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>, formally inaugurated the impressive <MONEY>$300-million</MONEY> new 
addition to the museum <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in a simple and elegant ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
After the ribbon-cutting, an enthusiastic crowd of tourists and onlookers were 
allowed to stream in, lending a spontaneous, populist feel to the grand opening 
of the structure that has been the focus of a lively French aesthetic and 
political debate for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
I. <PERSON>M. Pei</PERSON> beamed. "You are never sure about these things until they are built," 
he said. As the architect spoke, a wash of brilliant sunlight poured in through 
the crystal-clear roof -- 793 panes of glass specially made from the pure white 
sand of a quarry in <LOCATION>Fontainebleau</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the 650,000-square-foot new addition will serve as the 
entrance and reception area for the famous museum -- home of the <PERSON>Mona Lisa</PERSON>, the 
<PERSON>Venus de Milo</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Winged Victory of Samothrace</ORGANIZATION> and many other great works of art. 
</P>
<P>
American visitors (there were more than 300,000 last year) will be especially 
happy to know that the new addition will include toilets, restaurants and 
multilingual information booths conspicuously lacking in the old museum and, 
indeed, in many other French museums. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this will help the tourists in their traditional quest to find the <PERSON>Mona 
Lisa</PERSON> and other major works remains to be seen. The new color-coded orientation 
guide released <DATE>last week</DATE> seemed not much more illuminating than the confusing 
old model. 
</P>
<P>
However, with spacious restaurants, cafes, cloakrooms, bathrooms and even 
separate lecture rooms for group tours, visitors will at least be more 
comfortable than before during their art hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors to the museum will now enter through a door in the glass pyramid, 
situated in the central <PERSON>Napoleon Courtyard</PERSON> of the giant, horseshoe-shaped 
former palace. 
</P>
<P>
Descending on escalators or a dramatic spiral staircase, the visitors arrive at 
a reception floor with information booths, banks of television screens, a 
400-seat auditorium, a large restaurant, a cafe and the main bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
From the reception area, more escalators lead to the three separate wings of 
the reoriented museum. In digging up the courtyard to install the underground 
complex, the builders unearthed the ancient ramparts of the early palaces and 
forts on the site, which have been kept as an archeological display. 
</P>
<P>
There is also an impressive new exhibit detailing the history of the museum 
from its days as a medieval fort to its modern vision, inspired by <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON>, 
to become the <LOCATION>Grand Louvre</LOCATION>, one of the world's largest and most technologically 
advanced art museums, by <DATE>1993</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> government has dedicated nearly <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> to this dream, which, 
along with the construction of the new <ORGANIZATION>Bastille Opera</ORGANIZATION> and a giant new national 
library, is seen as the president's personal, monumental legacy, in much the 
same way that the Arch of Triumph represented <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON> I and the modernistic 
<ORGANIZATION>Pompidou Center</ORGANIZATION> reflects the rule of the late President <PERSON>Georges Pompidou</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm, bright afternoon that showed off his monument in jewel-like glory, 
<PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> was clearly happy. For the president, the museum and its 
controversial glass ornament had become a challenge not only to his government 
but, even more important in French eyes, to his good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural critics mocked the design as "an annex to Disneyland." A Cabinet 
minister refused to move out of the building to make room for the new project. 
When construction workers made too much noise, the minister had them cited. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very difficult birth, a sale histoire (dirty episode)," said 
an aide to French Minister of Culture <PERSON>Jack Lang</PERSON>. "But on a day like this, it 
all seems worth it." After all, the political problems were solved last summer 
by the defeat of the conservative government of Premier <PERSON>Jacques Chirac</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The finance minister who was reluctant to move from his wing of the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> was 
forced out by the voters. Lang, a <LOCATION>Mitterrand</LOCATION> favorite, was reinstalled as 
culture minister to supervise the new building. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director <PERSON>Michel Laclotte</PERSON> declared himself happy with the results. "I 
have always been a partisan to this design," <PERSON>Laclotte</PERSON> said. "The pyramid is not 
a gadget. The reason for the pyramid is to bring light inside."

   British brewers and archaelogists wanting to know
how ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a
brewery, read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the
liquid in ancient pottery.
   News of the three-year project, launched by a leading British
brewery and the nation's prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Egypt Exploration Society</ORGANIZATION>,
drew headlines in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> newspapers on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``Brewers seek the Pharaohs' secret,'' said one. ``Explorers
seek the recipe for <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamen</ORGANIZATION>'s beer,'' boasted another.
   The Independent called it one of the first large-scale research
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a
commercial British company.
   When the researchers have figured out what went into brewing
beer in ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, the brewery will try to reproduce it at its
laboratory in the Scottish capital of <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>.
   But <PERSON>Jim Merrington</PERSON>, corporate affairs director for Scottish and
<ORGANIZATION>Newcastle Breweries PLC</ORGANIZATION>, said he wasn't sure if the fine ale of the
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in British pubs.
   ``It is highly improbable it will appear on the bar, but it is
not beyond the realms of possibility,'' he told a news conference
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>.
   He said the project will be based largely on archaeological
excavations at Tell-el <LOCATION>Amarna</LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s ancient capitals
located 190 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
   Archaeologists from the society, led by field director <PERSON>Barry
Kemp</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University</ORGANIZATION>, are investigating a royal brewery
there attached to a temple built by <PERSON>Queen Nefertiti</PERSON>.
   She was the leading wife of <PERSON>King Tutankhamen</PERSON>'s father, the
<ORGANIZATION>Pharaoh Akhnaton</ORGANIZATION>, whose name also was spelled Akhenaten or Ikhnaton.
   Tutankhamen reigned from <DATE>1333</DATE> to <DATE>1323</DATE> B.C. His tomb was
discovered in the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> in <DATE>1922</DATE>. His solid
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the
imagination of the world.
   <PERSON>Merrington</PERSON> said <PERSON>Nefertiti</PERSON>'s temple, each side of which measures
750 feet, had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread
for religious festivals. Both processes employ yeast.
   But no one knows what the beer tasted like.
   Ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several
different beers, ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a
finer texture.
   Wall paintings from <LOCATION>Tutankhamen</LOCATION>'s day depict courtiers vomiting
after getting drunk on beer. Another wall painting shows <PERSON>Nefertiti</PERSON>
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel.
   <PERSON>Merrington</PERSON> said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of
the beer. If they're successful, he said, scientists working for
Scottish and <ORGANIZATION>Newcastle</ORGANIZATION> would use a chemical process to test those
samples to try to determine the ancient brew's taste and
consistency.
   ``Apart from what the archaeologists give us, we hope to examine
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Merrington</PERSON> said. ``We will use <DATE>20th century</DATE>
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe.
Then we will try to brew it.''
   Researchers on the project also will examine ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics, tomb models and written material for clues to making
the beer.
   ``The pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer, with
bakeries and breweries operating together,'' <PERSON>Kemp</PERSON> said. ``The
ancient Egyptians baked a kind of bread first, then used it as a
mash from which to brew the beer.''

'GRUEL WITH A KICK': ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BREWERY IS UNTAPPED

<P>
After a long day of slaving over the pottery kilns or digging tombs, the 
ancient Egyptians probably looked forward to knocking back a few jars of the 
local beverage. 
</P>
<P>
Some undoubtedly quaffed the product from what archeologists believe may be the 
oldest brewery in the world -- a recently unearthed four-vat operation capable 
of producing a dung-fired beer brewed from Nile water, half-baked bread, wheat 
malt and date juice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm describing the beer as gruel with a kick," said <PERSON>Jeremy Geller</PERSON>, an 
archeologist in the anthropology department at <ORGANIZATION>Washington University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. 
Louis</LOCATION>. Geller is excavating the brewery in the ancient city of Hierakonpolis on 
the banks of the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> about 450 miles south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. By examining pottery 
shards at the site and assessing a radiocarbon analysis of a mysterious black 
residue found in the vats, <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> estimates that the brewery was active about 
5,400 years ago, before the rise of the Pharaohs and construction of the 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
"If his dates hold up, it sounds like the oldest brewery in the world," said 
<PERSON>Solomon Katz</PERSON>, an anthropologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>, who believes 
a robust thirst for beer was one of the main reasons prehistoric 
hunter-gatherers banded together to create civilizations and develop 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Geller initially was interested in studying the pottery industry that 
flourished along the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> about 3,400 years before the time of Jesus Christ. On 
the floor of the desert, in what was once the industrial sector of 
Hierakonpolis, <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> noticed chunks of burned clay pots and the broken lip of 
a large vessel. But the pottery kiln was unlike any <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> had ever 
encountered. 
</P>
<P>
Geller found four upright conical vats sitting on a raised platform. There was 
evidence that the vats were slowly heated with fires stoked with acacia and 
tamarisk wood and dung. Most intriguing was the presence of a glossy black 
residue that clung to the insides of the vats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Direction 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly not the kiln I had been seeking. But if this was not a 
pottery kiln, what was it? Suddenly I realized that my doctoral research had, 
unexpectedly, taken a new direction," <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
An extract of the iridescent gunk was prepared and produced an odor that 
smelled like brandy. Closer examination by botanist <ORGANIZATION>Nabil el Hadidi of Cairo 
University</ORGANIZATION> revealed that the residue was the prehistoric dregs of a beer made 
with wheat and enriched with a sugary substance. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized we had cereal and sugar in the same vat, we knew it had to be 
beer," said <PERSON>Michael Allen Hoffman</PERSON>, an archeologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of South 
Carolina's Earth Sciences and Resources Institute</ORGANIZATION> and director of the 
<PERSON>Hierakonpolis Expedition</PERSON>, the organization that supports the work of <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Geller</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The prehistoric Egyptians of Hierakonpolis probably brewed beer by adding 
broken-up pieces of half-baked bread to water, wheat and a syrup that might be 
date juice. The lightly baked loaves of bread contained the airborne yeast that 
drove the fermentation. The sugar also helped speed the process. Geller 
suggests that final product was frothy gruel that packed a wallop. 
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptians certainly weren't prudes. We're not talking about <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> and 
vulgar excess, but neither are we talking about a real sober people. There was 
clearly a place in ancient <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> for dance, joy and a little indulgence in beer 
and, later, wine," <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Beer was an important part of Egyptian life. It was drunk by laborers and 
nobles alike. Beer was also placed in tombs to provide the dead with something 
to sip while they pondered eternity. Funeral prayers invoked visions of a 
pleasant afterlife that included "bread and beer, beef and fowl, alabaster and 
linen, and all things good." Tomb walls dating back to the period of Pyramids 
of <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> show recipes for beer. 
</P>
<P>
When the brewery was active, <PERSON>Hierakonpolis</PERSON> was a city of several thousand 
inhabitants. A center of power in the upper <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Hierakonpolis</PERSON> supported a 
large pottery industry, herds of sheep and goats and a burgeoning funeral 
business.

<HEAD>Louvre Pyramid Opens to Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of visitors streamed into the refurbished
courtyard of the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> for their first close-up look at
a giant glass pyramid destined to be the museum's new entrance.
   President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> cut a tricolored ribbon leading to
the <PERSON>Cour Napoleon</PERSON>, a vast esplanade between the museum's two main
wings that had been closed to the public for four years.
   The pyramid, 71 feet tall and costing <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY>, was designed
by <PERSON>I.M. Pei</PERSON>, also on hand for the inauguration.
   Surrounded by three smaller glass pyramids and set off by seven
triangular basins in deep blue granite, the pyramid seemed to
change with the weather _ dull gray when clouds blocked the sun,
then brilliant in the sunshine.
   ``It's like a jewel, a diamond sparkling in the outdoors,'' said
<PERSON>Christiane Weiler</PERSON>, a visitor from <LOCATION>Toulon</LOCATION>. ``It's much more
beautiful than I expected.''
   The <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>, built by <PERSON>King Philippe Auguste</PERSON> in <DATE>1200</DATE> as a
fortress, underwent many structural changes according the tastes of
its inhabitants over the centuries before it became a museum after
the French Revolution in <DATE>1789</DATE>.
   The pyramid had been the subject of heated debate since the
project was unveiled at the beginning of <LOCATION>Mitterrand</LOCATION>'s term of
office. But many of <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s visitors said they weren't shocked by
the clash of the old and the new.
   ``It's breathtaking,'' said <PERSON>Peggy Curran</PERSON>, 22, a <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>,
native. ``The contrast between the classical style and the pyramid
seems to sum up <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.''

   The <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic Society</ORGANIZATION> released
pictures today of an Egyptian boat photographed with special
equipment in a stone chamber where the royal vessel was entombed
beside the Great Pyramid of <LOCATION>Khufu</LOCATION> 4,600 years ago.
   National Geographic officials said the photographs were taken
with remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that the
chamber then was sealed, leaving the ancient craft undisturbed in
its resting place.
   A similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in <DATE>1954</DATE>. That
142-foot-long craft was excavated, reassembled and put in a museum
specially constructed for its display. Officials said that boat now
is decaying rapidly.
   But new techniques permitted experts from the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> and from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to survey the
new boat using remote cameras, the <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> announced
today. The boat was documented last <DATE>October</DATE> and its chamber then
was sealed with the craft untouched.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> said in a release that a joint
U.S.-Egyptian team of scientists had hoped that the chamber
containing the new boat had remained airtight during the 46
centuries since it was sealed.
   In an effort to capture samples of that air, the scientists used
a drill enclosed in an air lock. An arrangement of vacuum tubes was
used to suck the chamber's air into storage tanks for analysis.
   ``The air in the chamber proved to be moderately polluted urban
air,'' said <PERSON>Pieter Tans</PERSON>, a scientist from the <ORGANIZATION>National Oceanic</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Atmospheric Administration</ORGANIZATION> who analyzed the samples.
   He said this proves that the chamber was not sealed and
possibily never was. Samples of the cap of the chamber, said Tans,
showed that the rock was a light limestone.
   ``The rock was so permiable that this pit probably has never
been sealed,'' he said.
   Remote television pictures taken inside the chamber detected a
beetle, which immediately proved, officials said, that the chamber
had been unsealed for some time.
   Tans said the insect was identified as a common desert beetle
that feeds on fungi that is commonly found in decaying wood.
   Television and still cameras lowered into the drill hole were
able to document the entire interior of the boat chamber. The TV
camera used fiber optics to light the chamber. In this way, the
lights added no heat to tomb environment.
   Photos released by the <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> show a mound of cedar
timbers collapsed to the floor of a long chamber that had been cut
with precision out of solid limestone bedrock.
   Scientists studying the pictures have identified various boat
parts, including oar blades, deckhouse and hull planking. There was
no sign of a mast, sail or rigging.
   The video camera detected hieroglyphic markings on the ceiling
of the chamber. The <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> interpreted these symbols
as measurements and as the name of the team of workers who carved
the stone used in the chamber.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION> announcement said the purposes of the
boat, and of its sister craft excavated in <DATE>1954</DATE>, remain a mystery.
   ``Why did the ancient Egyptians disassemble and bury two
full-size royal ships at the base of the Great Pyramid?'' the
announcement asks.
   The boats are thought to have been entombed to honor the <PERSON>Pharoah
Khufu</PERSON> by his son and successor Djedefre, according to the <ORGANIZATION>National
Geographic</ORGANIZATION>.
   But it is not known if the boats were used to bring <LOCATION>Khufu</LOCATION>'s body
on the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> from his palace at <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> to the pyramid at <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION>, or
if the craft were entombed in the belief that <LOCATION>Khufu</LOCATION> would use them
in an afterlife.
   A report on the exploration of the boat chamber is carried in
the <DATE>April</DATE> issue of <ORGANIZATION>National Geographic</ORGANIZATION>, the monthly magazine of the
<ORGANIZATION>National Geographic Society</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Thor Heyerdahl</PERSON> has come to unlock its secrets. Tanned, fit, white hair
neatly combed and blue eyes clear and direct, the 76-year-old Norwegian
explorer, made famous by his Kon-Tiki voyage 44 years ago, has calmed the
spirits and befriended the witch doctors in an effort to excavate the largest
complex of pyramids in the Americas.;    <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON> is not here for fun, though
he's enjoying himself. He's on a mission -- the same one that earlier pushed
him to raft thousands of miles across treacherous oceans: to prove all
civilizations have a common heritage, to show that the pyramids he is now
excavating are linked to the pyramids of Egypt.;    Most archaeologists think
<PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON> is nuts, or, worse, that he manipulates facts to support his theory.
Civilizations from <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Mesopotamia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s pre-Incan cultures arose
independently, they say, and developed similar characteristics -- including
pyramid building -- because of humanity's common predilections.;    "I don't
listen to the 'know-hows,' the people who sit behind desks and think they know
everything," said <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON>, relaxing in his comfortable two-story home facing
the ruins. "It is utterly illogical to think cultures developed independently
without direct contact after man developed seagoing vessels about 5,000 years
ago.";    But <PERSON>Richard Burger</PERSON>, an Andean expert and professor of anthropology
at <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON>'s theory is "idle speculation.";    "It's a
theory few professionals lend any credence to," <PERSON>Burger</PERSON> said.;    It was in
<DATE>1937</DATE> on the island of <PERSON>Fatu Hiva</PERSON>, part of the <LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Marquesas
Islands</LOCATION>, that <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON> found plants native to <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>. Was it possible
<PERSON>Fatu Hiva</PERSON> and other <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> islands were settled by white mariners who sailed
from <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, rather than by Asians migrating east, as most researchers
believed?;    <PERSON>HEYERDAHL</PERSON> SET OUT to prove his theory, or at least to prove it
was possible. In <DATE>April 1947</DATE>, he and five other Scandinavians left <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> on a
45-foot balsa-log raft called the Kon-Tiki. They landed on an island near
<LOCATION>Tahiti</LOCATION> 101 days later.;    The 4,300-mile voyage earned <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON>
international fame. He met <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, wrote the
best-selling "Kon-Tiki," and won an Academy Award for best feature film
documentary. But the experts snickered. Heyerdahl could sail, they said, but
he didn't know anything about ancient cultures. He was stunt man posing as
scientist -- the Evel Knievel of ocean travel.;    The criticism stung.;   
"They couldn't understand how a guy from <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> who was not an academic could
do something they said couldn't be done," said <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON>, his voice rising
slightly in anger. "Before Kon-Tiki, nobody thought ancient Peruvians
navigated the oceans.";    Well, maybe. Archaeologists say ancient Peruvians
sailed along the South American coast but doubt they had oceangoing vessels.
And they insist that Polynesians of Asian descent -- not South Americans --
settled <LOCATION>Easter Island</LOCATION>, a wedge-shaped volcanic rock 2,000 miles west of
Chile.;    In part, <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON> settled in Tucume in <DATE>1988</DATE> to prove them wrong.
Despite its importance, the site had remained unexcavated because of lack of
funds and perhaps its overwhelming vastness -- 500 acres of buried ruins.;   
Some of the pyramids' gold artifacts are inlaid with seashells and rare stones
that originated thousands of miles away, something that to <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON>, at
least, suggest extensive maritime travel.;    <PERSON>Dan Sandweiss</PERSON>, one of two
archaeologists <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON> has hired to do the Tucume excavation, said the site
is a huge complex of ruins containing 26 large pyramids, called huacas, and
numerous smaller pyramids, courtyards and temples probably first built around
1000 A.D. by the <LOCATION>Lambayeque</LOCATION> people.;    "What we immediately discovered is a
culture not just based on agriculture, but on fishing and long-range maritime
trade," said <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON>. <PERSON>Sandweiss</PERSON> says the finds indicate only that the
<LOCATION>Lambayeque</LOCATION> had "some maritime ability.";    But <PERSON>Heyerdahl</PERSON> is as convinced of
his thesis as ever. And even if he remains a pariah in the halls of academia,
the people of this dusty town have welcomed him warmly -- theories and all.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>New, Ultra-Modern Louvre Under Glass to Open</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of bitter controversy, a gleaming and
renovated Louvre museum, crowned by a tall glass pyramid at its
entrance, is scheduled to open next week.
   For months, many Frenchmen and art lovers worldwide have been
holding their breath, waiting for a look at the high-tech,
ultra-modern facilities designed to turn a once-exhausting tour of
the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s dark and dingy galeries into sunny joy.
   The six-year, <MONEY>$850-million</MONEY> overhaul will turn the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> into the
world's largest museum once the last of its 14 new galleries opens
in <DATE>1993</DATE>.
   The pyramid entrance will be inaugurated next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by
President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> and will open to the public on
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Visitors who once wandered in search of the museum's main
entrance won't have any trouble finding the new one. It soars
dramatically between the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s two main wings, is set off by
three smaller pyramids and fountains illuminated at night.
   A graceful spiral staircase takes visitors down to a spacious
underground lobby where they will find ticket windows, bookshops,
restaurants, boutiques and a 400-seat auditorium.
   From below, the view is breathtaking: the ornate architecture of
the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s twin towers looms against the ever-changing grays of
the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> sky.
   Visitors will also find video screens indicating in several
languages which galeries are closed as well as the best routes for
finding key items like the ``Mona Lisa'' and ``Winged Victory.''
   With about 650,000 square feet of new space, dozens of important
works have been dusted off and put on display for the first time in
decades.
   Aficionados of 16th and <DATE>17th century</DATE> French painters will
probably love the newly restored galleries on the third floor of the
Cour Carre overlooking the pyramid.
   Works to be shown there include ``The History of Alexander,'' a
huge, four-panel 17th century wall mural by <PERSON>Charles Lebrun</PERSON> not seen
in public since <DATE>1963</DATE>. The <DATE>18th century</DATE> ``The Meal at Simon's'' by
<PERSON>Pierre Subleyras</PERSON>, never displayed at the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>, will also grace the
walls.
   The guards will be dressed in chic new navy-blue outfits designed
by <PERSON>Yves Saint Laurent</PERSON>.
   The brainchild of French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>, the
<LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> project was plunged in controversy from the start. Problems
arose when <PERSON>Mitterrand</PERSON> picked celebrated American architect <PERSON>I.M. Pei</PERSON>
to design the project, bypassing the traditional architectural
competition.
   Pei's design _ a 70-foot pyramid of special thick, tinted glass
soaring between the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s main wings _ was cause for further
outrage. Critics lambasted the clash of new and old, complaining
that the pyramid would turn the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> into a subway entrance or
``Disneyland annex.''
   Turning a centuries-old palace into a space-age museum was no
easy task. Before the pyramid went up, teams of archeologists worked
day and night excavating centuries of ruins under the courtyard.
   They unearthed thousands of artifacts as ancient as items from
the <DATE>13th century</DATE>. Some of things they found _ animal bones,
porcelain dinnerware, cooking utensils, vases and pitchers, 200
silver coins dating from the French Revolution, and even common
latrines _ will be put on display.
   They will be used to tell the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>'s history.
   The museum was built in <DATE>1200</DATE> by <PERSON>King Philippe Auguste</PERSON> as a walled
fortress to help protect <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> from English invaders.
   In the <DATE>1600s</DATE>, the austere castle was made more livable but did
not become a royal residence until <LOCATION>King Louis</LOCATION> XIII made it bigger to
accommodate his ever-expanding court.
   A century later, after Louis XIV deserted the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> for more
sumptous quarters at <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> declined. It was
gradually taken over by artists' colonies and turned into a museum
in <DATE>1793</DATE>.

<HEAD>Texas Cities Duel over Ramses; Dallas Wins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> beat out <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> in a Texas-sized
duel for the right to hold an exhibition featuring artifacts of
<ORGANIZATION>Ramses II</ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s greatest pharaohs.
   <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s archaeological circles dubbed it the second ``Gunfight
at the O.K. Corral.''
   Each city was armed with what it considered a valid
letter-of-intent signed by Egyptian officials promising the popular
exhibit of the pharoah who ruled <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> 3,200 years ago.
   The <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> exhibit will go to the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> and then return to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>. A compromise worked out
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> won't leave <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> empty-handed.
   The <ORGANIZATION>San Antonio Museum of Art</ORGANIZATION> will be second in line for ``Art
of Ancient Egypt,'' a new exhibition of art treasures from <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Nile Delta</ORGANIZATION> region. The exhibit debuts in <DATE>November</DATE> at <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> and then travels to <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> in <DATE>March 1990</DATE>.
   ``I think it's a good solution,'' said <PERSON>Zahi Hawass</PERSON>, the
archaeological adviser to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Minister of Culture who drafted
the compromise.
   The Ramses exhibit opened in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> and is on display
in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour opened in <LOCATION>Provo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, in <DATE>October 1985</DATE>, and it has
been an attraction at <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>; <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>; and
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. It heads to <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>September</DATE> before moving to
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said the problem between <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> occurred
because both cities thought the <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> exhibit was going to their
museums.
   ``<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> has been interested in <LOCATION>Ramses</LOCATION> for about two years,'' he
said. ``And there is letter signed by Egyptian officials, which
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> considered a letter of intent, and <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> later signed
a regular letter of intent.
   ``So we were left with two cities, each wanting <PERSON>Ramses</PERSON> and each
thinking its letter was legal. We had to reach some sort of
solution.''
   Money from both exhibits will help finance a new Museum of the
Egyptian Civilization to be built in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Nubia Museum</LOCATION> at
<LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>, 615 miles to the south.
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>' contract calls for payment to the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian
Antiquities Organization</ORGANIZATION> of <MONEY>$750,000</MONEY>, plus <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for the use of
a 27-foot-tall Ramses statue restored by Egyptian and American
experts in honor of the exhibition.
   He said the agreement also calls for the organization to receive
<PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of profits from the catalog and related items sold in the

   ``In the past <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> didn't get a proper financial return for its
exhibits sent abroad. The Tutankhamun exhibit that toured <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is the best example,'' <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said. ``We know
every museum hosting such an exhibit makes <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$12
million</MONEY>. Each exhibit draws more than a million viewers.''
   The exhibit featured gold and other items from <LOCATION>Pharaoh
Tutankhamun</LOCATION>'s tomb, which toured several countries in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
Egyptian officials complained that contracts were too tightly
drawn, leaving them out in the cold as far as sharing the profits.
   <PERSON>Hawass</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Culture Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has decided to demand for
future exhibits a minimum of <MONEY>$850,000</MONEY>, plus <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> from the
sale of catalogues and other items.
   ``We take a risk in sending artifacts out of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>,'' he said.

Hearing where we spent the new year, people look at us with the kind of
respect due to someone who has come back from <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>. 'You went to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>]
Wasn't that dangerous?' We demur. Ten days in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> were
fascinating and unforgettable. Yes, we would go back like a shot.
Not that this is the happiest phrase, given the prevalent view of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> as a
country in the grip of bearded fanatics who shoot anyone in a swimsuit. It
has been a disastrous period for tourism, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s second most important
currency earner. On <DATE>December 27</DATE>, while we were there, the most serious
attack on tourists to date took place when Moslem extremists bombed and
fired on a coach carrying Austrians in old <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>.
Meanwhile, we were at <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>, congratulating ourselves on our prescience. At
the new and comfortable <ORGANIZATION>Ibis Island Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, hovering waiters outnumbered
sunbathers. It was the same at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, where in the heat of the afternoon
barely a handful of sun-worshippers lay beside the <ORGANIZATION>Winter Palace</ORGANIZATION>'s pool. The
moon was full, but there seemed to be no honeymooning couples under the
royal palms which once witnessed King Farouk's indiscretions.
For a century, tourism has been the life-blood of a town such as <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>. Now
there is little for the sellers of <ORGANIZATION>King Tut</ORGANIZATION> tat to do but draw on their
waterpipes. The mood is one of dejection and, so far as one can tell, anger.
When we took a sail in a felucca, the captain made mint tea on his primus
stove. Suddenly he stood up and announced that if he found the 'bad men' who
had scared away the tourists, 'I will catch them and eat them with my
teeth]'
<LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> have foreign-run luxury hotels to suit all pockets, although
for elegance and architectural distinction the Old Cataract Hotel at <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>
is unsurpassed. Whether hotels have one star or five, though, they are all
short of guests. Ask the price of a room and managers say they are
negotiable.
Winter is peak season and, even now, <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thebes</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Valley of the
Kings</ORGANIZATION> are far from deserted, especially if you dawdle in the morning or
coincide with a cruise ship.
The best plan, for mature travellers with a sense of humour, is to reject
organised tours and travel independently. From <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>, it is
possible to do all the major sites with guides hired through local
companies, or to do the sites alone. For around Pounds 25, you can hire a
taxi from 7am to 7pm.
After two centuries of tourism, it is almost banal to enthuse about the
monumental remains of the pharoahs, Ptolemies and Romans. In the <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>
suburbs there are the <LOCATION>Giza</LOCATION> pyramids with the astoundingly elegant Barge of
<LOCATION>Cheops</LOCATION> - often skimped by tour companies. There is <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> and the majestic
stepped pyramid at <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>.
In <LOCATION>Upper Egypt</LOCATION>, there is <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> where, last <DATE>October</DATE>, to boost falling
revenue, <ORGANIZATION>Tutankhamen</ORGANIZATION>'s tomb was reopened in the Valley of the <LOCATION>Kings</LOCATION>. Then
there are the temples of <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Abydos</LOCATION> - where the head of Osiris
was said to rest - <LOCATION>Dendera</LOCATION>, and yet others.
Aswan is a prettier, less pressured town than <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>, and the place you go to
for visiting the temples rescued from the waters of the <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> high dam.
Philae is small and, even now, uncomfortably crowded. At the other end of
the dam, few people go to <LOCATION>New Kalabsha</LOCATION> where a family of tame sand foxes
plays in the sanctuary of Marul. Further upstream, reached by bus or
aircraft, lies <PERSON>Abu Simbel</PERSON>.
It is only possible to imagine what the ancient mystery cults might have
been like when there is silence in the huge temples. Peace reigns in the
huge Ptolemaic temple of <PERSON>Hathor</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Dendera</LOCATION>, where for centuries people went
from all over <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> for the new year festivities.
Figures appear from the shadows, muttering the names of deities until paid
off with a note or two. On the temple's massive roof, it is completely quiet
and one sits for an hour or so, just gazing at the panorama with its
contrast between barren desert and cultivation.
In his book, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>, Land of the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robin Fedden</PERSON> described the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION> as
'like <LOCATION>East Anglia</LOCATION> with the form and tone of <LOCATION>Provence</LOCATION>'. It is a richly
beautiful landscape, utterly engrossing to watch. Egrets slowly criss-cross
the fields and hoopoes perch on the lemon trees. There are palm trees and
pigeon roosts, water buffalo and camels which sway past laden with sugar
cane.
Village houses are made of mud or bricks fired in kilns beside the road. If
their owners have made the pilgrimage to <LOCATION>Mecca</LOCATION>, they paint scenes from the
journey on the external walls. Electric pumps send Nile water gushing into
the clover and sugar cane, but the shaduf (buckets on pivots) and
Archimedean water wheel are still used.
The average fellahin family has six children, which explains why there are
so many people. Women squat outside washing clothes and making bread.
Children jog past, two or even three to a donkey, waving at tourists and
often darting into the road. Driving is best left to the Egyptians,
particularly at night, when the practice is to switch off headlights and
then flash them wildly at oncoming traffic.
The contrast between upper <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, traffic-choked, squalid and
chaotic, could not be greater. Yet <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> also has to be seen, and we found
four days too short. Its medieval heritage is one of the most impressive of
any city in the world, although shamefully neglected by the authorities.
Its principal Islamic monuments are architectural gems: <PERSON>Ibn Tulun</PERSON>, the
exquisite Madrasah of <PERSON>Sultan Hasan</PERSON> and the noble mausolea of the Mamluks in
the <LOCATION>North Cemetery</LOCATION>. Egyptians appear totally relaxed about non-Moslems in
mosques, providing they are modestly dressed (no shorts) and remove their
shoes. I would always cover my head, too, although many Arab women did not.
Even in seething <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, it was obvious how blessed a time it was to be
sight-seeing. At the Great Pyramid on a <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, foreigners were
outnumbered by Cairenes picnicking in their best clothes.
More extraordinary still was our visit to <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> Museum. By
lunchtime, the Japanese and Arab visitors had gone, giving a parting caress
to the statues they passed. That left us almost alone in the upper
galleries, where case after case displays the Tutankhamen finds, his war
chariots, sandals, linen, furniture, throwing sticks and perfume jars.
It may be that our persons were at marginally greater risk in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> rather
than in rain-sodden <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. (It last rained in <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION> four years ago.) Our
choice, however, was to believe people living or doing business in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> who
insisted on <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s reputation as an unusually safe place for foreigners.
Strolling in the evenings we felt completely safe. We succeeded in avoiding
gastric misery by eating conservatively and only in first-class restaurants.
The most unpleasant experience was a glass of <PERSON>Omar Khayyam</PERSON> rose - Egyptian
wine can be lethal.
All the guidebooks comment on Egyptians' warmth and kindness towards
foreigners, and they are right. The commonest word one hears is 'welcome'.
One of the next commonest is 'baksheesh' from children in the street. Part
of the scene is the begging, the need to be for ever tipping, and the street
hassling. Instead of letting these customs get under your skin, it is better
to ignore them as an inconvenience more than compensated for by the
Egyptians' good manners and love of a joke.
After all, it is <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s Islamic traditions which make a holiday there such
a rich experience. Inshallah - as pious Egyptians frame every future wish -
I will return to the <ORGANIZATION>Nile</ORGANIZATION>. As for the temples, the best time to be there may
have been now.
<PERSON>Patricia Morison</PERSON>'s trip was organised by the <ORGANIZATION>Egyptian State Tourist Office</ORGANIZATION>:
168 Piccadilly, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W1. Tel: 071-493-5282. She flew <ORGANIZATION>Egypt Air</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Aswan</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> stayed at the <ORGANIZATION>Rameses Hilton</ORGANIZATION>, which is quiet
and central.
Sight-seeing and shopping are aided by using the three Tour Maps of Islamic
<LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, available (Pounds 3 each) from the Travel Bookshop at 13 <ORGANIZATION>Blenheim
Crescent</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> W11, tel: 071-229 5260.
