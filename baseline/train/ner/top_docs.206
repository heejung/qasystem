   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft when it zoomed past the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on its long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the last good
pictures before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. It used <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the same purpose
last <DATE>February</DATE> and will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
on its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in dress
rehearsals for exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Three of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new photographs of the moon and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were
released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> zoomed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows <PERSON>Mare
Orientale</PERSON>, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Because of
the way the moon orbits <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s third picture shows half of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, including the
<ORGANIZATION>Ross Ice Shelf</ORGANIZATION> and mountains poking through ice near <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION> Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon as if we were alien observers,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said <PERSON>Clark Chapman</PERSON>, a researcher from the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary
Science Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release more pictures <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and more distant peeks at <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But after the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too risky to launch <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

   The spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> grabbed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
gravity coattails <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
<LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at <TIME>12:35 p.m. PST</TIME>, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director <PERSON>Neal E. Ausman Jr.</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said <PERSON>Clayne M. Yeates</PERSON>, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager <PERSON>William J. O'Neil</PERSON> added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s looping 2.4 billion-mile route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. Data and pictures will continue to come in as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in <DATE>1986</DATE>
led to changes in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into orbit <DATE>Oct. 18, 1989</DATE>, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft flew past <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> on <DATE>Feb. 10</DATE>. It will get another
boost from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   A probe launched from <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> next week so it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1995</DATE>, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project
manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>, starting its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY>, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter will spend two
years exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will use Earth for that
purpose <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a
gravity slingshot last <DATE>February</DATE>.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Data collected
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> was stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder and sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
<DATE>last week</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Robert Carlson</PERSON>
said.
   Studying <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON>Michael Belton</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION> physicist <ORGANIZATION>Louis
Frank</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. Scientists played the tape <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic
Ocean</LOCATION> at <TIME>3:35 p.m. EST</TIME> <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 4.46 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone
layer, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he added.

   Scientists say pictures of the far side
of the moon taken by the spacecraft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will help fill a blank
spot on the map of the planet.
   The pictures, taken as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> sped past the moon and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on
its six-year voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, also should reveal more about the
mineral content of the moon's crust, scientists said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``We're actually doing some new observation,'' said <PERSON>James Head</PERSON>,
a member of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s imaging team at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> displayed
black and white photos of the full moon that provided a sharp image
of the <LOCATION>Orientale Basin</LOCATION> as well as portions of both the near and far
sides of the moon.
   The spacecraft swung into the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravitational field
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, hurtling 597 miles above the western <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> at the
point of its closest approach.
   By sweeping near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was able to use gravitational
pull like a slingshot to increase its speed by 11,600 mph, boosting
its velocity to 79,000 mph in relation to the sun.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s approach allowed scientists to focus the craft's
cameras on the far side of the moon for the first exploration of
the region since <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Apollo missions in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.
   The cameras photographed a wedge of moonscape near the south
pole on the far side that somehow was missed by previous <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
Soviet mapping missions, said project scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>.
   ``That's interesting, it's got craters just like the rest of the
moon, but there's no great scientific surprise in that,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>
said.
   A subsequent journey through the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field gave
scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which
magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels.
   The data could reveal whether the majority of these ions, which
trigger colorful auroras near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic poles, come from the
sun or <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Lou Frank</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic field
working group.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists pretending to be
explorers from another world said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> they had concluded life
exists on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and it may be intelligent.
   The scientists based their conclusinon on data from the
Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft.
   ``The accumulated evidence we have ... would give your
hypothetical explorer a very strong indication you had biological
activity on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s study of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> illustrates how researchers use data
collected by spacecraft to reach conclusions about other planets.
   Galileo boomeranged past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, using the
planet's gravity as a slingshot to speed it up and expand its orbit
around the sun so it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   Scientists used the opportunity to treat Earth as an alien
planet, ordering <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to snap a few thousand pictures and make
numerous measurements. They outlined their findings during a
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> news conference.
   Measurements made by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared light-detecting
instrument showed <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere is rich in nitrous oxide,
methane and oxygen, indicating ``there's a lot of life'' on the
planet, said laboratory scientist <PERSON>Robert W. Carlson</PERSON>.
   Another of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments picked up non-natural radio
signals that got stronger closer to the planet, which would make
alien scientists strongly suspect <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> has intelligent life that
makes radio broadcasts, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The spaceship also detected lightning bolts, made measurements
to help explain creation of the <ORGANIZATION>Northern and Southern Lights</ORGANIZATION>,
determined the planet is warmed by a mild ``greenhouse effect'' and
detected a high-altitude ice cloud that helps cause the annual hole
in the protective ozone layer over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   On the moon, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> found evidence of a huge volcanic eruption
4 billion years ago. That shows such volcanic activity occurred
about 200 million years earlier than previously believed, said
<ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>.
   The spacecraft's pictures also confirmed the existence of a
1,200-mile-wide meteorite impact basin on the southern hemisphere
of the moon's far side, the largest such crater ever identified,
<PERSON>Head</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> released nine
more of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s photos of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   One was a mosaic, assembled from 11 separate pictures, showing
all of icy <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>. Others showed huge lunar craters, a color
map of minerals on the moon's surface, clouds swirling over <LOCATION>South
America</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s larger lakes and Great Barrier Reef.
   The pictures didn't display evidence of life on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> because
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s closest approach to the planet, at a distance of 597
miles, was over the southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>. The detail in the
pictures was inadequate to reveal buildings, scientists said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also displayed two short movies, made by assembling
hundreds of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s still photos, showing the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon
spinning.
   ``Top that, <PERSON>Ted Turner</PERSON>!'' Head declared after the colorized
lunar movie was played. He was referring to media mogul <PERSON>Turner</PERSON>'s
controversial practice of colorizing classic films.
   Also <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> fired its thrusters repeatedly to aim
itself properly for its close encounter with the asteroid Gaspra
next <DATE>Oct. 29</DATE>, said project manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, for a final
``gravity slingshot'' maneuver to help it reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>July
1995</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe. Both will
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will descend into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere, returning data
to the orbiter until the probe is crushed by intense atmospheric
pressure. The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for at least two years,
studying the planet and making closeup pictures of its 10 largest
moons.

   The Voyager 2 spacecraft, flying through
space 2.6 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, fired its thrusters <DATE>Friday</DATE> to
change course for its <DATE>August 1989</DATE> picture-taking encounter with the
planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``Responding to radio signals radioed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 fired
its hydrazine thrusters for three minutes and 29 seconds beginning
at <TIME>6:55 a.m. PST</TIME>,'' said a statement issued by the space agency's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Flight engineering manager <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON> said radio signals sent
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> by the space probe indicated the maneuver succeeded.
   The pre-planned course correction will bring Voyager 2 some 6,200
miles closer to the solar system's eighth planet, but another major
maneuver next <DATE>April</DATE> and several subsequent but minor trajectory
changes will be required before the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby, said laboratory
spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>.
   The spacecraft _ which passed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>
and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> _ is scheduled to sweep within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloud tops at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> next <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, taking pictures
with its television camera.
   Five hours later, it will fly within 24,000 miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which scientists believe may have lakes of liquid
nitrogen.
   <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said Voyager 2 is 414.7 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, one
of the solar system's giant, gaseous outer planets.
   Radio commands to the probe and its response signals are
transmitted through large, dish-shaped radio antennae that make up
the Deep Space Network operated by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Goldstone</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 is so far away that the signals take four hours to
reach it, even traveling at the speed of light.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last of the so-called ``grand
tour'' of the outer planets by the Voyager probes. Voyagers 1 and 2
were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE>. Voyager 1, which
visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, now is headed out of the
solar system.
   Scientists have called the Voyager mission humanity's most
productive space exploration effort because the two picture-taking
probes learned hundreds of times more about the outer planets than
all previous studies combined.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists have said that by <DATE>1995</DATE>, when both probes are
searching for the edge of the solar system, the total cost of the
mission will be about <MONEY>$920 million</MONEY>, which is less than half what the
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> spends during one workday.
   Among key Voyager discoveries were active volcanos spewing sulfur
on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, an icy volcanism that produced glacier-like
flows on some of the Saturnian and Uranian moons, and the discovery
of at least 17 previously unknown moons: three at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, at least
four at <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and 10 orbiting Uranus.
   The probes also discovered new rings encircling <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and Uranus; orange smog and ethane-methane rain on <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s moon
<ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>, and dozens of giant hurricanes on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.

<P>
After taking a brief look at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is speeding toward a 
close encounter with Earth <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> on its long journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and it is 
expected to hit its desired course almost on the button, scientists reported 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had tried to block the launch of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> last year because 
its instruments draw their energy from nuclear power, and some feared that a 
launch failure or a subsequent collision with <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> could release deadly 
radioisotopes into the atmosphere. But there is no chance of that, scientists 
said, because <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be within about 16 miles of its desired course, 
passing 590 miles over the surface of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make an even closer Earth flyby in two years, passing less than 
200 miles from the planet on its way to its ultimate destination, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But 
nothing about the spacecraft has given officials with the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> anything to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"The spacecraft's health is excellent," said <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON>William J. 
O'Neil</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo is functioning so well that "we don't have to do anything on the ground 
or anything on the spacecraft" to successfully zip by the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and use gravity 
to boost its speed by about 15,000 m.p.h. That is one of several maneuvers that 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will go through in order to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, where it will conduct a 
two-year study of the Jovian system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans did not call for <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to fly past either Venus or Earth, 
but a new course had to be developed after changes in the space program 
resulting from the Challenger disaster precluded the use of a rocket powerful 
enough to send it on a direct course to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. So both <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> are 
bonuses along the way, and scientists expect to make full use of both 
opportunities to study planets that are very similar in some ways, but quite 
different in others. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth flyby will be unique in that, for the first time, a spacecraft will 
reveal the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it would appear to an alien spacecraft flying through the 
solar system. The flyby is expected to produce some first-ever pictures of the 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see portions of the far side of the moon that have never been looked 
at with modern sensors," said <PERSON>Torrence V. Johnson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>JPL</LOCATION>, the project 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The images that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will send back as it speeds toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, as well as 
the thousands of photographs it will take of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and that planet's moons, 
could be exceptionally rewarding because the camera aboard <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is capable 
of creating extremely sharp images in very low light, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Michael Belton</PERSON>, leader of the imaging team, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera is 
about 100 times as sensitive to light as the cameras that sent back spectacular 
images from the two Voyagers as they explored the outer reaches of the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s visit to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has been upstaged by <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, which 
uses a radar camera to pierce through the sulfur dioxide clouds that hide the 
planet's surface, but at least it gave scientists a chance to check out their 
instruments and pick up a little precious data on the brilliant white planet. 
</P>
<P>
The data, collected in <DATE>February</DATE>, was stored aboard the spacecraft until <DATE>last 
week</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was close enough to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to transmit it back. Scientists 
have spent the last few days devouring the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas came early this year," <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
And there were a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s instruments detected a concentration of electrons 
traveling at far higher speeds than would have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
The electrons apparently were accelerated to the extraordinary speeds because 
of some "interaction" of Venus with the million-mile-an-hour wind blowing off 
the sun. Asked the significance of the discovery, <PERSON>Louis Frank</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University 
of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>, head of the plasma science team, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It shows our ignorance of how to push particles around the solar system." 
</P>
<P>
The photos of Venus taken by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> do not rival the sharp radar images that 
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> has been sending back for the last few weeks, but scientists embraced 
them anyway because they reveal additional details about the clouds that cover 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. That, in turn, is important because it gives scientists a chance to 
study the atmosphere of a planet that evolved quite differently from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in an atmosphere that we are changing," <LOCATION>Belton</LOCATION> said, referring 
to the global warming effect that many scientists believe is taking place on 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. "If you don't want the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to change into something like that (Venus), 
then you better learn about atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
Venus has an atmosphere that is rich in carbon dioxide, so it has already 
experienced the greenhouse effect. It is also devoid of life.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> they plan to
launch ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle <DATE>Oct.
12</DATE>, catapulting the ship <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a <DATE>December 1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will fly by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, pass <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, study depletion
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early <DATE>1960s</DATE> are available, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, the project
scientist.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is a marvel,'' <PERSON>Neal Ausman Jr.</PERSON>, the
mission director, said during a news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   <PERSON>Clayne Yeates</PERSON>, acting science and mission design manager, called
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the ``the <ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said <PERSON>Yeates</PERSON>.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE>, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
orbit <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>, then launch the spacecraft. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1990</DATE>, using
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and Mars,
where in <DATE>October 1991</DATE> it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again before being sent
on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in <DATE>August 1993</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make about 10 orbits around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, passing closest
to Io but also near <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION>, two other Jovian moons.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in <DATE>1977</DATE>, at which time launch was set for <DATE>1982</DATE>. Budget cuts during
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said <PERSON>John
Casani</PERSON>, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In <DATE>1990</DATE> and again in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the most
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast
oceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by
earthquakes and active volcanoes.
   That planet is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the space
shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, is ultimately bound for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But
its long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home
planet before dispatching it to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   That makes <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the first spacecraft to approach Earth from
interplanetary space.
   ``It's showing people what the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> would look like to an
extraterrestrial,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, project scientist on the
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earth
like this before. We're going to go in and see what this place
looks like.''
   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse
effect and the Antarctic ozone hole, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will film what
scientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer and
writer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the movie, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> will appear as a thin, distant crescent,
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10
feet across are visible.
   As the spacecraft pulls away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s sunlit side, it will
take a backward-looking shot showing five days of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> recedes.
   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tiny
planet that we're on,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also, at <LOCATION>Sagan</LOCATION>'s suggestion, use its
state-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. And
on its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone hole
over <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed to
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the
global environment,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is returning to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> only to pick up a boost in speed
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After its
launch, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will get a gravity kick by passing around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
pick up more speed with the two passes by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and then begin its
primary mission to orbit <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, explore its moons and dispatch a
probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere.
   ``We wouldn't do anything on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> encounters if we thought
it would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said <PERSON>Fraser P. Fanale</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Hawaii</ORGANIZATION>, who is in charge of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
science objectives.
   Scientists say the <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> probe's investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that
interplanetary exploration has witnessed. The <DATE>1979</DATE> Voyager views of
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its satellites were fascinating, but <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s images
will be 1,000 times clearer, they say.
   In <DATE>1995</DATE>, a smaller probe is to be fired by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the
Jovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushed
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will orbit the planet gathering information on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces
such phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-old
storm larger than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in <DATE>1982</DATE> on a
direct course to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, but it has been delayed repeatedly as
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> wrangled over <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> financing and as
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.
   On <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE>, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. They
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated
areas, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said its evaluations indicated the risk of
contamination was very low.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will do more than observe the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it makes its way
to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments
to observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of things
we don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a
picture of the whole moon from the data we have.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the
moon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of
the moon's crust and its interior.
   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, searching
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit at
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars
and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Its observations of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon may help resolve a debate
about the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of <PERSON>Louis A. Frank</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION>.
   The theory holds that the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s lakes and oceans come from
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.
   If that's true, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> should be able to spot hydrogen clouds
around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the moon, the result of the comets' water
molecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor rising
from the moon as comets collide with its surface.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make the most accurate measurements yet of the
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet
``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the
atmosphere.
   It may also show whether the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is shadowed by a ring of
interplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists have
proposed.
   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We may
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.
   Finally, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> observations have what <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> calls ``the
surprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planets
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even been
imagined. Could a fresh look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> do the same?
   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things people
hadn't thought about,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. ``Who knows?''

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spaceship swooped past Venus
early <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at <TIME>12:59 a.m. EST</TIME>, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared
light sensor to start observing <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, they
arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE>.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Venus is about <PERCENT>95
percent</PERCENT> as wide as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> a boost for
its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a slingshot next <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again
on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was programmed to photograph <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
atmosphere. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> arranged for the <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Venus
Orbiter</ORGANIZATION>, circling <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since <DATE>1978</DATE>, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While nearly 20 other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Soviet spacecraft have visited
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> send back a small
amount of data, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> added.
   Studies from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and previous spacecraft indicate <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION> and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> originally
planned to send <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> on a two-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> by launching
it with a <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched with a much weaker <ORGANIZATION>Inertial Upper Stage</ORGANIZATION>
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to redesign <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route so the craft could
utilize gravity from <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> from having a
shuttle carry <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the
risk was minimal.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s major moons.

   The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, giving a big lift as well to an ambitious <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> program of space exploration. 

   Seven years late in the launching, <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> has long been a symbol of trouble for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
But yesterday, as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with storm clouds closing in on it, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> sought to turn <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> into a symbol of triumph. 

   "<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> did it right; that's the message," said <PERSON>J.R. Thompson</PERSON>, the agency's deputy administrator. 

   The <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its 16 known moons. 
If all goes well, it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in <DATE>July 1995</DATE> to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago. 
Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape. 

   Investigating <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in detail may provide clues to what astronomer <PERSON>Tobias Owen</PERSON> calls the "cosmic paradox" of life: <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but these planets are lifeless; Earth, on the other hand, has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life. 
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to spawn life. 

   Beginning in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will begin a two-year tour of the Jovian moons. 
In <DATE>1979</DATE>, two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system. 
The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s, according to <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s project scientist, and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 

   Atlantis lifted <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from the launch pad at <TIME>12:54 p.m. EDT</TIME> and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later. 
"<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world," Atlantis Commander <PERSON>Donald Williams</PERSON> said. 
"Fly safely." 

   The five-member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments, including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space, before their scheduled landing at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, <DATE>Monday</DATE>. 

   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project started in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch. 
An ebullient <PERSON>Mr. Johnson</PERSON>, wearing a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars, called the launch "fantastic." 
<PERSON>Benny Chin</PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe, compared it to watching a child leave home. 
"I'm happy and sad," he said. 

   Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view. 
Having argued that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday, they weren't quieted by yesterday's successful launch. 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will skim past Earth in <DATE>1990</DATE> and <DATE>1992</DATE>, collecting energy from the planet's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
The protesters point out that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also could crash to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> then. 

   They said they dropped plans to infiltrate the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> beefed up its security. 
One protest did get past <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s guard, though; a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> centers. 

   The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space-science program. 
An unmanned spacecraft, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, already is heading to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and is due to begin mapping the planet next <DATE>August</DATE>. 
Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and its moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, this <DATE>summer</DATE>. 

   Next month, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to launch a satellite to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe. 
In <DATE>December</DATE>, the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> will try to retrieve a satellite that's been in orbit for nearly five years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments. 
Next <DATE>March</DATE>, the shuttle Discovery will launch the Hubble space telescope, a <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> instrument designed to see the faintest galaxies in the universe. 

   Not all of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s space-science work will be so auspicious, though. 
Around Thanksgiving, the Solar Max satellite, which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> repaired in orbit in <DATE>1984</DATE>, will tumble back into the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> won't attempt a rescue; instead, it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Begins Picture-Taking Encounter With Neptune</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voyager 2 began taking pictures <DATE>Monday</DATE>
of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the last planet the space probe will encounter since it
was launched nearly 12 years ago on a spectacular tour of the solar
system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials said.
   The spacecraft still is about 73 million miles from the planet,
about the distance from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to the planet <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Ellis
Miner</PERSON>, Voyager deputy project scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   But even at such distances, <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said the electronic
picture-taking equipment aboard Voyager 2 can provide more detail
and clarity than anything available on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``Each new picture gives us new information,'' <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said. The
probe is taking about six images every three hours as it approaches
the planet at roughly 37,200 miles per hour.
   ``We're seeing a lot of detail on the atmosphere that we really
hadn't anticipated,'' <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said.
   Enthusiastic members of <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s imaging team already are
speculating that the findings will be more exciting than the images
of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, where Voyager cameras discovered extraterrestrial
volcanoes on Io, a moon.
   On <DATE>Aug. 6th</DATE>, Voyager 2 begins its close-encounter phase and the
probe's closest approach is scheduled for <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, when it will
pass within 3,000 miles of the planet.
   The first images were being recorded by the spacecraft's tape
recorders, and will be played back <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> laboratory,
operated under contract by the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>
for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   The probe now is so far away, more than 2.6 billion miles, that
data radioed at the speed of light take nearly four hours to reach
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> officials said.
   Voyager 2 and its sister space probe, Voyager 1, were launched
within weeks of each other in the <DATE>summer of 1977</DATE> in what has proved
to be one of the most successful data gathering efforts from deep
space.
   ``They are the two most complex spacecraft missions that we have
launched to date,'' <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said. ``It's been a truly amazing journey
that the two have had.''
   Voyager 1 was directed to make an extraordinary fly-by of
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, which threw the space probe above the plane of the planets
and made it impossible to visit any more of the solar system's
outer planets.
   Voyager 2, however, sailed on to Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>, where it
observed 10 new moons, measured the planet's rotation and took
pictures of major portions of the planet and its moons.
   In addition to taking images of the planet, Voyager 2 also will
be measuring ultraviolet radiation and searching for escaping gases
and activity similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s aurora borealis and australis.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft
will zoom past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> next week, taking pictures and making
measurements as if its home planet were an alien world.
   ``It will be the first time the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> has been viewed from this
perspective. I expect it will give us a greater appreciation of
this place,'' said <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>, project manager at the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s close encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION> will take place on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>
and is aimed at using the planet's gravity like a slingshot to send
the craft on the right path.
   The craft will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest
<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> at <TIME>12:35 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was 3.97 million
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> today.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be the first planetary craft to approach Earth from
space. So the flyby will be ``our first chance to look at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as
we have at other planets,'' <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief
scientist, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   During its flyby, the spacecraft will measure gases that cause
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere and will
study high-altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy
Earth's ozone layer, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he added.
   Galileo is powered by two nuclear batteries - not reactors -
that use the decay of radioactive plutonium to produce electricity.
   Environmentalists unsuccessfully sued to halt <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s launch
for fear the plutonium could contaminate <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere. <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON>
said the chance that <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will somehow plunge into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
atmosphere and release its plutonium is less than one in <MONEY>2 million</MONEY>.
   Even if it did happen, the plutonium would cause no more than 10
cancer deaths during the next 70 years, according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from a space shuttle in <DATE>October 1989</DATE> and is
scheduled to rendezvous with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE> after a looping
2.4-billion-mile journey.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route was designed so the spacecraft could use Venus
and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as ``gravity slingshots.'' It will use Earth for that
purpose <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> and again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>.
   It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a gravity slingshot last <DATE>February</DATE>. Scientists
discussed their Venus findings on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s infrared camera made the first pictures of Venus'
middle and lower cloud decks. Pictures also were used to make a
movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph winds.
   Studying <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will warm the planet like glass trapping heat
in a greenhouse, said <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON>Michael Belton</PERSON>.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its <DATE>1995</DATE> encounter with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON> said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager <PERSON>Dick Spehalski</PERSON> said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
<TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager <PERSON>Bill O'Neil</PERSON>.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   The pictures and data were stored on <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until <DATE>October</DATE> when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> operating.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission also will let <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> examine <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>. In <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
they arrive at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as a gravity slingshot next <DATE>December</DATE>
and again <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, so it will be properly aimed toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, launched from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> <DATE>last May 4</DATE>,
will go into orbit around Venus in <DATE>August</DATE>. It will use radar map at
least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface during a <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> mission.
   When the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe and orbiter reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons until late <DATE>1997</DATE>, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s roundabout route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is an indirect result of
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> toward
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION>Centaur</ORGANIZATION> would have propelled <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
with plutonium in <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the risk was minimal.

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> starts the countdown <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
but <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s launch of the space shuttle Atlantis depends on
whether a federal judge permits its five astronauts to dispatch the
nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Anti-nuclear activists have sued to halt the flight, arguing
that a launch accident could spread radioactive plutonium over
densely populated parts of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. The space agency maintains the
danger is almost non-existent.
   Both sides will argue their cases in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Court in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. <PERSON>Judge Oliver Gasch</PERSON> then will
decide whether to grant a temporary restraining order to stop the
launch, or to let the countdown proceed. This is the first time
anyone has gone to court to stop a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> launch.
   The plutonium argument overshadows the fact that the mission
involves the most expensive, most sophisticated unmanned space
probe ever built, a vehicle one mission official calls ``the
<ORGANIZATION>Rolls-Royce</ORGANIZATION> of spacecraft.''
   After a six-year outward journey, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, priced at <MONEY>$1.4
billion</MONEY>, is to shoot a probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere and then
orbit the planet for two years.
   Mission planners say its investigation of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons
will be the most scientifically rich that interplanetary
exploration has witnessed. The <DATE>1979</DATE> Voyager views of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and
its satellites were fascinating, but <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s images will be 1,000
times clearer, they say.
   The countdown is to start at <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>. If <PERSON>Gasch</PERSON> does not
rule quickly, the count will pause at the 11-hour mark, for several
days if necessary, awaiting a decision. Several critical steps,
including fueling the shuttle, occur after that point.
   If <PERSON>Gasch</PERSON> gives the green light, and no other problems arise,
Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at <TIME>1:29 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The activists vow that if they lose in court, they will
physically try to stop the liftoff.
   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on
the launch pad,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Gagnon</PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>Florida
Coalition of Peace and Justice</ORGANIZATION>, one of three groups that filed the
suit.
   Extra security measures have been in force several days,
including closing to the public several roads approaching <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>. These roads are normally closed only on launch days.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials are concerned that <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s brief, 10-minute
launch window would vanish if protesters penetrate the launch zone
with a boat or plane in the count's final minutes.
   At issue are <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s two generators and their fuel: 48 pounds
of radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide.
   The activists say that if the space shuttle crashed or exploded,
as the Challenger did in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the poisonous plutonium would be
released into the air.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has said the ``highest probability of launch-area release
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 and
such a release would have no appreciable adverse effects on the
population.''
   The agency quotes health physicists who say this type of
plutonium is relatively harmless unless a particle is inhaled or
lodges in an open wound, where it could cause cancer. Generally the
particles do not travel far in air and can be stopped by a piece of
paper or unbroken human skin.
   In tests, empty graphite plutonium containers have been blown
up, shot at and burned to determine how they survive all types of
accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those
generated by the Challenger explosion, say <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Energy
Department</ORGANIZATION>, which took part in the testing.
   The space agency notes that similar generators have flown on 22
space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and
that in three instances the well-protected devices survived severe
accidents: two unmanned rockets that blew up in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and the
explosion aboard Apollo 13 in <DATE>1970</DATE>, which forced abandonment of a
moon landing.
   Plutonium 238's normal decay gives off intense heat, which
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will convert to electricity. No other power source is
practical for space missions too far from the sun to use solar
energy.
   The five astronauts who will fly the mission say they are not
concerned about flying with plutonium.
   ``I have no absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said
commander <PERSON>Donald Williams</PERSON>.
   Pilot <PERSON>Mike McCulley</PERSON> was more blunt: ``I don't see how it can
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's pretty
remote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as a
philosophical issue to some people.''
   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as
well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about
it; I feel it's safe,'' said mission specialist <PERSON>Ellen Baker</PERSON>.
   The other crew members, mission specialists <PERSON>Shannon Lucid</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON>, expressed similar feelings.
   Six hours after liftoff, the astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
from the cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motor will start the
6,700-pound craft on a six-year trip that will cover 2.4 billion
miles on the path to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest planet in our solar
system.
   Along the way, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will obtain fly-by data about the moon,
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and at least one asteroid, <LOCATION>Gaspra</LOCATION>. It will make two return
swings to within 600 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>December 1995</DATE> a 737-pound probe released from the spacecraft
is to plunge into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s cloud layers at 115,000 mph and make
the first direct sampling of the Jovian atmosphere. Slowed quickly
by the thickening atmosphere, the probe will pop a parachute and
transmit data to the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mother ship for about an hour as it
descends about 360 miles before it is crushed and vaporized by
extreme heat and pressure.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will fire into orbit about the planet, and its 10
scientific instruments will gather information on temperatures,
magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics and gravity
fields.
   Of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather system
that produce the ever-changing bands, whirls and plumes seen from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and from the two Voyager spacecraft.
   The weather includes storms up to 25,000 miles across that have
raged for centuries. Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot,
which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes.
   The Voyagers also found that <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, 318 times more massive
than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen, topped by
an atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium. They discovered a
narrow ring of debris around the planet and found three new moons,
raising the toal to 16.
   The four largest moons bear the same relationship to their
planet as planets in our solar system do to the sun _ the nearest
being solid rock, like <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, and the farthest being a slush ball
with a rock in the center, like gaseous <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Thus, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will examine data and transmit pictures of a
miniature solar system as it orbits <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Edward C. Stone</PERSON>,
professor of physics at the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, who
is one of the mission scientists.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will give us more than just snapshots in passing, as
the Voyagers did,'' Stone said. ``Being there and observing over a
period of nearly two years will allow us to sort out the dynamics
of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons.''

<TEXT>
   Voyager 2, only a day away from its close
encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, was ready for new computer commands today as
it searched for more moons and rings after discovering a first
complete ring around the storm-wracked planet.
   A new picture taken by Voyager shows what appears to be a large
meteorite crater on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s major moon, deputy project
scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Howewver, he said, there also are uncratered regions on the moon,
and scientists haven't yet definitely concluded the spot on the
still-fuzzy <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> picture is an impact crater.
   Engineers prepared to send Voyager the computer program this
afternoon to control how the spacecraft aims itself, its cameras and
other sensors during its flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Doug
Griffith</PERSON>, deputy mission manager at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest navigation information shows that after a 12-year,
4.4-billion-mile flight, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will be within one second and 22
miles of where it is supposed to be for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby, he said.
   ``The spacecraft is working marvelously, with no problems at
all,'' <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON> said.
   He said the new computer program, smaller than that contained in
many popular computer games, is crucial to experiments in which
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will study the makeup of the atmospheres of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> by sending radio waves through their atmospheres to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Griffith</PERSON> said the new navigation data shows Voyager will make its
closest approach by flying 3,000 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloudtops at
<TIME>18 seconds before 8:56 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Until today's search for more moons, ``suspects have been seen
here and there,'' said <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>
planetary scientist who heads <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s photographic imaging team.
``I would expect several more satellites.''
   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has found four small moons besides Nereid and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first seen years ago from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   After Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the probe
may find a sheet of ring material encircling the planet _ similar to
the broad band of dust it discovered around Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>,
laboratory astronomer <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON> said.
   Smith announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the spacecraft found at least one
complete ring of diffuse debris orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. He said a partial
ring discovered by the spacecraft almost two weeks ago also may
prove to be a second complete ring. It has parts that are thicker
than other parts.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s find, the latest in a string of discoveries by the
probe during passes by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus,
elated scientists.
   ``I like the idea Voyager is going out with a bang. It's going to
blow our minds,'' said <PERSON>Carolyn Porco</PERSON>, a planetary scientist with the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>.
   Pictures taken by Voyager on <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE> revealed two partial rings _
or ring arcs _ extending around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. One of them couldn't be
found in later images and was dubbed the ``lost arc,'' until Voyager
relocated it <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> and found it goes all the way around the planet.
   Finding a complete ring was surprising. Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> said two months ago the planet might be orbited by 50
to 100 ring arcs, but he backed away from that <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   About 9 o'clock PDT tonight, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will cross within 1 million
miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant gaseous planet at 38,047
mph. It will be about 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, having traveled
a curving path of 4.4 billion miles since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   At <TIME>2:10 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will zip within 24,000 miles of the
moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> is scheduled to visit the <ORGANIZATION>Jet
Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> several hours later to congratulate Voyager
scientists and engineers.
   Voyager was programmed to search today for more rings and arcs _
including any that might be in or near <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s orbit _ and to look
for ``shepherd moons.'' Rings get their shape from the pull of
gravity between a planet and its moons, so moons that corral rings
are called shepherd moons.
   Today's picture-snapping schedule also included 30 images of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, four photos of one of the moons Voyager discovered, and 22
pictures of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and its surprisingly turbulent weather, with
racing clouds and an Earth-sized cyclone.
   Because of its bluish color and bright clouds, ``<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> looks
Earthlike,'' <PERSON>Porco</PERSON> said. ``With clouds floating in the atmosphere,
it looks homey.''
   The space probe also was to measure temperatures at various
altitudes in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Some scientists have said arcs and rings could be the remnants of
moons torn apart by gravitational forces, but <PERSON>Porco</PERSON> said it was more
likely some of them form when moons collide.
   ``We've now seen four different ring systems at four different
planets,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said, citing Saturns vast system of broad rings,
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s single narrow ring, and Uranus' 10 thin rings and one
broad sheet of dust that seems to contain dozens of rings.
   ``I find it intriguing to think that in coming to all these
planets, we're seeing ring systems at different stages of
evolution,'' <PERSON>Porco</PERSON> said. ``They have complexity in common. Each
planet is so damn different than the next.''
   The existence of moons and rings around planets in our solar
system suggests ``the processes that formed the Earth are common,''
bolstering the belief that planets orbit stars other than the sun,
<PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers fired the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
spacecraft's tiny thrusters almost 1,600 times in a successful
four-day maneuver designed to help the space probe reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1995</DATE>.
   The thruster pulses, completed late <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, slowed the

   Voyager 2 brushed by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then dove past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at <TIME>2:10 a.m PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> told hundreds of scientists
and dignitaries <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedingly
delighted to be here on this very historic day for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s space program.''
   During its approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons in
addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and frost-covered <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first
observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around
the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will
also prove to be a complete ring.
   Voyager's closest photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this <DATE>weekend</DATE>, but those returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> astounded
scientists. <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>.
   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been
seen on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> and some other moons, ``it's the first
time we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one of
the huge craters on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. ``This is a real volcano.''
   But Stone noted that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s volcanoes are ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across.
   Other <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying
cliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier
terrain,'' <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> said. ``They're like
things you see in polar caps on Mars.''
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' <PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said, adding that the faults suggest
``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.
   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``erupted
plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys
or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is
``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''
<PERSON>Soderblom</PERSON> said.
   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices
and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.
   Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io are the only objects in the solar
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active.
   Voyager also revealed <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere, as predicted.
It's content wasn't immediately determined, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said the haze
might be like photochemical smog.
   Stone said the discovery that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface once was
geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting
moon _ about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ once was a
comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Under that theory, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> initially would have orbited <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in
a long ellipse, but <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity slowly pulled it into a
circular orbit, making <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> a semi-molten, geologically active
ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 1.385 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the
giant planet at 37,847 mph.
   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s bluish
atmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands of
miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone
called the Great Dark Spot.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Its trip to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> followed a
4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 1 also was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>
and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> before speeding out of the plane of the planets.
   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager
2 will look back over its shoulder at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it, like Voyager
1, will head toward interstellar space.
   ``Voyager 2 is now past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and is continuing to press
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON>Richard Truly</PERSON> said. ``The Voyagers are destined
to wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they will
encounter.''
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, an associate administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, called the
climax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time
we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the
reconnaissance of the planets, except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.''

   Voyager's pictures of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>,
an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
has something in common with <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>: smog.
   Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
<DATE>last Thursday</DATE> and zipped past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists
recognized that the frosty surface of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon
reflected much more light than originally expected, said <PERSON>Mary Beth
Murrill</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman.
   Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68
seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON>
said.
   Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas,
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square
miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen
particles 20 miles skyward.
   During its <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six
moons in addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad
rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON>, manager of the flight
engineering office.
   By <TIME>9 p.m. PDT tonight</TIME>, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.55 million miles behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the
edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph.
   Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface
temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon
``the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said <PERSON>Roger
Yelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   Voyager also found smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's
atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of
photochemical smog at the bottom of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s stratosphere, said <PERSON>Jim
Pollock</PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an
atmosphere,'' imaging team leader <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON> said of other
planets and moons.
   ``In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the problem is it's happening way down low
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen
except on Titan,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy moon.
   In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon
<DATE>1989</DATE> N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its
lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into <DATE>1989</DATE> N1,
one of the six moons discovered by Voyager since <DATE>June</DATE>, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   Voyager found earlier that <DATE>1989</DATE> N1 really is <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
second-largest moon after <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. Scientists previously thought
Nereid was No. 2.
   Instruments aboard Voyager discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is encircled by
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape,
called a torus.
   The torus is created by gases coming off of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Ralph
McNutt</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>. Jupiter is
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur
volcanoes on the Jovian moon Io.
   The space probe also found <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> have auroras
vaguely like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern and southern lights. They glow in
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however,
unlike <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s visible auroras.
   Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> capped its epic
tour of the four outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and
Uranus. The probe was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> along with its twin, Voyager
1, which explored only <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>.

   Seven months into its six-year, <MONEY>$1.35
billion</MONEY> journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft ignited its
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two-day
maneuver that ends late today, said <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON>, a spokesman at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth
flyby. It's a very gradual change,'' mission director <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop past Earth in a gravity slingshot
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the
sun and hurl it toward its <DATE>1995</DATE> rendezvous with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar

   The spacecraft will study <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during the flyby and again
during another slingshot maneuver in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> used
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> as a gravity slingshot <DATE>Feb. 9</DATE>.
   When the maneuver started at <TIME>11:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was
96 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but had traveled a looping path of 365
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle Atlantis
last <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE>, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said.
   Its trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the fifth planet from the sun, will total
2.4 billion miles.
   The <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission will take <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> past one asteroid in
<DATE>1991</DATE> and perhaps another in <DATE>1993</DATE>. In <DATE>July 1995</DATE>, the spacecraft
separates into a 4,890-pound orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They
are scheduled to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense
atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two years
studying and taking snapshots of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its major moons Io,
<LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Callisto</ORGANIZATION>.
   One or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
to swoop about 1,000 miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
Without the maneuvers, the spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5
million miles.

   Discovery of a magnetic field around
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies
past the planet.
   ``Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said <PERSON>Norm
Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Similar radiation belts at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> disrupted <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s internal
clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the
wrong time.
   Today, Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 5.01 million
miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251
mph.
   The ship will make its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of
the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was
launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike
radio signals coming from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ strong evidence the planet has a
magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed
electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere
along magnetic field lines.
   Mercury, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic fields.
Venus and Mars do not. Whether <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> has one is unknown, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a
planet's core. Molten iron in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s core, for example, creates a
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a
nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft
electronics.
   So far at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, ``there's nothing to indicate it (the
radiation) is anything worse than we expected,'' said <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON>. ``But
time will tell.''
   Existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field suggests the planet has an
aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern and southern lights, created when
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a
planet's poles.
   Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists
determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ now believed to be
between 17 and 18 Earth hours _ and gain better understanding of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s internal structure, said <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>.
   Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> has said he believes
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center.
   That would mean that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, like neighboring Uranus, probably
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in
color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause similar radiation
darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> also released new photographs taken by Voyager.
Blurry black-and-white images show markings on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
largest moon, but ``it is still too early to tell if the features
are clouds or features on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   A color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> shows complex, frequently changing
weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy
clouds, a small cloud dubbed ``the scooter'' because it rotates
quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks.
   In recent weeks, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> also has discovered four Neptunian moons
besides two observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of
debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet
streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON>, referring to
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s previous exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the <DATE>next week</DATE>,'' Stone
said during a <TIME>late morning</TIME> news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s flight past its largest moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly closest to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> about <TIME>8:55 p.m. PDT</TIME>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Engineers at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at <TIME>8:15 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> indicating the thrusters
started firing at <TIME>4:09 a.m</TIME>. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and another moon,
<LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, cable television stations will
carry live <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which had been discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager also discovered <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> listed <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position as of <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> as 2.743
billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus
in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>. The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the
<MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager <PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
will conduct daily news conferences through <DATE>Aug. 29</DATE>.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   They also say <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field may create auroras like
<ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands
of dust orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and found evidence the planet has
``southern lights,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited
scientists as unique in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON>Rich
Terrile</PERSON>, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands
orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered
by Voyager earlier.
   Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken
during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers
celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby.
   ``My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had
one hell of a party <TIME>last night</TIME>,'' <PERSON>Mike Urban</PERSON>, a Voyager engineer,
said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, then dove past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at <TIME>2:10 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   During its approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons
besides <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were first observed from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be
a complete ring.
   While only the narrow rings were visible as Voyager flew toward
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
That makes them look like <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s broad rings, but only when viewed
from behind <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The same thing happened when Voyager passed Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. That
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft,
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus.
<PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s dust bands are not as extensive.
   Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at
30 degrees south latitude on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s ultraviolet light
sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project
scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   Because the scan didn't cover different longitudes, scientists
don't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
east to west, as do <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s auroras, <PERSON>Miner</PERSON> said.
   Miner said <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> also found nitrogen in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere.
Nitrogen makes up <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles,
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates
magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On
Earth they glow in visible light. Neptune's lights glow ultraviolet
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere.
   Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape
recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during
the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, <ORGANIZATION>Urban</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which is four-fifth's the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon. But pictures
returned <DATE>Friday</DATE> were more than enough to stun scientists.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
<PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The photographs show a cracked, frozen <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> scarred by
thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters,
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far
defy explanation.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Edward Stone</PERSON> said
<DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> and some
other moons, but <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the first place scientists have actually
seen ice volcanoes, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. Photographs showed at least three
inactive volcanoes.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000
to 2,000 feet high.
   The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen
``are very different from ordinary ice,'' said <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON>, a member of
the Voyager imaging team. ``That may explain the exoticness of the
landforms.''
   Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment
of radiation that produced chemical changes, <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said. ``We've got
pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.''
   Preliminary measurements of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic field suggest that
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic
field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said.
   <PERSON>Robert Strom</PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said the relative
scarcity of craters on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> tends to confirm speculation that
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> originated outside the solar system and became captured by
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons.
   Voyager also revealed that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere and is
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog.
   On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other
volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and
condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager 2 will look
back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space.
   Weary <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scientists, many of whom spent all night at the
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over
the spectacular images being received.
   <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said: ``Wow! What
a way to leave the solar system.''

   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by

its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   As of <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, approaching the

   With a final course correction <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers

   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf

that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will conduct
daily news conferences starting <DATE>Monday</DATE> and continuing through <DATE>Aug.
29</DATE>.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   _A magnetic field surrounding <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet also

   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Miner</ORGANIZATION> said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will start a 49-minute trip through
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s shadow. Instead of photographing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures

   <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> will ship its
rebuilt <MONEY>$157 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> space probe to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> so a
space shuttle can launch the probe and a mother ship toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY>, six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage was delayed
3{ years by the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL (<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,''
<PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> vice president <PERSON>Steven Dorfman</PERSON> said at a news conference
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Hughes spokesman <PERSON>Richard Dore</PERSON> said the 4-foot-diameter,
teardrop-shaped probe would be trucked <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> across the <LOCATION>Los
Angeles</LOCATION> area to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, where JPL runs <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s unmanned space
exploration program for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy
Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE>, followed the next month by the mother ship,
or <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter. After the two are attached, the combined
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed
aboard the shuttle Atlantis.
   The launch is expected to take place between <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and about
<DATE>Nov. 21</DATE>.
   After exploring two asteroids, the orbiter and probe will reach
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>, after separating 150 days earlier. The
probe will enter <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere at 115,000 mph, then deploy a
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planet's
atmosphere.
   The probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes
before it is crushed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s tremendous atmospheric pressure.
   The orbiter will circle <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> for at least 20 months, studying
the planet and its surrounding moons, magnetic field and
electrically charged particles.
   The data will help scientists better understand the origin of
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system and the universe, said <PERSON>Richard Young</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in
<DATE>May 1986</DATE> and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system's largest planet and
the fifth from the sun.
   Then Challenger blew up on <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, killing seven crew
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last <DATE>fall</DATE>. After the
tragedy, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid-fueled
Centaurs aboard the shuttle.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> was drastically redesigned and
lengthened because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> are no longer aligned as
ideally as they were in <DATE>1986</DATE> and because the new booster is less
powerful.
   Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were
retested.
   On the new flight plan, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will take six years instead of
three years to get to the gaseous, giant planet, traveling 2.4
billion miles although <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is about 400 million miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Dore</ORGANIZATION> said. To gain energy for the trip, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will use the
gravity of Venus and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in a slingshot effect.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swing toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>February 1990</DATE>, swing back
toward Earth that <DATE>December</DATE>, circle the sun, and swing around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE> before finally heading for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The delay increased the probe's cost to <MONEY>$157 million</MONEY> from <MONEY>$133
million</MONEY>, said <PERSON>Benny Chin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA-Ames</ORGANIZATION>. Total cost of the mission, from its official start in
<DATE>1977</DATE> through completion in late <DATE>1997</DATE> is about <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY>, said
<PERSON>Richard Spehalski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Spehalski</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> approval for the launch is expected in
<DATE>September</DATE>. Such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive
plutonium. A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> environmental impact statement concluded last
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off
with <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is very small.

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space <DATE>Friday</DATE> to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and the
evolution of our own <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Liftoff is scheduled for <TIME>2:24 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and six hours later,
<PERSON>Atlantis</PERSON>' five astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the <DATE>1978</DATE> Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> this year. The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is
to set forth in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in <DATE>1986</DATE>. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s Venera 1, which scouted Venus in <DATE>1961</DATE>. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has successfully sent five probes to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
six to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, four to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, three to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, and one each to
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. And in <DATE>August</DATE>, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has sent 19 successful spacecraft to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 <DATE>last September</DATE> while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> may represent what
might happen to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

On its convoluted journey to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft swung by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>12:35 p.m.</TIME>, only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the <MONEY>$1.5-billion</MONEY> nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was virtually perfect," said <PERSON>William J. O'Neil</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s project manager 
at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
<PERSON>Clayne M. Yeates</PERSON>, science and mission design manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 
</P>
<P>
Two extremely sharp photographs taken <DATE>Saturday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, one of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes of these recorded images, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after 
visiting another planet," <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> encounter went, 
scientists at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> can be labeled a success. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step will take place <DATE>Oct. 29</DATE>, when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>, it will have its second encounter with <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both swings around the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, as well as a rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> last <DATE>February</DATE>, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
As <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> raced by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> scoots by <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> arrives at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> late in <DATE>1995</DATE>, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s four major moons with one of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s first telescopes.

SHUTTLE ALOFT, SENDS GALILEO ON 6-YEAR VOYAGE TO JUPITER

<P>
The shuttle Atlantis roared into space <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the <TIME>9:53 a.m. PDT launching</TIME> and is 
finally on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director <PERSON>Robert Sieck</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth the wait," said <PERSON>Richard Young</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis commander <PERSON>Donald E. Williams</PERSON>, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials considered scrapping the <MONEY>$1.4-billion</MONEY> project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reevaluated the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was saved when engineers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> 
beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will have to take the scenic back 
roads to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced speed left <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> falling toward the sun. But, in <DATE>February</DATE>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> around and throw it back toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December of 1990</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will come within 600 miles of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit. Ten months later, 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>December of 1992</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will make a daringly close approach to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, that should give <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> the speed it will need to reach 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> accidentally plunges down 
into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
That would require multiple failures, which <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s launching. 
</P>
<P>
Although <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will send data back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will loop 
around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> reaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data 
until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> 
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>12:39 p.m</TIME>. The shuttle's pilot is <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Michael J. McCulley</PERSON>. 
Other members of the crew are <PERSON>Shannon W. Lucid</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franklin Chang-Diaz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ellen 
S. Baker</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RETURN TO <ORGANIZATION>JUPITER</ORGANIZATION> 
</P>
<P>
After a flight lasting six years, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe will separate into two 
parts as it approaches <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. The orbiter section will circle the planet for 
at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere 
and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases 
there. 
</P>
<P>
GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight 
path using flybys of the planets <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Earth to build up enough speed to 
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.

   From 3.8 billion miles, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in <DATE>February</DATE> and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded <DATE>Feb. 13-14</DATE> but were not played back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> until
late <DATE>March</DATE> because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> was too close to the sun
to be photographed and <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was within a band of sunlight but
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
<DATE>August</DATE> and <DATE>September 1977</DATE> from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years <DATE>2000</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE>. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in <DATE>1975</DATE>.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> space ship cruised on the
next leg of its 2.4-billion mile, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> after
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act
like a mad shutterbug.
   Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but for
about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera
opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None
of those unintended exposures were recorded.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers sent the 2.8-ton <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> new computer commands
late <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures, right
on schedule, of cloud-shrouded Venus in a series that ended <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>.
   ``They seem to understand what happened, and they're not
concerned about any repeats,'' said <PERSON>Bob MacMillin</PERSON>, spokesman for
the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is now flying back toward Earth so the planet can act as
a gravity slingshot on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> to help the spacecraft reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1995</DATE> in a <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission to explore the solar system's
largest planet.
   Galileo swooped about 10,000 miles above the 900-degree
Fahrenheit surface of Venus at <TIME>9:59 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the
mission's first ``gravity assist maneuver.'' Venus helped increase
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s speed by almost 5,000 mph, giving it enough energy to get
to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   After the flyby, the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study
Venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning. The camera
bugs then developed.
   MacMillin said engineers determined <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s camera and
computer were fine, and that the problem was in a computer program
sent from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to tell <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> what to do and when to do it.
   The problem was caused by improper timing between various
commands within the computer program, <PERSON>MacMillin</PERSON> said.
   He said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. The craft was deployed <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE> from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then launched by a solid-fueled booster to start
its looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at Venus
until late this <DATE>Friday</DATE>, taking 27 more photos and using other
sensors to detect dust, infrared and visible light, and
electrically charged particles.
   The pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecraft's
tape recorder. Almost all of them will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
<DATE>October</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is close enough to send scientific information
using its small antenna.
   That antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft. A
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the sun's heat.
   After swinging past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will explore
asteroid Gaspra in <DATE>October 1991</DATE>, then make another flight past
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8, 1992</DATE>. The spacecraft may study asteroid Ida in
<DATE>August 1993</DATE> before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> deploys a 760-pound probe in <DATE>July 1995</DATE>.
Galileo and the probe will reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>.
   The probe will parachute into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> until it is vaporized by intense heat and
pressure. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will swoop past the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes, then go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to
study the planet and moons <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Callisto</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> at least
until late <DATE>1997</DATE>.

   Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny
``moonlets'' hidden in one of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s two brightest rings, and
also found three more rings orbiting the planet, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's
fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a
tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern
and southern lights.
   The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT>
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink
snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed
viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is
present as well, they said.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will
be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager traveled a curving
4.43-billion-mile path to achieve <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s close encounter
with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>'s flight past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We have five rings at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,'' including the two bright ones
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said <PERSON>Bradford
Smith</PERSON>, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't
well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as
five. He reversed himself later <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, deciding the rings are
distinct enough to count the total as five.
   A bright ring discovered <DATE>Aug. 11</DATE> initially appeared to be a
partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring.
Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12
miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   ``You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring
has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others.
   So far, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has discovered six objects orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that
are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight
moons, including <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The ring containing the moonlets remains <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s outermost
ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring,
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse
band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest
to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band
of dust <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said was 1,550 miles wide.
   The initial confusion over the number of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings is
reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Ten thin rings were
apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed
that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible
when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing
how many distinct rings orbit Uranus.
   Researchers said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that Voyager also found:
   _<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away
from the poles around which the planet rotates. Earth's magnetic
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one
magnetic pole in northern <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> about 1,000 miles from the true, or
rotational, north pole.
   _The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than
the <ORGANIZATION>Van Allen</ORGANIZATION> belts encircling <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The radiation belt's location
near the orbit of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> may explain the pinkish hue of some of the
moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas
that color.
   Deputy Voyager project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said there is
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south
latitude, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has an aurora similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and
southern lights. Other scientists <DATE>Saturday</DATE> refused to discuss the
evidence, saying it was too preliminary.
   If the aurora proves real, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s tilted magnetic field would
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's
equator rather than the rotational poles.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth,
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational
poles are relatively close.
   Voyager continued <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to send back recorded photographs
taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed
photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global
temperature map of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, search for auroras and more rings, and
study the weight of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 2 was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>, Voyager 2 will look
back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space,
looking for the edge of the solar system.

   Voyager 2 plunged over <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north
pole and <DATE>today</DATE> took its closest look at the moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, discovering
dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults
and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic
exploration of four planets.
   ``This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory
astronomer <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON> said after the 12-year-old spaceship made
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. Neptune ``is not
a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real
place.''
   The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s icy
north pole cloud tops at <TIME>8:56 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> _ the closest of its
planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravity
to a speed of 61,148 mph.
   Its photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> revealed that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s major moon has
large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said
Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.
   ``It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a
moon of Uranus, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. ``This is a real volcano.''
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> in a speech to
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Reiterating President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s <DATE>July</DATE> statement in support of an
eventual permanent base on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon and a manned trip to
<ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> declared: ``We Americans have been opening new
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so.
Today, space is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s frontier.''
   <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, an associate administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, called the climax of the
Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time we're seeing a
planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the
planets, except <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.''
   Five hours after the rendezvous with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the spaceship made
its closest pass by the moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>2:10 a.m.</TIME>, a flyby that was
confirmed when signals reached <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> at <TIME>6:16 a.m. PDT</TIME>.
   The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's
radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The array of information on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon had
scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
itself.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> will upstage <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. It's filled with hummocky,
rippling terrain,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said.
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' said <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>. The
faults suggest that ``Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time
on the moon.
   Later, <PERSON>Joseph Boyce</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> geologist, said there was ``abundant
evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like
substance rather than molten rock.
   Voyager's newest photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> received <TIME>this morning</TIME> showed a
smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> said
measured several hundred miles across.
   ``It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,''
<PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> said. ``It looks like some sort of feature flooded by
material, and the material is probably volcanic material.''
   The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows
on Uranus' moon <PERSON>Ariel</PERSON> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and earlier found active
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Boyce</PERSON> emphasized there is no evidence yet that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s icy
volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the
crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so.
   Earlier, <PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, head of Voyager's photographic imaging
team at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had described <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
surface in photos taken <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as ``extremely strange and
puzzling.''
   The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and
``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist
<PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON> said.
   While difficult to interpret, the early photos of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> gave
``the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and
alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white
topography that is ``closer to flat than big mountains,'' said
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, who called the pictures ``Just short of spectacular.''
   At <TIME>11:59 p.m. PDT</TIME>, signals were received showing that Voyager had
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it
passed through the plane containing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s rings, said <PERSON>Donald
Gurnett</PERSON>. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the
spacecraft, <PERSON>Gurnett</PERSON> said.
   Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the
spaceship's near encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
   ``There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. ``We are all very
excited.''
   Scientists announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that Voyager discovered two more
tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a
60-mile-wide moon designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N5, and the even smaller <DATE>1989</DATE> N6,
which is a mere 30 miles wide.
   That brought the number of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moons discovered before the
close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and Nereid _ and four found earlier by Voyager.
   Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc.
Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> almost certainly also is a complete ring.
   During its flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, Voyager was programmed
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study
their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the
rings and search for others; and take its best but still
2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid.
   Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds,
high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other
cyclones.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> calculated <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s position during the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby as
nearly 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. But the ship had traveled a
curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in
<DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   Champagne flowed at the laboratory <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when Voyager crossed
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
magnetic field.
   Earlier pictures of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> suggested the backward-orbiting moon
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural
gas on its pink-and-blue surface.
   Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry
to aim a space probe built with <DATE>1960s</DATE> technology, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was
supposed to be after the long journey.
   ``Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer.
   Voyager 1 visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>, and now is
speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after
it stops studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s
elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> temporarily
the solar system's outmost planet.
   ``Someday there ought to be a <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> flyby,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. ``But
there are no active plans to do that.''

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers were unwilling to wait
until <DATE>October</DATE> to see the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's photographs of Venus,
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures
sent to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> early.
   One of the photos released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> shows clouds as small as 25
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere.
It was taken <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when the Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was about
1 million miles past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the second planet from the sun.
   ``You can see clouds, and you can see some very interesting
detail in the cloud patterns,'' said <PERSON>Neal Ausman</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission
director at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``The engineers and scientists are
exceptionally pleased.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to go into orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December
1995</DATE> in a <MONEY>$1.35 billion</MONEY> mission to study the solar system's largest
planet. Just before <TIME>10 p.m. PST</TIME> <DATE>last Friday</DATE>, the spacecraft swooped
about 10,025 miles over <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION> so that planet could act as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most of the photographs and other data collected during and
after the flyby won't be sent back until <DATE>October</DATE>, when the
spacecraft is closer to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s main antenna now is furled
to protect it from the heat of the sun. A smaller antenna, which
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate, is
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft.
   But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers were able to get <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to send the three
photos back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by transferring separate
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio
transmission, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jim Wilson</PERSON> called the technique ``experimental
and difficult.''
   <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>'
lower atmosphere, as well as ultraviolet light measurements and
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in
space around <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>.
   By the time <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s fly-by of Venus formally ends <DATE>Friday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, the spacecraft's television camera will have taken about 80
pictures of cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Many other spacecraft have photographed <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, some from much
closer than <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>. But the new photos still should have
scientific value, <PERSON>Ausman</PERSON> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last <DATE>Oct.
18</DATE> on a looping 2.4 billion, six-year route that requires <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
Earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. It will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE>, then again on <DATE>Dec. 8,
1992</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, the Voyager
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the
solar system, according to <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Mary Hardin</PERSON>.
   Voyager 1, which photographed <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE>, was ordered to shoot the pictures <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>. But it
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs
to travel the 3.7 billion miles to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hardin</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in <DATE>1977</DATE> to probe <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> next <DATE>August</DATE>.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>'s surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer</ORGANIZATION> probes found
that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Photographs taken of <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 in <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>1975</DATE>
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> 10 found that <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in <DATE>1976</DATE> and <DATE>1977</DATE>
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce <DATE>summer</DATE> storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

   Seeking new worlds 2.75 billion miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'S Voyager 2 spacecraft discovered a third moon
orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and is likely to find many more, scientists say.
   ``It's nice, after years of preparation for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, to have Voyager now starting to make these discoveries,''
Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomer <PERSON>Steve Synnott</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
``Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the time this discovery process
is frustration, so it is finally nice to dig a nugget out of all the
mud.''
   Synnott detected the moon, temporarily designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N1, in
photographs taken by one of the space probe's television cameras.
Previously, only two moons had been detected from earth.
   Project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON> said recently that Voyager might
discover at least 10 small moons orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyagers 1 and 2 _ with total mission costs of <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> _ now
have discovered at least 18 moons: three at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, at least four
and possibly seven at <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, 10 orbiting Uranus, and one so far at
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   That boosts the total lunar count to 16 for <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, at least 17
for <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, 15 for Uranus and three for <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Synnott</PERSON>, who helped discover several of those moons, was asked
how he celebrates when he finds an entire new world.
   ``I usually go home and have a beer,'' he said.
   The Jet Propulsion laboratory operates <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s unmanned space
exploration program for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager 2 was launched from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Today it was 2.67 billion
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 42.8 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, speeding at
42,200 mph toward its <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> close encounter with the solar
system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when it sweeps
3,000 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops at <TIME>midnight EDT</TIME>
<DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, but its curving path to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will equal 4.43 billion
miles.
   Neptune's other moons are Nereid and the backward-orbiting
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, discovered through telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE> and <DATE>1846</DATE>,
respectively.
   In <DATE>1981</DATE>, scientists using telescopes believed they detected
another Neptunian moon, but its existence hasn't yet been confirmed
by Voyager.
   With a diameter estimated at 125 to 400 miles, <DATE>1989</DATE> N1 is smaller
than Nereid _ estimated at 190 to 620 miles across _ or <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, with
an estimated diameter of 1,400 to 2,240 miles, or roughly the size
of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon.
   Synnott first detected the moon as a smudge in images taken by
Voyager 2 on <DATE>June 21</DATE>. He confirmed the discovery <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by
examining images.
   ``I never really jumped and screamed, but I clenched my fist,
nodded my head to myself and said, `Yup, that one's real!''' he said.

<TEXT>
   Neptune's icy volcanic moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the
coldest body ever measured in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>,
and the planet itself has something in common with <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>: smog.
   The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern lights on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, scientists said.
   Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on <DATE>Monday</DATE> snapped a
series of family portraits of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, appearing as
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.
   Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
making the moon ``the coldest body we have seen in the solar
system,'' said <PERSON>Roger Yelle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   In another finding, the best close-up photo yet of another moon,
<DATE>1989</DATE> N1, showed that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon has a huge crater
about half as wide as the lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide satellite.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into <DATE>1989</DATE> N1,
one of six moons discovered since <DATE>June</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>, according to
<PERSON>Bradford Smith</PERSON>, the leader of <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s photographic imaging team.
   Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find
liquid lakes or oceans on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, but the moon almost certainly is
too cold to have them, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, a scientist at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.
   Johnson defended the theory, advanced by other scientists <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles
20 miles skyward. ``It isn't a crazy idea,'' he said.
   Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> occurred <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
and it passed <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, capping its epic tour of the four
outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
   The probe has also found five rings, including three thin ones
and two broad bands of dust.
   1989 N1 took <ORGANIZATION>Nereid</ORGANIZATION>'s place as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s second-largest moon
after <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. N1 and the other five moons discovered by Voyager in
addition to <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,
have not yet been permanently named.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras somewhat like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights
over wide sections of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s skies and over much of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s day
side, said Yelle.
   But unlike <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s auroras, which glow in visible light as
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases, the
auroras on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> are invisible to the human eye. That's
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles
excite hydrogen gas.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
atmosphere ``converts it into photochemical smog'' that forms a
90-mile-thick icy layer at the bottom of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s stratosphere,
said <PERSON>Jim Pollock</PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research
Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> have ``definite
similarities,'' although <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> smog has components absent on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Finding smog on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> ``is no surprise,'' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said.
``Photochemical smog exists any place (planet or moon) we've been
that has an atmosphere. In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, the problem is it's
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts
exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy
moon.
   Auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles
from the solar wind spiral toward a planet's magnetic poles along
magnetic field lines. On Earth, the magnetic poles are tilted only
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates, so
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions.
   Neptune's major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from
its rotational poles, and scientists have said the planet may have
multiple magnetic poles. That could explain why <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s auroras
appear over wide areas of the planet.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s aurora is created differently. Electrically charged
particles in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s orbiting radiation belt, discovered recently
by <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>, excite gases in <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere to create its
auroras, said <PERSON>Andy Chen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins University</ORGANIZATION>.
   By <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Voyager will be 2.759 billion miles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.097 million miles beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, slowly decelerating as
it speeds toward the stars at 37,582 mph.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said <PERSON>Lanny Miller</PERSON>, manager of the flight
engineering office.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> that may be
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles of
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>. They visited <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE> and <DATE>1981</DATE>, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   At a cost <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> pegged at <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Voyager 2 cruised away from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and
toward the stars <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, completing an <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY> trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON>, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 4.2 million
miles beyond <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>1977</DATE>, past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in
<DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>, and now past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>
in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   For <MONEY>$865 million _ 20 cents</MONEY> per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
<PERSON>Voyager</PERSON> has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were first detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than <DATE>a half billion years ago</DATE>, said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION>
geologist <PERSON>Laurence Soderblom</PERSON>.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> showing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Planetary Society</ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON>Bruce Murray</PERSON>, former director of
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
<PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   He said <PERSON>Sherwood Rowland</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mario Molina</PERSON> first warned of
depletion of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
<ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said.
   From <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said <PERSON>Voyager</PERSON> also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> until <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until <DATE>2020</DATE>.

<HEAD>Galileo Probe Rebuilt For October Launch, 1995 Plunge Into Jovian
Skies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A space probe grounded for 3{ years by
the Challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an <DATE>October</DATE> launch to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the
birth of the solar system.
   The <MONEY>$1.36 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> mission should climax in <DATE>December 1995</DATE>,
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75
minutes before it is crushed by <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s intense atmospheric
pressure.
   Its mother ship, the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> orbiter, will circle the planet for
22 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION> planned to deliver the refurbished <MONEY>$157
million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe late this afternoon in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
<ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> on its way to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> Vice President <PERSON>Steven Dorfman</PERSON>
said at a news conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   JPL will send the 4-foot-diameter, teardrop-shaped probe to
<ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in late <DATE>April</DATE>, followed by the
orbiter in <DATE>mid-May</DATE>. The probe and orbiter then will be hooked up
together, placed atop a booster rocket, and finally loaded into the
cargo bay of the shuttle Atlantis.
   The shuttle, set for launch no earlier than <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE> and no later
than about <DATE>Nov. 21</DATE>, will release the combined <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft
into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit. Then <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s rocket will fire, sending the
orbiter and probe on a circuitous, 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage
to the solar system's largest planet, which is the fifth planet from
the sun and is about 400 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   En route to the giant gaseous planet, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will observe two
asteroids. The probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they
reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, then fly in tandem until the probe enters the
atmosphere at 115,000 mph. The probe will deploy a parachute and
descend about 370 miles through Jovian skies until it is crushed by
pressure more than 25 times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   Data from the probe will help scientists better understand the
origin of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, the solar system and the universe, said <PERSON>Richard
Young</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe project scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>.
   Scientists believe the Jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the
original material from which stars are formed, according to a Hughes
statement.
   The orbiter will measure <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s electrical particle and
magnetic fields, and snap 50,000 photographs of the planet and its
moons, including Io, <LOCATION>Europa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ganymede</LOCATION> and Callisto, which were
discovered in <DATE>1610</DATE> by Italian astronomer <ORGANIZATION>Galileo Galilei</ORGANIZATION>.
   The spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle
in <DATE>May 1986</DATE> and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But Challenger exploded on <DATE>Jan. 28,
1986</DATE>, killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet
until last <DATE>fall</DATE>.
   After the tragedy, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too dangerous to carry
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s route to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years
to six because <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> are no longer aligned as ideally as
they were in <DATE>1986</DATE> and because <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new solid-fueled booster is
less powerful.
   The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> approval for the launch is expected in <DATE>September</DATE>,
said <PERSON>Richard Spehalski</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> project manager at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>. Such
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium. A <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is very
small.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 is converging on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager
at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on <ORGANIZATION>Nep</ORGANIZATION>
a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE>, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s size and the fourth largest planet after <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost until <DATE>2007</DATE>.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, said
physicist Ed Stone, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hurricanes or <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Despite any internal heat, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> receives 900 times less
sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has extreme seasons because its orbit
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> doubts
similar problems at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>, and photos and information it sends to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
<DATE>2020</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   After <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

<HEAD>Ring Arcs Added to Voyager 2 Discoveries as Spacecraft Nears Neptune</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voyager 2, now 12 days from its close
encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, has made another discovery that thrilled
scientists: two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar system's
fourth-largest planet.
   ``There is a mood of total elation here,'' said astronomer <PERSON>Rich
Terrile</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're really just ecstatic. ... Everything
we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.''
   Early <DATE>Friday</DATE>, Voyager 2 photographed the two partial rings,
called ``ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the
complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Since early <DATE>July</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has discovered four small moons
orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in addition to the previously known moons, <ORGANIZATION>Nereid</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   The probe also has discovered 2,700-mile-wide dark bands _
possibly jet stream-like belts of windblown clouds _ forming a
collar around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole and possibly its north pole.
Voyager 2 earlier revealed a 6,200-mile-wide dark spot in the
planet's atmosphere, probably a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great
Red Spot.
   Today, Voyager 2, traveling at 42,198 mph, was 2.72 billion
miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 11.3 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the fourth
largest planet of the solar system and eighth planet from the sun.
   On <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>, Voyager 2 is expected to fly about 3,000 miles above
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloudtops. The probe was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, and explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   One of the two ring arcs detected <DATE>Friday</DATE> extends one-eighth of
the distance around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s equator, and the other only
one-thirty-sixth around the planet. That makes them about 30,000
miles and 6,000 miles long, respectively, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said
they may prove longer upon closer examination.
   ``Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of
debris associated with nearby moons, or may be remnants of moons
that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
said.
   Scientists don't yet know if the ring arcs are made up of dust,
pebbles or boulders, or if the debris consists primarily of rock or
ice, said <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON>Brad Smith</PERSON>, who
heads the team analyzing photographs taken by the spacecraft.
   Researchers also don't know if the two partial rings found by
Voyager are among the three to six ring arcs that scientists
previously believed they detected from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but ``it would be
surprising if they weren't,'' he added.
   Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> has said <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> may
discover 50 to 100 partial rings orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   ``Astronomers have long suspected the existence of ... an
irregular ring system around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. ``Voyager's
photographs of the rings arcs are the first photographic evidence
that such a ring system exists.''
   The three to six previously suspected ring arcs were detected by
telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> passed in front of a distant star.
   <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s extensive rings are made mostly of marble-sized ice
pebbles, while Uranus' rings contain very dark boulders of unknown
composition, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is encircled by a single thin ring
and a sheet of fine dust, while <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> has some ring arcs in
addition to its rings, <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said
   Why does <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> have partial rather than complete rings?
   ``That's the <MONEY>$64,000</MONEY> question,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said. ``Rings come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, all the way from complete disks of
material like we've seen at <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, to narrow thin complete
ringlets like we've seen at Uranus. ... We believe the
gravitational influence of moons that orbit nearby give rings their
particular form.''
   Voyager 2 detected the 30,000-mile-long arc just outside the
orbit of one of the newly discovered moons, designated <DATE>1989</DATE> N4,
which orbits about 23,300 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. The 6,000-mile long
arc seems to trail about 50,000 miles behind moon <DATE>1989</DATE> N3, which
orbits about 17,000 miles above <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s cloudtops, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Magnetic Field Around Neptune Discovered By Voyager 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that
a magnetic field surrounds <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet is
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s
northern lights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to
determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, believed to be 17 to
18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
internal structure, said <PERSON>Mary Beth Murrill</PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Just as <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s magnetic field traps the Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> radiation
belts, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field also may help create radiation belts
around that planet. Scientists don't yet know if that poses a hazard
to Voyager 2's electronic components, <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said.
   Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 5.92 million miles
from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at
42,236 mph.
   The spacecraft was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>. Voyager 2 will make its closest
approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:59 p.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when it flies about
3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest
planet.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to the two discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, two partial rings, or ring arcs,
of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to
jet streams and giant cyclones on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Discovery of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field was confirmed <DATE>Friday</DATE> by
intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's
vicinity. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically
charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
field lines.
   ``Mercury, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic
fields, while <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Mars do not,'' the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. ``Whether <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION> has one
or not is unknown.
   ``A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines
that surround a planet,'' the agency said. ``Such fields are thought
to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. (<ORGANIZATION>Molten</ORGANIZATION> iron in
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s core, for example).''
   Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along
magnetic field lines toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s poles, creating the northern and
southern lights. A magnetic field at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> means that planet also
may have auroras, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s internal structure. Voyager project scientist <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>
has said he believes that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock
closer to the planet's center. That would mean that <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> _ like
neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings
to turn them dark in color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause
similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs,
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The nature of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s radio signal allowed scientists to
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said <PERSON>James Warwick</PERSON>, head
of Voyager's radio science team.
   ``The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur
in a limited range of frequency,'' <PERSON>Warwick</PERSON>, a scientist at <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Colo.-based Radiophysics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said in the release.
   Once <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> confirmed the existence of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in
data collected by Voyager as early as <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``Early analysis indicates <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic field is of an
intensity similar to the fields of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and Uranus,'' <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Murrill</PERSON> said scientists don't yet know how <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s magnetic
field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet
spins.
   Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the
planet's north rotational axis.

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to four more active ice volcanoes on
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager
2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the
fastest yet seen in the solar system.
   Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly
five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, ``chances are that there are a dozen of these things going
off globally'' at any time, said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, a planetary
scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>.
   Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced <DATE>Oct. 2</DATE>
after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its <DATE>Aug.
24-25</DATE> flight past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>.
   Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION>American Geophysical Union</ORGANIZATION>'s fall
meeting.
   <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is only the third world in the solar system known to have
active volcanism. The others are Earth and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, which
has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are
volcanoes on cloud-shrouded Venus.
   <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas
past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like
Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist
<ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION> told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere.
   ``These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the
previous record winds of 1,100 mph in <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s jet stream, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>
said. ``These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is
Mach 1.''
   The speed of sound on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is about 700 mph, depending on
temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s air.
   The clouds racing in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s winds could be seen in a movie
made by computer from still photographs taken by Voyager. Also
shown at <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>'s news conference was another computer movie
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar
system.
   The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts
back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud
also is visible.
   The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three
more plumes, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   When Voyager swept past <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> early <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE>, scientists saw
streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what
they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> announced it
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic
analysis of the photos.
   But the images were so fuzzy ``you had to take our word for
it,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   So <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> used a computer to overlap still photos taken from
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes.
   The causes of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s nitrogen ice volcanoes and <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s high
winds are mysterious.
   Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material
settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent
nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker
material beneath. But the heat cannot escape through the ice, so
some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build
until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark
material with it.
   Neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Scientists are
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot,
not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15
and 20 degrees south latitude, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in
the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is
needed to power high winds, he said.
   Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission
in which it flew past <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. The spacecraft
discovered six moons at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, bringing the total to eight, and
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30
times farther from the sun than <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA7 of July 5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said <PERSON>Edward
Stone</PERSON>, Voyager project scientist for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>, a physicist and vice president at the
<ORGANIZATION>California Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said <PERSON>Candice Hansen</PERSON>, a
planetary scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on <DATE>June 22</DATE> when it was
57.2 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, which called it ``the
best color photo of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE> close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot or <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and apparently on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and Caltech planetary
scientist <PERSON>Andrew Ingersoll</PERSON>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, he added.
   Stone said that on <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, and possibly <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere, said <PERSON>Rich Terrile</PERSON>, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' <PERSON>Terrile</PERSON> said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from <LOCATION>Cape
Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   They explored <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. Voyager 1 flew past <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE>, Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE> and will fly about 3,000 miles above
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole cloudtops at <TIME>9 p.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>.
   Five hours later it will encounter <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s backward-orbiting
moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>'s elongated orbit <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> will be the ninth and outermost
until <DATE>2007</DATE>.

VOYAGER 2 AIMS TO END TOUR IN GRAND FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grand Tour is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
The venerable Voyager 2 spacecraft is sailing through the back yard of the 
solar system at more than 42,000 m.p.h., closing in on the last encounter of 
the most incredible journey of all. 
</P>
<P>
The automated craft is plunging through an area nearly 3 billion miles away 
where no visitor from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> has ever been before, aiming toward a spectacular 
flight over the cloud tops of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 24</DATE>. No one has ever 
seen <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> other than as a ball of telescopic fuzz, but by the time Voyager 
is through, thousands of close-up photos and warehouses full of data will have 
been sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists will watch the encounter with rapture, knowing that nothing like 
this will happen again for decades, perhaps even centuries. 
</P>
<P>
For many years they will study the images and examine the data and rewrite the 
textbooks as Voyager 2 soars out into the Milky Way to wander among the stars, 
possibly forever. Its twin, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager 1</ORGANIZATION>, is already on its way to study emissions 
from distant stars, its journey to the planets completed. 
</P>
<P>
For most people, the fantastic flight of the <DATE>Voyagers will end later this month</DATE> 
when Voyager 2 whips past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and pays a quick visit to its extraordinary 
moon, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>. The spacecraft has already discovered four new moons, including 
three announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But the electronic camera that has allowed armchair scientists to tour the 
solar system's four outer planets will soon grow quiet, ending a 12-year 
odyssey that is without parallel. 
</P>
<P>
"The picture show will be over," said <PERSON>Edward C. Stone</PERSON>, vice president of 
<ORGANIZATION>Caltech</ORGANIZATION> and chief scientist on the Voyager project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fitting End 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter should be spectacular, and many of those final pictures 
will be shown live on television, providing a fitting end for a most unusual 
spacecraft. The one-ton Voyager is the most sophisticated robot ever built, 
composed of 65,000 parts, including an on-board computer that has the 
electronic circuitry equivalent to 2,000 color TV sets. In recent years, 
Voyager 2 has been electronically rebuilt by controllers at the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> as it sailed through the solar system, making 
photography possible under circumstances comparable to taking pictures in a 
dark cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The craft's computer is sophisticated enough for the Voyager to heal itself 
when trouble arises. It can even shut off important electronic parts during 
times of radiation peril, or freeze its orientation toward <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> if for some 
reason it appears in danger of drifting into a position where contact with 
<ORGANIZATION>Mission Control</ORGANIZATION> would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Stone expects the two Voyagers to send scientific data on the composition of 
interstellar space back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for another quarter of a century, but there 
will be no more Neptunes, no more moons like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Io with its potent 
volcanoes, no more mad dashes through the rings of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. It will be the 
middle of the 22nd Century before the outer planets once again present 
themselves in such an alignment that would make a similar mission possible. 
</P>
<P>
Neptune will grow ever dimmer as Voyager 2 dips below the ecliptic plane in 
which the planets travel around the sun, signaling the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sad Day 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sad," admitted <PERSON>Charles E. Kohlhase</PERSON>, who for the <DATE>last 14 years</DATE> 
has worried about every detail of the mission. As manager of the Voyager 
mission planning office at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>, Kohlhase well remembers the early days when he 
and his colleagues wondered among themselves: "Is this really going to work?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet work it did, "better than any of us expected," Stone observed. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of that fact was underscored by astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON>, a member 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s imaging team, during a recent speech to <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> employees. 
</P>
<P>
"This will surely be in the history books 1,000 years from now," <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Voyager is a unique event in solar system exploration," he added. "But an era 
is drawing to an end." 
</P>
<P>
The climax is not without peril, however. Even a small piece of dust could 
severely damage Voyager during its daringly close flyby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antenna Network 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, 38 different antennas on four continents 
will be used to receive transmissions from <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>. Many of them have been 
enlarged, and some have been tied together to form a network of antennas to 
monitor the weak signal. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of both Voyager missions is about <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>, according to 
Kohlhase. 
</P>
<P>
That means the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Tour</ORGANIZATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> 
likes to call it, has cost every American <MONEY>20 cents</MONEY> per year, he added. And in 
12 short years it has produced more information about the solar system than had 
been learned throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
Although this month will bring the end of the planetary odyssey, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will 
go out in spectacular form. Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
* <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is 2.71 billion miles away, so far that <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will be on its own 
throughout the close encounter. It will take four hours and six minutes for 
<ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s radio transmissions, traveling at 186,000 miles per second, to reach 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. That means that if an object should suddenly loom in <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>'s path as 
it zips past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> at 17 miles per second, the spacecraft would have hit it 
hours before ground controllers even learn of the danger. There will be no 
opportunity to correct its course from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
* Voyager is so distant that by the time its radio signal reaches Earth it will 
be reduced to the strength of only one ten-quadrillionth of a watt. That is 20 
billion times weaker than the power used to operate a digital wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
* The amount of sunlight that reaches <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is about 1,000 times less than 
that reaching <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, making it extremely difficult to capture clear images. So 
engineers have come up with a system that will allow the entire spacecraft to 
"nod" so that its camera can remain fixed on the target as the craft speeds 
past, permitting longer exposures. Each electronic image will be composed of 
more than 5 million bits of data, so as the craft whips past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> it will 
create a continuous string of data nearly 3 billion miles long, reaching back 
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
* Voyager will pass within 3,000 miles of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s north pole, closer than it 
has come to any other object in the solar system. That is, quite literally, 
right over the cloud tops. 
</P>
<P>
* <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s gravitational pull at that close range will change Voyager's course 
by 90 degrees, sending it off to encounter one of the strangest objects in the 
solar system <DATE>five hours later</DATE>. Voyager is to pass 24,000 miles from the surface 
of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which is about the size of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon but a very different body 
indeed. <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is the only large moon in the solar system that travels 
backwards, orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. 
Scientists think they know why, and Voyager should tell them if they are right. 
</P>
<P>
* By the time <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> passes <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, 11,000 man years will have been devoted 
to the mission, according to <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s Kohlhase. 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager program was initially funded to study only the planets <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>. Two spacecraft were provided so that if one failed, the other could 
complete the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager 2 was launched from the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> atop a Titan-Centaur 
rocket on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>. Sixteen days later Voyager 1 was launched on a shorter 
trajectory, so the second spacecraft arrived at the two planets first, reaching 
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>March 5, 1979</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Nov. 12, 1980</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voyager 1 Pays Price 
</P>
<P>
Voyager 1 passed close to the two planets while Voyager 2 remained at a safer 
distance. Both encounters by both spacecraft were an enormous success, but 
Voyager 1 paid a price -- it passed through an intense radiation belt 
surrounding <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, and several instruments aboard the craft were severely 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had been riding the spacecraft you would have received a lethal dose of 
radiation," <PERSON>Kohlhase</PERSON> said. In fact, he added, the amount of radiation would 
have been 1,000 times greater than humans can endure. 
</P>
<P>
So a somewhat crippled Voyager 1 was allowed to end its planetary sojourn and 
zip on out toward the stars. But Voyager 2 was still in excellent condition, 
just as it is all these years later, and mission planners at <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> did not want 
to let go. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> agreed to provide funding for the rest of the Grand Tour, and Voyager 2 
used the gravitational field of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> to fling itself out toward Uranus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Date With Miranda 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Jan. 24, 1986</DATE>, Voyager 2 zipped passed Uranus, but the planet itself ended 
up being upstaged by one of its moons, <LOCATION>Miranda</LOCATION>. Miranda, it turned out, had 
strange contours on its surface that to this day have not been fully explained. 
</P>
<P>
Like Uranus, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> may well end up playing second fiddle. The planet will 
appear bluish in color because of the methane in its atmosphere, and it will 
have more atmospheric texture than Uranus. But since it is essentially a huge 
ball of hydrogen and helium gas, there are no surface features to observe other 
than clouds. There will never be a "landing" on <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, because there is no 
land. 
</P>
<P>
But <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s largest moon, is another story entirely and it has 
fascinated scientists ever since it was discovered in <DATE>1846</DATE> -- just one month 
after <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> itself was detected. A smaller moon, <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION>, was discovered in 
<DATE>1949</DATE>, and Voyager has since found four more. That, however, is not very many 
moons compared to the other great planets, and that shortage has long troubled 
scientists because they can see no reason why <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> should have so few. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrong-Way Moon 
</P>
<P>
Once every 5.88 days, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> completes an orbit around <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, but it travels 
in the wrong direction. Moons form in the equatorial plane around planets, and 
in all other cases they move in the direction of the planet's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"When planets form they have a disk and small satellites, and small satellites 
orbit in the same direction as the planet," said <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION>, who has been the 
Voyager's chief scientist throughout the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Why is <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> traveling in the opposite direction in a cockeyed orbit that 
carries it far above and below the planet's equator? 
</P>
<P>
A team of Caltech scientists led by astrophysicist <PERSON>Peter Goldreich</PERSON> have argued 
that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is not a natural part of the Neptunian system at all and that the 
reddish-brown moon was actually a chunk of rock and ice wandering through the 
solar system that collided with one of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s moons. That spectacular 
collision would have destroyed the other satellite and sent <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> careening 
off on a very irregular orbit, so the argument goes. 
</P>
<P>
If <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> was a wandering "planetesimal" that collided with a Neptunian 
satellite, it would have entered a highly elliptical orbit, passing as close as 
five <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> radii from the planet and then moving out to more than 100 radii 
in an elongated orbit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping a Path 
</P>
<P>
That irregular orbit would have caused <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> to sweep through those altitudes, 
smashing into any other moons that happened to be in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> would have devoured the regular satellite system, other than those that 
are closer than about five radii," <PERSON>Goldreich</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s orbit would grow circular, but not before "almost any 
object in its path would have been destroyed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, which probably lasted up to a billion years, <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> would 
have been subjected to immense stresses due to the changes in <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s 
gravitational pull as the moon plunged close to the planet, and then zipped 
far, far away. The stresses, called "tidal forces," would have been great 
enough to liquefy the core of the satellite, and possibly its surface. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager should reveal whether this theory is true, according to both <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> and 
<PERSON>Goldreich</PERSON>. Furthermore, anyone who follows <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION>'s discoveries during <DATE>August</DATE> 
will have a chance to test the theory for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test of Theory 
</P>
<P>
If that scenario is correct, Voyager should not find new moons between five and 
100 radii of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>. The four that have been discovered so far are in orbits 
close to the planet and would not have been affected by <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s grand sweep. 
</P>
<P>
It would be an immense problem for the theory if Voyager discovered a lot of 
moons in the area that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> should have swept clear, but at this point that 
appears improbable. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> was liquefied during the time when it would have been 
sweeping up other moons, there should be far fewer craters on its surface than 
on other moons throughout the solar system. Thus the surface of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> should 
be reasonably smooth, although some cratering could have occurred after the 
surface hardened. 
</P>
<P>
If the surface of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is indeed much smoother than the surface of the 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s moon, and if a spate of new moons are not discovered beyond five radii, 
chalk one up for the theorists and think of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> as a captured wanderer. 
</P>
<P>
But if <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> is heavily cratered and many other moons are discovered circling 
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, scratch <PERSON>Goldreich</PERSON>, et al., and look for another explanation for 
<ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>'s peculiarities. That, however, is considered unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than a Rock 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is right, Voyager's view of <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> should be sensational. 
Evidence suggests that <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION> has pools of frozen nitrogen on its surface, so 
this should not be just a dull hunk of rock orbiting a distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> has to get there and, despite its success record over 
the <DATE>last 12 years</DATE>, the rest of the journey is not without hazards. Scientists 
believe there should be little debris in <LOCATION>Voyager</LOCATION>'s path. But no one can be 
absolutely certain of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We are barreling in there really close," said <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION>'s Kohlhase. "We think we are 
outside the rings, and above the atmosphere. But are we going to make it? Are 
we running out of good fortune?" 
</P>
<P>
Only Voyager knows for sure.
