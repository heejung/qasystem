<TEXT>     Her neighborhood was leveled. The Tolentinos and 100 other poor families
along the <LOCATION>Albacan River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in
the shadow of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>, lost their homes <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in mudslides and
floods brought on by the volcano's powerful eruption.;    One resident, an
elderly man, drowned in the torrent of thick volcanic ash and rainwater.;   
Because of impassable roads and downed telephone lines, it was still
impossible <DATE>Monday</DATE> to determine the extent of the damage.;    The death toll
from the eruptions of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>, combined with a series of earthquakes
and torrential rains, increased to more than 200, according to Philippine
television. The <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> said at least 101 people had been
killed.;    The government estimated damage to property and crops at about
<MONEY>$200 million.</MONEY>;    Most of the deaths occurred when houses and other buildings
collapsed under the weight of as much as eight inches of ash and sand spewed
from the rumbling crater.;    Hundreds of people across the island of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>
were reported missing, while hundreds of thousands of others have been left
homeless.;    As many as 150,000 people fleeing the volcano were said to be
crowding into evacuation centers <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, the capital, about 50
miles south of the volcano.;    Volcano scientists continued to express a
careful optimism. <PERSON>Raymondo Punongbayan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute
of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology, said in an interview that while the volcano
remained a threat, the eruptions were "simmering down" and "significant,
critical eruptions are probably over.";    <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>'s domestic and international
airports were scheduled to reopen <DATE>today</DATE>, three days after they were closed
because of concern that ash from the volcano would damage jet engines.;   
Despite the optimism from scientists, however, the exodus of families fleeing
the volcano area continued late <DATE>Monday</DATE> as buses and trucks caked with gray ash
jammed roads leading into <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>. The government has set up more than 100
makeshift shelters in churches, schools, army camps and gymnasiums in the
capital.;    In the wake of the eruptions, Filipinos are facing monumental
tasks. Food and clean drinking water were running low in the central and
southwestern portions of the main <LOCATION>Luzon island</LOCATION>, which bore the brunt of the
volcano's week of fury.;    <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION> was without electricity <DATE>Monday</DATE> and so many
stores and gasoline stations were closed that it was difficult to find food
and fuel.;    Dozens of angry residents stormed a row of food shops in the
city's market, forced open the doors with crowbars and carted away canned
goods and other items, police and witnesses said.;    "We will die of hunger
if we don't do this," one of the looters said.;    Fifteen people were
arrested after more than 100 pigs were stolen from a farm near <LOCATION>Angeles.</LOCATION>;   
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> military officials said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that they were stepping up the
evacuation of 20,000 Americans, including the dependents of all employees at
the two huge U.S.-operated military bases, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Subic Bay.</LOCATION>;    <ORGANIZATION>Seven Navy</ORGANIZATION>
ships sailed <DATE>Monday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>, 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, with 6,200
dependents.;    "It's about time we left," said <PERSON>Lisa Hedland</PERSON>, wife of an <ORGANIZATION>Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> sergeant, as she prepared to board the cruiser <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> with her
15-month-old daughter. "It's been horrible this past week.";    The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> said
a battle group led by the aircraft carrier <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> was on the way to
<LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> to pick up 5,000 more Americans.;    For most Filipinos fleeing the
volcano, the journey to safety was less orderly and far more difficult.;   
"We have nothing except the clothes we are wearing," said <PERSON>Solidad Santiago</PERSON>, a
41-year-old laundry worker from <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, who fled to a <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> evacuation
center <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with most but not all of her family.;    "Our house collapsed
because of the volcano," said <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>, a widow, whose face showed signs of
the wrenching fear of the past week. "My oldest son stayed behind to try to
guard our possessions.;    "He should be here by now," she said. "I have gone
on the public address system here and called his name, but there is never any
response. I am very concerned. I pray he is safe.";    <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION> and her family
were among nearly 5,000 refugees who crowded <DATE>Monday</DATE> into the shaded bleachers
of a <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> sports stadium that is being used as an evacuation center.;    The
evacuees were provided with food -- mostly sausages, rice and crackers donated
by local businesses.;    "We have lost everything, but still I am happy, happy
to be here," said <PERSON>Romayo Garcia</PERSON>, a 29-year-old mason, whose house near the
now-evacuated <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, about 10 miles east of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>, had
collapsed from the weight of volcanic ash.;    "The rocks were as big as
this," he said, bringing together his thumbs and index fingers to make a
circle five inches wide. "It was impossible to walk. People panicked. We had

<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; PHILIPPINES; WEATHER; CHANGE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly 19 miles high today in the
biggest eruption since it came to life this week. An approaching typhoon
threatened to trigger mudflows down the volcano.;    After sunset the volcano
erupted again, lighting up the night sky. Two streams of orange, glowing
material flowed from the crater.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEW THREAT: TYPHOON
IT MAY TRIGGER MUDFLOWS AS PHILIPPINE VOLCANO
ERUPTS AGAIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Scientists initially thought it was the first flow of lava in a week of
eruptions. But <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology, said the glow was actually an "incandescent
pyroclastic flow," hot gases, stones and ash that travel at high speeds and
are an even greater threat than lava.;    As if the volcano were not enough,
the <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> weather bureau reported <DATE>today</DATE> that a typhoon was headed for the
eastern coast of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION> island with maximum winds of 110 miles per hour.;   
Typhoon <PERSON>Yunya</PERSON> was expected to come ashore late <DATE>Saturday</DATE> or <DATE>Sunday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Baler</LOCATION>,
90 miles northeast of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>. Heavy rain began falling today in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>
and central Luzon.;    If the typhoon brings more rain, scientists fear it
will unleash mudflows -- giant rivers of earth, boulders and debris fused
together with sticky volcanic ash.;    <PERSON>Kelvin Rodolfo</PERSON>, a Filipino-American
geology professor from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Illinois-Chicago</ORGANIZATION>, said mudflows
represented one of the most serious dangers from <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> because they
could bury towns and settlements quickly under tons of debris.;    At least
four people died; four were missing and 24 injured since <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> began
erupting <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after being dormant for 600 years, officials said. About
79,000 people, including 15,000 Americans, have been evacuated.;    The
thunderous explosions today spewed ash over a wide area, including the
evacuated <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> 10 miles east of the volcano and <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> naval base
25 miles to the southwest, where the <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> personnel are being temporarily
housed.;    At <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, the remaining 1,500 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> service members guarding the
installation donned goggles and surgical masks.;    The mayor of <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Richard Gordon</PERSON>, urged residents to stay indoors because ash was falling like a
hailstorm and had accumulated up to three inches deep. Subic Bay naval base is
located next to Olongapo.;    The volcano's fallout made the town look "like
nighttime" in midafternoon, correspondent <PERSON>Louella Vizcocho</PERSON> said by telephone.;
   <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> had been calm more than 24 hours after a major eruption
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> that shot ash more than 15 miles high, but scientists had
said pressure was intensifying within the 4,795-foot volcano.;    Then at
least four blasts within 2 1/2 hours of each other occurred today, sending ash
nearly 19 miles high.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and
<PERSON>Seismology</PERSON> said the fourth blast was the largest of 10 eruptions since
Sunday.;    During the evening eruption, seismologist <PERSON>Julio Sabit</PERSON> said the sky
darkened and then dramatically lit up.;    "The fireworks of Pinatubo began,"
the excited <PERSON>Sabit</PERSON> said by radio.;    Radio reporters at the scene said the
spectacle cast a gentle, orange glow over the summit of the volcano. "It's
very beautiful," reporter <PERSON>Vic Lima</PERSON> said. "There's a stream of orange flow on
the two sides of the volcano.";    About 64,000 people have been evacuated,
most of them since major eruptions began on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. Food was reported
running low at refugee camps.;    Police said 12 people have been arrested for
allegedly looting parts of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, which nearly 15,000 Americans and
their families evacuated <DATE>last Monday.</DATE>;    Many of the Americans expressed
concern for the safety of their belongings, but <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officials assured
them that the 1,500 security guards would be sufficient to protect homes and
barracks.;    <ORGANIZATION>The Office of Civil Defense</ORGANIZATION> said that at least four people have
been killed in eruptions this week. Unofficial reports by local officials and
survivors put the death toll at 10.;    Rescue agencies said they were still
trying to confirm the unofficial reports and some or all of these may be added
to official counts later.;    At least 24 people were injured and four were
missing, the civil defense agency said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than

debris from the jagged slopes.;    Seven explosions were recorded from the
4,800-foot tropical volcano today, and scientists said more were expected.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Typhoon Yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of
<LOCATION>Luzon island</LOCATION>, which includes Mount Pinatubo, early in the day. But it quickly
weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered
about 70 miles east of the volcano.;    Still, heavy rains churned up by the
typhoon drenched <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> and the provinces near the volcano, raising fears of
mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away.;    Meanwhile,
President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON> dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans
had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages
nuclear storage sites at <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, abandoned <DATE>Monday</DATE> by nearly 15,000
Americans.;    The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000
Americans who crowded onto <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</LOCATION> as a bizarre tropical blizzard
of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base <DATE>Friday</DATE> during a
third day of increasingly violent eruptions of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo.</LOCATION>;    Showers of
'mud drops';  "It looks like it's snowing outside," said military spokeswoman
Capt. <PERSON>Kim Urie</PERSON>. Headlights and street lamps were turned on at midafternoon as
a "dark, black cloud" passed over the giant <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> base and dropped a gritty
rain of "mud drops," she said.;    At least four people have died, 24 have
been hurt and four have been listed as missing since <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> began erupting
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, after lying dormant for six centuries, officials said. About 84,000
people, including Americans, have been evacuated.;    Police said 12 people
had been arrested for looting at Clark.;    Five explosions shook the mountain
<DATE>early today</DATE>, showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular
pre-dawn display of nature's fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and
rain.;    <DATE>Friday</DATE>, eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam
nearly 19 miles high.;    <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s eruptions hurled ash over <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, 10 miles
east of the volcano, and <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, 25 miles southwest, where the <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> personnel
had been temporarily housed. Gray ash also fell in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, 60 miles south.;   
At <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, base spokesman <PERSON>Robert Coble</PERSON> said generators had to be shut down from
time to time to clean out volcanic ash, plunging the base into darkness.;   
River temperatures rising;  Temperatures in local rivers were rising because
of the volcanic debris, officials said.;    After sunset, the volcano spewed
two streams of orange, glowing material from its crater in what scientists
thought was the first appearance of lava during the weeklong eruptions.;   
<PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and
Seismology, said <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest
since <ORGANIZATION>Mount Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> awoke <DATE>Sunday</DATE> from its 600-year slumber.;    A British
newspaper, the Guardian, reported <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that the Americans declared a
nuclear alert at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and informed governments in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> that "a nuclear accident in the region was possible." But <PERSON>Aquino</PERSON>
told reporters the story was "baseless and purely fabricated.";    The <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the
<LOCATION>Philippines.</LOCATION>;    Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Raul Manglapus</PERSON> also said the eruption
should have no effect on talks on the future of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, where leases
expire <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE>. The talks are deadlocked over compensation and the duration
of a new agreement.;    <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> could remain active
for years if it follows the pattern of similar Philippine volcanoes. That
would leave <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> unusable.  </TEXT>

mess.";    The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> said all 20,000 military family members have now
left <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION>. The naval base's population swelled by nearly 15,000 when the <ORGANIZATION>Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> evacuated troops and dependents from <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>June 10</DATE> after the
nearby volcano began erupting for the first time in more than 600 years.;   
An <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON>Wayne Crist</PERSON>, also announced that 4,500 air

that would reduce <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> troops by more than 60 percent.;    At <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, 10
miles east of the volcano, people who toured the base <DATE>today</DATE> said flows of hot
rocks, gas and other volcanic debris had reached within 300 feet of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Mactan</LOCATION> housing area. The flow was still smoking today.;    <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> was
quiet after seven small ash eruptions <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, but a government expert said
tremors suggest eruptions could occur.;    "We are recognizing some long
tremor periods and earthquakes, and this means that some magma is again moving
to the surface," said <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology.;    He said it was impossible to
predict when new eruptions could begin.;    Many Filipinos who had returned to
their homes after the volcano quieted down began leaving again today, worried
by the eruption prediction and fearing heavy rains may unleash tons of debris
from the volcano's slopes.;    Two weeks of eruptions on the 4,795-foot
volcano, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, has claimed at least 268 lives.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Rivers</ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION> were reported rising today as volcanic ash washed into

dead.;    <PERSON>Roy David</PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION>Porac</LOCATION> west of <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, said he had urged
residents who fled to evacuation centers not to return home because of the

<LEADPARA>  About 15,000 U.S. service members, dependents and civilians were ordered early
today to evacuate Clark Air Base, one of the largest U.S. bases overseas,
after a Philippine volcano dormant for six centuries began exploding with
searing gases, thick ash and deadly debris.;    Lt. Col. Ron Rand, a spokesman
at Clark, announced at 5 a.m. that all non-essential personnel should begin
evacuating the sprawling base as dawn skies over central Luzon were filled
with gray ash and steam from eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, about 10 miles away
in central Luzon.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Rand said that Americans who live on or near the base would drive or be
bused to the U.S-operated <ORGANIZATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</ORGANIZATION>, about an hour's drive to the
southwest. The evacuation was to take four hours, he said.;    There was no
indication how long the Americans would stay, but they were ordered to take
along important papers and three days worth of food, water and clothing.;   
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> officials earlier had ordered the evacuation of more than 11,000
people from about 20 villages near the volcano, about 60 miles northwest of
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, after a series of small eruptions began <DATE>Friday</DATE>. No injuries were
reported over the weekend.;    <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>, director of the
<ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology, said, however, that two
moderate eruptions shortly before <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> appeared to signal a larger
explosion.;    "We're expecting a major eruption," he said in a telephone
interview early today. "We're just at the beginning stage of eruptions. We're
expecting many, many more.";    <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said that the 4,795-foot-high
volcano was spewing gases up to 1,800 degrees, thick black ash, boulders and
rock fragments in two fast-moving streams from two vents on the western side
of the lower summit.;    "It's very dangerous," he said. "Anything along its
path will be destroyed.";    Clouds and ashes;  <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s eruptions sent a
dense cloud of steam and ash billowing thousands of feet above rice paddies
that are lush green from an impending harvest. Heavy black clouds shrouded the
mountain, and a blanket of gray ash covered nearby fields. Debris reportedly
was sprayed as far as the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION>, 20 miles to the west.;    Villagers
from a 12-mile radius of the mountain fled the area on foot and water buffalo,
and aboard crowded trucks and jitneys. The <ORGANIZATION>Philippines Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> said 11,024
people, including local Aeta aborigines, were evacuated to 18 disaster relief
centers set up at area schools, but officials said that many villagers stayed
behind to protect their animals and farms from looters.;    <PERSON>Rand</PERSON> said the
evacuation of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> was ordered "due to a slight increase of volcanic
activity" overnight. All <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> planes had moved from the base to <ORGANIZATION>Cubi
Point Naval Air Station</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and infants in the base's
neo-natal hospital and other patients had been flown out.;    Evacuation
rehearsal;  All military personnel at <LOCATION>Clark</LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION>13th Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, were
recalled to the base <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials ordered local
Americans to pack bags and rehearse evacuation procedures.;    "People are
pretty calm," said one American woman who lives on the base. "People are
prepared.";    <ORGANIZATION>Rand</ORGANIZATION> said that a minimal number of troops would remain at <ORGANIZATION>Clark</ORGANIZATION>
to guard the facility and maintain essential services. Marines from <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> as
well as <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military police were deployed along the road to
provide security.;    The volcano began showing signs of activity in <DATE>April</DATE> for
the first time in 600 years, and last week it began belching small amounts of
steam and smoke. Seismologists reported a marked increase in volcanic tremors
last week, with intense seismic quakes on the mountain Friday.;     Last
eruption;  Mount Pinatubo last erupted in <DATE>1380</DATE>, 141 years before <PERSON>Ferdinand
Magellan</PERSON>, a Portuguese explorer flying the flag of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, first reached the
islands in search of spices.;    There are about 21 active and 200 dormant
volcanoes in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, which sits on the "Ring of Fire" that circles
the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>. Scientists said there was no connection, however, to the
eruption last <DATE>Monday</DATE> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Unzen</LOCATION>, which killed at least 37 people
on <LOCATION>Kyushu Island</LOCATION>. A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris erupted there <DATE>Saturday</DATE>,
setting 73 homes on fire.;    Nearly 10,000 people have left their homes at
the foot of <LOCATION>Mount Unzen</LOCATION>, and two naval ships stood by to take residents
farther away in case a new eruption sent lava, hot rocks and ash over a yet
wider area.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week
after six centuries of dormancy. No casualties have been reported, but experts
are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon.;    Gases, ash and
molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in
thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Seismology</PERSON> said it detected rhythmic ground
movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of
the craters.;    Institute Director <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Mount Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>
was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."; 
  He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600
years ago, the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark.;
   <ORGANIZATION>Rains</ORGANIZATION> fell across the area <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, and officials warned residents in
the lush, green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to
escape mud flows.;    <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON>Ron Rand</PERSON> announced the
evacuation in a <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> broadcast over the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military's <LOCATION>Far East Network</LOCATION>. An
hour later, the first vehicles began rolling out of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> for the <LOCATION>U.S.-run
Subic Bay</LOCATION> naval base, where the 14,500 troops, dependents and civilian
employees will be housed until the danger passes. Another 1,500 troops
remained at <LOCATION>Clark</LOCATION> to provide security.;    The <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> command center operated
with a skeletal crew, but the base's operations were suspended. The base is a
major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the <ORGANIZATION>Military
Airlift Command.</ORGANIZATION>;    The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading
to <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, about 50 miles southwest of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Marines</ORGANIZATION> patrolled the
highways, which pass through areas where Communist guerrillas operate, and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> helicopters hovered overhead.;    By <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said
all the evacuees had reached Subic.;    "If it's going to blow, I hope it does
it fast so I can go home before the cockroaches take my house," said Staff
Sgt. <PERSON>Mike Huffman.</PERSON>;    <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, a city of more than
300,000 people about 50 miles north of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, residents reported
no ash fell <DATE>today</DATE> but said the air smelled of sulfur.;    In southern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>
today, <ORGANIZATION>Mount Unzen</ORGANIZATION> continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks, and heavy
rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week,
raising fears of deadly mudslides.;    Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano
covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against
possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police
said.;    An explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks from the mountain
one week ago claimed 38 lives, and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens
more homes. In all, about 9,800 people have been evacuated from communities at
the foot of the mountain, said police in <LOCATION>Nagasaki</LOCATION>, 30 miles away.;    <LOCATION>Mount
Unzen</LOCATION> and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>
where shifting plates of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s crust push against each other, triggering
periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.;    In the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, officials
have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces since <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>
began erupting last week. About 3,100 of them are primitive Aeta tribes people
who lived on <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s slopes.;    Many of them walked or traveled by ox cart
to flee the volcano. But reporters found that some evacuees are returning to
their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to
evacuation centers at sundown.;    <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said he flew to the area and
warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins.; 
  There was no indication how long the Americans evacuated from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> would
stay at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, but they were ordered to take along important papers and food,
water and clothing for three days.;    <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION> base spokesman <PERSON>Bob Coble</PERSON> said
families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that
others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters.;    <LOCATION>Mount
Pinatubo</LOCATION>, which last had a major eruption in <DATE>1380</DATE>, began to show signs of
activity in <DATE>April</DATE>. Last week, it belched small amounts of steam and ash.;   
There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. The
last major eruption occurred in <DATE>1965</DATE>, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles
south of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, exploded. About 200 people were killed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo erupted with six thundering explosions today, shooting a giant
plume of ash 15 miles high. Molten rock and hot gas poured from the volcano,
and nearby residents fled in panic.;    A Filipino serving with the U.S. Navy
became the first reported fatality related to the eruption when his car
collided with a bus on an ash-slicked road north of the Subic Bay naval base.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Residents of nearby Angeles panicked when a huge, gray-greenish mushroom
cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night. Thousands of fleeing
people packed roads.;    "Stones as big as my head were falling down from the
mountains," said <PERSON>Rolly Soria</PERSON>, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said
<PERSON>Manuel Romualdo</PERSON>. "Children were crying. We had to grab whatever we could.";   
Scientists warned of more, possibly larger eruptions from the 4,795-foot
volcano, which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in
April.;    "This could be only the beginning," said <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology.;   
<LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, but authorities had
not ordered a general evacuation there.;    Hundreds of Americans fled <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>,
home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most of the
base's residents had been evacuated <DATE>Monday</DATE>. The base did not appear
immediately threatened by volcanic flow.;    Seismologists said searing gas,
ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountain's western and
northern slopes. They said most of the debris flowed into the <PERSON>Marella</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Maraunot</PERSON> and <PERSON>O'Donnell</PERSON> rivers and that there had been no reports that property
or homes had been damaged.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman, descendants of the
original inhabitants of the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, fled the slopes of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo.</LOCATION>;  
 At a refugee center in <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors
told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed
by a rain of ash.;    They said they scampered for safety with their
belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall, many wearing
cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by
the eruption," television reporter <PERSON>Bert Basa</PERSON> said. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights and
windshield wipers on.;    A photographer who circled the volcano in an
airplane said an aerial gunnery range at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> was covered with ash, as were
mountains in the <LOCATION>Zambales</LOCATION> range, normally lush, green tropical peaks.;   
Today's first eruption began at <TIME>8:40 a.m.</TIME> with a tremendous blast that sent
forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes
later and a third, smaller blast at <TIME>11:49 a.m.</TIME>;    The huge plume could be
seen in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene said it
blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the <LOCATION>South China Sea.</LOCATION>;   
Two more thundering explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo late today.;    The
<ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Seismology</PERSON> said the explosions
occurred at <TIME>10:52 p.m. and 11:05 p.m</TIME>. The second explosion sent a plume of ash
and steam 80,000 feet into the sky.;    Shortly after <TIME>midnight</TIME>, a sixth
explosion was reported.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of
built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The
crisis has not ended yet," said <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology. "We have signs that the volcano is preparing for
another one.";    <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> warned people within a 15-mile radius of
Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the
sky," television reporter <PERSON>Gus Abelgas</PERSON> said in a broadcast from <LOCATION>Botolan</LOCATION>, near
the volcano's western slopes. He said strong tremors preceded the nighttime
eruptions and continued afterward.;    President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON> visited
refugee centers near <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION> briefly before returning to <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> for
independence day celebrations.;    The Americans who fled <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> with a few
belongings <DATE>Monday</DATE> moved in with sailors and their families at <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> naval
base, 50 miles to the southwest.;    <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is one of the biggest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases
overseas. <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that the site was in the path of the
volcanic flow from <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> during its last major eruption, in 1380.;   
About 19,000 Filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near
the volcano's slopes and were housed in 25 makeshift evacuation centers
outside the projected danger zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated
after today's eruption.;    About 10 people in <LOCATION>Moraza</LOCATION>, a village on the
western slope of the mountain, were refusing to leave, relief officials said.
They told rescuers that they would not leave their livestock and if the
animals die, "we will die with them.";    On <DATE>April 2</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> produced a
small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water meeting hot rocks
deep inside. On <DATE>June 3</DATE>, the volcano spewed ash in a mild eruption.;    That
same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> erupted with an explosion of
superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    Experts say there
is apparently no connection between <LOCATION>Unzen</LOCATION> and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1965</DATE>. That explosion
killed about 200 people.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  U.S. officials Sunday launched an emergency evacuation to the United States of
about 20,000 military dependents and civilian workers from two strategic bases
after a deadly 36-hour string of eruptions at Mount Pinatubo.;    At least 76
people have been killed since the volcano began erupting June 9 for the first
time in 600 years, the Red Cross said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The first 900 of the evacuees boarded <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> warships <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Subic Bay
Naval Station</LOCATION> and departed for <ORGANIZATION>Cebu</ORGANIZATION>, a southern Philippine city about 350
miles from <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, where they were scheduled to board planes for the <ORGANIZATION>United
States.</ORGANIZATION>;    Even as the evacuation order was issued, Philippine volcano
scientists said that the worst of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>'s eruptions may be over,
despite a prediction <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that the volcano was on the verge of a major
explosion.;    The scientists said that much of the pressure built up in the
volcano had dissipated this <DATE>weekend</DATE> in the emission of vast clouds of ash and
rock that turned day to night across the island of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>, and in a series of
earthquakes, including one that rocked skyscrapers in downtown <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> on
Sunday.;    The ash combined with rain from a tropical storm <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and left
a slippery glaze on buildings and roads as far away as <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, about 50 miles
south of the volcano.;    Panicked residents of villages close to the volcano
trudged on foot through knee-deep ash <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to escape the rumbling volcano.
Mudslides washed out bridges, clogged highways and caused hundreds of homes to
collapse.;    The international and domestic airports in the capital remained
closed <DATE>Sunday</DATE> out of concern that the ash would damage jet engines.;    Last
week, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> announced that about 7,000 dependents of military and
civilian workers at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-run Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> would be evacuated from the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, one of the largest American military
bases outside the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, is 10 miles east of the volcano and has been
shut down since last Monday.;    <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s expanded evacuation order includes
all civilian workers at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and at <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>, as well as all dependents from
both installations.;    "The only ones left will be uniformed <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> or Marine personnel," said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON>Kevin Mukri</PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION>.
"You'll have to be in uniform to stay.";    Workers to remain at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>;   
Military officials said that about 12,000 uniformed military workers were
stationed at the bases before the volcano erupted, and that most would remain
behind at <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION> while their families and the civilian employees left the
<LOCATION>Philippines.</LOCATION>;    Virtually all of the 16,000 base workers at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and their
family members were evacuated to <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> <DATE>last week.</DATE>;    The chief spokesman
at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Stanley Schrager</PERSON>, said the evacuation had been
ordered because "it's just untenable to have 30,000 people at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, double
the ordinary population, especially given the uncertainty over the volcano and
over the future of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> as to when these people would be able to go home.";  
 On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> looked like a vast moonscape, with about six inches of
concrete-like volcanic ash covering roads, roofs and runways. Ragged scrubland
and manicured lawns had the same bleak blanket of hard gray crust.;    'A
wasteland';    "Everything looks like a wasteland," said Philippine Brig. Gen.
<PERSON>Leopoldo Acot Jr.</PERSON>, commander of about 150 Philippine troops guarding the
nearly deserted base.;    On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, volcanic ash and a hail of inch-long
pebbles emitted by <ORGANIZATION>Mount Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> shut down operations at <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> and
damaged about 100 buildings, half of them seriously.;    Two people -- a
9-year-old American girl and a Filipino -- were reported killed late <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
when the roof of their shelter at <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION> collapsed under the weight of the
ash.;    "We don't have snow here, and the roofs are not designed to hold
anything," <PERSON>Mukri</PERSON> said. "You get an event like this only about every 600 years.
It's not something you plan for.";    In the city of <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>
base, eight people were reported killed when the roof of a hospital collapsed
late <DATE>Saturday</DATE> because of ash deposits. Six people died when a church collapsed
in <LOCATION>Dau</LOCATION>, near Clark.;    Readiness unaffected;    <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said the
evacuation of base workers from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and Subic would not affect military
readiness in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. All jet fighters had been withdrawn from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> in
recent months as a result of a global redeployment of forces by the Pentagon.;
   But the volcano is expected to affect the final round of negotiations
between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> over an extension of the joint
lease for the two bases, which expires in <DATE>September</DATE>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials say <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>
may not be able to assume normal operations for months, if not years.;   
There appears to be no similar doubt about the future of <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, which could
reopen fully within the next few weeks.;    Philippine scientists said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
it appeared that a section of the crater on <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> had collapsed on
itself, releasing pressure that might otherwise have produced a cataclysmic
avalanche of molten rock.;    Forecast withdrawn;  On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine
Institute of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology had predicted such an explosion after
obtaining satellite photos showing a nearly two-mile fissure along the
southern edge on the volcano. But <DATE>Sunday</DATE> it withdrew the ominous forecast.;   
The evacuation from <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> began <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, when 900 Americans, mostly
wives and children from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, boarded the cruiser <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and two frigates,
the <PERSON>Rodney M. Davies</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Kurtz</PERSON>, bound for Cebu.;    Military officials
said the evacuees would probably be flown by chartered jets from the
international airport at <LOCATION>Cebu</LOCATION> to an American air base on <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>, and, from
there, to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Plans to evacuate the Americans by plane from the
<ORGANIZATION>Cubi Point</ORGANIZATION> naval air station, which adjoins <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>, were foiled by the
ash.;    The aircraft carrier USS <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>, leading a battle group out
of <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> on the way to the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>, is to assist in the evacuation,
which is expected to last a week to 10 days, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Once the United States' largest overseas air base, this strategic military
installation may be crippled permanently, U.S. officials said Sunday as damage
reports continued to increase from last week's devastating eruption of Mount
Pinatubo.;    A six-hour tour of Clark showed that the eruption spewed a
deadly torrent of superheated gas, rocks and mud up to 20 feet high down a
river valley only a few hundred yards behind an officers' housing complex and
elementary school. It also sent waist-deep mud and swirling water across parts
of the base, damaging the hospital and washing cars and trucks away.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VOLCANO DAMAGE RAISES DOUBTS U.S. CAN USE
AIR BASE AGAIN
ERUPTIONS COULD CONTINUE FOR 3 YEARS, SCIENTISTS
SAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At least 30 huge aircraft hangers, warehouses, a gymnasium and other
buildings were crushed from heavy gray ash that blankets runways, roads and
rooftops up to a foot deep in places. Falling trees damaged homes, a school
and other structures.;    With 10 new volcanic explosions <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, new ash
continues to rain down on <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, only 8.6 miles away. Worse, scientists say
<ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> may remain active and dangerous for up to three years, spewing
volcanic debris that endangers lives, threatens aircraft and fouls sensitive
communications equipment.;    "It'll take a long time to get <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> back and
operating, if ever," <PERSON>Stanley Schrager</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>,
said Sunday.;    Lt. Col. <PERSON>Ron Rand</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> spokesman, said it was not clear
whether the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> ever could use runways and fly so close to an erupting
volcano. The ash is much finer than the desert sand that pilots overcame
during the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> war.;    Moreover, the giant "pyroclastic flow" of
searing gas, steam and mud that roared at least 10 miles down the <LOCATION>Sacobia
River</LOCATION>, a short walk behind dozens of now ash-covered homes, broken trees and
the partially collapsed <ORGANIZATION>Grissom Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Mactan</LOCATION> housing
complex, indicates that the base is directly endangered by future eruptions.; 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> temporarily has transferred some of the base's essential
operations -- including training, airlift capability and special operations --
to other bases in the <LOCATION>Western Pacific</LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION>.
Officials say the transfers may become permanent if the base is deemed
inoperable.;    No precise figures are available, but damage and cleanup from
the <DATE>June 15</DATE> eruption is likely to cost <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY> at
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and the equally stricken <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</LOCATION> and dockyard, where more
than 122 buildings were badly damaged or destroyed.;    <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION>'s activities may
be temporarily relocated as well, officials said, but no decision has been
made yet. Subic is less likely to close permanently, however, since its ship
repair, refueling and resupply facilities are easier to maintain.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo spewed a deadly cloud of ash and gas more than 15 1/2 miles
high today after a turbulent night in which the volcano shook with the most
intense fury since it awoke from six centuries of sleep.;    "What we are
seeing now are phenomenal eruptions," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of
the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. "The story of Mount
Pinatubo is not quite over yet."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ASH AND GAS ARE SPEWED IN 'PHENOMENAL' ERUPTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Two deaths reported;  Two deaths have been reported from the eruptions,
which began Sunday.;    A Filipino serving in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> was killed
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when his car skidded on an ash-slickened road north of the <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>
naval base, 30 miles southwest of the volcano, and crashed into a bus.;    A
member of the Aeta tribe that lives on the slopes of <LOCATION>Pinatubo</LOCATION>, said he saw his
uncle die in an eruption <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. There was no official confirmation, but
the man himself was badly burned.;    The latest eruption occurred at <TIME>8:41
a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> and lasted for a half hour. It unleashed giant mudflows down the
jagged, ash-covered western slopes of the 4,795-foot mountain and into the
<LOCATION>Marella River.</LOCATION>;    The eruption sent a gray avalanche of deadly ash, gases and
molten rock down the slopes. The billowing ash cloud above turned day to
dusk.;    Debris from the eruption covered the roads, and huge boulders, some
the size of cars, littered gullies and riverbeds.;    Ash fell as far as
<LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>, 25 miles to the southwest.;    Aviation authorities warned airline
pilots to avoid flying near the volcano after a <ORGANIZATION>Saudi Airlines</ORGANIZATION> 747 developed
engine trouble <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> when it passed near the ash cloud en route to <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>
from Dhahran.;    The plane landed safely and an inspection showed volcanic
ash in the engines, according to air controller <ORGANIZATION>Roserene Reyes.</ORGANIZATION>;    Today's
eruption followed a violent night in which the volcano exploded with a fury,
first at <TIME>10:52 p.m.</TIME>, then again a short time later and a third time at <TIME>12:04
a.m.</TIME> today.;    "This is already the big bang," <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said. "I can't see
any other eruption that will exceed this. What we are seeing now are
phenomenal eruptions.";    Another seismologist with the institute, <PERSON>Delfin
Garcia</PERSON>, said the volcano was entering "an episode of big eruptions" that would
continue indefinitely.;    <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s eruptions began at <TIME>8:40 a.m.</TIME> with a
tremendous blast that sent forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second
explosion a few minutes later and a third, smaller blast at <TIME>11:49 a.m.</TIME>;   
After the nighttime eruptions, the troops that remained at nearby <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air
Base</ORGANIZATION>, from which most personnel were evacuated on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, prepared to
evacuate.;    About 100 vehicles lined up near the main gate and restless
troops milled about clutching their duffel bags, but no evacuation order was
issued.;    In the city of <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, which is adjacent to <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, the more than
300,000 residents spent an anguished night, fearful the volcano might force
them to flee. Many residents packed emergency kits with clothes and provisions
and stored them in their cars so they could leave at a moment's notice.;   
Thousands evacuated;  In all, more than 35,000 people have been evacuated from
areas near the volcano since it began showing signs of activity last week.
They include thousands of primitive Aeta tribesmen, who fled <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on
buffaloes and ox-drawn carts after large rocks rained down on them.;    Aetas
who were evacuated to refugee centers in <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION> appeared to have been upset
by the ordeal. Many spoke of the ground shaking furiously before the huge
volcanic clouds appeared.;    "It's very hard for us when the ground shakes,"
said <PERSON>Vilma David</PERSON>, 32. "Why doesn't it end so we can go home?"  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo erupted today for a third straight day, shooting a cloud of gas

unleash tons of debris and boulders from the slopes of the rumbling volcano.;

<HEADLINE>  VOLCANO ERUPTS 3RD TIME
ONCOMING TYPHOON THREATENS MUDFLOWS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Geologists said <DATE>earlier today</DATE> that new activity was imminent because
pressure was building inside the 4,795-foot volcano 60 miles north of the
capital, <LOCATION>Manila.</LOCATION>;    As though the volcano were not enough trouble, the <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>
weather bureau reported <DATE>today</DATE> that a typhoon was headed for the eastern coast
of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION> island with maximum winds of 110 miles per hour. Typhoon Yunya is
expected to reach land late <DATE>Saturday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Baler</LOCATION>, about 90 miles northeast of
<LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>. Rain already was falling today in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> and Luzon.;    If the
typhoon brings more rain, scientists fear that it will unleash mudflows --
giant rivers of earth, boulders and debris fused with sticky volcanic ash.;   
Meanwhile, administration officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that damage
from the volcano could cause the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration to reduce or pull back
its offers for the continued use of the strategic <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military bases in the
<LOCATION>Philippines.</LOCATION>;    "If <LOCATION>Clark Air Base</LOCATION> is unuseful to us, they (Philippine
officials) will pay the price for their decision (to balk at recent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
offers)," said an administration official, who has closely followed the
negotiations.;    At the moment, he said, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would not sign a
new agreement even if the Philippine government fully accepted the most recent
offer for the bases, the mainstay of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military power in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia.</LOCATION>;  
 Rather, this official said, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wants to wait, at least
briefly, to see how much damage the volcano would cause to <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Subic
Bay Naval Station</LOCATION>. The eruption "could, in the extreme, render (<ORGANIZATION>Clark Air
Base</ORGANIZATION>) inoperative for jet aircraft," the administration official said.;    The
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials spoke on condition that they not be identified.;    This
<DATE>spring</DATE>, after a year of negotiations, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration and Philippine
officials had been moving toward an agreement that would permit continued <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
use of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> for at least seven more years. The current base
leases expire <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE>;    However, at the end of the last round of talks in
<DATE>May</DATE>, the two sides still remained deadlocked on several issues.  </TEXT>

several miles to the north and northeast of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> to escape volcanic debris,
boulders and uprooted trees washed down a river by heavy rains. Scores more

<LEADPARA>  For generations, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay naval base were bastions of U.S.
power in Asia. After a week of volcanic eruptions, the bases are in ruins,
their future uncertain.;    Weeklong eruptions by Mount Pinatubo, 10 miles
west of Clark, dumped tons of ash on the two installations and rendered
airfields at both Clark and Subic's Cubi Point naval air station unusable.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For the first time since the Japanese occupation in World War II, the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has no operational military airfields in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>,
although <ORGANIZATION>Cubi Point</ORGANIZATION> is expected to be back in service later this month.;   
<LOCATION>The U.S.</LOCATION> military last week evacuated about 15,000 troops and their families
from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> and later decided to send the spouses and children of
fliers home until the volcano quiets.;    But damage during <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s
eruption was so extensive at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, 25 miles from the volcano, that it was
decided to send home all 20,000 dependents, including <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> families.;    The
evacuation is expected to be complete by the end of the week, drawing down the
size of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military community from about 35,000 a week ago to about
15,000 uniformed personnel.;    Confusion surrounding the eruptions diverted
attention from deadlocked talks on the future of the bases.;    The lease
expires on <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE>, and the talks on an extension bogged down over
compensation and how long the Americans can stay.;    "I don't have a sense at
this point where the negotiations are going," said a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. "I don't think anybody else does either.";    The
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had agreed to return four small facilities to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
<DATE>this year</DATE> but proposed a 10- to 12-year extension on <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and Subic in return
for <MONEY>$360 million</MONEY> a year in compensation.;    <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> demanded <MONEY>$825 million</MONEY> a
year, half in cash and the rest in trade concessions and debt relief, in
return for a seven-year extension.;    The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> appeared to be wavering
on the "non-cash component" and the two sides were only about <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>
apart when the volcano began erupting <DATE>June</DATE> 9.;    Publicly, both sides
maintain that the eruptions will have no effect on the talks. Foreign
Secretary <PERSON>Raul Manglapus</PERSON>, the chief Philippine negotiator, said it is up to
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to decide whether it no longer wants use of Clark.;    In fact,
however, <ORGANIZATION>Mount Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> has cast a shadow over the entire bases issue. The
volcano has been relatively quiet since <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology, says it
may remain active for several years.;    That raises questions not only about
the feasibility of the Americans remaining there but also whether the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> can implement plans to transform <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> into an international
airport and commercial center if the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops leave.;    The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
has traditionally used the bases as leverage for extracting more aid from the
<LOCATION>United States.</LOCATION>;    As long as <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> remains a threat, however, <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>
finds itself in the same position as someone trying to sell a house on Love
Canal.;    "If he (<PERSON>Manglapus</PERSON>) had closed the deal a month ago, the Americans
would have laid down a fat check," said one diplomat, who refused to be
identified by name or nationality. "Nobody wants to commit himself to a large
compensation when he's facing a major reconstruction bill.";    There has been
no estimate of overall damage to the bases, but the figure could easily run
into the millions. Clark is covered by 10 to 12 inches of ash, and numerous
buildings have been damaged.;    Roads at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> are clogged with ash and mud.
Water and power have been disrupted and there has been some theft, although
the extent is unclear.;    At <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, tons of ash cover roofs, roads and harbor
facilities, and water and power have been disrupted.;    About 166 buildings
are damaged, including <ORGANIZATION>George Dewey High School</ORGANIZATION>, where a 9-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
dependent was killed when a roof caved in late Saturday.;    Hot lines set;
The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> have established telephone hot lines for
information about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> armed services members their dependents in the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. Here are the toll-free telephone numbers:;    <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>:

<LEADPARA>  Thousands of people fled in terror Saturday after a huge fissure cracked Mount
Pinatubo, and scientists said they expected a catastrophic blast from the
volcano.;    In an awesome display of nature's power, day turned into night by
midafternoon across central Luzon and as far south as Manila as a series of 11
explosions sent a relentless, hard rain of golf-ball-sized pumice, pebbles and
ash pouring down. Thunderclaps and jagged streaks of lightning alternated with
brilliant orange flashes from the eruptions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The last 900 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> personnel were evacuated from <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, deserting
one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s oldest and largest overseas bases for the first time since
World War II. Philippine officials warned that looters would be shot.;   
About 15,000 evacuees from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> have been taking shelter at <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval
Base</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> announced that 6,000 to 8,000 <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> dependents
there would be evacuated to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on charter flights over the next
few weeks to relieve overcrowding. Ash in the atmosphere, however, has forced
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>'s airports to close.;    A <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said there were no plans to
evacuate Subic. The base lies about 25 miles southwest of <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials say it is protected from volcanic flows by favorable terrain.;   
Still, base spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON>Kevin Mukri</PERSON> said the base had lost all
electricity and power, and a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dependent and a Filipino were killed <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
when roofs collapsed under the weight of almost a foot of ash.;    Also
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, six people died when a church collapsed in <LOCATION>Dau</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Clark</LOCATION>, and eight
people were killed when a hospital roof fell in <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>,
officials and reports said.;    34 deaths so far;  These casualties raised to
34 the death toll from a week of volcanic eruptions, a typhoon and
earthquakes.;    Under orders from <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Fidel Ramos</PERSON>, the
government on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> extended the "danger zone" around the volcano from 18 to
25 miles and began evacuating three major cities, but washed-out bridges,
ash-clogged highways and a lack of transport slowed the effort.;    Officials
said they had only 250 buses and trucks to move the more than half million
people living in <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION> and San Fernando.;    But many residents,
either unaware of the evacuation or refusing to wait for help, on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
started piling into cars, pedicabs, and trucks or trudged on foot through
knee-deep ash to escape the rumbling mountain.;    Experts fear total blowup; 
Scientists said a 1.8-mile-long fissure that has opened on <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>'s
southern slopes raises the grim possibility that the 4,800-foot volcano may
blow itself apart, blasting deadly debris for miles and triggering massive
avalanches of super-hot gases and rocks far into the surrounding countryside.;
   "We are picturing a worst-case scenario," said <PERSON>Ronaldo Arboleda</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology. "The situation is really
dangerous. . . . We are not gods, but, based on our studies, something not
good is about to happen.";    "It can go any time, any time now," agreed
<PERSON>Glenda Besana</PERSON>, another government geologist.;    The volcano, which was
dormant for 611 years, became active in <DATE>April</DATE> and began minor eruptions last
weekend. Major eruptions started <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and have grown more violent each
day.;    At least 10 small, volcano-related earthquakes rocked the area
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> and were felt 60 miles south in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, where gray-white ash covered
the capital's streets, cars and rooftops like snow.;    Bizarre wind patterns
heightened the difficulties. Typhoon Yunya, which weakened to a tropical storm
as it swept north of the volcano <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, drew low-lying clouds of ash north
and east, while prevailing winds carried higher plumes south and west. The
effect was to dump a blanket of non-toxic silicate ash across most of central
Luzon.;    Half the buildings in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> air force's Basa base
collapsed, officials reported. The ash has also caused incalculable damage to
crops and grazing lands.;    Combined with earthquakes of up to 4.4 on the
Richter scale, the torrents of rain, sand and lumps of pumice made life
miserable for more than 80,000 Filipinos already evacuated from areas near the
volcano and sowed panic in towns bordering the two huge <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military bases.
Residents used any means of transport they could find to try to escape the
volcano.;    Onslaught from the skies;  As mud and then a fierce hailstorm of
pumice reeking of sulfur began pelting down <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>,
tens of thousands of people frantically clambered aboard anything with wheels
and fled on ash-slicked roads in pitch-black darkness.;    Dump trucks and
flatbed trucks carried hundreds of bedraggled refugees, coated brown from the
mud and huddled miserably under tarps and umbrellas. Some hung on hoods and
trunks or clung desperately to the sides of vehicles.;    "We must run away,"
said <PERSON>Roger Pineda</PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON>Rosario</PERSON>, fearfully clutched their 3-month-old
infant under a tarp as a rain of gravel clattered down. "The volcano is
coming.";    Others rode bicycles, motorcycles, buffalo carts and other
vehicles in what quickly became a nightmarish traffic jam on the two-lane
<ORGANIZATION>MacArthur Highway</ORGANIZATION> heading south. Trees cracked and fell on all sides from the
weight of the volcanic debris, halting bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours at a
time. The road repeatedly shook from earthquakes, and lightning and eruptions
eerily lit the sky in a hellish display.;    'Like the end of the world'; 
"It's like the end of the world," said <PERSON>Van Punzalan</PERSON>, a 34-year-old farmer who
drove his wife and two children on a tarp-covered motorcycle and sidecar.;   
Nearby, mud-covered and barefoot <PERSON>Arno Lusung</PERSON>, 21, drove his motorcycle behind
a truck carrying his wife and children.;    "I forgot my shoes," he said. "We
just ran."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Roads nearby were clogged with cars, jeeps and buses as thousands of
terrified residents fled. Church bells pealed in the city of <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION>, adjacent
to the air base, warning the more than 300,000 residents to seek shelter.;   
Reporters at the scene said the blast created a greenish-gray mushroom cloud
"like an atomic bomb." They said they heard three blasts, and then a huge
gray-greenish cloud burst from the crater, blocking out the sun.;    There
were no immediate reports of injuries. Philippine officials had evacuated
about 19,000 villagers in recent days, but others stayed in scattered hamlets
to tend to their animals and farms.;    All telephone lines to <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> were
down, and <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces Television</ORGANIZATION> was unable to broadcast after at least three
eruptions began at <TIME>8:51 a.m.</TIME> (<TIME>5:51 p.m.</TIME> PDT), following two smaller emissions
before dawn. Another eruption occured shortly before noon.;    Scientists said
the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could
come later.;    "Most probably there will be more eruptions," said
seismologist <PERSON>Julio Sabit.</PERSON>;    <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology, said everyone within a 12-mile radius
should evacuate, or even within 18 miles, "to be safe.";    'Dark mushroom'; 
"The smoke is very thick, like a dark mushroom in the sky," <PERSON>Gus Abelgas</PERSON>, a
reporter for <ORGANIZATION>ABS-CBN</ORGANIZATION> television, said in a broadcast from <LOCATION>Botolan</LOCATION>, near the
volcano's western slopes. "It's just like what we saw in <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION>.";    Other
reporters described panic as people scampered for safety with their belongings
and livestock.;    Most of the Americans stationed at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> were transferred
to the <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</LOCATION> and were expected to remain there until the danger
from the volcano was past.;    In volcano's path;    <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said the site
where <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is located was in the path of the volcanic flow from <LOCATION>Mount
Pinatubo</LOCATION> during its last major eruption, in the 14th century.;    <PERSON>Rollie
Rimando</PERSON>, another volcanologist, said a major eruption could hurl debris and
poisonous gases in a 12-mile radius, affecting both the base and parts of
Angeles.;    On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, a cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet
above the volcano but suddenly dissipated in the afternoon, only to revive
again 20 minutes later. The area on the western slope of the mountain was
covered in a thin layer of ash.;    Ash began falling <DATE>Monday</DATE> on villages west
of <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION> near the slopes of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>, prompting authorities to close
roads there. But Angeles police said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that no one was evacuating the
area.;    Some refused to go;    A Philippine police major identified only as
Major <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> said he visited a remote settlement near the volcano after the
blast and tried to talk a handful of residents into leaving. But they refused
to abandon their livestock and water buffaloes, known as carabaos.;    "If our
carabaos die, we'll die with them," the officer quoted them as saying.;   
Col. <PERSON>Jose Balajadia</PERSON>, chief of the Philippine military's <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base
Command</ORGANIZATION>, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that troops remaining at the base had been issued gas
masks in case ash falls over the installation.;    At the Subic station,
newcomers from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> tried to sort out their finances, adjust to cramped
living and otherwise cope with dislocation. Finance officers issued partial
pay to personnel who had to leave before having a chance to go to the bank.;  
 Smaller than anticipated;  The eruption appeared to be smaller than that
anticipated by <PERSON>Peter Lipman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> scientist in <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION>,
who on <DATE>Monday</DATE> had said an eruption as massive as that of <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION>
could occur any day.;    After the eruption, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to
telephone five <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> researchers monitoring the volcano from <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base.</ORGANIZATION>;  
 In a conversation with <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> half an hour before the eruption, the
researchers said the volcano had had small eruptions earlier in the day. At
the time of the phone call, they were planning a helicopter ride above the
volcano to survey the size of the lava dome inside its crater.;    There are
about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. The last major
eruption was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, in <DATE>1965</DATE>. That
explosion killed about 200 people.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The <ORGANIZATION>Filipino American

   CLARK AIR BASE, the Philippines -- Amando Ayson, a day
laborer at this U.S. military base, gapes at the damage
wrought by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and worries about
the future.
   Gritty, gray ash smothers the base's once-verdant grounds
under drifts as much as a meter deep. Collapsed warehouses
and abandoned homes appear ghostly through the swirling dust.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a canyon about 200 yards from the perimeter of the
base, a still-hot tongue of volcanic debris nearly half a
kilometer wide and four meters deep fills a channel where a
river once ran. On the horizon, a dark mushroom cloud blooms
over six miles into the sky, is swept away by the wind, and
is replaced with another.
   "A lot of people rely on <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> {for jobs} -- not only
people from here but from the {nearby} provinces," <PERSON>Mr. Ayson</PERSON>
says. "I don't think the base will close, but if it does, I
don't know what we will do."
   For <PERSON>Mr. Ayson</PERSON> and the tens of thousands of other Filipinos
who made their living directly or indirectly from the air
base, the impact of the volcanic eruptions that began early
last month could be dire. Once the largest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> air base
overseas, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> has been transformed into a ghost town, its
two runways rendered useless by the highly corrosive ash and
the threat of continued eruptions.
   Sharp reductions in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military personnel and dependents
at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Station</LOCATION>, both within 25 miles of
the volcano's new crater, are expected to take a heavy toll
on central <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION> island. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials say the bases
previously pumped as much as <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> annually into the
Philippine economy.
   Experts are rushing to assess damage and future volcanic
threats to the bases before <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> special negotiator <PERSON>Richard
Armitage</PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> in mid-July to resume negotiations
on a new bases treaty. Costs include the repair of hundreds
of collapsed buildings, replacement of damaged equipment and
removal of millions of tons of sandy ash.
   Philippine Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Raul Manglapus</PERSON> has said he is
confident the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> will want to retain both bases. "I visited
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>," he said last week. "It will need a lot of scraping. A
lot of roofs will need to be mended. I do not see that it has
been rendered totally useless."
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> have also asserted that
they remain interested in reaching an agreement on both
bases. Rear Adm. <PERSON>Thomas Mercer</PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces in
the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, said recently that his mission was to put
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and Subic back "exactly as" they were.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, however, at least some officials apparently
believe the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> assurances emanating from <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> have gone
too far. <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Pete Williams</PERSON> said, in
response to reports from the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, that "Adm. <PERSON>Mercer</PERSON>'s
statement notwithstanding, we have not made any decision on
whether to keep <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and Subic going at their pre-volcano
levels."
   Privately, some <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials say that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> merely
seeks to keep its options open until damage from the volcano
can be assessed. Assurances of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interest are necessary,
they say, to prevent an anti-bases faction in the Philippine
government from using the eruption to push for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
pullout.
   While assessments of current damage continue, the more
difficult calculation is the threat of future eruptions.
Subic received heavier ash falls and sustained more serious
damage, but only <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is threatened by pyroclastic flows,
deadly avalanches of superheated gas, sand and rocks that
hurl down the slopes at speeds of as much as 100 miles an
hour.
   "We can't be assured that there won't be more major
eruptive activity," says <PERSON>Ed Wolfe</PERSON>, chief scientist at the
<ORGANIZATION>Cascades Volcano Observatory</ORGANIZATION>, established in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, after the <DATE>1980</DATE> explosion of <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION>. "If
there is, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> will be subject to the same sorts of threats
that it was in <DATE>June</DATE>."
   One of about a dozen <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists who helped the
<ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology predict
the <DATE>June</DATE> eruption that forced the temporary evacuation of
<ORGANIZATION>Clark</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Wolfe</PERSON> said that even if the volcano doesn't blow
again, it will continue spewing hot ash for several months,
and possibly for years.
   Ash emissions are a serious hazard to aircraft in flight,
particularly jets. On the ground, the powdery sand is a
maintenance nightmare that shorts electrical lines, jams
generators and corrodes machinery.
   During the <DATE>June</DATE> to <DATE>October</DATE> monsoon, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is downwind from
the ash emissions. Subic, on the other hand, is separated
from the volcano by a low mountain range and was only heavily
coated with ash because the main eruption coincided with a
typhoon that altered the prevailing winds.
   Both bases, and their adjoining cities, face serious flood
risks because streams and drains have been clogged with
volcanic sand. However, the danger is greater in <LOCATION>Angeles
City</LOCATION>, adjacent to <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, where fast-moving slushes of water
and volcanic debris known as lahars are expected with the
first heavy rains.
   "All the solid material is up there in great abundance;
all we need is the triggering action," says <PERSON>Kelvin Rodolfo</PERSON>, a
Philippine-born <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> geologist who heads the <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo Lahar
Hazard Task Force</ORGANIZATION>.
   Massive lahars also are anticipated in a string of towns
along narrow river valleys north of <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, but the navy base
and the adjacent city of <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION> don't face a serious lahar
threat, <PERSON>Mr. Rodolfo</PERSON> says.
   Damage from ash fall and earthquakes at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>
has nonetheless been severe. Fifty-five people were killed by
eruption fallout in <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>, including several who died when
the 200-bed city hospital collapsed beneath ash.
   On the naval base itself, a hail of sand smashed more than
200 structures, including dozens of warehouses and workshops
vital to the base's primary mission of repairing and
resupplying <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> vessels. The volcanic fallout also
shredded 37,000 acres of triple-canopy jungle, the last large
stand of virgin forest in <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>.
   Protected from the illegal logging that has deforested
most of the rest of the island, the Subic jungle provided the
base with a vital watershed and a unique venue for
jungle-survival courses taught by aboriginal Aetas, a Negrito
people descended from some of the earliest inhabitants of the
Philippine archipelago.
   The jungle is now a wasteland of smashed trees and broken
ash-coated limbs, its once-teeming wildlife population either
scattered or destroyed. Monkeys that survived the eruption
have left the jungle to scavenge for garbage in other parts
of the base.

<DESCRIPT>  OPINION; PHILIPPINES; VOLCANO; US; REACTION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN A THOUGHTFUL speech to a California audience in 1984, Jon Tinker of the
environmental group Earthscan reflected on the different ways in which rich
and poor countries are equipped to deal with disasters. Recalling the westward
flight from the dust bowl in "The Grapes of Wrath," he commented: "Steinbeck's
Okies did not always like what they found there, but there was at least
somewhere else to go. . . . There are no Californias in the Third World.";   
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines brings the remark to mind
with special force. Nature -- or an act of God, if you will -- can sometimes
expose the realities of rich and poor, of power and impotence, in the manner
of a parable.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The mountain began to blow its top on <DATE>June 12</DATE>, Philippine Independence Day.
The timing was ironic, since the story that played so dramatically on the
<TIME>evening</TIME> news in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was the battle to save <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>
and <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</LOCATION>, two huge military installations that are a bitter
irritant to <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> nationalists.;    Fourteen thousand people from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>
were moved with prompt efficiency to <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>. As it became clear that the
threat from the volcano was not over, more than 20,000 dependents from both
bases were being evacuated. A <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> battle group was diverted from <LOCATION>Okinawa</LOCATION> to
spearhead the operation, led by the most modern nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier in the fleet, the <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>. Evacuees were shuttled out on <ORGANIZATION>Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> C-141 transports backed up by chartered civilian aircraft. There was one
American fatality.;    More than 260 Filipinos have died, suffocated by sulfur
fumes, crushed in collapsing buildings, drowned in swollen rivers and
mudslides. Others fled in trucks, on bicycles or simply on foot, clutching
children and domestic animals. Thousands took refuge in the bleachers of a
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> sports stadium, exposed to the elements.;    The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military was not
altogether unmindful of the refugees' plight. One million Meals Ready to Eat,
or MREs, happily surplus because of the speedy conclusion of the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION>
war, were distributed to the survivors. And <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops found reasons to be
cheerful at a time of crisis. One young sergeant at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said he thought the
volcanic eruption "was kind of neat. It looked like one of the nuclear tests
at <LOCATION>Bikini Island</LOCATION>." His superior officers also found a silver lining in the
mushroom cloud, concluding that the disaster would lower the market value of
the bases and so strengthen <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s hand in negotiations over their future
"rent" when the current lease expires <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE>;    <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and Subic date back
to the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, when President <PERSON>McKinley</PERSON> decided that it was
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s mission to "uplift and Christianize" the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. In the Cold
War years, the bases were crucial to the containment of Soviet power in the
<LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> insists it still finds them necessary, even after <DATE>last
year</DATE>'s Soviet pullout from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Cam Ranh Bay</LOCATION>, the only Soviet base on
foreign soil.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> also likes to argue that the bases benefit the
Philippine economy, although there is no reason to suppose that closing them
would do any great harm. Civilian reconversion posed no special difficulties
for <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops and bases were pulled out in <DATE>1976</DATE>, after the
defeat in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. The British shut down their naval base in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1971</DATE>, and it soon became one of the most successful shipyards in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Manila's Economic Development Foundation</ORGANIZATION> has estimated that the country could
earn <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> a year just by tilling the 100,000 acres of unused farmland
inside the bases' perimeters.;    The Philippine government has proposed <MONEY>$825
million</MONEY> as a fair annual rent for the bases over the next seven years; the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counteroffer is <MONEY>$360 million</MONEY> per year for 10 years. Of course, this is
not the bases' only relationship to the local economy. Tens of thousands of
Filipinos work at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and Subic and 20,000 women and children in the
honky-tonk town of <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION> have found employment of a sort servicing the
sexual demands of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sailors and airmen.;    Wearied by yet another scene of
mass calamity, Americans have begun to experience what the disaster-relief
agencies call compassion fatigue. Watching the ash rain down from <LOCATION>Mount
Pinatubo</LOCATION>, the reflex is to flip the channel and hide behind the old cliche
that life in the Third World is cheap. But a darker question remains: In those
parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION> where the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has planted itself, are some
lives not cheaper than others?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Mount Pinatubo, which continues to spurt huge plumes of volcanic ash, lies
10 miles west of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and less than 25 miles northeast of <ORGANIZATION>Subic Bay Naval

interested in holding on to <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, which also was damaged badly by fallen ash
but continues to function as a naval base.;    Citing "substantial damage"

drops its insistence on limiting a new bases agreement to seven years and

time frame still would be too short to justify the <MONEY>hundreds of millions of

the volcano's behavior for years to come.;    "There is no prospect that
significant sums of money will be spent to clean (<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>) up and reconstruct
it," the official said.;    Most of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s 16,000 Americans -- including

<TEXT>     <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials painted a depressing picture of conditions and damage at
<LOCATION>Clark</LOCATION> and Subic.;    At <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, power and water have been virtually knocked out
by heavy ash falls, and at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> the damage to buildings was more extensive
than initially thought, officials said. They said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s commissary and all
its warehouses collapsed under the weight of ash soaked by torrential rains,
and that many warehouses in the base's supply area also caved in.;    While
both bases have six to 12 inches of ash on the ground, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is in relatively
worse shape because it needs clean air to function as an air base, and the ash
fall has "rendered it inoperable," a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomat said.;    Officials at
<LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> said it could be two months or more before full electricity and
water services were restored to the sprawling naval base.;    "From all the
ash, it looks like a moonscape up here," said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON>Kevin Mukri</PERSON>, a
spokesman at <LOCATION>Subic Bay.</LOCATION>;    Scientists said the volcano was steadily calming
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, and they reduced the danger zone around Pinatubo from 18 miles to 12
miles. At least three small earth tremors were recorded at the volcano, and
one small explosion covered nearby <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> with fresh ash.;    Eight more <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
warships steamed toward <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> to help speed an exodus of American military
dependents from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> naval base. Military officials hoped to
remove all 20,000 dependents by the end of the week.;    Since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, 10

the inability of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> to sustain a large population over the short term,"
said <PERSON>Stanley Schrager</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>. "It's a real
mess up there.";    <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> have suggested
that <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> may be abandoned because of unacceptably high reconstruction costs.
Clark is buried under volcanic ash that varies from six inches to a foot
deep.;    Officials say the <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Station</LOCATION> is by far the more
valuable of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>. It is a principal maintenance,
supply and storage base for the 180 ships of the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Fleet</ORGANIZATION>, and is the
most convenient full-service port for <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> vessels in most areas of the Indian
Ocean.;    "Subic is a nearly perfect, well-protected deep-water harbor that
would be impossible for the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> to re-create," said an administration
official in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> is not irreplaceable, especially if it's
covered with volcanic sludge.";    New eruptions <DATE>Thursday</DATE> released a cloud of
swirling gray ash nearly three miles high, dumping a new layer of ash on the
base and creating fresh misery for hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who have
struggled to dig out from beneath the ash and rock that rained down on their
homes last weekend.;    The death toll from <DATE>last weekend</DATE>'s eruption rose to
268, Philippine officials said, and damage reports continue to grow. About
250,000 people were made homeless, and thousands of homes and buildings were
destroyed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
any time," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HUGE ERUPTION LIKELY IN PHILIPPINES 'ANY
TIME'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano
today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology said.;    If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash
produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, he said.
Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of <LOCATION>Angeles City</LOCATION>, where the air base is
located, about 50 miles north of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not
erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at
least, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;    Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the
eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, he
said.;    The five <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> scientists are among the few remaining people at <ORGANIZATION>Clark
Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near
the volcano.;    The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their
equipment, today  moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles
from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    <LOCATION>Mount
Pinatubo</LOCATION> is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire"
on the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coasts of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>. (These volcanoes -- including
<LOCATION>Mount Lassen</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Shasta County</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Mount Rainier</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, all in the <ORGANIZATION>Cascade Range</ORGANIZATION> -- arise where one of the earth's immense
crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.);    <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s last eruption,
600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half
a cubic kilometer -- as <LOCATION>Mount St. Helens</LOCATION> did when it erupted in <DATE>1980</DATE>. Until
volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath
the volcano this <DATE>spring</DATE>, it had not been studied well.;    Other recent
volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were <LOCATION>El Chichon</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> and
<ORGANIZATION>Nevado del Ruiz</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985.</DATE>;    If it does have a massive eruption,
<ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish
avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to
100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a
really big eruption, all of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> could be covered" with
glowing ash, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;    Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off
the avalanche is fatal. That is what killed 38 people in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> last week.;   
Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base,
<PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash --
indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their
engines stalled by the grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from
the base. But winds of the <DATE>summer</DATE> monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin
any day, would send ash directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity
-- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock
plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is
imminent, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on
the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days
they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    Their predictions
might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already. But it
would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before
scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the
base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be
linked to the volcano in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which is of comparable size.;    "No reputable
scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between the two, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;   
More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted. "Two out of
500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>

<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and from <LOCATION>Subic Bay Naval Base</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> after <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>
began a series of eruptions <DATE>June 9</DATE> that have killed 169 people.;    Some of
the early arrivals told harrowing stories of seeing collapsed buildings and a
countryside covered in white volcanic ash. Some said they had to flee with no
more than the clothes on their backs.;    "I've never been in an earthquake, a
volcano and a typhoon at the same time before," said <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Cliff
Breier</PERSON>, who managed to get his Doberman dog on the evacuation plane.;    "You
could see the hills in the distance. It looked like the Alps. Everything was
ash gray or white," said <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Scott Weyant.</PERSON>;    <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Master</ORGANIZATION>
Sgt. <PERSON>Benjamin Reese</PERSON> said he and his family were moved twice at Subic because
the weight of the ash was too much for base buildings.;    "The fire station I
know was totally collapsed on its trucks," he said.;    <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> security
policeman <PERSON>Joseph Callahan</PERSON> said he and his colleagues worked 14-hour shifts to
keep looters away from Clark.;    As many as 5,000 of the soldiers and their
relatives are expected to arrive at <ORGANIZATION>McChord</ORGANIZATION> in the next few days, said Sgt.
<PERSON>Jim Davis</PERSON>, base spokesman.;    The first arrivals were offered medical care,
travel expenses and money for clothing and other needs. Dozens of phones were
provided so they could call home.;    "Some people got out with literally no
shoes, nothing, because buildings were collapsing on them," said <PERSON>Holly
Erickson</PERSON>, wife of an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> captain.;    <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>John Litten</PERSON> said
people had to flee with only the few possessions they could carry aboard the
plane. That included a dozen cats and dogs.;    "Whatever they left behind,
they can expect never to see again," he said.;    Their 2 1/2-day journey
began aboard <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ships that left <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> for the Philippine island of <LOCATION>Cebu</LOCATION>.
From there, they flew to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> and then on to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> before the final flight to
<ORGANIZATION>McChord</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>Ron Barkdull.</PERSON>;    One of the evacuees, <PERSON>Debbie Parker</PERSON>,
of <LOCATION>Roanoke</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, said by phone from <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> earlier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that she and her
three children were waiting to hear when her husband, Maj. <PERSON>Greg Parker</PERSON>, would
be joining them.;    "I've heard that my husband has evacuated and I don't
know where he is," she said. "I would love to know because that is the only
thing that is bothering me right now besides wanting everyone out.";    <PERSON>Litten</PERSON>
said some of the evacuees who arrived at <ORGANIZATION>McChord</ORGANIZATION> would begin leaving for
hometowns across the country as early as today.;    About 60 people in
military and civilian clothes were on hand to greet the first arrivals.;    In
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, meanwhile, foreign flights out of the capital's crippled airport
resumed <DATE>today</DATE> as <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>'s daily eruptions entered their second week.
At least three more earth tremors were recorded and an explosion blanketed
<ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> with more ash.;    Still, scientists said <PERSON>Pinatubo</PERSON> was steadily
calming and they reduced the danger zone from a radius of 18 to 12 miles. That
still encompasses <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, which is 10 miles east of the volcano.;    Food and
clean drinking water were running low in central and southwestern portions of
<LOCATION>Luzon island</LOCATION>, which includes the volcano and <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>. Thousands of homes were
buried in ash and hundreds of thousands of people are homeless.;    <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Ninoy Aquino International Airport</ORGANIZATION> remained officially closed today, but
planes from <ORGANIZATION>Quantas</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Lufthansa</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Cathay Pacific</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> airlines left "at
their own risk" with passengers aboard.;    They had been stranded by
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s huge eruption.;    Airport officials said planes from other
airlines were still stranded.;    No new ash has fallen since <DATE>Saturday</DATE> on
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, 60 miles south of the volcano, but the city's air remained clogged
with fine, sand-like debris.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Donations can be mailed to

said <PERSON>Jessie Daligdig</PERSON>, a government geologist.;    Villagers tied wet kerchiefs
on their faces and used rakes, shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket
of snow-like ash from roads. At times, winds whipped the grit into the air,
forcing cars to use windshield wipers and headlights in blizzard-like
conditions through the afternoon.;    Two people have been reported killed so
far, a Filipino serving in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> who died in a traffic accident on an
ash-slick road and a Filipino boy reported to have died after inhaling
sulfuric fumes that began to seep from the volcano <DATE>last weekend.</DATE>;    The
initial explosions on <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> at <TIME>8:51 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> sent a
10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies
over <LOCATION>Clark Air Base</LOCATION>, forcing the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> to evacuate hundreds of American
volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive
communications equipment.;    Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work
at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> were evacuated <DATE>Monday</DATE>, when scientists said it was clear that the
volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life.;    <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at <LOCATION>Clark</LOCATION>, but
they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on
the base were hit by molten rock.;    Many of the villages in the vicinity
were holding Independence Day celebrations when heavy gray clouds first began
raining ash <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. The mayor in <LOCATION>San Marcelino</LOCATION>, 17 miles southwest
of the volcano, was giving a speech to several thousand people when dark
clouds suddenly blotted the sun and turned day to night.;    <PERSON>Calixto Macalma
Jr.</PERSON>, a police intelligence officer, said people panicked as it began "raining
sand." Church bells pealed in alarm, sirens wailed and many ran for shelter.; 
  Philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated 19,369
people from villages within a 12-mile radius of the volcano by <DATE>late Wednesday</DATE>.
Along the roads, some people wore cardboard boxes on their heads for
protection; some rode their water buffaloes to safety.;    At least 330
villagers, who had ignored earlier warnings to flee Aglao hamlet, finally
abandoned their homes <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> afternoon.;    "There were big stones, like
this," said one woman who escaped, holding out her fists. "We are very
scared.";    Thousands of residents of <LOCATION>Angeles City</LOCATION>, east of the volcano,
initially fled in panic from the booming morning blasts and greenish-gray
mushroom cloud that towered over the area. Passenger jeeps sped through the
streets, refusing to stop for riders as the drivers drove for cover. Most
residents later returned to the sprawling city.;    But officials issued no
general evacuation order for Angeles, even though the city is next to <ORGANIZATION>Clark
Air Base</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> geologists advising the Philippine government said most of
Angeles was not at risk, apparently basing their assessment on earth samples
indicating that earlier eruptions had reached the area on which <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> now

helicoptered to refugee centers near <LOCATION>Angeles</LOCATION> briefly before returning to
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> for an Independence Day rally and parade at <LOCATION>Luneta Park</LOCATION>. She authorized
the release of <MONEY>$1.42 million</MONEY> for relief efforts.;    <PERSON>Raymundo Punongbayan</PERSON>,

   U.S. Is Seeking
   `Flexible' Pact
   On Clark Base

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is seeking a new agreement with the
Philippines that will give it some "flexibility" to use all
or part of Clark Air Base or abandon the heavily
volcano-damaged base entirely, Pentagon spokesman Pete
William said.
   Speaking shortly before the resumption of negotiations in
Manila over the future of U.S. bases in the Philippines, Mr.
Williams said the U.S. definitely wants to keep the Subic Bay
naval base, though. The negotiations were to resume yesterday
for the first time since the eruption of Mount Pinatubo cast
a further cloud on the future of the bases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There have been suspicions that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> might abandon the
bases in the wake of the volcano's eruption, especially given
the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s budget strains and the diminished Soviet
military threat.
   <PERSON>Richard Armitage</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> special negotiator, was
expected to get a damage assessment from Adm. <PERSON>Charles Larsen</PERSON>,
commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Pacific Command</ORGANIZATION>, before
sitting down with his Philippine counterparts. Before the
talks were suspended, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> had offered the Philippines
<MONEY>$360 million</MONEY> in annual compensation for 10 years. <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> was
holding out for <MONEY>$825 million</MONEY> a year for seven years, but it
was willing to accept a portion of that sum in the form of
trade preferences and other non-budgetary benefits.
   Meanwhile, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has to deal with an upheaval of a
political kind. Oscar Orbos, a well-regarded administrator
who helped get the bases talks moving earlier this year, is
out of his job as President <PERSON>Corazon Aquino</PERSON>'s executive
secretary. His abrupt departure last week was linked to
internal politics rather than to his role in the bases
negotiations, but it creates yet another uncertainty about
the talks.
   Opponents of the bases are criticizing the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> for not
doing enough to ease the plight of 250,000 evacuees who lost
their livelihoods when <ORGANIZATION>Mount Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> covered their farms and
towns with a thick shroud of ash. The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> said
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> so far has spent <MONEY>$1.6 million</MONEY> in disaster relief for
the affected provinces.
   In a news briefing, <PERSON>Mr. Williams</PERSON> said the Subic naval base
is in "relatively good shape" and isn't likely to be
threatened by mudslides or flooding. However, he said the
outlook for further <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> use of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> is "very
uncertain" because of the potentially large reconstruction
costs and the hazards that the still-active Pinatubo
continues to pose for aviation.
   Although the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> wants to keep <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, it may decide to
retain just one part of <LOCATION>Clark</LOCATION>, its <ORGANIZATION>Crow Valley</ORGANIZATION> aerial gunnery
range, and give up the rest of the air base, the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman said. He declined to say how such a decision would
affect the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> offer.
   Both governments are trying to conclude a new bases accord
by <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE>, a deadline set by a provision of the Philippine
Constitution.

   Economists and businessmen say damage to the Philippine
economy from the spectacular eruption of Mt. Pinatubo has
been relatively minimal so far. But they are less certain of
the volcano's effect on the two U.S. military bases that
sprawl in its shadow.
   The Pentagon said the possibility of future eruptions and
the cost of repairs to Clark Air Base and Subic Bay naval
base may force the U.S. to re-evaluate its presence.

<TEXT>
   "The question of whether we will remain in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
is something we have to look at in light of this disaster,"
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Pete Williams</PERSON> said.
   Mass evacuations from the slopes of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> and
nearby cities and towns and the closure of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> have created
a sense that the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> faces a disaster similar in
severity to the <DATE>July 1990</DATE> earthquake that killed more than
2,000 people and damaged roads, bridges and buildings
throughout the main island of <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION>. But estimates by
Philippine officials, foreign economists and
international-aid experts suggest that the eruption, which
has killed about 170 people, will have little impact on the
country's economy.
   Vulcanologists say the worst of the eruptions are probably
past, and concern in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> is turning to the future of the
ash-coated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases. The bases have been the subject of
protracted and acrimonious talks that appeared to be moving
toward agreement when Mt. Pinatubo stirred last week after a
600-year sleep.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Stanley Schrager</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is
assessing damage at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>, and "until we have
that assessment, it's too early to speculate on the future of
the bases or the future of the negotiations." He added that
"no formal policy review" is under way, and that "the talks
have not been suspended or put on hold in that sense."
   Officials in the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs</ORGANIZATION>,
which has overseen the base negotiations, expressed concern
that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would use the reduced utility of the bases as a
bargaining chip to press for a cut in compensation payments
to <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> or to obtain an extended lease. The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>
said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would not exploit the situation.
   The lease on both bases expires <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE>, and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
has offered to pay <MONEY>$360 million</MONEY> a year in bases-linked
compensation, mostly military aid, for an extension of 10 to
12 years. <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> has been demanding <MONEY>$825 million</MONEY> a year in
exchange for a seven-year extension.
   The 4,500 <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> personnel and 23,000 dependents
and civilians who are being withdrawn from the two bases
would hurt the local economy nearby. But economists believe
the eruption won't further cloud the country's already grim
overall economic prospects, though tourism is likely to
suffer. A <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION> economist said its projections for
growth in gross national product of <PERCENT>1.5%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> this year and
<PERCENT>3.5%</PERCENT> in <DATE>1992</DATE> would remain unchanged.
   While some observers express concern that the eruption
could deter foreign investors, businessmen in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> are
generally unfazed. "The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> has come through far
worse than Mount Pinatubo," said <PERSON>Thomas J. Leber</PERSON>, president
of the <ORGANIZATION>American Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>.

<LEADPARA>  Hard-pressed Philippine officials stepped up rescue and relief efforts
Wednesday amid growing fears of disastrous mudslides from millions of tons of
rocks and ash that rained down during last weekend's devastating eruption of
Mount Pinatubo.;    Scientists estimate that the massive eruption dropped
volcanic debris more than 1,000 feet thick on parts of the volcano's steep
slopes. Heavy rains drenched the area Wednesday in the beginning of the annual

<TEXT>     "Mixed with rain, mixed with water, it becomes a liquid concrete river,"
said a Western diplomat who is monitoring the crisis. "That's our chief
concern right now.";    Aerial surveys indicated that the eruption "completely
obliterated" an area up to 7.4 miles from the volcano, with considerable
damage within a 12-mile radius, he said.;    Most of the debris came from a
huge dome of magma that built up on the mountain's summit after it burst into
life <DATE>June 9</DATE> after lying dormant more than 600 years. The dome is now a deep
crater more than a mile wide.;    While still active, the volcano has calmed
steadily since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and thousands of people have returned to the area.;   
The magnitude of the <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> disaster grew <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> as the death toll
rose to 169, with an estimated quarter-million people made homeless.;    The
heavy ash crushed thousands of homes and buildings, collapsed bridges and
roads and buried vast sugar cane and rice fields. Economic losses are believed
to be in the <MONEY>hundreds of millions of dollars</MONEY>.  </TEXT>

including his seven-foot pet python.;    For thousands of military personnel
like <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> and their families, the journey home began <DATE>June 10</DATE>, when <LOCATION>Mount
Pinatubo</LOCATION> erupted for the first time, showering their homes at <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>
with ash.;    They left the base with nothing more than they could carry and
headed for <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION>, 23 miles south.;    After a second eruption <DATE>five days

the island of <LOCATION>Cebu</LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and civilian aircraft flew them to <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION>,
then to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, then to Travis.;    Four flights came in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, another
four <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and up to 3,000 people were expected to pass through Travis by

said between 6,000 to 8,000 family members will be flown to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
on chartered flights during the next few weeks.;    Looking exhausted and
anxious, more than 120 American service personnel and their spouses, children
and dogs and cats stumbled off the jet at <TIME>1:20 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> at Travis.;    On
the runway, they were met by a Travis volunteer who acted as a "sponsor." Each
sponsor located a family and led them into the airport to be fed -- and in
some cases -- clothed. The volunteers played with children, walked dogs, and
set up travel arrangements for the displaced families with no money.;   
Eleven-year-old <PERSON>Jennifer Jettner</PERSON> sat with her sisters, <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON>, 18, and
<PERSON>Rizza</PERSON>, 17, while her mother waited in line for money -- they were able to get

children could fly to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> to stay with the girls' grandparents.;    The
girls talked of the terror of the volcano, saying the ash and smoke were so
thick at times it was impossible to see anything.;    "It was raining and
ashy, and it was pitch black," <PERSON>Jennifer</PERSON> said. "We had the ash falling,
tremors, and a typhoon all in one day.;    "One guy that was staying next door
to us did nothing but scream or sing really loud all day long," she said.
"Every time there was a tremor, he'd sing. I think he was praying or
something.";    He wasn't the only one.;    <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said he should have known
<ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> would blow in <DATE>April</DATE> when the enormous mountain began letting out
steam, a little at a time.;    But it wasn't until last week when that pitch
blackness hovered over <LOCATION>Subic Bay</LOCATION> for more than 27 hours that he thought,
"there's no way we can all get out of this alive.";    "The first time it
(erupted), it was beautiful," <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said. "It looked like a huge gray
mushroom cloud. Then the ash started falling.;    "Then it rained. And the ash
turned to cement," he said. "We were outside in the rain, on the tops of the
buildings, shoveling the ash off, hoping they wouldn't collapse beneath our
feet.;    "But all that's over now. And I'm on my way to <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>," he
said. "For some R and R."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  PHILIPPINES; VOLCANO; DISASTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A thundering wall of mud and boulders roared down a river near Mount Pinatubo
on Sunday, burying homes as residents looked on helplessly.;    While there
were no reports of casualties, authorities warned villagers living near the
volcano that they could expect worse mud flows, including huge waves of
volcanic ash and debris capable of entombing whole towns.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MUD, ROCKS POUR DOWN RIVER NEAR PINATUBO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The private television station <ORGANIZATION>GMA</ORGANIZATION> said mud flows had occurred near the
towns of <LOCATION>Porac</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida Blanca</LOCATION>, about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> and near
the volcano.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Seismology</PERSON> said
the incidents were not volcanic mud flows, but flooding and landslides caused
by heavy rains and accumulations of mud and volcanic debris from recent
eruptions.;    The institute said the <LOCATION>Porac River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Pampanga</LOCATION> had risen three
feet because of rain and ash accumulations since <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> began erupting
<DATE>June</DATE> 9.;    In the village of Pio, on the <LOCATION>Porac River</LOCATION>, residents fled their
homes near the riverbanks when they heard the rumbling sound.;    Soldiers
fired their weapons in the air to warn residents. Reporters said a huge mound
of steaming earth and boulders as large as refrigerators suddenly rolled down
the banks of the river, burying houses up to their roofs.;    There were no
reports of fatalities since everyone in the village had moved to higher
ground, the reporters said. Officials warned of possible flooding along four
other rivers in <LOCATION>Pampanga</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tarlac</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Zambales</LOCATION> provinces, which border the
volcano.;    In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, at least 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> as torrential rains swept down debris from <LOCATION>Mount Unzen</LOCATION>'s previous
eruptions.;    Volcanic ash and basketball-size rocks washed down three rivers
from the 4,485-foot volcano, but no casualties were reported, said <PERSON>Ichiro Otsu</PERSON>
of the fire department in <LOCATION>Shimabara</LOCATION>, at the base of the volcano.;    More than
9,000 residents have been evacuated from outlying parts of <LOCATION>Shimabara</LOCATION>, a city

did not evacuate <LOCATION>Angeles City.</LOCATION>;    City police Sgt. <PERSON>Rodolfo Talledo</PERSON> said most
residents were concerned about the volcano but there was no panic.;    "No one
seems to be afraid and nobody is evacuating because they don't think they are
in any immediate danger," he said. "Only the people from <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> left.";    The
departing Americans left behind a town of morose merchants, dispirited tavern
owners and idle bar girls at establishments with names like The Happy <PERSON>Hooker</PERSON>,
The Zoo and, perhaps a bit too apt these days, Earthquake McGoon's.;    Out on
the highway, one vendor did a brisk business selling icy soda pop to the long
line of departing Americans; another hawked bags of potato chips from under a
highway bridge. It seemed an odd start to what appears to be a long, uncertain
<DATE>summer</DATE> for tens of thousands of people forced from their homes by an angry
volcano.;    "The mountain's going to determine how long this is going to
last," said <PERSON>Kenneth West</PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> master sergeant stuck in a

in the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION>, 1907.;    At the height of the Mount Pinatubo eruption, a team of
<ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> and Filipino scientists was forced to abandon its monitoring site at
<ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION> for a safer position 36 miles from the volcano, <PERSON>Peck</PERSON> said.
Researchers also lost radio contact with their instruments on the mountain,
which monitor earthquakes and changes in the shape of the ground.;    However,
the team returned to <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and was beginning to assess the
extent of mud and ash flows.;    Ash and rock now blanket an area 90 miles
around <LOCATION>Pinatubo</LOCATION>; at some points, debris flows near the volcano are many yards
thick, the survey said. And while clouds and debris have hampered
observations, it appears that the summit of the mountain is now gone, replaced
by a crater 1.2 miles in diameter.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; PHILIPPINES  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT WAS long past midnight and Conrado Tiamzon was sound asleep when this
farming village suddenly shook to the thundering roar of what sounded like
"1,000 carabao running at us.";   It was worse than any stampede of water
buffalo: It was a deadly gray torrent of rain-soaked volcanic sand and mud,
thick as wet cement, stinking of hot sulfur and rushing faster than a person
could run.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For two hours, <PERSON>Tiamzon</PERSON>, his wife and two young children huddled on their
tin roof, crying and praying as the flood of smoking mud swirled higher and
higher. It didn't stop until it filled his concrete home, stopping just under
the eaves.;   "I am sure we will all die there," the gap-toothed, 36-year-old
farmer said, standing near rooftops poking from the mud.;   <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> died
instead, its simple homes and fertile fields buried under 10 feet of mud from
the <DATE>Sept. 7</DATE> volcanic mudflow that roared 24 miles from the debris-covered
slopes of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>. It was one of scores of villages and towns in
central <LOCATION>Luzon</LOCATION> that had survived the <DATE>June 15</DATE> volcanic eruption -- the biggest
the world has seen this century -- only to find the aftermath far worse.;  
Largely ignored by politicians during last month's fierce debate about the
future of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military bases here, <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s death and destruction has grown
dramatically. Indeed, most of the estimated 875 deaths now blamed on the
volcano occurred in the weeks after the <DATE>June 15</DATE> eruption, not during it. The
majority of victims, 505 people in all, perished in crowded, squalid,
government evacuation camps. Nearly all were members of the primitive Aeta
tribes; two-thirds were Aeta children under age 4 who died from disease and
malnutrition.;   Also, the government says nearly 1.2 million people have lost
their homes, shops, farms or jobs to <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>, double the initial toll. Up to
half a million refugees have flooded into <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, increasing the overcrowded
capital's woes. More than two dozen towns and more than 200,000 acres of
farmland have been buried. Damage and rehabilitation costs, already in the
hundreds of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>, continue to grow.;   And the future is even
grimmer.;   "Unfortunately, it is going to get worse," said <PERSON>Raymundo
Punongbayan</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Institute of Volcanology</ORGANIZATION> and Seismology.
"We expect major (mudflow) danger for at least five years. So many more towns
will be affected.";   Scientists say <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s eruption ejected an
astonishing 8 billion cubic meters of ash, sand and rocks, or enough to bury
463 square miles nearly 23 feet deep. The volcano has largely stopped
erupting, but most of the debris still sits on the upper slopes, threatening
to unleash massive, deadly avalanches each time it rains.;   So far, after two
months of almost daily rainfall, less than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the debris has washed
down the eight rivers that drain the mountain. Up to half of the rest is
expected to roar down in coming rainy seasons. Some areas along the crowded
eastern slopes and below may be endangered and uninhabitable for a decade.;   
Not much can be done. Officials say it is senseless to rebuild most of the
bridges and roads, for example, since massive silting from the mudflows has
filled riverbeds, forcing the water over the banks. Emergency dredging and
dikes have fought a losing battle against the power of nature.;   "It's not
only a waste of money, it's a waste of time," said <PERSON>Bren Guiao</PERSON>, governor of
<LOCATION>Pampanga</LOCATION> province, one of three bearing the brunt of the mudflows.;   "No one
really knows what to do," agreed a Western expert who has studied the problem.
"It's an unstable environment. The rivers move with each major rain. We call
it the windshield effect. They're meandering back and forth.";   Thigh-deep
muddy water fills the streets of <LOCATION>Bacolor</LOCATION>, for example, a once-prosperous
trading center of 67,000 people 22 miles south of Pinatubo that escaped major
damage during the <DATE>June</DATE> eruption. In the <DATE>last month</DATE>, however, mud has buried
some neighborhoods 15 feet deep. Floods have ruined much of the rest, forcing
most residents to flee.;   "Every time it rains upstream, we get mud and
floods here," said <PERSON>Efren Blanco</PERSON>, a city official. "The town proper has become
a river.";   An all-out effort to contain the mudflows with structural dams
and dikes would cost <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> that the impoverished <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>
doesn't have. As a result, <PERSON>Balingit</PERSON> has been forced to make Solomon-like
decisions, ordering that protective dikes be built to funnel mud into three
already buried barrios. That action sparked repeated protests from villagers
armed with guns and machetes, angry that their ancestral land is being
sacrificed.;   <PERSON>Balingit</PERSON> said, "I cannot blame them, but I must decide for the
good of the majority.";   TENS OF thousands of people have built shantytowns
and makeshift tent camps along raised roads, often without medical care or
relief goods. More than 150,000 others still are crammed into government
evacuation centers.;   <PERSON>Mariano Suniga</PERSON>, a burly 59-year-old tailor from <LOCATION>Santa
Inez</LOCATION>, stands outside one evacuation center, hoping for answers. His wife has
been in the hospital since mud buried their barrio in mid-July. "She is in
shock," he said. "She became too nervous from the mud."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  U.S. and Philippine negotiators agreed Wednesday that the Americans will give
up Clark Air Base next year but can keep their naval station at Subic Bay for

<HEADLINE>  U.S. TO LEAVE CLARK BASE, KEEP SUBIC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     News that the Americans were leaving <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, one of the oldest and largest
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases overseas, came as a shock to residents of nearby cities.;    About
27,000 Filipinos depend on <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> for their livelihoods, and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>
estimates the two bases together pumped about <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> into the Philippine
economy through salaries and spending by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops and their families.;   
Both installations, whose leases expire <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE>, were heavily damaged when
the Mount Pinatubo volcano, 10 miles west of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, began erupting last month
for the first time in 600 years.;    The volcano continued to spew ash over
both bases <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, forcing international and domestic airports to close in
<LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>, 60 miles to the south.;    Agreement on the future of the bases came
after 14 months of talks, which resumed after chief <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON>Richard
Armitage</PERSON> arrived <DATE>Monday</DATE> for the first time since the eruptions began.;    "We
have reached agreement on all major issues," <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON>Stanley Schrager</PERSON>
told reporters Wednesday.;    <PERSON>Schrager</PERSON> said <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> would be turned over to the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> "not later than <DATE>Sept. 16, 1992</DATE>." That gives the Americans one year
for cleanup operations before the base reverts to the Philippine military.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION> also suffered heavy damage from <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> but is located about 25
miles from the volcano, well beyond the 12-mile danger zone.;    The two sides
agreed that a joint committee would decide later how long the Americans can
take to vacate Subic at the end of the agreement. That left open the
possibility that the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> could remain there longer than 10 years.;    In
the joint statement, the sides said the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> will receive <MONEY>$360 million</MONEY>
for both bases during the next fiscal year, a figure already submitted to
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> by the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration.;    The agreement faces an uncertain
future in the <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which resumes sessions <DATE>Monday</DATE> after an annual
vacation. Before the eruptions, more than half the senators expressed
opposition to any extension of the leases.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
anytime," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  </LEADPARA>

(publ. 6/12/91, pg. 2A);  Because of an editor's error, a story in Tuesday's
editions may have been misleading about the location of Mount Lassen. It is in
the Cascade Range, a continuation of the Sierra Nevada.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep
across adjoining <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, he said. Also in peril are the 350,000
residents of <LOCATION>Angeles City</LOCATION>, where the air base is located, about 50 miles north
of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is
likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;    Scientists
doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same
time as the Mount Unzen volcano in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, he said.;    The five <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION>
scientists are among the few remaining people at <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, which was
evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.;    The
researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today 
moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano,
where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION> is typical
of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire" on the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> coasts
of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>. (These volcanoes -- including <LOCATION>Mount Lassen</LOCATION> in the
<LOCATION>Sierra Nevada</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Mount Rainier</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Cascade Range</ORGANIZATION> --
arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath
another.);    <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have
yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as <LOCATION>Mount St.
Helens</LOCATION> did when it erupted in <DATE>1980</DATE>. Until volcanologists' attention was drawn
to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this <DATE>spring</DATE>, it had not
been studied well.;    Waves of hot ash;  Other recent volcanoes that erupted
on the same scale were <LOCATION>El Chichon</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Nevado del Ruiz</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985.</DATE>;    If it does have a massive eruption, <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s primary
means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash
-- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing
and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a really big eruption,
all of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> could be covered" with glowing ash, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.; 
  Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal. That
is what killed 38 people in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> <DATE>last week.</DATE>;    Risk to planes;  Such ash
also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON>
said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on
radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the
grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base. But winds of
the <DATE>summer</DATE> monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash
directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity -- measured by
seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system
-- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON>
said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's
slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days they fly above
the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    No link to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>;  Their
predictions might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst
already. But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur
emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military
could return to the base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's
activity could be linked to the volcano in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, which is of comparable
size.;    "No reputable scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between
the two, <PERSON>Lipman</PERSON> said.;    More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical
time, he noted. "Two out of 500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>

Bureaucratic delays kept <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON> from arriving at <ORGANIZATION>Nevado de Ruiz</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>
until a day after its <DATE>1985</DATE> eruption. Harlow and his team predicted the <DATE>1989</DATE>
eruption of Redoubt Volcano in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, but few lives were threatened in the
remote area.;    <DATE>Three weeks ago</DATE>, <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON> joined a team of five <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological
Survey</ORGANIZATION> scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast
the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. One
crew gathered evidence of <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION>'s earlier eruptions as clues to its
potential power.;    <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON>'s team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs
around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly
pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption
is imminent.;    <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> followed an almost textbook pattern over the past
six weeks. Gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas,
the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more
than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the
narrow valleys west of the volcano.;    <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION>
officials ordered evacuations Monday.;    Since late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON>'s

bunker at <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, but do not believe the team is in danger. The
eruption is on the west side of the mountain, with the summit shielding <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>.
Prevailing winds are also away from the base.;    "I'm not so concerned," said
<PERSON>Pauline Lord</PERSON>, <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON>'s wife. "My husband is not unaccustomed to danger.";   
<PERSON>Lord</PERSON> said <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON>'s love affair with volcanoes began when he was an
undergraduate student at <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> and his professor took the entire
class to observe an eruption in <LOCATION>Guatemala.</LOCATION>;    "He's somebody who's fascinated
by that kind of energy," said <PERSON>Lord</PERSON>, a psychotherapist who has accompanied
Harlow to several volcanoes. "It's wonderful to see that lava sloshing
around.";    <PERSON>Harlow</PERSON>'s 5-year-old daughter, <PERSON>Megan</PERSON>, is not worried about her
father.;    "She knows Daddy is in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and that he's fixing a

Two months ago, when the drama began, scientists knew almost nothing about
this drowsy Philippine giant, swaddled in thick jungle and ignored by the
hundreds of thousands of people living around its flanks.;    They didn't know
it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the <DATE>1980</DATE> eruption
of <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> -- or that the debris from these eruptions
had covered much of what was now <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base.</ORGANIZATION>;    But with the first small
signs of trouble, researchers went on alert, throwing a network of instruments
around the restless mountain. And in a few frenzied weeks of investigation,
they learned enough to recommend evacuation of some 84,000 people.;    The
warning came just in time. A series of violent eruptions has rocked the
mountain since <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, blowing ash and pumice 80,000 feet in the air and
sifting volcanic grit over villages 90 miles away. At least 101 people have
been killed, 150,000 Filipinos have crowded into refugee centers in <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> and
20,000 American military dependents and civilian workers are being evacuated
from the country. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said the damage may lead them to permanently
close <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base.</ORGANIZATION>;    On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, scientists said much of the pressure
inside the volcano had dissipated and the worst may be over.;    Although
Pinatubo never erupted into the cataclysmic blow-up that some had feared, the
damage and death toll from related earthquakes, mudslides and falling ash and
pumice could have been far higher had scientists not recommended evacuation.
The successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has
come in the past decade.;    The basics are the same. Researchers still use
seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and
bulging of the ground that often spell danger.;    But the technology has
improved immensely:;    (check) Instruments are cheaper and more expendable,
so they can be deployed where they will do the most good -- right in the path
of the volcano's fury.;    (check) The instruments continually beam data to
scientists who are waiting a safe distance away. Before, they had to visit
their instruments and collect the data by hand.;    (check) Information is
routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation
quickly -- and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of
volcanoes.;    Researchers have also made strides in interpreting what they
see. "Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads," said <PERSON>Peter Lipman</PERSON>, a
volcanologist with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Geological Survey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Menlo Park.</LOCATION>;    These skills
were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the
past decade.;    "The <DATE>1980s</DATE> was a very interesting decade because of the
number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring
information," said <PERSON>Steven Brantley</PERSON>, a geologist with the survey's <ORGANIZATION>Cascades
Volcano Observatory</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION> "It was a rather remarkable decade,
really.";    Scientists say the eruption of <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION>, which killed 57
people and caused <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in property damage, triggered a renaissance in
volcano research.;    It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and
prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and
monitoring, said geologist <PERSON>Robert Tilling</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Menlo Park.</LOCATION>;    As a
result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories. One, in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
keeps track of active volcanoes in the <LOCATION>Cascades Range</LOCATION> of the <LOCATION>Pacific Northwest</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mount Rainier</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mount
Hood</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mount Baker</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mount Shasta</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mount Lassen</ORGANIZATION>. The second is in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>,
where Redoubt Volcano put on a spectacular show in <DATE>1989</DATE> and <DATE>1990</DATE>. A third
observatory has been operating in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> since 1912.;    American scientists
have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world,
from Galunggung in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Nevado</LOCATION> del Ruiz in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, improving their
ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards. Such a quick response is crucial
because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been
adequately investigated and monitored.;    "Now," <PERSON>Tilling</PERSON> said, "we can go in
there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data
within a day or two.";    The blossoming research has in turn spurred
development of cheaper and more rugged instruments.;    Take tiltmeters.;   
Like glorified carpenters' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and
tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface.;    A
decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each. But after <ORGANIZATION>Mount St. Helens</ORGANIZATION>
blew, scientists looked for cheaper models. One was developed by <PERSON>James
Westphal</PERSON>, a well-known astronomer and gadgeteer at the <ORGANIZATION>California Institute of
Technology</ORGANIZATION>, who patterned it after an idea used in missile guidance systems.
Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped
out in eruptions.;    The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as
scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying.;    "Volcanoes are
probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet," said
<PERSON>Bernard Chouet</PERSON>, a seismologist at the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Menlo Park.</LOCATION>;    It's not unusual
for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes -- but those quakes can
have a variety of causes. Most are innocuous, caused by the cracking of rock
above pools of magma that, for the moment, aren't going anywhere. But others
are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation
for an eruption.;    In the past few years, <PERSON>Chouet</PERSON> said, seismologists have
learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way.
These patterns were successfully used to forecast the <DATE>1989</DATE> eruption of <ORGANIZATION>Redoubt
Volcano</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo.;    But even
though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake
forecasts, they're far from foolproof.;    Some volcanoes give virtually no
warning. Even when they do, the decision to evacuate is difficult and
expensive. In the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, for instance, vandals looted parts of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air
Base</ORGANIZATION> that were left unguarded. Factories and businesses shut down; crops and
livestock were left unattended.;    This time the evacuation paid off,
possibly averting a number of deaths. But it won't always. In the end, every
volcano is a rugged individualist, with its own distinct patterns of activity.
Some wake up, make threatening noises for weeks or months, then drift back to
sleep.;    The burden of deciding whether to warn the public weighs heavily on
scientists.;    <PERSON>Randall White</PERSON>, another seismologist with the <ORGANIZATION>USGS</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Menlo
Park</LOCATION>, recalled how he felt while working near the freezing summit of
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s Nevado del Ruiz six years ago.;    Struggling to hear their
instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues
warned local officials that an eruption was on its way. But their warnings
were vain. For reasons that are still unclear, the officials did not order an
evacuation, and 22,000 people died after lava spewed from the volcano, melting
glaciers and forming devastating mudslides.;    "I found it nerve-racking,"
White said. "We were literally afraid to go to sleep at night, thinking that
some technician would get the interpretation (of the incoming data) wrong, and
a lot of people would die.";  Tools give clues that can save lives;    The
basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were
10 years ago. Scientists can move in fast and set up instruments that
continually broadcast readings, which are then analyzed by computer. This
allows quicker evaluation of volcano hazards -- and forecasts that can save
lives.; 1. Surveying: Researchers measure the volcano, with optical
instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as
a result of magma rising inside. They also put tiltmeters near the volcano's
vent to record changes in the slope of the ground.; 2. Pick and shovel:
Geologists dig through layers of old ash and lava to determine how often a
volcano erupted in the past -- a clue to what it might do in the future. The
thicker and more extensive the deposit, the bigger the eruption.; 3.
Seismometer: Measures ground shaking. Volcanoes often produce swarms of small
earthquakes. Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from
those caused by magma rising toward the surface -- a sign of impending
eruption.; 4. Spectrometer: First developed to measure pollutants from factory
smokestacks, it is now also used to measure sulfur dioxide in the smoke
belched by volcanoes. Increasing levels of the gas may signal an impending
eruption. The amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano,
and thus the potential size of the eruption.;    Sources: <PERSON>Robert Tilling</PERSON> and

<LEADPARA>  The top commander of U.S. forces in the Philippines said Wednesday that the
United States intends to keep two major military bases that have been heavily
damaged by volcanic eruptions and plans to start rebuilding them next month.; 
  "My mission is to put it back together exactly the way it was," Rear Adm.

<TEXT>     Mercer, the base's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> commander, said he hoped that many dependents
evacuated to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> after <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>'s most powerful eruption
<DATE>June 15</DATE> would be able to return in <LOCATION>July.</LOCATION>;    The optimistic assessment came as
the volcano, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION> and 10 miles west of <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air
Base</ORGANIZATION>, continued to spout plumes of ash more than six miles high and rocked the
area with frequent earth tremors.;    More than 330 Filipinos have been
reported killed by the volcanic discharges, most of them crushed in homes and
buildings that collapsed under the weight of falling ash.;    With falling ash
near <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> preventing air operations and expected to continue up to a year or
more, the future of the huge air base is in doubt, diplomats have said.
Dependents of <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> personnel living on or near the base have been sent
back to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. All but about 2,500 of the 7,000 service personnel
assigned there have been evacuated, and the few aircraft that were still based
at <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> have been flown elsewhere.;    At <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, which is considered a more
vital installation, some facilities are operating despite a heavy ash fall.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; CLEANUP; FORECAST; PHILIPPINES  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  As thousands of U.S. military dependents left bases covered with ash from
Mount Pinatubo, Filipinos today confronted monumental chores that began with
securing clean drinking water.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said the volcano was
"simmering down" after a week of violent eruptions.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MONUMENTAL CLEANUP IS NEEDED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Significant, critical eruptions are probably over," the institute
announced.;    <PERSON>Punongbayan</PERSON> said he might recommend reducing the 25-mile danger
zone around the volcano, but he cautioned that <ORGANIZATION>Pinatubo</ORGANIZATION> remained a threat. The
institute said it would continue its alert at least until the volcano had
remained quiet for a week.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Philippine Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> said at least 101
people have been killed since the 4,795-foot volcano began spewing ash, steam
and super-heated rocks <DATE>June 9</DATE> for the first time in 600 years.;    Most of the
victims were killed in a huge explosion <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that dumped ash as far as 375
miles away. The damage was aggravated by rains, and scores of buildings
collapsed in nearby towns and cities.;    At least 20 people were missing
today. Relief efforts have been complicated by impassable roads and ash clouds
that grounded aircraft all weekend.;    <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON>Eduardo Ermita</PERSON>
said food was in short supply in the affected areas and water supplies had
been polluted by ash. Officials ordered <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION>'s fire department to transport
drinking water to towns hit hardest by the volcano.;    In <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, a volcano
that claimed at least 39 lives earlier this month burst back to life <DATE>today</DATE>,
sending a torrent of hot rocks down the mountainside and spewing ash over a
hot springs resort.;    There were no reports of casualties from the latest
blast of <LOCATION>Mount Unzen</LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION>Meteorological Agency</ORGANIZATION> warned of the likelihood
of additional eruptions of lava chunks and super-heated gas and rocks.;   
Since the fatal <DATE>June 3</DATE> blast, volcanic ash from <ORGANIZATION>Mount Unzen</ORGANIZATION> has blanketed the
town of Shimabara at the eastern foot of the 4,480-foot volcano, 610 miles
southwest of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  US; NAVY; END; PHILIPPINES; MILITARY; FACILITY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The Philippines said today that the U.S. Navy will withdraw from Subic Bay
Naval Base by the end of 1992, closing the largest American naval installation
in East Asia and the last American base in this former U.S. colony.;  
President Corazon Aquino's chief aide, Franklin Drilon, made the announcement
at a news conference after he and U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner failed to iron
out differences, including Manila's ban on nuclear weapons at the facility.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  U.S. NAVY TO ABANDON SUBIC BAY BY END OF 1992,
PHILIPPINES SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The friendly and cordial relations between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the
<LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> will continue," <PERSON>Drilon</PERSON> said. "Both governments will continue to
build on this strong bond of friendship between the two countries.";   The
announcement ends nearly a century of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military presence in this country,
which began when the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> seized the islands from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in 1898.;  
<ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base</ORGANIZATION>, the other major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> installation, was closed last month after
it was damaged by the eruption of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Drilon</PERSON> said there was
nothing to preclude future talks on a longer withdrawal after a new Philippine
government takes office <DATE>June 30.</DATE>;   But <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials have indicated that
further talks are unlikely and that they will begin pulling out troops in
strength after the base's three dependent schools close <DATE>June 12.</DATE>;   No
immediate comment was available from Washington.;   The 60,000-acre base 50
miles west of <LOCATION>Manila</LOCATION> has about 5,800 troops and 4,500 dependents.;   Closing
of the base will cost thousands of Filipinos their jobs. Most of the 300,000
residents of <LOCATION>Olongapo</LOCATION>, adjacent to <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, rely on the base for their
livelihood.;   Nearby Zambales province is reeling from the devastating
effects of the <DATE>June</DATE> eruptions of <LOCATION>Mount Pinatubo</LOCATION>, which damaged <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION> and
forced the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to abandon <ORGANIZATION>Clark Air Base.</ORGANIZATION>;   In <DATE>September</DATE> the
<ORGANIZATION>Philippine Senate</ORGANIZATION> rejected a 10-year lease for <ORGANIZATION>Subic</ORGANIZATION> in return for <MONEY>$203
million</MONEY> in annual aid.;   The <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> insisted the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> honor
constitutional prohibitions against nuclear weapons on Philippine soil and
also provide a detailed plan for withdrawing.;   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> refuses to
say whether nuclear weapons are stored at <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, although it is widely assumed
that ships calling at the port carry them.;   Philippine officials noted that
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> already had pledged to remove tactical nuclear weapons from
surface warships.;   <LOCATION>Subic</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s major supply and repair facility in the
western <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>, provided logistical support for <ORGANIZATION>Seventh Fleet</ORGANIZATION> operations in
the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>.  </TEXT>
