NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: ARE PRENATAL VITAMINS ESSENTIAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> recommended, in a report published last 
week, that pregnant women avoid multivitamin supplements and instead get the 
extra nutrients they need from a balanced diet, it came as a great surprise to 
many women. 
</P>
<P>
Some said they would agree to consult with their physicians but believed 
supplements were necessary as insurance. Others said they would outright refuse 
to heed the advice, which they viewed as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"I take a prenatal vitamin, plus extra calcium and iron supplements," said 
<PERSON>Aimee Oswald</PERSON>, a medical receptionist whose baby is due in <DATE>November</DATE>, "because 
sometimes you can't eat all the right foods. When you're sick you have to eat 
what looks good to you. . .sometimes I have a hard time just getting crackers 
down. I refuse to give mine (vitamins) up. I need them." 
</P>
<P>
This reaction to the recommendations of the 11-member panel of medical and 
nutrition experts and an auxiliary committee of specialists is not unusual. 
Since obstetricians commonly prescribe prenatal vitamins to expectant mothers 
to ensure nutritional adequacy, many people believe the pills are essential for 
delivery of a healthy baby. 
</P>
<P>
Some research has even shown that those women who take multivitamin supplements 
containing folic acid around the time of conception have a reduced chance of 
having a baby with a defect of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
This birth defect, also called a neural tube defect, occurs when the neural 
tube, a pre-embryonic structure that develops into the spine and the brain 
during the third and fourth week of pregnancy, fails to close completely. 
</P>
<P>
It effects an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 newborns each year. And although there 
is no known exact cause, experts believe the mother's nutritional status and 
other environmental factors may interact with her genetic predisposition and 
increase risk for the defect. 
</P>
<P>
But lacking sufficient evidence of a direct link, the government committee 
concluded that, "there is not enough evidence to recommend a folic acid 
supplement to all women of child-bearing age." 
</P>
<P>
It is known that folic acid has a role in development of red blood cells and 
genetic material in body cells. Anemia can even result when folic acid intake 
is inadequate. During pregnancy the requirement for folic acid (also known as 
folate and folacin) does increase, but the question of supplementation to 
reduce risk for birth defects is "quite a different issue," according to the 
chairman of the government committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ordinary clinical sense the neural tube defect has occured almost by 
the time that a woman is aware that she is pregnant," said <PERSON>Dr. Roy Pitkin</PERSON>, 
department of obstetrics and gynecology at the <ORGANIZATION>UCLA School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>, who 
chaired the committee. "If she waits until she knows (she is pregnant) to 
institute vitamin therapy -- even if it is effective -- then it will be too 
late. All of these studies that have examined (the connection) have involved 
women who were already taking multivitamins before conception." 
</P>
<P>
The panel did, however, call for studies to determine a relationship between 
multivitamin supplements and birth defects. The <ORGANIZATION>Spina Bifida Assn. of America</ORGANIZATION> 
last week also made this recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Until all the data is in, the committee said that careful menu planning can 
help achieve achieve adequate nourishment for mother and fetus through diet. 
Food is the preferred source of folic acid and many other nutrients -- except 
iron -- the committee said because most women typically fail to meet the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance through diet. A low-dose ferrous iron supplement 
of 30 milligrams is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Women of child-bearing age are encouraged to eat "adequate" amounts of fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains and legumes -- all good sources of folate. A new <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> publication can explain just how much is "adequate." 
</P>
<P>
"Good Sources of Nutrients," lists the top sources of 16 vitamins and minerals 
and dietary fiber -- and both folic acid and iron are among them. It also gives 
information on how to prepare and store foods to avoid nutrient loss, explains 
serving sizes and tells why each vitamin or mineral is important. 
</P>
<P>
"This information will help consumers select a variety of foods that provide 
the vitamins, minerals and fiber they need," said Sue <PERSON>Ann Ritchko</PERSON>, 
administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Human Nutrition Information Service</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Since folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, it is easily destroyed during 
preparation, cooking and storage, so fruits and vegetables should be served raw 
whenever possible. Or, they can be steamed, boiled or simmered in a minimal 
amount of liquid. Store vegetables in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some good sources of folic acid according to the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>. Raw forms of 
some vegetables are not included, because in their raw state they don't contain 
enough folic acid. For example, a 1/2-cup cooked serving of beets contains more 
than the same amount of the vegetable raw. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the term "good source" is based on the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> of 400 micrograms daily for a 
pregnant woman. Desirable intakes for women, men and children, which are less, 
would be about half. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>: three ounces braised beef or calf 
liver, 1/2 cup cooked black-eyed peas or 1/2 cup cooked lentils. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 25 to <PERCENT>29%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>: one ounce fortified 
ready-to-eat cereal -- depending upon the brand (check the label), 1/2 cup 
cooked spinach, three ounces pork or 1/2 cup cooked red kidney beans. 
</P>
<P>
The following foods supply 10 to <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>: one whole-wheat English 
muffin; one small whole-wheat pita-bread round; two tablespoons plain wheat 
germ; 3/4 cup grapefruit and orange juice frozen, reconstituted; 3/4 cup fresh 
or frozen reconstituted orange juice; one medium artichoke cooked; 1/2 cup 
cooked asparagus, beets, broccoli, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> sprouts, cauliflower, Chinese 
cabbage, cream-style corn, mustard greens, okra, parsnips, green peas, spinach 
or turnip greens; one cup raw endive, chicory, escarole, romaine or spinach; 
three ounces steamed crab meat; 1/2 cup cooked bayo, black, brown, calico, 
garbanzo, lima, Mexican, pinto, white beans or split yellow or green peas. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> package also includes fact sheets on Vitamins A, E, C, B-6, B-12, 
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, 
phosphorous, potassium and dietary fiber.

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The multivitamin supplements that many women
take during pregnancy aren't generally necessary, because
proper diets can provide most of the nutrients expectant
mothers need, an Institute of Medicine study concluded.
   A lengthy study by medical and nutritional experts found
that "iron is the only known nutrient for which requirements
cannot be met reasonably by diet alone." It recommends
low-dose iron supplements during pregnancy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the study takes a more relaxed view of weight
gain during pregnancy, saying that increases in the range of
25 to 35 pounds are appropriate for women of normal
prepregnancy weight. The new range is an increase from the 20
to 25 pounds suggested 20 years ago.
   These recommendations, which are in line with existing
standards, aren't likely to have much impact on current
practices. Taking multivitamin supplements, which include
iron, during pregnancy "is a deeply ingrained custom; it's
generally regarded, particularly by patients, as something
that you do," said <PERSON>Roy Pitkin</PERSON>, the chairman of the medical
school and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. Dr. Pitkin headed the
study for the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with
the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>.
   However, <PERSON>Dr. Pitkin</PERSON> suggested that part of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s
report, entitled "Nutrition During Pregnancy," could moderate
growing interest in the so-called periconceptional use of
vitamin supplements -- their use in a span of several months
immediately before and after conception. Several recent
studies have reported the periconceptional use of vitamin
supplements containing folate, or folic acid, may provide
some protection against neural tube defects, which can cause
such birth defects as spina bifida. But the study concluded
that there isn't enough evidence to support a recommendation
for periconceptional use of vitamins.
   The vitamin industry promptly attacked the panel's
finding. <PERSON>J.B. Cordaro</PERSON>, president of an industry group called
the <ORGANIZATION>Council for Responsible Nutrition</ORGANIZATION>, said, "This
outrageously anti-health report potentially dooms thousands
of children to an early death or at best substantial
disability due to serious birth defects." The <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> said
there is "growing evidence that women who take multivitamins
containing folic acid as part of their normal life style have
a signficantly lower risk" of having babies with neural tube
defects.
   The panel recommended further research on the connection
between multivitamins containing folate and neural tube
disease. In the meantime, it suggested that women of
childbearing age increase their consumption of fruits,
vegetables, legumes and whole-grain breads and cereals, all
good sources of folate.
   The study, which was sponsored by the maternal and child
health bureau of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>,
recommends that women of normal prepregnancy weight who are
carrying single fetuses aim for a weight gain of about one
pound a week during the second and third trimesters.
   Its recommendation is somewhat higher than the 22 to 27
pound range suggested by the <ORGANIZATION>American College of
Obstetricians</ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists, but it's in line with the
weight-gain many physicians feel comfortable with, <PERSON>Dr. Pitkin</PERSON>
said. Over the last few decades, physicians have become more
relaxed about weight gain during pregnancy. In general,
larger weight gain reduces the number of low birth-weight
babies, but it also can make it more difficult for mothers to
lose weight after pregnancy, the report warned.
   The report notes that women of less than normal weight
should gain in the range of 28 to 40 pounds.
   Although the report recommends against the use of
multivitamin supplements for most women, it says that
high-risk groups -- women who are malnourished or carrying
more than one baby, along with smokers and drug and alcohol
abusers -- should take supplements.
   The college agrees multivitamin supplements aren't
necessary for healthy women on well-balanced diets. However,
unlike the institute, the group recommends supplements of
folic acid, as well as iron.
   Leading multivitamin supplements for pregnant women are:
Materna from the <ORGANIZATION>Lederle Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION>American
Cyanamid Co.</ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Natalins</ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Mead Johnson</ORGANIZATION> division of
<ORGANIZATION>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</ORGANIZATION>; and Stuartnatal and <PERSON>Stuart Prenatal</PERSON>
from <PERSON>Stuart Pharmaceuticals</PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION>ICI Americas Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>ICI</ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Kate Ruddon</PERSON>, an official of the college, agreed that
another finding that multivitamin supplements aren't
necessary won't change use patterns. "Our recommendations
have been around for a long time, and most fellows of the
college know what they are and most still recommend a
multivitamin supplement," she explained.

<HEAD>Multivitamin Use in Early Pregnancy Linked to Fewer Spinal Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing
folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear
babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new
study concludes.
   The birth defects were about one-fourth as common among babies
whose mothers took the over-the-counter vitamins than among babies
whose mothers didn't take vitamins, according to a report in
today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the
vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the
researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid
when they first start trying to conceive.
   The defects include spina bifida, in which incomplete closing of
the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or
severe paralysis. Another spinal column defect is anencephaly, in
which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs
within hours.
   Such defects occur in about 4,000 babies a year, or 1 to 2 in
1,000.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> report was based on a three-year study of
22,776 women, about half of whom took multivitamins containing
folic acid.
   The occurrence of spinal column defects was 0.9 per 1,000, among
babies whose mothers took the vitamins, compared to 3.3 per 1,000
among infants born to women who didn't use supplements.
   The study was conducted by <PERSON>Dr. Aubrey Milunsky</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Human Genetics</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Boston University School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> and
colleagues.
   ``We believe that the combined data from this and other studies
provide good evidence that folic acid-containing multivitamins
taken during the first six weeks of pregnancy will prevent'' spinal
column defects, the authors wrote.
   The study doesn't prove folic acid prevents birth defects, said
one expert, <PERSON>Dr. Lewis B. Holmes</PERSON>, a professor of pediatrics at
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard Medical School</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Is it the vitamin itself. ... or are these women doing other
things?'' Holmes asked.
   Discussing the implications, <PERSON>Milunsky</PERSON> noted most pregnant women
see their doctors for the first time 8 to 10 weeks after conception.
   ``Almost all the fetal organs have been formed at that time,''
he said. ``An opportunity for useful intervention would have been
lost.''
   The function of folic acid _ found naturally in liver, leafy
green vegetables, mushrooms, and lima and kidney beans _ isn't
really known, <PERSON>Milunsky</PERSON> said.
   Studies haven't ruled out the possibility that vitamins A, C, D
or E _ alone or with folic acid _ protect against the defects,
since all were contained in most of the multivitamins, the
researchers noted.
   The researchers also cautioned that excessive doses of
multivitamins could be harmful.
   Researchers noted a ``strikingly higher'' prevalence of the
defects _ 13 per 1,000 _ among infants of women with a family
history of spinal conditions who didn't take supplements, compared
to women with such histories who did _ 3.5 per 1,000.
   The study group _ mostly white and well-educated _ wasn't
statistically representative of the population.
   The frequency of spinal column defects is higher among poor
whites and lower among blacks, <PERSON>Mulinsky</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Kids Tend To Be Better Nourished If They Eat Breakfast Cereal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writers</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ready-to-eat cold cereals provide lots of
nutrients, and children who eat them tend to be better nourished
than those who breakfast on other foods, according to a study of
hundreds of 1- to 5-year-olds.
   University of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> nutritionist <PERSON>Gretchen Hill</PERSON> said her study
shows ``kids can get a good breakfast on their own by getting the
cereal box and some milk.''
   Hill, who presented her study <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during the annual meeting
of the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</ORGANIZATION>,
said the research didn't suggest that cold cereal was the only good
breakfast.
   Parents who feed their children well-balanced breakfasts _
fruit, toast, low-fat milk, some bacon and only three eggs weekly _
shouldn't change, she said.
   ``But if you're lazy and have to choose between doughnuts and
cereal, provide the cereal,'' especially with low-fat milk, she
said. ``The data was very clear that there are a lot of nutrients
in that breakfast they might not get enough of in some other
breakfast.''
   Even a leading critic of sugar in breakfast cereals agreed with
the study's conclusion.
   ``Cold cereal is a good breakfast. But giving your child a
fortified cereal is like giving them a vitamin pill,'' said <PERSON>Bonnie
Liebman</PERSON>, nutrition director for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Center for
Science</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Public Interest</ORGANIZATION>.
   While most cereals are fortified, ``parents should still try to
choose the most healthful breakfast cereals _ those relatively low
in sugar and those that are whole grain,'' <PERSON>Liebman</PERSON> said.
   Hill used data collected in l985 by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> for her study of 27 dietary components _ including
calories, protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber _ consumed during
all three meals and snacks by 548 children ages 1 to 5 nationwide.
   Eleven skipped breakfast. Of the others, about half ate
ready-to-eat cereals. The half that didn't eat cereals wasn't
divided as to whether the children ate balanced breakfasts or not
because Hill simply wanted to know how the average cereal eater did
compared with other children.
   Cereal eaters tended to receive significantly more vitamins A
and B12, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, iron, folic acid
and zinc than non-cereal eaters or breakfast skippers, <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> said.
Cereal eaters also ate significantly less cholesterol and fat.
   She said all three groups tended to get adequate protein and
carbohydrate, but breakfast skippers risked low-energy and future
bone ailments because they failed to meet recommended daily amounts
of thiamine, calcium and vitamin A, and ate less fiber, pyridoxine,
calcium, magnesium, zinc and copper.
   Hill's study was financed by the <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> Agricultural
Experiment Station, without support from cereal manufacturers, she
said.
   Liebman cautioned that a link between breakfast cereals and
better overall nutrition ``doesn't prove cause and effect. It's
possible these kids overall ate less fat and cholesterol because
they came from families that are more nutrition-conscious.''

YOUR BODY: STUDY SHOWS VITAMIN B MAY LOWER STROKE RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vitamin B may reduce the risk of stroke in some people, say the <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> 
researchers whose study is published today in the journal Stroke. 
</P>
<P>
But <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> stroke experts, while noting that the study has merit, say it 
is too soon to conclude that Vitamin B therapy is effective for reducing the 
risk of stroke, which afflicts a half million Americans a year. (A stroke is an 
interruption in the blood supply to the brain; nearly 150,000 victims die 
annually.) 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin B may reduce stroke risk, the <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> researchers say, by breaking down 
abnormally high levels of an amino acid called homocysteine. (Amino acids are 
the "building blocks" of proteins.) 
</P>
<P>
In their study, <PERSON>Dr. M. Rene Malinow</PERSON>, professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION>Oregon Health 
Sciences University</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, and his colleagues found high levels of 
homocysteine in one-third of 99 patients who had suffered strokes, transient 
ischemic attacks (a stroke "warning"), or who were at high stroke risk because 
of high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking or hardening of the arteries. The 
homocysteine levels in these 33 patients were 1.5 times higher than levels in 
31 healthy control subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how this elevated homocysteine may increase stroke risk isn't known, 
according to <PERSON>Malinow</PERSON>, who said four or five other studies have suggested the 
same association between elevated homocysteine and increased stroke risk. One 
possibility: "The elevated levels of homocysteine may injure the endothelial 
cells lining the blood vessels," said <PERSON>Malinow</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Malinow believes the blood test to measure homocysteine, now available only at 
a handful of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> facilities, should be more widely available. Until then, 
<PERSON>Malinow</PERSON> says, consumers at high risk of stroke might consider requesting this 
test. If their homocysteine levels are elevated, and pernicious anemia (caused 
by a Vitamin B-12 deficiency) has been ruled out, taking Vitamin B may be wise. 
He recommends two milligrams a day of folic acid, which is a member of the B 
vitamin family. 
</P>
<P>
"One or two milligrams of folic acid a day probably won't hurt, providing there 
is no pernicious anemia (the symptoms of which may be masked by taking folic 
acid)," said <PERSON>Dr. Richard Wright</PERSON>, senior staff cardiologist at <ORGANIZATION>St. John's 
Hospital and Health Center</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, emphasizing that the concept needs 
further study. "We need more study about the effects of folic acid therapy not 
just on amino acid levels, but on stroke prevention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. <PERSON>Mark Fisher</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> associate professor of neurology, agreed: "I don't believe 
that increased levels of homocysteine represent a proven independent risk 
factor for stroke. It's a good study, but bears further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Until more evidence is gathered, consumers can concentrate on tried-and-true 
stroke prevention measures, <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> said. "Keep blood pressure under control," 
he said. "Don't smoke, eat a nutritious diet and exercise."

^Experts Say Pregnant Women Can Gain Weight Safely, Don`t Need
Vitamins</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Pregnant women who eat balanced diets don't
need extra vitamins and can safely gain more weight than previously
believed, according to guidelines released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by the
<ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>.
   The guidelines, based on a review of studies on nutrition, weight
gain and pregnancy, said the average woman who gains 25 to 35 pounds
during pregnancy is more apt to produce a healthy, normal-weight
baby. The study said also that, with few exceptions, vitamins and
other food supplements are of no value in pregnancy.
   In effect, said <PERSON>Lindsay Allen</PERSON>, a professor of nutrition at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Connecticut</ORGANIZATION>, the study committee concluded that <ORGANIZATION>Mother
Nature</ORGANIZATION> may know best.
   ``Women, when they are not told to restrict their diet during
pregnancy, normally gain this amount of weight (25 to 35 pounds),''
said <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON>, who was a chairman of a study subcommittee. ``What
we are doing is recognizing that dietary restriction in pregnancy is
not a good idea. Normal weight gain is better.''
   ``Evidence that the committee reviewed is the reported experience
of large groups of women,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Roy M. Pitkin</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>
obstetrician who chaired the study committee. ``In a sense, this
brings health recommendations in line with what is actually
happening.''
   Officials in the nutritional supplement industry were uick to
dispute the committee findings that said vitamin pills were of no
value in pregnancy.
   ``This outrageously anti-health report potentially dooms
thousands of children to an early death or at best substantial
disability due to serious birth defects,'' <PERSON>J.B. Cordaro</PERSON>, president
of the <ORGANIZATION>Council for Responsible Nutrition</ORGANIZATION>, a vitamin industry
organization, said in a statement. ``This report is a recipe for
risk and the people who prepared the report must be held accountable
for any potential harm which may come from following their advice.''
   Cordaro cited studies that showed some nutrients, such as folic
acid, may reduce the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube
birth defects.
   <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON> said, however, that the committee found earlier studies
to be inconclusive. Furthermore, she said, the amount of nutrient
sufficient to affect birth defect rates would be consumed in a
normal, balanced diet.
   Weight gain in pregnancy has been a major issue in medicine since
the <DATE>19th century</DATE>, when physicians believed overeating led to large
babies and difficult labors. In recent years, most doctors have
followed guidelines established in <DATE>1970</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>National Research
Council</ORGANIZATION> that advised women to gain no more than 25 pounds during
pregnancy.
   But <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON>, who gained just over 30 pounds during her own
recent pregnancy, said members of her committee studied new
statistical data that shows ``women can gain more weight and have
babies who are bigger and healthier at birth. They used this new
supporting evidence to say that weight gain should be higher than
recommended previously.''
   The report said weight gain during pregnancy should be evaluated
on an individual basis, considering the woman's height and body
type. Tall, underweight women, the study said, should gain between
28 and 40 pounds during pregnancy, while obese women should gain
only about 15 pounds. <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON> said this follows a weight gain
pattern that women seen to follow naturally.
   How fast pregnant women gain weight is important. The committee
said a gain of one pound a week is best during the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy for the average woman, while overweight
women should gain at half that rate.
   ``A smooth, steady weight gain usually is an indication of an
increase in lean and fat,'' a committee statement said. ``Sudden or
erratic gain may indicate fluid retention, a possible signal of
toxemia or other problems.''
   For normal women eating balanced diets, <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON> said vitamin
pills and other food supplements are not needed and could even be
hazardous.
   ``We find it irresponsible to suggest that supplements are needed
when we can't find any evidence that women taking healthy balanced
diets will gain any benefit from them whatsoever,'' she said.
``We've done a very thorough search of the literature and the data
are just not there to make a case that all women need the
supplementation of nutrients.''
   An exception is for iron pills.
   ``Supplements of 30 milligrams of ferrous iron are recommended
daily during the second and third trimesters'' for the general
population of pregnant women, the study said.
   But <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON> said that even iron supplements should be used with
caution since dosages above 30 milligrams interfere with the
absorption of other essential nutrients. And <PERSON>Pitkin</PERSON> said that iron
pills during the first trimester of pregnancy can aggravate nausea.
   <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON> said an excess intake of some other nutrients, such as
vitamin A, could adversely affect fetal development.
   As with weight gain, the use of supplements should be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis, the committee said.
   <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON> said added nutrients may be appropriate for women who
do not eat a balanced diet, or who are carrying more than one baby,
or for women at higher risk because of tobacco, alcohol or drug
abuse.
   Ironically, the study was released a short time after <PERSON>Ms. Allen</PERSON>
and her husband became parents.
   ``I gained 31 pounds _ well within the guidelines,'' she said.
   The study was organized by the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> for the
<ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>. Both are organizations affiliated with the
<ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, a private organization chartered by
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to advise on scientific issues.

<HEAD>Kellogg Takes Nabisco to Court Over Shredded Wheat Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg Co.</ORGANIZATION> is taking <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco Brands</ORGANIZATION>
to court over shredded wheat, contending <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> is trying to crush
<PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON>'s plans to introduce a more nutritious cereal.
   Kellogg has been planning since <DATE>June</DATE> to put its Whole Grain
Shredded Wheat on the market this month with the claim it's ``very
simply, the most nutritious shredded wheat you can buy.''
   The company contends the shredded wheat has <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> more
dietary fiber and more thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, iron, vitamins
B6 and B12, folic acid, magnesium and zinc _ with no sugar or salt
_ than the famous shredded wheat manufactured for 89 years by <ORGANIZATION>New
Jersey-based Nabisco Brands</ORGANIZATION>, a division of RJR-Nabisco.
   But on <DATE>July 27</DATE>, attorneys for <PERSON>Nabisco</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION> that it, too,
had developed a more nutritious shredded wheat _ with nearly
identical nutritional value as the new Kellogg product _ that would
be on the market in <DATE>mid-August</DATE>.
   Nabisco sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION>, saying the <ORGANIZATION>Battle Creek</ORGANIZATION>
company must ``take immediate steps to avoid any false claims of
nutritional superiority for its fortified shredded wheat cereal on
packaging, advertising, point of sale and any other materials
whatsoever.''
   Instead, <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> filed suit <DATE>Aug. 3</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Kalamazoo</LOCATION>.
   The company contends <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION> had known since early <DATE>June</DATE> that
<PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> was preparing to spring the new shredded wheat onto the
market, but said nothing. Kellogg had been sending samples and
promotional materials since that time to various test markets.
   ``That <PERSON>Nabisco</PERSON> should wait for 89 years and a competitive
challenge from <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION> before manufacturing its own unsugared,
fortified shredded wheat biscuit was itself suspicious,'' the suit
says. ``But ... <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION> has learned other facts which clearly
indicate that <PERSON>Nabisco</PERSON> set out to copy both the features of and
marketing strategy behind <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg</ORGANIZATION>'s new cereal in a cynical attempt
to prevent vigorous competition in a sector of the market for
ready-to-eat cereals that it has dominated for so long.''
   Nabisco spokesman <PERSON>Mark Gutsche</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> the company denies
the charge and called the lawsuit ``a reaction to <ORGANIZATION>Nabisco</ORGANIZATION>'s own
threat of legal action.''
   He said the company's new cereal, Spoon Size Plus Shredded
Wheat, a fortified version of its regular product, already has been
sent to grocers.
   ``Nabisco is absolutely confident that <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> will be stopped
from confusing consumers that its new cereal is the most nutritious
shredded wheat,'' he said, reading from a prepared statement.
   Kellogg spokesman <PERSON>Neil Nyberg</PERSON> said the company is asking the
court to rule that its product claims are legal and that <PERSON>Nabisco</PERSON>
may not sue <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> over those claims.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SUPPLEMENTS ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BALANCED NUTRITION OF 
A GOOD DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are you among the millions of Americans who start each day with a vitamin pill? 
If so, you may do it despite knowing that your diet probably provides all the 
nutrients essential for good health, and that even the best supplement is no 
substitute for a well-planned diet. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> recently released a wide-ranging report on many 
topics related to diet and health. The report confirmed the conclusion that 
vitamins are not necessary for many people. According to evidence, daily 
vitamin or mineral supplements are neither harmful nor beneficial to the 
population at large. 
</P>
<P>
This issue made headlines throughout the country, drowning out other aspects of 
the report such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and osteoporosis. Yet despite 
all the media coverage, our guess is that American behavior has changed very 
little. And for understandable reasons. A single vitamin and mineral supplement 
is, after all, a bit of low-cost nutritional insurance for any of us, and 
particularly useful at special times -- during infancy and early childhood, 
pregnancy, lactation, for the elderly whose caloric intake may be limited and 
for many people who are ill. 
</P>
<P>
While we have a good idea of who would benefit most from supplements, we know 
little about the relationship between use and need. But we are learning. As 
part of a national survey conducted in <DATE>1986</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Health 
Statistics</ORGANIZATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>, collected data showing 
who is taking supplements and what they are taking. 
</P>
<P>
In each family interviewed over a six-month period, information about 
supplement use was obtained for one adult 18 or over and one child age two to 
six. (The findings don't include pregnant and nursing mothers, groups of 
particular interest.) 
</P>
<P>
During <DATE>1986</DATE>, over one-third of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> adults took vitamin and mineral 
supplements. Factors associated with usage included sex, race and age. Among 
adults, heaviest users were white women, ages 45 to 64. At the other extreme, 
black males 65 and older were least likely to use a vitamin and mineral 
product. Income was a great divider too. While only <PERCENT>28%</PERCENT> of those with family 
incomes under <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> took supplements, approximately <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of those whose incomes 
were over <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY> reported using them. 
</P>
<P>
Young children were also big consumers, averaging <PERCENT>43%</PERCENT> among three- to 
six-year-olds, with heavier use at the younger end. And there were differences 
by race. While <PERCENT>45%</PERCENT> of white children took a supplement, among the black 
children the figure was only <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT>. And here, income was an even bigger factor. 
Just <PERCENT>23%</PERCENT> of children ages two to six in families earning less than <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> took 
supplements, compared to <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of those whose incomes were at least <MONEY>$40,000</MONEY>. 
Higher education levels of adults were also associated with more widespread use 
by both adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
The survey collected information about types of supplements used. Regardless of 
how many supplements they took, roughly <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of adults took multivitamins. For 
more than <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> of children, the supplement of choice was a multivitamin. 
</P>
<P>
Of the single vitamins taken, Vitamin C was identified most often, by about <PERCENT>31%</PERCENT> 
of adults. Women were more likely than men to take mineral supplements, 
explained partly by the more frequent use of calcium by older women. Iron 
ranked second, and was the mineral consumed most often both by adult men and 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
Quantitatively, many Americans take much more than the Recommended Dietary 
Allowances (RDAs) in the supplements they consume. The average daily intake of 
Vitamin C for men was <PERCENT>250%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>, while that for Vitamin B-12, was <PERCENT>300%</PERCENT>. 
Among women, Vitamin E and B-12 intakes were highest, <PERCENT>250%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> for each, 
followed by thiamine (<PERCENT>225%</PERCENT>) and riboflavin (<PERCENT>217%</PERCENT>). <PERCENT>Ten percent</PERCENT> of supplement 
users consumed an average of 15 times the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> for no less than six vitamins, 
including E, C, thiamine, riboflavin, Vitamin B-6 and B-12. For <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of these men 
and women, average intake of thiamine, riboflavin, B-6 and B-12 totaled over 30 
times the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>. But why people take such huge amounts is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Use of individual minerals was not as extreme. In general, average intakes were 
less than <PERCENT>200%</PERCENT> of the RDAs. And among young children, average intake for most 
individual nutrients was between 100 and <PERCENT>200%</PERCENT> of recommended levels. 
</P>
<P>
These data illustrate on a broader scale what smaller studies have shown 
repeatedly: Many Americans take vitamin and mineral supplements that go well 
beyond the one-a-day "nutritional insurance" plan. How do supplements 
complement the diets of those who use them? What possible hazardous effects 
might befall people who continue to take massive amounts of single supplements? 
</P>
<P>
The fact that such important questions remain unanswered should convince any 
sensible person that taking supplements far in excess of recommended amounts is 
taking a risk without benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Choose Breakfast Cereals Solely for the Vitamin Content 
</P>
<P>
Question: A TV commercial I saw for a breakfast cereal showed that you'd have 
to eat boxes and boxes of other cereals to get all the vitamins you receive 
from one box of their brand. Should I choose my cereal on the basis of vitamin 
content? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. The product you describe sounds like what we call "a vitamin pill 
in a cereal bowl." That is, it contains <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Recommended Dietary 
Allowances for various vitamins and minerals. If you prefer the taste, fine. 
But there's little reason to choose it on nutritional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the science of nutrition has expanded, we are far from creating 
perfect nutrition in a pill (or in a cereal bowl, for that matter). There is 
more to being well-nourished than simply meeting the day's need for vitamins 
and minerals. For that we must depend on a varied diet stocked with fresh and 
lightly processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What causes severe food allergies? 
</P>
<P>
A: Severe or mild, the mechanism for the development of allergies is the same. 
It's also the same whether the offending substance comes from food or from 
drugs, insect venom or poison. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, it is an abnormal response to an antigen, usually a protein. In 
susceptible individuals, initial exposure induces production of an antibody 
called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. These antibodies then attach themselves 
to certain types of cells in the body, setting the stage for the next encounter 
with the offending antigen. When the substance containing this antigen is 
consumed, it links onto the IgE antibodies attached to particular types of 
cells, causing them to release large amounts of histamine and other substances. 
</P>
<P>
These substances, in turn, make blood vessels expand and leak fluids into 
surrounding tissues, prompting smooth muscles in the airways to contract. 
Resulting symptoms vary in type and severity. In the extreme, life-threatening 
anaphylactic reactions usually begin with a sensation of warmth, followed by 
severe itching, often on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The 
skin becomes flushed, hives may appear, the face may swell and breathing 
becomes difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read about a new type of vacuum-packaged prepared foods requiring 
refrigeration. The article said that while these may taste better than 
conventionally processed foods, they are potentially more of a health hazard. 
The quality sounds superior. But how great is the risk? 
</P>
<P>
A: Doubtless you are referring to what the French call sous-vide (literally 
translated as "under vacuum") foods, a method widely used in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that is 
gathering momentum here. 
</P>
<P>
The process, used for a growing number of mixed dishes, involves placing fresh 
ingredients in plastic pouches and vacuuming out air. Some manufacturers also 
add either nitrogen or carbon dioxide to modify the atmosphere in the pouch. 
The sealed container is then cooked under very precise conditions and 
refrigerated. To prepare the food, you simply place it in a pot of boiling 
water to reheat. 
</P>
<P>
Since the food is subjected to neither the high heat of canning nor the very 
low temperatures needed for freezing, damage to cell structures is minimized, 
resulting in fresher flavor. However, the oxygen-free or nearly oxygen-free 
environment provides an excellent arena for the growth of several bacteria that 
can cause such serious forms of food poisoning as botulism, listeriosis and 
<ORGANIZATION>Yersinia</ORGANIZATION> poisoning. The problem is that the temperatures used to process the 
food are high enough to kill harmless organisms that produce unpleasant odors 
signaling food spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Every time I read a nutrition article that advises eating more "complex 
carbohydrates," I wind up feeling frustrated, because I'm not sure what it 
really means. Can you fill me in? 
</P>
<P>
A: Common sources of complex carbohydrates in our diets are wheat, corn, 
barley, rice, oats and potatoes. In the wheat kernel, the complex carbohydrates 
include both digestible starch and indigestible fiber. 
</P>
<P>
A more descriptive name for complex carbohydrates is polysaccharides, a term 
that translates directly to "many sugars." And that is exactly what complex 
carbohydrates are: many molecules of simple sugars linked together, sometimes 
with an acid built into the structure. The structure of pectin, for instance, 
includes two simple sugars, glucose and arabinose, and galacturonic acid as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The way sugar molecules (and acids) are strung together determines the type of 
carbohydrate formed, and thus its physical and chemical properties. Amylose, 
the starch in such foods as wheat and corn, is made up of molecules of glucose 
attached in straight chains. The human digestive system has enzymes that can 
separate the glucose units so that they can be absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
To experience this for yourself, chew a plain cracker longer than usual. The 
sweetness that begins to develop is the result of enzymes breaking the starch 
molecules down to their simple components. But if these same units are linked 
in a more complicated way, as they are in cellulose, the body cannot pull them 
apart. They are part of the fiber that travels through the body undigested. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm an avid reader of ingredients lists and never cease to be amazed at what 
I find. For instance, recently I noticed that frankfurters and luncheon meats 
contain corn syrup. Then I became curious about just how much sweetener they 
contain, but there was no way to tell from the ingredients list. I wonder if 
you could provide the information. 
</P>
<P>
A: They don't contain much. Frankfurters, bologna and similar products can 
contain a maximum of <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> corn syrup by weight. That translates to just over half 
a gram per ounce. To put that into more visual terms, a one-ounce slice of 
bologna would contain about 1/8 teaspoon of corn syrup.

The Strange Story of a Drug
Regarded as Hero and Villain
---
By Jerry E. Bishop
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>

<TEXT>
   THE EPISODE WAS the kind that makes grist for novels and movies. 
A 40-year-old man suffering a severe liver disease had suddenly developed a life-threatening skin condition. 

   "His skin was sloughing off all over his body," recalls <PERSON>Marshall M. Kaplan</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Tufts University</ORGANIZATION> gastroenterologist who had been tending the patient's liver problems. 

   Cortisone wasn't helping, "so the question came up whether methotrexate would help," <PERSON>Dr. Kaplan</PERSON> says. 
Methotrexate is an old anti-cancer drug that had been found to aid certain other skin conditions, but it also has a dangerous side effect -- liver damage. 
The idea of using this drug in a man with a diseased liver was "frightening," <PERSON>Dr. Kaplan</PERSON> says. 
"But if we didn't use it, there was a good chance he would die from the skin condition." 

   Balancing the risks, doctors began giving the man methotrexate. 
"We watched his blood tests (for signs of liver damage), fully expecting them to get worse," <PERSON>Dr. Kaplan</PERSON> says. 
Instead, not only did his skin condition clear up, but to the doctors' astonishment, his liver began to improve. 
Now, eight years later, he takes maintenance doses of methotrexate, and both his skin and liver are normal. 

   THIS EPISODE, recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine, marks another serendipitous incident in the strange history of methotrexate. 
In these days when genetic engineering and molecular manipulation turn up new wonder drugs almost weekly, methotrexate stands out as a baffling technological anomaly. 
In the 40 years since the drug was first synthesized, it has been alternately lauded as a treatment for a variety of human scourges and castigated as a poison whose risks are greater than the diseases it's being used to treat. 
Yet no one is quite sure how or why it does what it does. 

   The methotrexate story begins in the mid-1940s when the late <PERSON>Sidney Farber</PERSON> and his colleagues at <ORGANIZATION>Children's Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> were attempting the first use of chemicals in the treatment of acute childhood leukemia, then an invariably fatal blood cancer. 

   The cancer researchers, according to an oft-told story, had noticed a similarity between the leukemia and a certain anemia which was due to a deficiency of the vitamin folic acid. 
This led them to treat the leukemia with folic acid. 
To their horror, the folic acid accelerated the leukemia instead of retarding it. 
This near-disaster, however, led them to try a second chemical, called aminopterin, that blocked the cancer cells' use of folic acid. 
In <DATE>1948</DATE>, in an historic research paper, the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> researchers reported the first remissions of acute leukemia through chemotherapy. 
Unfortunately, the remissions lasted only a few weeks or months. 

   The <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> discovery led chemists at <ORGANIZATION>Lederle Laboratories</ORGANIZATION>, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>American Cyanamid Co.</ORGANIZATION>, to synthesize an improved version of aminopterin they called a-methopterin, to which <ORGANIZATION>Lederle</ORGANIZATION>'s marketing people affixed the brand name, Methotrexate (the brand name has since slid into generic use). 

   METHOTREXATE PROVED even better at bringing about remissions of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and today it is one of the drugs achieving cures of leukemia in about <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> of afflicted children. 
By <DATE>1956</DATE>, cancer researchers reported another first: Women developing an unusual cancer of the placenta during pregnancy had been permanently cured by methotrexate, the first cancer ever cured by chemotherapy. 

   In the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>, serendipity struck again. 
A <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> dermatologist reported instances of some patients being relieved of psoriasis, a chronic and severely disturbing skin disease, when treated with methotrexate. 
This led <PERSON>William O'Brien</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Black</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> to run a controlled trial on 21 psoriasis patients. 
Not only did the skin disorder clear up in several patients but so did a type of arthritis that often accompanies psoriasis. 
The scientists then reported a second trial showing that methotrexate produced remissions in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the most common form of the crippling disorder. 

   But, in treating psoriasis patients, the dangers of methotrexate became apparent. 
In high doses and daily use, the drug can cause severe liver damage and sometimes a lung disorder. 

   IN SOME CANCER PATIENTS, doctors have worked out a unique "rescue" concept, giving a patient dangerously high doses of methotrexate to kill cancer cells and then shortly afterward administering an antidote to save normal tissues from its poisonous effects. 

   Methotrexate's use in arthritis, at least for patients whose disease isn't helped by any other drug, is now being revived. 
Researchers have treated several hundred arthritis patients with low doses of methotrexate given only once a week. 
Anywhere from half to two-thirds of these patients improve; some have remissions of their arthritis. 
But while many arthritis specialists are using methotrexate in "refractory" patients, others shun it. 
One is <PERSON>Dr. O'Brien</PERSON>, who did the first trial of methotrexate in arthritis and who is now a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION>. 
Because of its toxicity, he says, "we don't use it anymore here in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION>." 

   Meanwhile, in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Dr. Kaplan</PERSON> and his colleagues say they had a second patient with the same severe liver disease as the first but without the skin problem. 
"He was at his wits' end," <PERSON>Dr. Kaplan</PERSON> says. 
"I thought of that first patient and said, 'If you're a gambler and you want to try methotrexate, we'll do it.'" 
The patient's liver is now normal. 
A clinical trial of methotrexate in the liver disease, called primary sclerosis cholangitis, is now under way.

Christmas eating is seriously misrepresented. Not only is it not bad for
you, but it provides the nearest thing to the perfectly-balanced day's
eating.
When else does one eat dates (loaded with potassium)? Don't we all eat
tangerines (beta-carotine, vitamin C) at Christmas? Is there anybody who
does not get chocolate and nuts (vitamin E, magnesium, potassium) in their
Christmas stocking?
The menu was created by a great nutritionist.
Turkey is a very low-fat meat, which helps maintain a healthy cholesterol
level. It is rich in folic acid - especially important for pregnant women
and elderly people. It contains zinc which contributes to healthy sexual
functioning. And there is evidence it may help psoriasis sufferers,
according to <PERSON>Earl Mindell</PERSON>, author of <ORGANIZATION>The Food Medicine Bible</ORGANIZATION>. The meat also
contains vitamins B1 and B6 which help digestion, while potassium is good
for the heart.
Poultry liver contains iron and selenium, which help combat free radicals
(which can damage the cells genetic material and lead to cancer). Chestnuts
are rich in starch, an important energy source. Cranberry juice helps to
flush out the bacteria (E. coli) responsible for most urinary infections.
Goose contains a high proportion of oleic fat, which is valuable in
protecting the cardiovascular system. <PERSON>Michel Montignac</PERSON> points out in his
Recipes and Menus for healthy eating that high life expectancy rates in
<LOCATION>Gers</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, coincide with a high consumption of duck and goose fat, eaten
mainly in foie gras.
Potatoes, the Cinderella vegetable (or 'dieter's dream', according to
<PERSON>Mindell</PERSON>), are a great source of fibre (for regular bowel movement),
potassium, and vitamins C and B6. Green vegetables are packed with vitamins
and nutrients, but don't overcook them or much will be lost.
Wine contains a high concentration of minerals, trace elements and soluble
fibre to help the digestion. Sherry is said to have aphrodisiac qualities.
Christmas pudding with brandy and cream must be bad for you, but eat it for
the sheer pleasure as happier people live longer, according to Professor
<PERSON>David Warburton</PERSON>, director of the human psychopharmacology group at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Reading</ORGANIZATION>.
But if Christmas festivities become too much of a strain 'take time out to
indulge a little and relax', says <PERSON>Warburton</PERSON>, also a member of the Arise
group (<ORGANIZATION>Associates for Research</ORGANIZATION> into the Science of Enjoyment). He recommends
'guilt-free enjoyment' as a relaxation strategy at a stressful time of year.
'There is clear scientific evidence that spoiling ourselves with, say, a
glass of wine or beer . . . or a few pieces of chocolate and all things
sweet, makes people calmer, more relaxed and generally happier. And medical
evidence shows that happier people live longer, so moderate indulgence can
only be beneficial.'
You need never feel guilty again.

<TEXT>
   A funeral will be held <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> for <PERSON>Roger
J. Williams</PERSON>, a leading authority on nutrition who died at age 94.
   A professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas, Williams</ORGANIZATION> died
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> of pneumonia in an <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION> nursing home. He had been in ill
health for several months, but still kept in touch with UT
scientists, many of whom he persuaded to come to <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>' work in nutrition at the <ORGANIZATION>UT Clayton Foundation
Biochemical Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which he founded, led to the discovery of
more vitamins and their variants than at any other research
facility in the world.
   He was particularly interested in the role nutrition played in
physical and mental well-being. Until he retired in <DATE>1985</DATE>, <PERSON>Williams</PERSON>
worked regularly in his laboratory on the <ORGANIZATION>UT</ORGANIZATION> campus.
   <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was a proponent of ``biochemical individuality,'' a
concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and
therefore everyone has different nutritional requirements.
   One of <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION>' most significant accomplishments was the
discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid, one of the ``universal
vitamins'' required by all living cells and essential to life.
Later he discovered and named folic acid, a substance used by every
cell in the body.
   Survivors include his wife, <PERSON>Phyllis</PERSON>, three sons, a daughter,
nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

It looks like cauliflower dyed green. 
</P>
<P>
It has a pleasing taste, sweeter than cauliflower, milder than broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called Broccoflower. It's a cross between cauliflower and broccoli and is 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s newest vegetable," <PERSON>Joseph Montecalvo</PERSON> explained. 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo recently completed several weeks of nutritional tests on the plant. 
He heads up the food science and nutrition department of <ORGANIZATION>California Polytechnic 
State University</ORGANIZATION> here. 
</P>
<P>
"It has more Vitamin C than oranges," <PERSON>Montecalvo</PERSON> said. "And it's high in folic 
acid, which is important to the maintenance of red blood cells carrying oxygen 
through the human body." 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo conducted the nutritional profile at the request of <PERSON>Rick Antle</PERSON>, 
president of <ORGANIZATION>Tanimura</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Antle Co.</ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION>Salinas</LOCATION>. The produce firm 
has 20,000 acres in lettuce, broccoli and cauliflower in <LOCATION>Salinas</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>San 
Joaquin Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Yuma</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Obregon</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Antle, 33, a fourth-generation <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> grower and <DATE>1979</DATE> Cal Poly graduate, is 
a member of the school's crop science advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>October 1988</DATE> Antle sent a few cases of Broccoflower to his customers on a 
trial basis. Now his company is shipping 20,000 to 25,000 boxes a week (12 to 
16 heads to a box) throughout the country and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>. Broccoflower sells for 
about the same price as cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a major grower of both cauliflower and broccoli. Wild crosses occur 
between the two crops. About 10 years ago we began breeding the two vegetables 
on an experimental basis," <PERSON>Antle</PERSON> recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't do much with it. Then, on a trip to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> three years ago he 
discovered seeds for a cauliflower-broccoli cross at a seed company in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought some of the seed, planted it in <LOCATION>Salinas</LOCATION>, liked what I saw and then 
bought as much of the seed as was available from the <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> seed company. I 
learned that the plant was grown commercially on a small scale in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, but 
in all my travels I had never seen it in this country," <PERSON>Antle</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The seed was expensive -- <MONEY>$1,500-a-pound</MONEY>. "But I knew I was onto something. 
Growers are always looking for a new crop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Antle called the vegetable <PERSON>Broccoflower</PERSON> and has taken out a trademark 
application on the name. He sells the product to his regular customers, who are 
located for the most part along the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Seaboard</ORGANIZATION>. About <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of his 
production of Broccoflower is distributed in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. It has been sold in a 
few markets in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"It has really caught on. The demand far exceeds the supply so far. Last year 
we were growing Broccoflower on 300 acres. This year we are increasing the 
acreage considerably," <PERSON>Antle</PERSON> noted. He said many other growers are now doing 
test trials on the crop. 
</P>
<P>
"Broccoflower is the talk of the vegetable commodity industry. There is an 
obvious niche for it in the market. And everybody's trying to get on the 
bandwagon. We feel fortunate because we've got a head start," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He said the first big public display of Broccoflower will take place at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Food Marketing Institute Trade Show</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> the first week in <DATE>May</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 Broccoflower plants donated to <LOCATION>Cal Poly</LOCATION>'s crop science department 
were planted on the <LOCATION>San Luis Obispo</LOCATION> campus <DATE>April 21</DATE> by <PERSON>James Greil</PERSON>, professor 
at the school's crop science department, and four agriculture students. 
</P>
<P>
"The plantings are part of <LOCATION>Cal Poly</LOCATION>'s enterprise program underwritten by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Cal Poly Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. Students involved will earn <PERCENT>67%</PERCENT> of the profits from the 
crop toward their education, with <PERCENT>33%</PERCENT> of the profits returned to the 
foundation," Greil explained. 
</P>
<P>
Both the grower and the students benefit as students will be doing continuous 
research on the new crop under <ORGANIZATION>Greil</ORGANIZATION>'s direction. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s broccoli brouhaha, <PERSON>George Gowgani</PERSON>, 
head of <LOCATION>Cal Poly</LOCATION>'s crop science department, shipped a case of Broccoflower to 
the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a thank you note from a member of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> staff and were 
informed that <PERSON>Broccoflower</PERSON> was served raw as a dip at two receptions attended 
by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. But, we don't know whether the President tried it. Of 
course, we hope he did and hope he liked it," <PERSON>Gowgani</PERSON> said.

   Risk of Cervical Cancer Climbs Sharply
   With Diet Low in B Vitamin, Data Show

   Researchers said a diet low in one of the B vitamins makes
a woman more vulnerable to the power of a common virus to
cause cervical cancer.
   The new study seems to explain why the human papilloma
virus, which can cause genital warts in men and women, can
sometimes trigger cells lining a woman's cervix to grow to an
abberrant degree. The finding may lead to a way to prevent
such cancer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The researchers at <ORGANIZATION>University of Alabama's School of
Medicine</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> found in a study of 464 women that
those exposed to the virus were five times more likely to
have precancerous changes in their cervical cells, or
dysplasia, if they also had low levels in their blood of the
B vitamin called folate, or folic acid. Such cell changes can
be detected with a <ORGANIZATION>Pap</ORGANIZATION> smear test. Found early, the
precancerous cells can be removed, and the risk of cancer
eliminated.
   <PERSON>Charles E. Butterworth</PERSON>, a professor of nutrition who led
the study, said the vitamin deficiency is most often caused
by a poor diet, one lacking sufficient amounts of vegetables,
fruits and especially orange juice. "It looks as if many
cases of dysplasia could be prevented with a healthy diet,"
said <PERSON>Dr. Butterworth</PERSON>, whose study was published in today's
Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>. "The folate
deficiency may explain why the cancer is so common among poor
women."
   Cervical cancer affects about 13,000 women a year in the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and results in about 5,000 deaths annually. But the
cancer is rampant in poor nations.
   The researchers found the link between the virus and the
vitamin deficiency by testing blood levels of 294 women with
precancerous cell changes whose condition was detected at
various county health clinics in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>. The researchers
then compared folate levels in the blood of 170 other women
who visited the county clinics for other reasons, but who
showed no sign of dysplasia.
   Through statistical analysis the researchers found that
the women who had a combination of the vitamin deficiency and
the exposure to the virus faced a risk of developing
dysplasia fivefold greater than women exposed to the virus
whose diet contained sufficient levels of the vitamin.
   Previous studies had found that the risk of cervical
cancer can be affected by the virus as well as the number of
sexual partners, cigarette smoking and use of oral
contraceptives. But the latest research found that none of
these factors was as powerfully linked to dysplasia as the
combination of the virus and the vitamin deficiency.
   Scientists already believe that the papilloma virus causes
changes in cell growth by inserting its own genetic material
into the genes of the cervical cells. <PERSON>Dr. Butterworth</PERSON> said
there is some evidence suggesting that the vitamin deficiency
somehow makes the cervical cells' genetic material especially
vulnerable to attack from the virus. Normal levels of folate
may keep genetic material sturdy enough to fend off the
virus. "But that still needs to be proved," he said.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: WRONG MIX OF MEDICATION, FOOD CAN LEAD TO NUTRITIONAL 
DEFICIENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of us try to choose our foods to promote good health. Some of us also take 
medications -- either over-the-counter or prescription -- for the same reason. 
But what happens when the two are at odds? 
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that use of certain drugs can lead to nutritional 
deficiencies. And by the same token, diet can block the effectiveness of some 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense that foods and drugs interact within the body. Yet the chemical 
intricacies of how they do so remain a gray area. Meanwhile, medications on the 
market multiply every year, widening the problem's scope. 
</P>
<P>
Some facts are known about the effect of drugs on nutrition. Digitalis, used in 
the treatment of heart disease, has been found to depress appetite. Many other 
drugs can upset the stomach, causing you to eat less. Over a long period of 
time, such a side effect might result in significant weight loss and depletion 
of nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nutrient Absorption Blocked 
</P>
<P>
Some drugs impair the body's ability to utilize nutrients. One of the first to 
be shown to do so was mineral oil, once commonly used as a laxative. In some 
people it hampers absorption of vitamins A, D, E and <PERSON>K. Laxatives</PERSON> cut down the 
length of time foods stay in the body, reducing the opportunity to absorb the 
nutrients they provide. And some laxatives also can affect the lining of the 
intestine. Likewise, antibiotics alter the intestine, affecting intake of 
glucose, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, carotene and Vitamin 
B-12. 
</P>
<P>
Another group are the antacids containing magnesium or aluminum hydroxide. 
Binding themselves to phosphorus, they make phosphorus hard to absorb. They 
also interfere with absorption of folic acid by making the gastrointestinal 
tract more alkaline. And potassium chloride, which is used to protect potassium 
supplies, raises the acidity of the intestine, reducing uptake of Vitamin B-12. 
</P>
<P>
Other drugs can hasten the destruction of vitamins. Patients on long-term 
anticonvulsant medication may develop a bone disease called osteomalacia, 
possibly because the drug stimulates enzymes that inactivate Vitamin D, which 
is essential to bones. 
</P>
<P>
Still other drugs cause nutrients to be lost through urinary excretion. Taking 
aspirin may increase excretion of <PERSON>Vitamin C. Isoniazin</PERSON>, a drug used to fight 
tuberculosis, binds with <PERSON>Vitamin B-6</PERSON>, which is then excreted by the kidney. 
</P>
<P>
With all the drugs we've been discussing, the extent of the nutritional problem 
caused will depend on the length of time involved, rather than on the dose. In 
other words, occasional use of medications won't jeopardize your nutritional 
status, but long-term use could open the door to nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of the coin is that as drugs can alter nutritional processes, so 
food may affect the action of drugs. If you drink milk when you take the 
antibiotic tetracycline, calcium will block the drug's absorption. Other foods 
affect other medications differently, and the effect is not always negative. 
For instance, anti-fungal medications are absorbed more readily if taken with a 
high-fat meal. And while fruit juices may interfere with absorption of some 
antibiotics, the acid environment they create is helpful when it comes to 
taking iron supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Some foods contain ingredients that counteract the effectiveness of a medicine. 
Foods high in <LOCATION>Vitamin</LOCATION> K (essential for blood clotting) such as broccoli, beef 
liver, cabbage, asparagus and spinach may inactivate anti-clotting medication. 
And if you're taking the anti-depressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors, you 
should stay away from foods rich in tyramine such as Cheddar cheese, avocado, 
bananas, soy sauce and chicken liver. These foods can bring about serious 
complications. Also, megadoses of Vitamin B-6 work against L-Dopa, used to 
treat Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's a body to do when medications are necessary over the long term? The 
wisest step is to read directions on the bottle or package to find out just 
when (before or after a meal) and how (with water, milk, etc.) any drug should 
be taken. It's also important to consult with your physician about what dietary 
course to follow. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to mixing drugs and food, you should give yourself every chance 
to make the mix both effective and safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Updated Figures Give Eggs Lower Cholesterol Content 
</P>
<P>
Question: Are eggs today lower in cholesterol than they used to be? I heard 
that on the radio and wonder if it's really true.

Answer: Updated figures for the cholesterol content of eggs are considerably 
lower than those first published by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> more 
than 20 years ago. Indeed, the results of a nationwide study conducted jointly 
by the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> and the egg industry indicate that the average large egg contains 
213 milligrams of cholesterol, down <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT> from earlier estimates of 274 
milligrams. These results are based on analyses of samples representing more 
than <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the eggs produced in this country. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason is the availability of superior methods of laboratory analysis, 
making more accurate determinations possible. But there may be real differences 
in the amount of cholesterol in eggs now available. It has been suggested that 
changes in feed and increased production of eggs by hens result in eggs that 
contain less cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
But even at these lower levels, eggs remain the main source of dietary 
cholesterol for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that one out of five adults in this country is overweight? 
</P>
<P>
A: Alas, the figure is higher. The most recent estimates come from data 
obtained by the <ORGANIZATION>Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</ORGANIZATION> (BRFSS) for 32 
states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Conducted by state health 
departments and coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION>National Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION>, the 
surveillance system's telephone surveys have been providing valuable 
self-reported behavioral and personal-health practices information since <DATE>1981</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
That survey found the prevalence of overweight to be <PERCENT>21.8%</PERCENT> for men and <PERCENT>21.1%</PERCENT> 
for women. Prevalence varies considerably by region. It is lowest in the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> 
(<PERCENT>17%</PERCENT>), followed by the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> (<PERCENT>19.8%</PERCENT>), the South (<PERCENT>22%</PERCENT>) and the Midwest 
(<PERCENT>23.1%</PERCENT>). 
</P>
<P>
But if anything, these estimates, based as they are on self-reporting, err on 
the side of underestimation. 
</P>
<P>
In the second <ORGANIZATION>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</ORGANIZATION>, where 
individuals were weighed and measured, the prevalence of overweight was <PERCENT>24.2%</PERCENT> 
among men and <PERCENT>27.1%</PERCENT> among women. Given the increased risk of a number of 
diseases associated with excess weight, even the lower figures are too high. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can honey cause botulism poisoning in infants? 
</P>
<P>
A: Honey has been linked to increased risk of botulism in infants and is 
currently not recommended as a suitable food for babies under 1 year of age, 
and especially not before they are 6 months old. But the occurrence of infant 
botulism cannot be explained by the use of honey alone. In fact, while as many 
as <PERCENT>29%</PERCENT> of the affected subjects in early studies had been given honey, in later 
studies that figure had dropped to about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT>. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to better understand the infection, which has been diagnosed in 
600 infants since it was first described in <DATE>1976</DATE>, the Center for Infectious 
Diseases of the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> recently conducted a study of all 
known cases that had occurred over a two-year period in every state but 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> between <DATE>April 1985</DATE> and <DATE>March 1987</DATE>. The objective was to identify 
factors common to babies who got botulism but absent from a similar group who 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
Risk factors were found to change with age. For infants less than 2 months old, 
living in a rural area or on a farm was the only consistent factor. For those 2 
months and older, however, the condition was more likely to occur among those 
who were breast-fed, among those who had a history of decreased frequency of 
bowel movements for at least two months, and among those who had been given 
corn syrup, which has occasionally been found to contain low levels of botulism 
spores. The use of honey also remained a factor, although only 11 babies in the 
case studies had consumed it. 
</P>
<P>
These data do not provide a cohesive approach to preventing botulism. The 
report's authors concluded that while avoiding honey does make sense, the 
relationship with corn syrup requires further clarification. And the higher 
prevalence of botulism among breast-fed infants should not be viewed as a 
deterrent to breast-feeding. The reason for the association with breast-feeding 
remains a matter of conjecture. Moreover, botulism is rare, and the benefits of 
breast-feeding far outweigh any possible increase in risk. 
</P>
<P>
Infants who do not have a fever but who show a reduced ability to feed, and in 
whom no other infection can be demonstrated, should have a stool specimen 
submitted for detection of the toxin, especially if there has been a change 
toward less frequent bowel movements.

<HEAD>Leading Researcher Sues Science Academy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> is fighting a
<MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> lawsuit that claims it plagiarized the writings of a
nutrition researcher that it earlier had rejected.
   <PERSON>Victor Herbert</PERSON>, a lawyer and physician who filed the suit in
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION>, charged that the academy copied figures
verbatim on work he had done to update published recommended
dietary allowances (RDAs), after earlier trying to discredit the
work.
   ``<PERSON>Dr. Herbert</PERSON> is a great promoter of nutrition science,''
<PERSON>Herbert</PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON>Michael Botts</PERSON>, said in a telephone interview
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mo.</LOCATION> ``It isn't just a moral point at all.
(The academy) took his work and then went out and sold it. The
academy made in the neighborhood of a <MONEY>half million dollars</MONEY> off of
this work.''
   RDAs form the foundation for determining the nutritional needs
of schoolchildren, food stamp recipients and other federally funded
supplemental programs. The academy sells lists of the standards to
libraries, medical schools, doctors, dietitians and nutritionists.
   To update the RDAs in the mid-1980s, the science academy, an
independent federal agency chartered by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, selected <PERSON>Herbert</PERSON>
and nine other prominent nutrition scientists.
   Using a <MONEY>$650,000</MONEY> grant from the <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION>,
the committee's produced a document that discussed the sciences of
each 18 essential vitamins and minerals that each person is
encouraged to eat each day.
   Botts claimed the academy tinkered with the RDAs document before
publishing it in <DATE>October 1989</DATE>, damaging the ``integrity of the
authors' work'' and destroying the quality.
   The document included copyrighted material <PERSON>Herbert</PERSON> wrote on iron
and on the vitamins B12 and folate, or folic acid, <ORGANIZATION>Botts</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Lawyers for the academy filed a motion for dismissal <DATE>last week</DATE>
and a hearing on the motion has been scheduled for <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE>. The
academy contends that if there is copyright infringement, the
federal government should be the defendant in the suit, which was
filed in <DATE>February</DATE>.
   Botts said the committee completed its work and passed peer
review, and a <DATE>September 1985</DATE> publication date was scheduled. The
panel was prepared to recommend lower levels of vitamins A and C
than what had been suggested earlier.
   But according to <ORGANIZATION>Botts</ORGANIZATION>, the academy gave the panel an ultimatum:
keep the RDAs for vitamins A and C the same, while adding a
footnote to the table at the end of the book.
   When the academy and committee disagreed over the wording of the
footnote, the academy refused to publish the work and disbanded the
group, <ORGANIZATION>Botts</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Botts described the disagreement as ``a conflict in nutrition
between those who promote pop nutrition,'' such as those who call
for high doses of fiber and vitamin C versus those who say there is
harm in ingesting too much fiber and vitamin C.
   ``That's nonsense,'' <PERSON>Calvin H. Cobb Jr.</PERSON>, a lawyer representing
the academy, was quoted as saying in <DATE>Saturday</DATE> editions of The
Washington Post. ``The complaint has no merit.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Institutes of Health</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> told the academy it
must fulfill the terms of the contract or return the money. Botts
said <ORGANIZATION>NIH</ORGANIZATION> officials reviewed the committee's report and wanted it to
be published but the academy said it needed <MONEY>$160,000</MONEY> to select a
subcommittee to update the earlier work.
   Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION>Botts</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Herbert</PERSON>'s work appeared in a nutrition
education journal in <DATE>1987</DATE>.
   The academy published a 10th edition revision in <DATE>October 1989</DATE>.
Botts said the subcommittee was listed as author, although the work
included <PERSON>Herbert</PERSON>'s writings.

      Vaccine for <ORGANIZATION>Arthritis
   Shows Promise</ORGANIZATION> in Rats
   AN ARTHRITIS vaccine works in rats, suggesting a new avenue of research on human rheumatoid arthritis. 

   Human rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly attacks its own joint cartilage, causing inflammation and destruction of the joints. 

   To study autoimmune arthritis, a team of Dutch and Israeli researchers induced the disease in susceptible laboratory rats by injecting them with a strain of bacteria. 
The rats' immune systems activated white blood cells that attacked both the bacteria and the rats' cartilage, causing the arthritis. 
The reseachers discovered that the white cells "recognized" and attacked a tiny segment of a protein on the bacteria. 
It turned out that a protein segment in cartilage is similar to the bacterial protein segment, which explained why the white cells also attacked the cartilage. 

   But the researchers also found a paradox: The same protein fragment also activated a second type of white blood cell that seemed to suppress the attack on cartilage. 
In fact, these cells prevented arthritis when given to rats before bacteria injections. 

   The puzzled researchers genetically engineered a version of the tiny protein fragment and injected it in rats to see if it caused or prevented arthritis. 
The protein fragment prevented the disease and even caused a remission in rats who had arthritis. 

   In their report in a recent issue of the journal Nature, the researchers note that the protein segment, or one closely related to it, is found in more than 50 species of bacteria, all of which have been suspected of being involved in rheumatoid arthritis. 
Perhaps, they speculated, bacterial infections in certain "susceptible" individuals trigger autoimmune arthritis. 
If this is true, they suggest, then a purified version of the protein fragment might suppress the disease as it did in the rats. 

   Athletes Wearing Black
   Play More Aggressively
   BLACK UNIFORMS make football and hockey players appear -- and act -- meaner, according to a study by two <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> psychologists. 

   Penalty records of 28 <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> teams from <DATE>1970 to 1986</DATE> showed that all five teams that wore predominately black uniforms were among the 12 most penalized teams. 
Similarly, the three most penalized teams in the <ORGANIZATION>National Hockey League</ORGANIZATION> in those 17 years wore black. 
When the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Penguins</ORGANIZATION> switched to black-and-gold from blue in midseason in <DATE>1979-80</DATE> (to emulate that year's <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> champion <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION>), their average penalty time per hockey game went to 12 minutes from eight minutes. 

   This prompted the psychologists to launch a series of experiments on the effects of black uniforms. 
Groups of football fans and referees were shown either of two videotapes of a staged football play. 
In one tape the defensive team wore black while in the other tape the defenders wore white. 
Those who saw the black-uniformed team rated the defenders as far more aggressive and "dirty" than those who watched the white-clothed defenders making the same moves. 

   Moreover, when student volunteers were asked to pick five games to play against a competing team, those given black jerseys tended to pick aggressive games like dart-gun duels, while those in white jerseys picked games like putting contests. 

   A black uniform may make others think a person is more aggressive or "mean" and, as a result, the person becomes more aggressive, the psychologists speculate in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 

   Boosting Intelligence
   Vitamin by Vitamin
   CAN CHILDREN'S intelligence be improved by vitamin-mineral supplements? 

   Two psychologists in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> sought to answer this question in an experiment with 90 students, aged 12 and 13. 
Diet diaries kept by the children before the experiment began indicated that they consumed on the average slightly less than recommended amounts of most minerals and several vitamins, particularly thiamine, folic acid and vitamin D. 

   For <DATE>eight months 30</DATE> of the children took daily vitamin-mineral supplements, 30 took placebos and 30 were untreated. 
Intelligence tests showed that all the children had a slight increase in verbal intelligence, which needs vocabulary and real-world experience to solve problems. 

   But only the 30 children taking the supplements showed an improvement in non-verbal intelligence, the innate ability one uses to solve problems that don't require learning or experience, such as figuring out that a square peg goes into a square hole. 

   "Inadequate nutrition would be expected to show its earliest effects on the more biological intelligence measured by the non-verbal intelligence test," the psychologists note in the medical journal Lancet. 
The experiment suggests that less than optimum amounts of vitamins and minerals may be hampering the children's brain functioning, they say. 

   Nicotine Gum Becomes
   An Unexpected Habit
   IN <LOCATION>BALTIMORE</LOCATION>, a three-pack a-day smoker quit his 21-year habit by chewing Nicorette, the nicotine gum made by <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemical Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Lakeside Pharmaceutical</ORGANIZATION> division. 
But he became addicted to the gum, chewing 17 pieces a day, researchers at <ORGANIZATION>Johns Hopkins Medical School</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute on Drug Abuse</ORGANIZATION> report in <LOCATION>Lancet</LOCATION>. 

   So the researchers gradually substituted the Nicorette in his daily ration with a placebo gum. 
After six weeks, he was chewing only the placebo. 
He then weaned himself off the placebo by substituting bubble gum. 
Lakeside says it hasn't any immediate plans to market a placebo Nicorette.

<TEXT>
   A <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> report that said
vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and
perhaps harmful was denounced as ``a disservice to all Americans''
by a trade group.
   The group, called the <ORGANIZATION>Council for Responsible Nutrition</ORGANIZATION>, said
that the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> report released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> failed to acknowledge what it
called ``emerging research'' on benefits from supplements of
vitamins, fiber and calcium.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> report provides only a shallow review of the evidence
on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the
tide of research that supports those benefits,'' the trade
association said in a prepared statement.
   The <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> released a 1,300-page report that is a
compilation by 19 experts of research from many sources related to
diet and health. The three-year study concluded that health is best
maintained by a balanced diet of a variety of foods in a diet that
is reduced in fat and salt, and enriched with fruits, vegetables and
complex carbohydrates.
   The study said the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> committee found no conclusive evidence
that taking doses of supplemental vitamins, fiber or calcium would
provide protection from cancer, heart disease, embrittlement of
bones or other ailments.
   <PERSON>Annette Dickinson</PERSON>, a nutrition expert and a spokeswoman for the
trade group, said the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> finding is unrealistic because it did not
recognize that the food eaten by many Americans does not include all
the nutrients in the recommended dietary allowance developed by the
federal government.
   ``People simply are not getting those required amounts,'' said
<PERSON>Ms. Dickinson</PERSON>. ``We believe that it is better that they get them
(nutrients) somewhere'' than not at all.
   She said the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> study is ``backing away'' from the use of a
number of supplements that have been shown to be ``quite
effective.'' She said that the report springs from a bias against
supplements in favor of a balanced diet.
   <PERSON>Ms. Dickinson</PERSON> acknowledged that research reports on the value of
supplements have had mixed results historically and admitted that
``there is a lot of bias on both sides'' about their use.
   The <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> study said that dietary supplements was a <MONEY>$3 billion</MONEY>
business in <DATE>1987</DATE>, and that many doctors, nurses and nutritionists
take multivitamins and other supplements. It said many people
self-prescribe supplements containing nutrients far in excess of the
<ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> set by the federal government.
   A daily dose of multiple vitamins with <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>
``is not known to be harmful or beneficial,'' the report said.
``However, vitamin-mineral supplements that exceed the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> and other
supplements (such as protein powders, single amino acids, fiber and
lecithin) not only have no known health benefits ... but their use
may be detrimental to health.''
   Though the study recommended foods high in calcium, it noted that
``the potential benefits of calcium intakes above the RDAs to
prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well documented and do
not justify the use of calcium supplements.''
   Fiber supplements by themselves, the report said, did not confer
any protection against disease, but fiber taken with fruits,
vegetables, grains and legumes are beneficial. The study recommended
five or more servings daily of fruit or vegetables, and six or more
servings of bread, cereals or legumes.

   FDA Plans to Propose New Rules
   For Nutritional Labeling on Food

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The first overhaul of federal food-labeling
rules in 17 years would allow food makers to provide
consumers with a "nutritional profile" of every serving they
eat.
   The Food and Drug Administration, as part of a major
initiative to require nutritional labels on almost all
packaged foods, is about to propose a way for consumers to
compare the nutrients in a food serving with the recommended
daily allowances for fat, saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids, salt, cholesterol, fiber and potassium.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Health and <ORGANIZATION>Human Services</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON>
disclosed the proposal yesterday when he gave further details
on three food-labeling rules that are to be formally proposed
within a week or so.
   For the first time, consumers would be able to tell from a
label what their daily intake of the seven substances should
be and what one serving of a particular food would furnish.
Though there is a growing clamor for such health-related
information, the food industry hasn't been able to provide
so-called nutritional profiles because the government has
never set recommended daily allowances for those seven
nutrients. Under the sweeping new rules, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> would fill
this regulatory void by setting what it calls "reference
values."
   For food companies, adding nutritional profiles to their
labels would be optional because many food packages aren't
large enough for them. But it appears likely that a large
share of the industry would provide the profiles. A survey
commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>National Food Processors Association</ORGANIZATION>
showed a strong consumer preference for a label format with a
nutritional profile. Of 400 consumers polled, <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> found the
nutritional profile of breakfast cereal "very helpful."
   "Consumers should have full access to information that
will help them make informed choices about the food they
eat," <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON> said here at a food safety and nutrition
conference. "Simply put, Americans must be helped, not hyped
or hustled, in the supermarket."
   The <ORGANIZATION>HHS</ORGANIZATION> secretary is in a race with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to revamp the
nation's food-labeling requirements. Floor action is expected
next month on labeling bills sponsored by Rep. <PERSON>Henry Waxman</PERSON>
(D., <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Sen. Howard Metzenbaum</PERSON> (D., <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>). Some in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> believe that <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON>, sensing the political
appeal of comprehensive food labeling, is trying to steal the
march on lawmakers.
   Consumer advocates welcome the competition. "If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
adopts the legislation this <DATE>summer</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> will be simply
one step ahead in implementing it," says <PERSON>Bruce Silverglade</PERSON>, a
lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Science</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Public Interest</ORGANIZATION>, a
Washington-based consumer group. "The {parallel} efforts,
although competitive politically, are complementary in a
practical sense."
   But <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON> is running into resistance within the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. Strenuous objections from <PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> budget director, thwarted the <ORGANIZATION>HHS</ORGANIZATION> secretary's
plan to publish three new regulations this week in the
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Register</ORGANIZATION> as well as a tentative final rule that would
define such terms as "cholesterol free" and "low
cholesterol."
   The snag in the regulations is the volatile issue of
federal pre-emption.
   The triad of rules, among other things, would require
nutrition labeling on virtually all packaged foods and would
define serving size for 159 food categories, ranging from
jelly to breads. Currently, just <PERCENT>61%</PERCENT> of the food products
regulated by the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> carry nutritional labels, many of which
are added voluntarily by manufacturers.
   <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON> and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON>Carla Hills</PERSON> say these rules should
pre-empt state and local labeling laws. They fear that a
hodgepodge of labeling requirements would disrupt food
production and distribution in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and impede trade. But
<PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials regard federal
pre-emption as running counter to the principles of
federalism and states' rights embraced by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
They also are sensitive to <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>'s concerns about
reregulation tendencies in his administration.
   Yet to be resolved, administration officials say, is
whether the proposed rules will be silent on federal
pre-emption or whether the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> will seek public comment on
the issue.
   The food industry has been adamant on the need for
regulatory uniformity. "Make no mistake," says <PERSON>John Cady</PERSON>,
president of the food processors group, "different food
safety and labeling requirements will impose very substantial
added costs to our national food distribution system." Adds
<PERSON>C. Manly Molpus</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Grocery Manufacturers of
America</ORGANIZATION>: "When it comes to what diet and health information
goes on food labels, there can be only one cook in the
kitchen."
   But consumer groups oppose federal pre-emption. The
industry "just wants to preclude more stringent state
labeling requirements," including freshness dating and
organic-food labeling laws, <PERSON>Mr. Silverglade</PERSON> says.
   The thrust of the labeling package is to help consumers
make sense out of a welter of confusing and often conflicting
nutritional information as food companies increasingly rely
on health claims as a marketing tool. Under current
regulations, nutritional labels are required only when a
company makes a nutritional claim or adds vitamins, minerals
or protein to a product.
   Yesterday, <PERSON>Dr. Sullivan</PERSON> said nutritional labeling would be
required on every packaged-food product that is a "meaningful
source" of nutrients. Food sold by restaurants, bakeries and
other small businesses would be exempt from the proposed
rule, as would spices and bite-size food, such as mints and
penny candies. Supermarkets would be required to post
nutritional information on fruit, vegetables, fish and
seafood or distribute booklets to shoppers.
   On the top half of a typical label, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> would require
food companies to list the number of calories from fat per
serving, as well as the amount of saturated fatty acids,
cholesterol and total dietary fiber. Currently, only figures
for protein, carbohydrates fat and calories are required.
   On the bottom half, the agency now requires companies to
list the percentage of recommended daily allowances per
serving of eight nutrients: protein, vitamin A, vitamin C,
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium and iron. Under its new
rules, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> would make the listing of thiamine, riboflavin
and niacin optional, and would only require protein on foods
for infants and young children.
   The agency also proposes switching from recommended daily
allowances, or RDAs, to an internationally used term,
"reference daily intakes," or RDIs, for the sake of
uniformity. At the same time, the agency would update the
RDIs for protein, 12 vitamins and seven minerals. In
addition, it would set RDIs for seven other nutrients,
including vitamin K, manganese and selenium.

BATTLE IS STILL RAGING OVER VITAMIN-MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps no other subject arouses as much acrimony among nutritional authorities 
as vitamin and mineral supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
Firmly entrenched on one side are the skeptics who, like researchers at the 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>, call supplementation "a questionable and 
potentially harmful practice." On the opposing side stand the apologists, who 
claim that taking megadoses of vitamins and minerals can extend the life span 
and boost the body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Between these two extremes are the many nutritionists and physicians who 
cautiously endorse taking a daily multiple supplement with <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the 
Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) as "insurance" against nutritional 
deficiencies. The Food and <ORGANIZATION>Nutrition Board</ORGANIZATION>, the government agency that sets 
nutritional standards, defines the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> as the amount of each nutrient necessary 
to keep most people in good health, based on available scientific knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Supplementation may be warranted after age 50 because nutritional needs change 
and because the American fast-food diet makes it difficult to get complete 
nutrition," said <PERSON>Maryanne Painter</PERSON>, a dietitian for <ORGANIZATION>Health Care Pharmacies</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. "You may be a candidate if you don't consume two servings of milk 
products daily, two servings of protein foods (such as lean red meat, fish and 
poultry), four serving of fruits and vegetables (one-half cup each) and four 
servings of starches, including cereals, breads and rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Supplements should not provide more than <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>, she warned, because 
certain vitamins, such as Vitamins A and D, become toxic in excessively high 
concentrations. High doses of Vitamin A, for example, may cause blurred vision 
and headaches, while excesses of Vitamin D may cause vomiting and diarrhea, 
weight loss and muscular weakness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wholesome Food 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than megadosing on vitamins to make up for an inadequate diet, I 
recommend eating healthful, wholesome food and using vitamins as an adjunct to 
your diet," <PERSON>Painter</PERSON> said. "If you listen to your body and eat a varied diet 
that incorporates your favorite foods in moderation, as <PERSON>Hippocrates</PERSON> said, 'food 
will be your medicine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritionists, however, claim that given our present agricultural and 
food-processing systems, relying strictly on unsupplemented diets can only 
create nutritional deficiencies.

Getting adequate nutrition from food "was possible 100 or even 50 years ago, 
when all foods were grown on fertile soils, were unrefined, and unprocessed, 
and contained all the nutrients nature intended them to contain," writes <PERSON>Paavo 
Airola</PERSON>, a well-known nutritionist, in "The Holistic Health Lifebook." "But 
today, when soils are depleted, when foods are loaded with residues of hundreds 
of toxic insecticides and other chemicals, the addition of vitamins and food 
supplements to the diet is of vital importance. "Nutritionally inferior and 
poisoned foods of today cause many nutritional deficiencies, derangement in 
body chemistry, and lowered resistance to disease." 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritional authorities do not fault the food system itself, but people's 
lack of knowledge in balancing meals for adequate nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"Satisfying the RDAs at the dinner table is a wonderful goal but unrealistic," 
said <PERSON>Paul Saltman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> biology professor and author of 
"The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Nutrition Book." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Net 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you're a superb nutritionist and know how to balance foods to provide 
the essential micronutrients, you need supplements to act as a safety net to 
catch needs that fall through the dietary cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, government studies of older men and women reveal that more than 
half get less than two-thirds of the RDAs for calories and several vitamins and 
minerals, he said. Common deficiencies of the aging include shortages of 
calcium and Vitamin D necessary to combat osteoporosis, the trace minerals zinc 
and iron, and essential B vitamins, such as thiamine, Folacin, B-6 and B-12. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if seniors consume <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>, the figures established by the 
government may be inappropriate for them," <PERSON>Saltman</PERSON> said. "There is only one set 
of RDAs for all men and women over 50, yet there is substantial evidence that 
people's nutritional needs vary dramatically between 51 and 65 or 75." 
</P>
<P>
Nutrition-minded seniors intent on getting adequate amounts of key nutrients 
may encounter another problem: absorption. According to <PERSON>David Olson</PERSON>, a 
chiropractor in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, many seniors have trouble absorbing calcium because 
they cannot produce sufficient stomach acid. Older adults also have trouble 
with Vitamin B-12 absorption, putting them at risk for pernicious anemia. 
</P>
<P>
As the digestive system becomes less efficient in later life, supplementation 
may help offset problems caused by decreased absorption, he said. But people 
also can make life style changes to aid the digestive process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eat Calmly 
</P>
<P>
"To increase absorption, it's important for people to eat calmly," he said, 
"otherwise digestion is hindered by anxiety. And people should chew their food 
throughly before swallowing, because an enzyme secreted in the mouth, ptyalin, 
begins to break down carbohydrates, facilitating digestion." 
</P>
<P>
Olson also recommends eating small, frequent meals throughout the day, easing 
the burden imposed on the digestive system. He also cautions taking fiber 
products -- such as oat bran, apple pectin and wheat bran -- apart from meals, 
because fiber blocks the absorption of certain key minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors who use over-the-counter and prescription medication need to be 
especially conscious of food-drug interactions, which may deplete bodily stores 
of important nutrients, said <PERSON>Jerry Hammond</PERSON>, a pharmacist and president of the 
<ORGANIZATION>San Diego County Pharmacists Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin, for example, impairs assimilation of Vitamin C, he said. Mineral oils, 
found commonly in laxatives, decrease absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins, 
A, D, E and K. Diuretics deplete bodily stores of calcium, potassium, magnesium 
and zinc. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take medication that interferes with vitamin intake, a multiple 
supplement may help replenish depleted nutrients," <PERSON>Hammond</PERSON> said. "I recommend a 
supplement with <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>, along with a calcium supplement to slow down 
the development of osteoporosis." 
</P>
<P>
Still, supplements cannot take the place of a well-balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
Advised <PERSON>Roslyn Alfin-Slater</PERSON>, professor of nutrition at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>School of Public 
Health</ORGANIZATION>: "Eat a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, get plenty of fruits, 
vegetables and whole grains, increase fiber consumption and drink eight glasses 
of fluid daily. Exercise the body and mind regularly, and in the process be 
sure to enjoy all the food that contributes to your health."

<HEAD>Women Who Took Vitamins Showed Reduced Chance Of Birth Defects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study suggesting vitamins taken by women
helped prevent certain birth defects in their children needs further
scrutiny, doctors say.
   Medical researchers interviewed more than 3,000 mothers and found
that those who took vitamins about the time of conception were less
likely to have babies with brain and spine defects than other women.
   But the researchers are unsure whether to credit the vitamins or
some other factor, like diet.
   Evidence remains too thin to recommend that women planning
pregnancies take vitamins to try to ward off birth defects, said <PERSON>Dr.
Joseph Mulinare</PERSON>, who led the study group at the national <ORGANIZATION>Centers for
Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   ``Such a simple solution is almost too good to be true,'' said an
editorial accompanying the study in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American
Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>. ``We need confirmation of this finding from
other studies.''
   Still, the results are valuable because they are a starting point
for further research into vitamins as a guard against defects, like
anencephaly and spina bifida, <PERSON>Mulinare</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Anencephaly, the absence of major parts of the brain, usually is
fatal after a few hours. Spina bifida, the incomplete closing of the
bony casing around the spinal cord, typically causes mild to severe
paralysis of the lower body.
   The defects are equally common and strike about 3,500 infants
each year in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mulinare</PERSON> said.
   He and his colleagues looked at data on all babies born with at
least one of the defects in the five-county <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> area from <DATE>1968</DATE>
through <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   The researchers interviewed mothers of 347 babies born with the
defects, and 2,829 mothers of defect-free babies chosen randomly for
comparison.
   The mothers were asked if they had taken vitamins at least three
times a week during the three months before they became pregnant and
at least three months after conception.
   Fourteen percent of all the mothers reported taking multivitamins
or their equivalent during the entire six-month period, and <PERCENT>40
percent</PERCENT> reported using no vitamins. The remainder of the mothers
either took vitamins only part of the time or couldn't recall, the
researchers said.
   ``We found that women who ... reported using multivitamins three
months prior to conception and in the first three months after
conception had a 50 to <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> reduction in risk of having a baby
with anencephaly or spina bifida, compared with women who reported
not having used any vitamins in that same time period,'' <PERSON>Mulinare</PERSON>
said.
   The researchers made adjustments for differences in the ages of
the mothers, their education levels, alcohol use, past unsuccessful
pregnancies, spermicide use, smoking habits and chronic illnesses.
All of those factors have been linked to differences in birth defect
rates in past research.
   The findings come five years after a British report found
multivitamin use by mothers who already had one baby with a birth
defect seemed to help prevent similar defects in children, the
researchers said.
   <PERSON>Dr. Lewis B. Holmes</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> wrote in an
editorial accompanying the new study that genetic factors may cause
some kinds of spina bifida and that vitamins, even if effective,
would be unlikely to prevent all cases.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Management: Healthy resolutions - Health Check / Tangible
benefits of giving up what one enjoys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a doctor to suggest New Year's resolutions and the answer is
depressingly predictable. Giving up what one enjoys and taking up what one
does not is hard until there are tangible benefits. So just how soon can one
expect returns from giving up smoking, taking up exercise and eating more
healthily?
In the case of smoking, it depends on the end-point you choose. At
post-mortem, no ex-smoker's lungs ever match the healthy pink hue of the
life-long non-smoker's. But lung function usually improves within weeks or
months of stopping, while shortness of breath and coughs gradually recede.
The risk of lung cancer falls gradually once the habit is ditched. However,
new research from <ORGANIZATION>Hope Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Salford</LOCATION>, shows that the risk of lung cancer
in ex-smokers, even if they gave up years ago, remains higher than in those
who never smoked.
On the other hand, some benefits are seen quickly. Personal freshness
improves almost immediately, while giving up smoking in early pregnancy
reduces the risk of miscarriage, growth retardation and stillbirth.
Taking up exercise is demoralising if stiff muscles result, but there are
many later benefits in cardiovascular fitness, mobility, muscle strength and
even mood. Exercise may also help prevent cancer of the prostate, breast, or
bowel, though data are inconclusive.
Exercise has a well-documented effect on blood cholesterol, increasing the
good fraction known as HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and therefore reducing
the risk of coronary heart disease.
How much exercise? The usual advice is to take 20 minutes of brisk exercise
three times a week, checking first with your doctor if unused to activity or
worried about fitness.
Recommendations from the <ORGANIZATION>American College of Sports Medicine</ORGANIZATION> and others
suggest that less vigorous exercise five times a week is enough. A brisk
daily walk of 2km may do the trick.
Exercise usually takes weeks of commitment to make a difference, but
improvements continue for months or years. Studies even show that, in some
people, coronary artery changes are reversed after a year's regular exercise
(but see your doctor first).
<DATE>November</DATE> saw the publication of the Coma (<ORGANIZATION>Committee on Medical Aspects of
Food Policy</ORGANIZATION>) report on cardiovascular disease. Its recommendations for
healthy eating include eating more fibre and starchy carbohydrate - as a
nation we still take too much fat and sugar. It also recommends eating oily
fish twice a week, replacing the breakfast fry-up with cereal and/or toast,
and eating more fruit and vegetables.
Fortunately, no single food is wholly good or bad. Variety and moderation
are important.
Although they did not feature in the Coma report, anti-oxidants are worth
knowing about. They include vitamins C and E, folic acid and beta-carotene
(the precursor of vitamin A), and combat free radicals, which probably cause
cell mutations, and the changes of ageing. Collectively, anti-oxidants are
found in green leafy vegetables, carrots, whole grains and fruits, and there
is some evidence that a diet rich in anti-oxidants does help prevent cancer
and heart disease.
How quickly does a healthy diet work? In most people, changes in fat intake
result in measurable effects from three weeks. The consequences of taking
more anti-oxidants are less clear. Crash diets should not be part of the
plan. Rapid weight loss does not usually stay off, and those whose weight
fluctuates seem to be at greater risk of heart disease than those with
stable weights.
A final recommendation for <DATE>1995</DATE> is based on evidence that people who enjoy
life are healthier and may even have better immunity to infection. So above
all have a Happy New Year.

   Weight-conscious Americans may be giving themselves short shift
on nutrition, says the Center for Vitamin and <ORGANIZATION>Mineral Communications</ORGANIZATION>.
   The organization cites a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> survey of
21,000 people in which not one person got the recommended dietary
allowances (RDAs) of 10 nutrients needed for basic good health.
   The CVMC lists the 10 most needed nutrients, what they do and
where you can get them:
   _ Iron. It helps build healthy blood. An iron deficiency leads to
anemia, meaning blood cannot carry enough oxygen to the body's
cells, leaving you tired, weak and irritable. Best sources for iron
are lean meats, organ meats, green leafy vegetables, nuts, breads,
cereals and eggs. Eating these in combination with a vitamin C
source such as orange juice can help your body absorb more iron from
other foods.
   _ Folacin. It's vital to fetal growth and in making maternal
blood. A woman's blood volume doubles during pregnancy, and her
folacin stores may be depleted quickly if not enough is in her diet.
Folicin is found in leafy green vegetables and organ meats.
Overcooking should be avoided, because folacin is sensitive to heat
and easily destroyed, even with a microwave.
   _ Calcium. A bone and teeth builder, it also helps in blood
clotting, which helps the heart and nervous system work efficiently.
Three out of four women don't get enough calcium, and the deficiency
has been implicated in osteoporosis and high blood pressure. Best
sources are low-fat milk and cheeses, soy products such as tofu, and
broccoli. Cottage cheese, however, is not as rich in calcium as in
other dairy foods.
   _ Zinc. Zinc helps make up many of your body's enzymes that
regulate metabolism and also helps produce hormones for growth,
sexual development, taste, sight, smell and protein building. Recent
research also reveals zinc helps heal wounds and supports immune
functions. Women, the elderly, and vegetarians are most likely to
lack this element. Best sources are oysters, herring, milk and eggs.
Zinc also can be found in whole grains but in less absorbable form.
   _ Water. Water is essential for proper functioning of all cells,
making up two thirds of the body. Choose plain water, juices or
decaffeinated beverages. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, though
liquid, are dehydrants.
   _ Fiber. Fibers promote digestion and alleviate constipation.
Soluble fiber may help lower blood cholesterol and to a more limited
extent, blood sugars. Best sources are oat bran, legumes such as
dried peas and beans, rice bran, fruits and vegetables. Insoluble
fiber can reduce risk of colorectal and similar cancers and can help
diabetics. Whole grains, especially wheat and rye, some fruits and
vegetables are good sources. To increase fiber in your diet, do so
gradually and drink plenty of liquids. Too much fiber can cause
bloating, cramping and diarrhea.
   _ Beta carotene. Though not a vitamin itself, it can be converted
to vitamin A in the body, essential for night vision, healthy skin,
strong teeth and bones, and immunity. Beta carotene is an
antioxidant which will help protect body cells from damage that can
cause cancer. Foods with beta carotene are easy to spot because of a
characteristic carroty color _ cantaloupe, carrots, sweet potatoes,
winter squash and apricots. It also is found in dark leafy greens.
   _ Vitamin B-6. Along with other B vitamins, this element helps
produce energy in body cells. Its main job is to metabolize
proteins, so how much you need depends on how much protein you eat.
Inadequate B-6 may cause memory loss, lack of energy, irritability,
poor concentration, muscle aches, cold sores and digestive problems.
It's estimated that only <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of all Americans, and only <PERCENT>7
percent</PERCENT> of women, get enough of it. Lean meats, whole grains,
legumes, liver, wheat germ, salmon, bananas and sunflower seeds are
sources; these same foods also provide many of the B-complex
vitamins, including niacin, thiamine, B-12, riboflavin, folacin and
others.
   _ Vitamin C. Important for healthy gums, strong bones and teeth,
vitamin C also helps form collagen, the most abundant body protein.
It also is thought to act as an antioxidant, helping protect against
certain types of cancers. Citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, and red
fruits like cherries and strawberries are good sources.
   _ Magnesium. It's part of every body cell, activating enzymes
that keep the body running smoothly. It also promotes bone growth
and helps the nervous system function. Inadequate magnesium in the
blood can cause abnormalities in the heartbeat called arrhythmias,
muscle cramps and muscle twitching. An estimated <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the
population _ and <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of women _ fail to meet daily
requirements for magnesium. Sources include soybeans and soy
products, nuts, legumes, and whole grain foods.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: WINTER AND ALCOHOL DON'T ALWAYS MIX WELL TOGETHER, SO BE 
CAREFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've been on the slopes for hours, and it's time to head back to the lodge. 
Once you get in and get your gear off, you decide to have a good stiff drink to 
warm up before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with this picture? Alcohol does make us feel warm, and who can 
forget the image of the faithful <PERSON>Saint Bernard</PERSON> reviving stranded skiers with a 
cask of Cognac? 
</P>
<P>
But, in truth, that dog might do better carrying hot cocoa rather than Cognac. 
Winter and alcohol aren't always a healthy mix, and the warming effects of 
alcohol are purely illusory. The flush in the cheeks that it produces results 
from dilation of blood vessels in the skin. The net effect is not body warming 
but a loss of body heat. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at appropriate times and in reasonable quantities, alcohol can be 
pleasant and safe. But it's important to understand how it acts in the body. 
Unlike foods, which must be digested before being absorbed, alcohol enters the 
bloodstream intact. Since it's absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, 
the presence of food can provide a barrier, slowing absorption and moderating 
physiological effects. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the blood, alcohol circulates through the body. Some enters the brain, 
where it acts as a central nervous system depressant. The first brain functions 
to be affected are reason and judgment, deluding us into feeling invincible. 
Thus, a drinker on the slopes -- as well as on a highway -- is a menace both to 
himself and to others. If alcohol intake continues, motor skills deteriorate. 
When levels climb high enough, alcohol has an anesthetic effect, which may be 
followed by respiratory failure and death. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking needn't produce such dire consequences as long as consumption doesn't 
exceed the liver's ability to metabolize, or detoxify, the alcohol. A healthy 
adult can metabolize only a single ounce of pure alcohol each hour. This 
approximates the amount in a shot of hard liquor, a glass of wine, or a bottle 
of beer. Nothing -- not coffee, vitamins or exercise -- can speed this 
metabolic process. 
</P>
<P>
Gulping alcoholic drinks, rather than sipping them, produces a stupor. But 
intoxication, even if only occasional, can affect more than just behavior. The 
liver, pancreas and intestines become acutely inflamed. Nutrients, such as 
amino acids and certain vitamins and minerals, may not be absorbed normally. 
Others are not converted to forms the body needs. 
</P>
<P>
Fat accumulates in the liver and, over time, can contribute to cirrhosis, or 
scarring, a life-threatening disorder. Levels of fat in the blood may also 
rise, while blood glucose levels often fall. Add to this the fact that heavy 
drinking frequently replaces nourishing foods, and it can spell nutritional 
havoc. 
</P>
<P>
The kidneys are also affected by alcohol, losing their ability to control water 
balance. This can lead to dehydration and retention of excess uric acid that, 
in turn, can precipitate gout in sensitive individuals. 
</P>
<P>
When athletes drink, the effects can be disastrous. Alcohol not only impairs 
motor skills, raising chances of injury, but the low blood sugar and 
dehydration that drinking produces can severely limit endurance. Performance 
may be affected still further by the shift in metabolism needed to process the 
alcohol. Buildup of lactic acid may occur. Although a normal by-product of 
intense exercise, high lactic-acid levels can contribute to muscle pain and 
soreness. Clearly, an athlete who has been drinking cannot perform at his best, 
although his judgment may be too impaired to realize it. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women -- and women who are attempting to get pregnant -- should also 
avoid alcohol. The risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, including physical birth 
defects, mental retardation and behavior problems, is greatest in children born 
to mothers who drink heavily. But even moderate consumption could be risky, 
especially early in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is an athlete or pregnant or a heavy drinker. Even so, alcohol 
does translate into empty calories. With seven calories per gram, it has almost 
as many as fat (which has nine per gram) and nearly twice as many as 
carbohydrates and proteins, which both have four. And alcohol calories contain 
little else. Usually, any vitamin and minerals in the drink come from what's 
been added to the alcohol, such as orange juice. Most mixers are also high in 
empty calories, containing substantial amounts of sugar and very little real 
fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
While it may seem that a daily beer, martini or glass of wine poses little 
threat to the waistline, keep in mind that just the extra 85 to 140 calories 
per day can mean nine to <MONEY>15 pounds</MONEY> in a year. And in small doses, alcohol may 
stimulate the appetite. That's fine if you want to gain a few pounds. But if 
you're trying to avoid adding extra weight, it can sabotage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frozen or Canned Vegetables: OK to Buy the Least Expensive 
</P>
<P>
Question: My friend and I are having a friendly argument about whether canned 
or frozen vegetables are superior. We're both along in years and living on 
limited incomes. I take the position of buying what's least expensive: canned 
vegetables. She sticks with frozen whenever possible, because they're richer in 
vitamins and minerals. Who's correct? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are. Price, taste and sometimes special dietary considerations go 
into the decision about whether to buy canned or frozen vegetables. Also, the 
practical matter of whether there's room in the freezer can figure in. 
</P>
<P>
Nutrients are lost as produce is processed either by freezing or canning. Any 
differences in vitamin and mineral content between the two are too small to be 
significant. You should keep in mind, though, that once you get the product 
home, you can affect its nutrient content by using proper handling techniques 
in the kitchen. Chief among these are using only a minimum of water and cooking 
frozen vegetables just until done. 
</P>
<P>
Q: During my first pregnancy I had terrible morning sickness. In anticipation 
of having another baby, I'd like to know whether there's any new dietary advice 
about measures to control the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not really. For some people, several time-honored suggestions do seem to 
help minimize, if not eliminate, the symptoms of morning sickness. One is to 
eat a few dry crackers before getting out of bed. Second, some women seem to 
tolerate several small meals better than three large ones. Taking liquids a 
half-hour before or after -- but not with -- meals also may help. Avoiding 
fried foods and cutting back on fat in general, avoiding spicy foods and such 
strongly flavored vegetables as cabbage, broccoli, turnips and onions all are 
recommended as measures that can offer relief. But the best antidote is a 
little time. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, for those women who are vulnerable to it, the nausea and vomiting 
often begin to subside after about the <DATE>12th week</DATE> of pregnancy. The main point, 
of course, is that while the discomfort during early pregnancy can curtail your 
normal intake, it's important to resume as soon as possible a diet to meet not 
only your own nutrient needs but those of the developing baby. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our family agrees on very few vegetables besides broccoli, which we all 
love. I know it's rich in beta carotene and contains other compounds linked to 
decreased risk of cancer. These are great features, but does it provide other 
nutrients as well? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your family picked a winner, because broccoli is a nutritionally potent 
vegetable -- and a tasty one too. Government studies show that consumption is 
rising across the nation as more and more Americans come to appreciate broccoli 
for its flavor, as well as its contributions to nutrient needs. 
</P>
<P>
As you point out, it does contain considerable beta carotene, whose bright 
orange color is masked by the chlorophyll. In fact, a medium stalk provides 
nearly enough to meet the day's requirement for Vitamin A. While we don't tend 
to think of vegetables as sources of protein, the same stalk has nearly six 
grams, almost as much as an ounce of meat, making it one of the strongest 
vegetable sources. True, the quality is not equivalent to that in meat, but if 
eaten as part of a mixed meal, other foods can provide the amino acids it 
lacks, allowing the body to use it efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli has still other assets. It's an exceptionally good source of Vitamin 
C; it provides a number of B vitamins, and it's one of the best non-dairy 
sources of calcium. All that, and a single stalk has just 50 calories. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli does not take kindly to overcooking, which may explain its lack of 
popularity in some households. To avoid overcooking and at the same time 
conserve nutrients and flavor, stand it upright in about an inch of boiling 
water, cover the pot and let it cook for about 10 minutes, until barely done.

 FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SORRY SAGA OF EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON PREGNANCY AND 
UNBORN INFANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently read an article advising against drinking alcohol during 
pregnancy. The author said that the dangers of alcohol were first identified in 
a report published only 20 years ago. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Not exactly, although the modern process for studying the problem fell 
into place around then. An issue of the journal Public Health Reports devoted 
to alcohol-related problems contains an article by <PERSON>Dr. Kenneth R. Warren</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Richard Bast</PERSON> of the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Clearinghouse for Alcoholism</ORGANIZATION> and Drug Information that reviews the 
sorry saga of concern about the effects of alcohol on unborn infants. 
</P>
<P>
Lower birth weights and a rise in deaths were observed during the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> "Gin 
Epidemic" between <DATE>1720</DATE> and <DATE>1750</DATE>. It was a period of good wages, plentiful food 
and relative freedom from epidemic diseases. However, <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> had reduced 
controls on the distilling and sale of gin in order to support the gentry who 
furnished the raw materials. This encouraged alcohol consumption. Reports and 
petitions from physicians and others referred to effects on children that 
correlate with what we today call <ORGANIZATION>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</ORGANIZATION> (FAS). 
</P>
<P>
Such reports on the impact of alcohol on growth and development continued 
through the 18th and <DATE>19th centuries</DATE>, often mixing science and mortality. In 
<DATE>1899</DATE>, <PERSON>Dr. William Sullivan</PERSON> reported his observations of 600 offspring of 120 
women alcoholic prisoners in <LOCATION>Liverpool</LOCATION>, describing what was later called FAS. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> (as well as <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>), with the arrival of 
Prohibition, concern about the effects of alcohol on pregnancy were largely 
ignored for about 20 years. Ironically, much of the research conducted during 
the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and beyond tended to refute the harmful ramifications of drinking. 
Alcohol was even recommended to pregnant women for "sluggish digestion" and was 
used to delay labor. 
</P>
<P>
Then in <DATE>1967</DATE>, <PERSON>Alexandre Lamache</PERSON>, a family physician in <LOCATION>Rennes</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, 
presented to the French Academy his observations of 1,245 children, collected 
during 37 years of practice. This signaled a rebirth of interest in 
alcohol-related birth abnormalities. A year later, a group of French 
researchers published what was apparently the first well-organized study of 
birth defects. In <DATE>1970</DATE>, the pattern of characteristic abnormalities labeled FAS 
was first described in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, estimates based on 20 studies from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> 
indicate that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading cause of mental 
retardation, ahead of Down's syndrome and spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please tell me something about the vegetable called kohlrabi. 
</P>
<P>
A: Botanically, kohlrabi (the name derives from the German word for cabbage and 
the Latin word for turnip) belongs to the cabbage family. Although the leaves 
are edible, the turnip-like root is usually considered the best part. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritionally, a half cup cooked contains about 40 calories and provides some B 
vitamins and Vitamin C. It is an excellent source of potassium, a useful 
vegetable for people taking diuretics that cause them to lose that nutrient. 
</P>
<P>
While it can be easily diced and cooked until tender, it can also be braised in 
broth, whipped with potatoes, served with sauces, stuffed, cooked in soup, or 
served cold with vinaigrette dressing. Introduced in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> during 
the <ORGANIZATION>7th Century</ORGANIZATION>, it appears in various Chinese recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've noticed that when nutrients are added to foods, the word "enriched" 
sometimes appears on the label, while other times the word "fortified" is used. 
What, if any, is the difference? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both terms are associated with the addition of nutrients, but the underlying 
concepts differ. "Enrichment" refers to the restoration of nutrients discarded 
during processing. Nutrients are added back at levels equal to or not much 
greater than those in the original food. The classic example of enrichment is 
the restoration of iron along with the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin and 
niacin to white flour. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortification" is the addition of nutrients that either are not normally 
present in food, or the amount available is too small to be nutritionally 
significant. A number of fortification measures have been dramatically 
effective in combatting major nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, more than 40 years ago, carotene, which the body converts to 
Vitamin A, was first added to margarine in <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> when it was discovered that 
the switch from butter to margarine during World War II was linked to blindness 
among children there. Similarly, milk was a logical vehicle for Vitamin D 
fortification to prevent rickets. And the addition of iodine to salt was an 
effective tool in preventing goiter. 
</P>
<P>
Those were important public-health measures. In recent years, the basis for 
much fortification seems far less clear. In many cases, the addition of 
generous helpings of vitamins and minerals appears to be inspired more by the 
goal of selling products than by a demonstrated need for the added nutrients. 
Selecting heavily fortified cereals or other foods containing as much as <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> 
of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Recommended Daily Allowance for some nutrients is no substitute for 
consuming a varied and well-balanced diet.

ROCHE, the Basle-based pharmaceutical group, said consolidated sales reached
SFr12.9bn (Dollars 9bn) in <DATE>1992</DATE>, 13 per cent higher than in <DATE>1991</DATE>.
There was a 'gratifying improvement' in operations which, together with
healthy income from investments, resulted in 'another considerable growth in
group profits'. All divisions contributed to the good result.
Pharmaceutical sales were up 16 per cent to SFr6.9bn, with sales of
Rocephin, <LOCATION>Dormicum</LOCATION>, Roferon-A, <ORGANIZATION>Rivotril</ORGANIZATION> and Furtulon showing strong volume
growth.
Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals rose 13 per cent to SFr3.1bn. Growing
scientific evidence of the prophylactic effect of important vitamins led to
a rise in the sales volume of vitamin E, vitamin B6, folic acid and
beta-carotene.
Diagnostic product revenues gained 9 per cent to SFr1.55bn, due to the
contribution of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> service laboratories.

<HEAD>Study: Vitamins Do Not Protect Against Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who take vitamins before they get pregnant do
not reduce the risk of birth defects, a study concludes.
   The research contradicts earlier reports suggesting that women
who take multiple vitamins before they conceive are less likely to
have babies with defects of the neural tube, which develops into the
brain and spinal cord.
   ``We found that vitamin use was associated with neither an
increased nor a decreased risk of neural tube defects,'' wrote the
authors of the latest study.
   The work was conducted by <PERSON>Dr. James L. Mills</PERSON> and colleagues from
the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</ORGANIZATION>. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The doctors asked 571 women who had babies with neural tube
defects whether they had taken vitamin pills or eaten
vitamin-fortified cereal before they got pregnant. They were
compared with 573 mothers of healthy babies and 546 who had babies
with other birth defects.
   The researchers found no difference in vitamin use between the
three groups.
   ``These results indicate that the use of vitamin supplements by
American women'' around the time of conception ``is unlikely to lead
to any important reduction in the frequency of neural tube
defects,'' the researchers wrote.
   Types of neural tube defects include anencephaly, in which babies
are born without a cerebrum.

   Niacin May Hinder Diabetics' Efforts
   To Control Blood Sugar, Report Says
   ----
   By Jerry E. Bishop
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4
</SO>
<LP>
   Medical researchers warned that using niacin to reduce
high blood cholesterol levels could interfere with diabetics'
attempts to control their blood sugar levels.
   Niacin, widely sold and also known as nicotinic acid, is
one of the B complex of vitamins.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For most diabetics with high cholesterol levels,
"nicotinic acid therapy must be used with caution or avoided
altogether," declared a report in this week's Journal of the
<ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> from two nutrition scientists at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>.
   Doctors have known since the mid-1950s that large daily
doses of niacin can lower blood cholesterol levels. Because
it is so cheap, widely available and has few side effects,
niacin is one of the "first choice" cholesterol-lowering
drugs recommended by the federally backed <ORGANIZATION>National
Cholesterol Education Program</ORGANIZATION>. Niacin, which can be bought
without a prescription, also is recommended in many popular
controls on cholesterol levels.
   Niacin is recommended especially for people who have both
a high level of cholesterol and high levels of fats, or
triglycerides, in their bloodstreams, a group that includes
many diabetics.
   In their report, Drs. <PERSON>Abhimanyu Garg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scott M. Grundy</PERSON>
said they asked 13 male diabetics with high cholesterol and
triglyceride levels to take high doses of niacin daily for
eight weeks. All the men had what is known as
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the kind of diabetes
that usually develops in adulthood when, for unknown reasons,
insulin from the pancreas gland is no longer sufficient to
control the amount of sugar circulating in the bloodstream.
One man was controlling his diabetes with diet while the
other 12 were using either insulin injections or an
anti-diabetic drug to hold down blood sugar levels.
   During the diabetics' stays in a research ward at a
veterans hospital, the researchers checked their cholesterol,
triglyceride and blood sugar levels before treatment, during
the eight weeks they were taking niacin and during an
eight-week "control" period when no niacin was taken.
   As expected, the niacin, at doses of 1,500 milligrams
three times a day, lowered the mean cholesterol level of the
13 volunteers by <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT>. The mean level of LDL-cholesterol, the
"bad" form linked to heart disease, dropped <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> while the
HDL-cholesterol, the "good" kind that protects against heart
disease, rose <PERCENT>34%</PERCENT>.
   But, the researchers reported, control of the patients'
diabetes deteriorated, with levels of blood sugar (glucose)
rising <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> while niacin was being taken. One patient
experienced a sharp rise in blood glucose levels that
increased doses of insulin failed to correct. Two other
patients had to reduce or stop their diabetes medications
because of a drop in blood sugar levels.
   Levels of uric acid in the blood rose in all 13 patients
while taking niacin, with two patients experiencing extremely
high uric acid levels. High uric acid levels often accompany
gout. Although none of the volunteers complained of gout,
niacin could increase the risk of such a disorder, the
researchers suggested.
   "Therefore, it can be argued that the benefits" of
lowering cholesterol levels in the diabetic patients with
niacin "may be counterbalanced" by a worsening of the blood
sugar control, Drs. <PERSON>Garg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Grundy</PERSON> wrote.
   The researchers suggested that doctors consider using
other cholesterol-lowering drugs in diabetics.
   The report was the second strike against niacin in recent
weeks. Earlier, doctors reported at least four cases of liver
damage occurring in patients who switched from conventional
niacin to large doses of new sustained-release tablets of the
vitamin. Three of the patients used the vitamin for lowering
cholesterol while a fourth used it for general good health.

   Cigarette smokers need more than 1{ times as
much vitamin C a day as non-smokers, the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>
said <DATE>Monday</DATE> in revising its nutrient intake recommendations for the
first time in nearly a decade.
   ``Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin,
leading to lower concentrations in the blood,'' the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> said in the
10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances.
   The new guidelines say that non-smokers need 60 milligrams of
vitamin C a day and that smokers need at least 100 milligrams. The
recommendation for pregnant women who do not smoke is 70 milligrams
a day.
   RDAs are defined as intake levels of essential nutrients that
are ``adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all
healthy persons.'' People with special nutritional needs are not
covered by the RDAs.
   The recommended allowances for nutrients are amounts intended to
be consumed as part of a normal diet; the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> said they ``are
neither minimal requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of
intake.''
   RDAs are used in a number of ways by different groups. The
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, uses them to evaluate the
adequacy of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> food supply, for establishing standards for
food-assistance programs and for determining the nutritional status
of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> popoulation.
   Most average Americans come in contact most often with
nutritional information as it is listed on cereal boxes. Such
figures are derived from the RDAs.
   The new, 285-page volume leaves most previous recommendations
unchanged or modifies them only slightly. It does include some
important revisions.
   Instead of basing RDAs for adults on arbitrary heights and
weights, allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in
the population.
   Requirements for folate, which is found in liver, leafy
vegetables and some fruit, have been reduced from 400 micrograms
for both men and women to 240 micrograms for men aged 25 to 50 and
190 micrograms for women of the same ages.
   The <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> for vitamin B-12, an essential nutrient for maintaining
normal metabolism and function of the blood-forming organs, was
reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2.
   The new edition lists recommended dietary allowances for
protein, 11 vitamins and 7 minerals. It points out that besides
known nutrients, food contains thousands of other naturally
occurring substances of certain nutritional value.
   ``A varied diet meeting RDAs,'' said the subcommittee of the
<ORGANIZATION>Food and Nutrition Board</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>, ``will probably be adequate in
all other nutrients.''
   The recommendations are not daily objectives, but rather goals
to be met over time.
   ``In planning meals or food supplies,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>, ``it is
technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a
single day's diet that contains all the RDAs for all the
nutrients.''

<HEAD>Sullivan Discusses Food-Labeling Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and <ORGANIZATION>Human Services</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Louis
Sullivan</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> disclosed additional details about the
food-labeling rules being drafted, but it's still undecided whether
they will apply uniformly.
   Sullivan declined to discuss the uniformity question during a
speech to a conference on food safety and nutrition, saying ``this
issue is under review within the administration.'' He also declined
to discuss it after his speech.
   Administration sources have said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>'s department wants the
federal regulations to supersede state regulations, but that <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> officials don't want to preclude the states from adding
stronger regulations.
   <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is the only state that might be directly affected.
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said he believed the uniformity question would be
resolved ``very soon.'' He previously said he wanted to get the
proposed regulations out by the end of this month, but he declined
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to be that specific.
   The proposal, to be issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>,
would require nutrition labeling on most foods _ including most
fresh produce and seafood.
   Nutrition labels would have to appear on all packaged food. For
unpackaged foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood,
other methods of displaying the information would be allowed, such
as leaflets or posters where the foods are sold.
   Also, manufacturers would have to show on the label the number
of calories from fat and the amount of saturated fatty acids,
cholesterol and total dietary fiber.
   The regulations would define the terms ``cholesterol free,''
``low cholesterol'' and ``reduced cholesterol'' to eliminate
misleading claims.
   Restaurants, bakeries, cafeterias and some small businesses
would be exempt from the regulations, <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said. Also waived
from the requirements would be bite-size foods and foods that have
no meaningful sources of calories and nutrients, he said.
   Another change would update the reference values, now called the
Recommended Daily Allowance or <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION>, used to compare the nutrition
content of foods and evaluate a food's contribution to the diet.
   <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> would be replaced with the term Reference Daily Intakes, or
<ORGANIZATION>RDI</ORGANIZATION>, and updated values would be proposed for protein and for 12
vitamins and seven minerals that have RDAs.
   Vitamin K, manganese and other nutrients that don't have RDAs
would be added to the list with reference values.
   Reference values also would be established for fat, cholesterol,
sodium and fiber, but manufacturers would not be required to
include that in their nutrition labels, <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said.
   The food industry has lobbied strongly for a labeling policy
that would be standard across the country.
   <PERSON>John Cady</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Food Processors
Association</ORGANIZATION>, said that if labeling rules differed from state to
state, consumers would be confused and distribution logistics would
increase food costs substantially.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Center for Science</ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest wants the states
to be able to bolster any federal food-labeling requirements. But
even with that issue aside, center officials say the department's
proposals ``are inadequate given the severity of the problem.''
   <PERSON>Bruce Silverglade</PERSON>, legal affairs director for the center, said
the organization obtained a draft copy of some portions of the
proposed regulations. Because of several deficiencies in the
proposal, he said, the center is urging passage of congressional
legislation that is tougher.
   <PERSON>Silverglade</PERSON> said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>'s proposal was defective because it
would not require manufacturers to disclose how much fat,
cholesterol, sodium and fiber a food contributes to the maximum
daily amounts a person should consume. It also would not require
disclosure of sugar content or set a deadline for final agency
action, he said.
   Current requirements, established 17 years ago, call for
nutrition labeling only when a manufacturer adds vitamins, minerals
or proteins or makes a nutritional claim about the product.

which is labeled voluntarily.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NUTRITION, THE EIGHT ESSENTIAL 
AMINO ACIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The caricature of early man is of a brawny fellow with a huge club, dressed in 
animal skins and gnawing on a bone. While it's true that our ancient ancestors 
did engage in hunting, we know they were not the carnivores portrayed in 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Roots, berries, leaves, nuts, eggs and fruits were staples of their diet. And 
such game as they did catch was far leaner than the farm-grown meats we eat 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The 20th-Century stereotype of cave men perpetuates the myth that meat is 
power. Eating large quantities is linked in many people's minds to surging 
growth, bulging muscles and athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, meat is rich in protein and is a vital nutrient. Carbohydrates, 
fats and proteins can all provide us with energy, but only protein has the 
capacity to build, repair and maintain the body's tissues, including those in 
the kidneys, liver and skin. Proteins are components of enzymes and of certain 
hormones, and are needed to make blood cells and infection-fighting antibodies, 
as well as for growing hair and nails. Proteins are part of the carpentry that 
helps keep the body erect; it is the grout that holds the cells together. 
</P>
<P>
Like other constituents of the body, proteins eventually get used up and must 
be replaced. The body constructs its own proteins from those in the foods we 
eat. Every animal, vegetable or microbe has special types of proteins, so there 
are countless kinds, designed to meet the needs of particular organisms. These 
millions of proteins are all formed from only 20 different building blocks -- 
amino acids -- put together in different ways, just as words are made from the 
alphabet or structures from a Lego set. 
</P>
<P>
Our body's task is to take the proteins of other organisms and transform them 
into types we can use to repair and maintain our cells. By breaking down the 
proteins in foods into their component amino acids, and then reassembling them, 
our bodies can manufacture some of the amino acids and from them some of the 
proteins. These are called "nonessential" because we do not have to get them 
ready-made in foods. 
</P>
<P>
But there are eight amino acids we cannot make from raw materials and that must 
be included in our diets. These "essential amino acids" have to be present in 
the foods we eat or we will be placed in nutritional jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Here's where meat comes in. Animal foods most closely resemble the proteins in 
our bodies. They contain all the amino acids in the right proportions, which 
makes them "of highest biologic value." A smaller, overall amount of protein of 
high biological value will give us the same amount of amino acids (and thus 
overall usable protein) as a large amount of a "poor" protein, like those in 
plant foods. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean we should don cave-man clothes and go out hunting for meat? 
Absolutely not. While meat certainly provides generous amounts of amino acids, 
we don't need to depend exclusively on high-quality proteins (some of which are 
laden with fat and/or cholesterol) to meet our amino-acid needs. Habitually, we 
eat a variety of foods containing proteins of differing qualities. The daily 
Recommended Dietary Allowance is 56 grams (or two ounces) of pure protein for a 
man and 46 grams (1.6 ounces) for a non-pregnant, non-nursing woman. 
</P>
<P>
These quotas are not that hard to fill. One cup of milk, for instance, has nine 
grams of protein. An ounce of ground beef has seven, an egg has six, and one 
tablespoon of peanut butter, four. A woman, then, can get nearly <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of her 
protein requirement from two cups of milk. Add an egg and three ounces of meat, 
fish or poultry, and she'll have all the protein she needs for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Many other foods are also good protein sources. A half-cup of oatmeal has three 
grams, as does one slice of whole-wheat bread. A cup of spinach has five grams, 
a stalk of broccoli six. One medium baked potato has three grams -- and the 
quality is impressive too. 
</P>
<P>
A very small amount of protein of high quality that contributes the missing 
essential amino acids can be mixed in to upgrade the quality of "poor" 
proteins. For instance, cereals are generally low in the amino acid lysine, 
whereas milk contains ample amounts. When we pour milk on breakfast cereal, we 
create a complete protein. 
</P>
<P>
A meal that supplements rice with beans or combines the two with small portions 
of fish, poultry or other meat is an excellent model of this mutual 
supplementation of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Simply by virtue of the variety of foods consumed, the typical American diet 
provides all the protein -- and thus the essential amino acids -- we require, 
and more. So if you eat a varied diet, your protein profile is one thing you 
need not worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Depend on <PERSON>Herb Teas</PERSON> as Substitutes for Medical Care 
</P>
<P>
Question: I have a friend who insists that in the interests of my health I 
should switch from regular tea and coffee to herb teas. Is this really 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: From our perspective, a more sensible course might be to use all three 
in moderation. While herb teas may convey a sense of the "natural" (though they 
are no more so than coffee or tea), the fact is that herbs contain a variety of 
compounds that are extracted when the herbs are steeped in hot water. Some of 
these compounds are potentially harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking herb teas to avoid the known effects of caffeine may expose 
individuals to chemicals about which we know far less. Moreover, herb teas have 
not been subjected to animal studies that simulate the effects of drinking tea. 
</P>
<P>
And despite claims of benefit in the popular press, it is never a good idea to 
depend on herb teas as substitutes for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the most part we eat plain fruit for dessert, but every few weeks I bake 
a fruit tart as a special treat. I would prefer to make the crust out of oil 
instead of solid shortening, but so far have been unable to find a recipe. 
Since I don't have time to experiment on my own, can you help me out? 
</P>
<P>
A: We can. For a simple crust, mix 1 1/3 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup 
oil and three tablespoons cold milk. Then mix and roll. 
</P>
<P>
In a study done <DATE>several years ago</DATE>, trained panelists found that vegetable oils 
produced better flavor and more flakiness than crust made with solid 
shortening. No color differences among the crusts were detected, and the only 
negative observation was that crusts made with solid shortening shrunk less 
than the ones made with vegetable oils. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been put on diuretic medication and advised to eat lots of fruits and 
vegetables to get extra potassium. Can you provide me with specific information 
about how to get good sources into my diet? 
</P>
<P>
A: A large glass of orange juice and a banana sliced over breakfast cereal are 
two good ways to build up your potassium intake. But there are many more. Among 
the best vegetable sources are winter squash, dandelion and mustard greens, and 
cooked kidney beans. Baked potatoes provide generous amounts, and so do sweet 
potatoes, broccoli, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, corn, beets, <DATE>summer</DATE> 
squash and spinach. In addition to oranges and bananas, fruits that contain the 
greatest amounts include cantaloupe, watermelon and grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
And remember that other fruits and vegetables may not contribute as much, but 
they do add to the total. So the advice to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables 
of all types really is the key to ensuring that you get your needed potassium, 
along with goodly amounts of other vitamins and minerals.

<HEAD>Adults Should Eat Less Salt, Research Council Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Health and Diet, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average American adult can get along on as
little as 500 milligrams of salt a day, far less than the usual
diet contains, the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> says.
   ``Although no optimal range of salt intake has been established,
there is no known advantage in consuming large amounts of sodium
and clear disadvantages for those susceptible to hypertension,''
the council said in an update of its nutritional recommendations.
   The <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>'s 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances,
published today, also says cigarette smokers need at least 100
milligrams of vitamin C per day _ as opposed to 60 milligrams for
adult non-smokers.
   ``Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin,
leading to lower concentrations in the blood,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>.
   The new guidelines also say pregnant women should increase
vitamin C to 70 milligrams a day.
   The new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient
recommendations in nearly 10 years. The RDAs are a major guide for
developing nutrition programs and policies.
   ``There are a lot of little changes, up and down, but not
earthshaking,'' said <PERSON>Michael Jacobson</PERSON>, executive director for the
<ORGANIZATION>Center for Science</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Public Interest</ORGANIZATION>, a health advocacy group.
   One of the noteworthy changes, he said, is the one on sodium.
   ``This marks the first time this committee or any other official
committee suggested so low a number,'' <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> said. ``They are
telling Americans what is optimal, not what's convenient.''
   About <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from
processed food. ``A typical serving of canned soup has almost 1,000
milligrams of sodium as flavoring,'' <PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> said. ``A fast-food
cheeseburger has 1,400 milligrams.''
   He said previous recommendations specified 1,100 to 3,300
milligrams of sodium a day for adults.
   The new recommendations are not daily objectives, but rather
goals to be met over time.
   ``In planning meals or food supplies,'' said the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>, ``it is
technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a
single day's diet that contains all the RDAs for all the
nutrients.''
   RDAs are defined as levels of essential nutrients that are
``adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all
healthy persons.'' People with special nutritional needs are not
covered by the RDAs.
   The recommended allowances are intended to be consumed as part
of a normal diet. The <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> said they ``are neither minimal
requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of intake.''
   RDAs are used in a number of ways by different groups. The
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, uses them to evaluate the
adequacy of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> food supply, for setting standards for food
assistance programs and determining the nutritional status of the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population.
   Most average Americans come in contact most often with the
nutrition information listed on the sides of breakfast cereal
boxes. They are derived from the RDAs.
   The new volume leaves most previous recommendations unchanged or
modified only slightly, but it includes some important changes.
Instead of basing RDAS for adults on arbitrary heights and weights,
allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in the
population.
   The <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> for vitamin B12, an essential nutrient for maintaining
normal metabolism and function of the blood-forming organs, was
reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2 micrograms.
   The new edition lists recommended allowances for protein, 11
vitamins and 7 minerals. It points out that besides known
nutrients, food contains thousands of other naturally occurring
substances of nutritional value.
   ``A varied diet meeting RDAs,'' said the subcommittee of the
<ORGANIZATION>Food and Nutrition Board</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>, ``will probably be adequate in
all other nutrients.''

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: DO WE HAVE A NATURAL HUNGER FOR NUTRIENTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON>'s movie "Sleeper," set far in the future, he explains to a 
surprised traveler from the past that hot-fudge sundaes and steaks have been 
found to be good for you. We'd all like to live that fantasy: having foods that 
look, smell and taste good turn out to be the most nutritious. Even better 
would be if the reverse were true: if finding a food distasteful signaled that 
it was not nutritious, or even plain bad for us. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, that implies an inborn ability to select a good diet and avoid a poor one 
-- equipment we lack. It's true that we do have some general genetic 
information handed down from remote ancestors, as well as more recent 
scientific and cultural guidelines. Otherwise, we're on our own in dealing with 
a huge, varied food supply perhaps as challenging as that faced by the 
hunter-gatherers of long ago. The human race has been so successful as a 
species partly because we are omnivores, able to adapt to new sources of 
nourishment -- provided we experiment with caution. 
</P>
<P>
By this time in our evolution, the ways we choose foods are complex. Dr. <PERSON>Paul 
Rozin</PERSON>, professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>, recently 
published an update in Nutrition Reviews on how long-lasting food preferences 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few genetically programmed biases for or against certain food 
substances. Thousands of years ago, two bits of enduring information were 
acquired by our nomadic progenitors: Sweetness provides energy and bitterness 
can signal harm. 
</P>
<P>
Today, when drops of salty, sour, bitter or sweet solutions are placed on the 
tongues of newborn babies, their expressions range from emphatic rejection of 
the bitter solution to beaming acceptance of the sweet one. The age-old lesson 
is still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Humans also instinctively display ambivalence about new foods -- suspicion 
coupled with curiosity. Historically, man has had an inborn ability to make the 
link between a given food and unpleasant consequences. This information was 
handed down through the generations, promoting survival of the species. 
</P>
<P>
There are innate hungers for a few essential nutrients. Earlier in this 
century, <PERSON>Dr. Curt Richter</PERSON> conducted classic studies with rats (another 
successful omnivorous species). Sodium-deficient for the first time, the rats 
selected high-sodium foods. Made thirsty, they chose foods high in water. It's 
also possible, but unproven, that there are innate hungers for protein, 
carbohydrate and calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, over time humans (and rats) learn to identify foods that are 
deficient in specific nutrients and foods that supply the lack. Long before a 
deficiency of <ORGANIZATION>Vitamin C</ORGANIZATION> was pinpointed as a cause of scurvy, British ships were 
carrying preventive medicine in the form of limes (citrus fruits are high in 
Vitamin C) on long voyages. Centuries before, the diet of Chinese sailors 
included the fresh, Vitamin C-rich leaves of ginger plants. 
</P>
<P>
Predominantly, however, our food choices are influenced by culture and 
ethnicity, and by individual experiences, pleasant and unpleasant. Sometimes 
cultural knowledge is a plus. The ancient Mexican practice of soaking corn 
kernels in lime water to soften them for tortillas also releases niacin in the 
corn for absorption by the body and helps prevent pellagra in corn-eating 
populations. Fermenting milk to produce yogurt makes it possible for 
lactose-intolerant people to enjoy its nutritional benefits, among them 
protein, riboflavin and calcium. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you belong to the people of northern <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, who 
habitually eat a high-salt diet, you have a better chance of developing 
hypertension than inhabitants of the southern Japanese islands, where salt 
consumption is low. An innate recognition of the need for enough sodium is not 
paralleled by an inner gauge signaling when you've had too much. Similarly, the 
universal inborn preference for sweet flavors doesn't extend to an instinctive 
knowledge that sugary foods, particularly sticky ones, are harmful to teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Within cultures, there are many variations in individual food preferences. 
Strangely enough, though, family relationships have little impact on individual 
choices. Heredity plays a role in obesity, but bows out when it comes to food 
selection. Even a mother's or father's likes and dislikes have no great 
influence on those of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Why the family has so little imprint on individual choices is a mystery. 
Another public-health puzzle is why people like or dislike foods because of 
their intrinsic sensory properties. Obviously, it's easier to persuade people 
to eat healthy foods if they also taste good. Worldwide, the food industry is 
devoting some <MONEY>$2.5 billion</MONEY> annually to finding ways to give flavor to low-salt 
products, add sweetness to foods low in sugar, or introduce a rich and creamy 
"fat" sensation without using fat. 
</P>
<P>
Both as nutritionists and as food lovers, our taste is for fresh and lightly 
processed foods. But with all this research going on, maybe <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s 
hot-fudge-sundae future isn't so far away after all. 
</P>
<P>
Question: While listening to a TV talk show that took viewers' calls, I heard a 
mother call in and ask if it was safe to let her two daughters, age 10 and 12, 
become vegetarians. The answer given was that it was fine, especially if the 
diet contained dairy products and eggs. However, the person on the show was a 
health reporter, not a nutritionist. Was the advice sound? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Indeed it was, as far as it went. A lacto-ovo vegetarian diet can 
provide enough of the essential nutrients young people need for growth and 
development. Contrary to popular belief, however, the nutrient that deserves 
special attention is not protein. Almost certainly, it will be present in 
sufficient amounts -- not only from dairy products and eggs but from the 
vegetables and grains the youngsters eat to get the calories they need. 
</P>
<P>
Iron is a different story. In vegetarian diets, the amount of iron is more 
limited. Iron from vegetable sources also is absorbed less efficiently than 
iron from animal flesh. For these reasons, it's important to pay particular 
attention both to getting enough iron into the diet and to making sure that 
it's well absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Iron-rich foods include enriched and fortified breads and cereals, dark-green 
leafy vegetables and dried beans. The key to enhancing absorption from these 
foods is Vitamin C. That's found in generous amounts in many fruits and 
vegetables, among them citrus fruits, tomatoes, cantaloupe, honeydew, broccoli, 
green pepper and cabbage. Serving a C-source along with an iron source makes 
good nutritional sense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought a tube of concentrated tomato paste in an Italian grocery. The 
packaging had no instructions about how much to use in place of regular tomato 
paste in a can, and nobody in the store could tell me. Do you know? 
</P>
<P>
A: Whether it comes in a tube or a can, we're talking about the same product. 
Either way, that means about 15 calories per tablespoon, virtually all from 
carbohydrate. Use the same amount as you would if the paste came in a can. The 
advantage of the tube is when a recipe only calls for a tablespoon or two. Of 
course, it can be more expensive to buy it in this form. You could open a can 
of paste when you need a small amount and divide the rest into small portions 
to store in the freezer until needed. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, tubes of tomato paste and other seasoning are only beginning 
to become popular. In <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, this form of packaging has been in use for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there any differences in the Vitamin-C content of frozen orange juice 
prepared from concentrate versus the juice available in the dairy case? 
</P>
<P>
A: The differences are insignificant. In six ounces of juice, the average 
amount of Vitamin C ranges from 74 to 76 milligrams, considerably more than the 
Recommended Daily Allowance of 60 mg. It's true that Vitamin-C losses occur as 
the juice sits in the refrigerator. To minimize losses, keep the juice tightly 
covered. Refrigerate it promptly after use, and buy amounts that you can use up 
within a few days.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: BETTER SKIP MAIL-ORDER DIAGNOSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Tufts University</ORGANIZATION> student walked into introductory nutrition recently and 
handed one of us a thick booklet. It had come from a "wellness center" in 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> where her mother was considering signing on for an evaluation. The 
student had a healthy skepticism about what was being offered her mother -- 
skepticism that was right on target. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the program worked. For a fee of <MONEY>$125</MONEY>, payable in advance, the 
subscriber would get "56 chemistries, a consultation and a month of answers to 
questions." A postscript advised that follow-up by mail at <MONEY>$50</MONEY> for three 
months, or at the bargain cost of <MONEY>$150</MONEY> a year, or in-person appointments at <MONEY>$50</MONEY> 
each were "highly beneficial" to success in a "new lifestyle of optimum 
health." 
</P>
<P>
According to the cover letter, laboratories where the chemical analyses can be 
performed are available in eight states from <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In the next section, the subscriber was asked to furnish an extensive and 
somewhat strange health history, reminiscent of those used by charlatans for 
decades. It asked about a host of symptoms and conditions, from the specific, 
such as diabetes or high blood pressure, to the very vague: chronic fatigue, 
inability to concentrate, mucus and stress. From this laundry list, the 
"nutritionist" in charge will identify symptoms that supplements can correct. 
</P>
<P>
The inventory also includes a profile of typical food intake, medication use, 
exercise and, most specifically, an "elimination record." Then follows a 
patient "stool evaluation," an in-depth inquiry into color, odor and 
consistency. If you're beginning to squirm at this point, so were we. But hold 
on, it gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
On the final page of the history, the individual is asked to perform a test of 
colon transit time, taking a "moderate" serving of corn or beets and noting 
when the vegetable shows up in the feces. Too long a transit time may signal 
"suboptimal colon health," while a very rapid transit time "may indicate poor 
absorption and assimilation of nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
Next comes a disclaimer, which must be signed by the subscriber and witnessed. 
It can be described only as a mixture of gobbledygook and legal cover. And as 
you might expect, the last three pages are order blanks. One is for books, 
tapes and videos (costing as much as <MONEY>$49</MONEY> for "Miracle Man"). Two are for 
"metabolic" products, to "temporarily spark normal functions." Curiously, of 
some 68 products on the list, just three can be clearly identified as 
nutrients, and none is likely to be in short supply in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
We can sum up this program in one word: outrageous. Without going into a 
point-by-point review, two highlights should serve to illustrate. First, many 
of the analyses offered are reliable only if done rigorously in laboratories 
with the highest standards. When these tests are done correctly and 
abnormalities are found, they are considered along with other evidence from a 
physical examination by a physician, who then decides whether and what 
treatment is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor may feel that nutritional counseling is an important part of the 
treatment. If so, he or she will refer the individual to a registered dietitian 
or nutritionist properly trained in diet counseling. Based on a personal 
interview, this professional will in turn suggest appropriate diet 
modification, perhaps along with a multivitamin and mineral supplement at, but 
not above, <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the Recommended Dietary Allowances, as a bit of insurance. 
The regimen is unlikely to include such odd-sounding supplements as 
"Energetic," "Tryptogenics," "Yin-plus" or "Germanium LC," the latter costing 
as much as <MONEY>$50</MONEY> for 30 capsules. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the section focusing on lower-bowel function is particularly 
bothersome. The appearance and odor of feces is influenced by many factors, 
including diet. Normal variations generally are no cause for alarm. On the 
other hand, blood in the stools, which can occur for several reasons, is a 
symptom that demands immediate attention, not mail-order advice. That also goes 
for other symptoms on the list. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that most Americans could do well to eat a diet higher in fiber, and 
that doing so shortens the length of time it takes for food to travel through 
the digestive tract and for waste products to be excreted. But the so-called 
"colon transit time test," looking for evidence of beets or corn in feces, is 
absurd, unpleasant and diagnostically worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there's nothing wrong with ordering multivitamin and mineral 
supplements at <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>RDA</ORGANIZATION> from a catalogue, especially if they are well 
priced. But beyond that, when it comes to mail-order nutrition advice, the best 
place for the brochure is in the paper-recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I remember reading that garlic oil had caused botulism food 
poisoning. I saw garlic oil recently in the grocery store where I shop. Is it 
safe to eat? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, it's safe. Following two outbreaks of botulism food poisoning 
traced to garlic packed in oil, the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> stepped in. 
The agency now requires that garlic-in-oil mixtures that aren't heat-processed 
and rely for safety on refrigeration must contain other protection: specified 
levels of either substances that inhibit microbial growth or acidifying agents 
such as citric or phosphoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, it's easy to see why the food-poisoning cases occurred. To make 
the mixture, minced garlic is combined with ice water and oil. Unfortunately, 
the combination of a non-acid mixture (water), lack of oxygen in the jar and a 
warm temperature created just the right environment for botulinum spores, 
commonly found on many tubers and root vegetables, to germinate. The 
microorganisms then grew, producing the very dangerous toxin. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the problem was traced to improper handling. In other words, 
consumers forgot to keep the product in the refrigerator, despite clear 
directions on the label. Leaving the mixture out on the counter instead of in 
the cold proved a critical error. Thanks to the new <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> regulation, the problem 
is resolved. But this episode underscores the need for consumers to follow 
directions on the label. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought a prickly pear for the first time and really enjoyed it. Can you 
tell me its nutritional value?

A: Prickly pear is the fruit of the cactus of the same name. A typical fruit 
contains about 50 calories and more than one-third of the day's quota for 
Vitamin C. It also provides small amounts of B vitamins and minerals. Whether 
or not you eat the seeds is a matter of taste. Some like them; others find them 
too hard. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, preparing prickly pears was like tangling with a porcupine: The 
pears often came with spines still attached. One technique used was to singe 
them before attempting to peel the fruit. Nowadays, though, the spines 
generally are removed before the fruit appears in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Prickly pears are native to the Americas and were brought back to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in the 
16th Century. They are known by several names, including Indian or Barbary 
pears and tuna figs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband is a heart-attack survivor. He has given up smoking, is 
attempting to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet and is taking medication to 
bring down his cholesterol. Despite a doctor's advice to the contrary, he is 
skeptical about whether this is of any value or whether, as he says, it's "too 
late" for him. What do you say? 
</P>
<P>
A: We can assure your husband that his efforts are worthwhile. It's true that 
the extent of damage to the heart and the severity of coronary-artery disease 
are more important predictors of risk of a second heart attack, especially in 
the first few months, than is serum cholesterol. But evidence from a number of 
studies of individuals who have already sustained one heart attack shows that, 
over the longer term, reducing serum cholesterol is linked to lowered incidence 
of both nonfatal and fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Heart</ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION>Blood Institute</ORGANIZATION> and his 
colleagues reported in the <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> Journal of Medicine that when data from 
eight such studies were considered together, a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> reduction in 
serum-cholesterol levels led to a reduction of <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT>, respectively, in 
the number of nonfatal and fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
These figures aren't much different from those in studies that focus on 
individuals who are at risk of heart attacks but haven't yet sustained one. In 
that group, the same cholesterol reduction led to a drop of <PERCENT>25%</PERCENT> in nonfatal and 
<PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> in fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Rossouw</PERSON> points out, these studies have been conducted over relatively short 
periods. Longer trials and more effective lowering of cholesterol could produce 
even more positive results. So tell your husband to keep up the good work: He's 
on the right track with his cholesterol-lowering efforts, and he needn't be 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
We would only hope that his healthier lifestyle also includes regular physical 
exercise.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Nourishment for an infant industry: Medics increasingly see
value in nutritional supplements - unlike many big drugs companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nutritional supplements are fast becoming a fad in orthodox medical circles.
Doctors who 10 years ago would have been scornful of healthy adults taking
vitamin pills, evening primrose or fish oil are today recommending them
enthusiastically to protect against cancer, heart disease and other common
ailments.
A steady stream of clinical trials is showing that food supplements can
bring health benefits to a wide range of people - and not just to patients
suffering from rare nutritional deficits. During the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, evidence
accumulated that regular consumption of fish oil reduced heart attacks and
that evening primrose oil could treat a variety of disorders from
pre-menstrual pain to eczema.
The spotlight in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> has fallen above all on the so-called
'anti-oxidant' supplements such as vitamins C and E, which suppress natural
chemical reactions that damage cells in the body.
'Over the past three years there has been a tremendous shift in knowledge
and opinion about anti-oxidants,' says Professor <PERSON>Anthony Diplock</PERSON>, head of
biochemistry at <ORGANIZATION>Guy's Hospital</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 'There's now a quite massive body of
evidence, largely epidemiological, that these nutrients can reduce the
incidence of cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer and also
cataracts.'
Hundreds of studies over the past decade have shown a strong link between
diet and disease - for example, that eating plenty of fruit and vegetables
helps to prevent cancer and that consumption of fish reduces heart disease.
What is new is the convincing evidence that nutritional supplements, in the
form of pills and capsules, can reinforce the beneficial effect of a healthy
diet.
This <DATE>summer</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard School of Public Health</ORGANIZATION> published an epidemiological
study of 120,000 nurses and doctors which showed that taking additional
vitamin E for at least two years cut the risk of heart disease by about 40
per cent. And last month a US-Chinese study of 30,000 people in rural <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
found a 13 per cent reduction in cancer deaths among those who took
anti-oxidant supplements over five years.
Such evidence is likely to fuel the growth of the nutritional supplement
market, which is already worth about Dollars 5bn worldwide and expanding by
10 per cent a year. (Good international estimates are hard to come by -
partly because the boundaries between nutritional supplements and foods on
the one hand and medicines on the other vary around the world.)
Statistics for the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, based on figures from manufacturers and market
research companies, show sales of health supplements up 12.5 per cent last
year to Pounds 215m. Evening primrose oil grew fastest - up 80 per cent to
Pounds 32m.
The proportion of the adult population taking supplements has risen from 19
per cent in <DATE>1986</DATE> to 32 per cent now, says <PERSON>Mr Alan Clements</PERSON>, marketing
director of Seven Seas, the leading UK brand.
Yet the orthodox pharmaceutical industry continues to keep its distance from
nutritional supplements and shows little interest in turning them into
prescription drugs. Indeed the whole thrust of pharmaceutical research today
is in the opposite direction. Most synthetic drugs are designed to block one
specific biochemical process in the body, whereas supplements achieve a
wide-ranging effect by making up for a natural chemical deficit.
One reason why drug companies prefer synthetic chemicals to natural products
is that their patent protection is far more secure. Another is that
licensing regulations are more clear-cut for straightforward medicines than
they are on the borderline between drugs and food supplements - where there
are still radical differences between national policies even within the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>.
Roche of <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> is the exception among the pharmaceutical giants. It
manufactures vitamins in bulk for other companies and also sells them itself
as food supplements and medicines. In <DATE>1992</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Roche</ORGANIZATION>'s vitamin sales rose by 13
per cent to Dollars 1.6bn. Roche has an active research programme developing
drugs from vitamins, including powerful new treatments for acne and other
skin disease based on chemical derivatives of vitamin A.
Apart from <LOCATION>Roche</LOCATION>, the world supplements industry consists mainly of
relatively small companies concentrating on national or regional markets.
Very few have the financial resources or the management expertise to develop
new drugs from their products, although these would give them a substantial
new revenue stream from essentially the same ingredients; even with the
current pressure on pharmaceutical prices, drugs have larger profit margins
than food supplements.
A striking exception here is <LOCATION>Scotia</LOCATION>, an emerging pharmaceuticals company
that is being floated on the <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stock market later this month with an
expected capitalisation of Pounds 160m. Dr <PERSON>David Horrobin</PERSON> founded the
company in <DATE>1979</DATE> with the strategy of selling evening primrose oil as a
nutritional supplement - promoted by clinical studies showing its
wide-ranging health benefits - and ploughing the profits into drug
development.
Scotia now has two prescription drugs based on 'essential fatty acids'
extracted from seeds of the evening primrose; they are licensed for treating
breast pain and the skin disorder, eczema. Others in ad-vanced clinical
trials include drugs for cancer, complications of diabetes, arthritis and
blocked arteries.
Dr <PERSON>Horrobin</PERSON> concedes that some doctors are occasionally suspicious of <LOCATION>Scotia</LOCATION>
because apparently different medical problems can be treated with very
similar drugs. But he points out two things. 'First, each fatty acid has
highly specific actions, and small differences in structure can lead to
dramatically different effects,' he says. 'Second, the n-6 family of fatty
acids, which are found in evening primrose and other oils, are essential for
the structure and function of every cell membrane in the body. Thus
shortages or imbalances of those fatty acids can disturb the function of
every tissue, leading to a diverse range of symptoms.'
The other group of essential fatty acids, the n-3 family, is particularly
important in the brain, the heart and blood circulation and the regulation
of inflammation. Fish oil is the main source of n-3 fatty acids.
The only medicine in the UK based on fish oil is <LOCATION>Maxepa</LOCATION>, for which Seven
Seas, a <ORGANIZATION>Hanson</ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, received a licence in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Doctors can prescribe
it for lowering the level of harmful fats in the blood.
Sales of Maxepa are relatively modest - about Pounds 2m a year in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>,
compared with Pounds 20m a year for the company's fish oil supplements. But
Seven Seas, unlike <LOCATION>Scotia</LOCATION>, does not want to change from being primarily a
supplements manufacturer to a drug company, says <PERSON>Mr Clements</PERSON>. '<LOCATION>Scotia</LOCATION> is an
R&amp;D-based company, while we're really a marketing company that is more
suited to the consumer marketplace.'
Compared with synthetic chemicals, medicines based on nutritional
supplements tend to be slow and gentle in their effects. That can make it
hard to satisfy regulatory authorities of their effectiveness in small-scale
clinical trials.
Scotia, for example, put in a licensing application for Efabetic, its
proposed treatment for nerve damage caused by diabetes, on the basis of a
trial with 111 patients. It led to a statistically significant improvement,
but the <ORGANIZATION>UK Medicines Control Agency</ORGANIZATION> told the company that 'convincing
efficacy had still not been demonstrated on a sufficiently large number of
patients'. Scotia is now sponsoring further clinical trials and hopes to
submit a new application late next year with data from 400 patients.
The barrier is just as high in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>. One company trying to overcome it is
La Haye Laboratories of <LOCATION>Redmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> - founded in <DATE>1986</DATE> with a
somewhat similar strategy to <LOCATION>Scotia</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>. It sells Icaps Plus, a
mixture of anti-oxidant vitamins and minerals, as a nutritional supplement,
and has a similar but more powerful blend in the final phase of clinical
trials for treating two eye diseases.
'I believe it will be the first nutritional product approved (as a drug) by
the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>,' says <PERSON>Mr Larry Laks</PERSON>, the company's
executive vice-president. La <PERSON>Haye</PERSON> is taking no chances; its clinical trials
involve 2,400 patients.
In addition to the epidemiological evidence, scientists are beginning to
understand how anti-oxidants work 'at the basic molecular level', Prof
Diplock says. In very simple terms, they destroy 'free radicals' - reactive
molecules which can damage cells and trigger diseases.
And, even if they do you no good, most supplements are unlikely to cause any
harm. Prof Diplock, who has just completed a scientific review of all the
safety evidence on vitamin E, found that it had no adverse effects even at
doses of 3 grammes a day - 300 times the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> recommended daily allowance.
As the chorus of medical voices singing the praises of vitamins and
nutritional supplements grows, the industry seems certain to expand rapidly.
At the same time, it may attract more attention from other large
pharmaceutical companies looking for a source of safe new drugs.

<HEAD>Food Supplements: Nutritional Need Or Marketing Moves?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food supplements, which began as public health
measures, have escalated into an array of additives that some
experts say do more to satisfy marketing than nutritional needs.
   Especially in the battle for the breakfast table _ Americans
spend <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> a year on cereal _ vitamins and minerals have
joined the cereal maker's arsenal of eyecatching shapes, crisp
sounds and sugar coating.
   Sometimes there is a risk of giving customers too much of a good
thing, illustrated by <ORGANIZATION>Kellogg Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s recall in <DATE>August</DATE> of 29,000
boxes of Frosted Mini-Wheats Biscuits cereal with too much Vitamin
A. The excess was harmless, but could cause a burning sensation in
the mouth and an ``off taste.''
   The benefit or harm of additives is difficult to determine just
because they are so prevalent, said <PERSON>Dr. Mark Hegsted</PERSON>, a nutrition
professor at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University School of Public Health</ORGANIZATION>. Studies
require control groups, and, ``We don't have populations that eat
the same things and don't have them.''
   Food producers like <PERSON>Kellogg</PERSON> say consumers look for the
supplemented foods because of lifestyle changes. Company
spokeswoman <PERSON>Marie T. Kitlas</PERSON> referred to a brochure saying cereals
are fortified to make up for skimpy, on-the-run breakfasts, and to
maintain adequate nutrition on low-calorie diets.
   Some dispute the industry claims. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attorney general
obtained an <DATE>Aug. 4</DATE> agreement from Kellogg to stop advertising in
that state that B vitamins in Rice Krispies give consumers more
energy. Studies indicate the American diet has enough B vitamins,
and most fatigue sufferers do not have vitamin deficiencies, the
state said.
   On the other hand, no harm has been proven from additives, which
are sprayed on or dissolved into batters.
   ``In today's world, most vitamins are chemically synthesized.
But they are identical to the compounds found in nature,'' said
<PERSON>Allan L. Forbes</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's Nutrition and Food Science Division</ORGANIZATION>. ``There is no
difference whatsoever.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> is preparing to impose health-claim regulations, but
those deal with prevention of degenerative ailments such as cancer
or heart disease, said <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON>. Vitamin and mineral claims usually
relate to deficiency diseases.
   Vitamin or mineral deficiencies can be found in parts of the
population, like women and teen-age girls who diet excessively, and
among poor people, but, ``If you look at the whole <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> population
it's hard to find a deficiency,'' said <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>
nutrition professor <PERSON>Sanford Miller</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> official and an
industry consultant.
   ``There is no sense adding vitamins for which there is no
deficiency,'' said <PERSON>Michael Jacobson</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Science</ORGANIZATION> in
the <ORGANIZATION>Public Interest</ORGANIZATION>, which raised the <ORGANIZATION>Rice Krispies</ORGANIZATION> issue and has
instituted other similar cases.
   Supplements first were added at public health officials' urging,
as an inexpensive and effective way to deal with specific problems,
<PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> said. The federal Food and <ORGANIZATION>Nutrition Board</ORGANIZATION> endorsed
supplementing wheat flour in the early <DATE>1940s</DATE> to replace thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin and iron lost in milling.
   Depression-era vagrants suffered pellagra due to niacin
deficiencies and beri beri due to thiamin deficiencies. The
supplements worked. ``You don't see pellagra in this country today.
You don't see beri beri,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said.
   Adding iodine to salt virtually eradicated goiter after it was
found that iodine in fish prevented goiter among coastal residents.
Vitamin D was added to milk to prevent rickets in children who
didn't get enough from sunshine.
   ``What is happening today is a different thing,'' <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said.
   ``Companies are adding vitamins to more and more things,''
<PERSON>Jacobson</PERSON> said. ``They are playing on people's fears and concerns.
There is no deficiency of those vitamins whatsoever in the American
public.
   ``The sole purpose is so they can say, `Now fortified with 14
vitamins.'''
   <PERSON>Bruce Silverglade</PERSON>, the center's director of legal affairs, said
food buyers need to be educated. ``The response of the average
consumer should be, `So what, that is irrelevant to my diet.'''

YOU ASKED ABOUT: DISTINCTIVE ROSIN-COVERED POTATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I came across a recipe in "Joy of Cooking" (Bobbs-Merrill: <DATE>1986</DATE>) 
called Potatoes Cooked in <LOCATION>Resin</LOCATION>. Can you tell me what kind of resin they are 
referring to and where I can purchase it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Others must have had the same question because in the newest edition of 
this cookbook authors <PERSON>Irma S. Rombauer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marion Rombauer Becker</PERSON> change the 
spelling to rosin and include the following information: 
</P>
<P>
". . . no other method turns out a potato so distinctively flaky. Allow a 
minimum of three hours for this recipe; because of the fumes, never try it 
indoors. Rosin can be purchased at athletic and dance supply stores." 
</P>
<P>
However, in researching the safety of this recipe, we discovered that neither 
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> 
were aware of the exact identity of the rosin used or its function in this 
recipe. Perhaps readers familiar with this cooking technique will share their 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't have a copy of the cookbook, we provide the recipe: 
</P>
<P>
Place 15 to 25 pounds rock rosin in a three-gallon iron kettle or galvanized 
bucket. The rosin may be used repeatedly. Heat it to 275 degrees over a grill 
or hot plate. Carefully lower into it on a large slotted wooden-handled spoon, 
one at a time, six large baking potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
After about 45 minutes in the simmering rosin they will float to the surface. 
Simmer them 30 minutes longer. Remove one potato and wrap in heavy brown paper, 
twisting the ends tightly. Let cool 10 minutes and serve. If the texture is not 
exceptional, cook the remaining potatoes 10 minutes more before testing. 
</P>
<P>
Serve with butter, salt and freshly ground pepper. Avoid eating the 
rosin-covered skins. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you please give the vital statistics -- calories, vitamins, minerals, 
etc. -- for jicama, kiwi, chayote and sunchokes? I can't find them in any table 
of food composition. 
</P>
<P>
A: We were able to find the following information for kiwi and sunchokes in 
"Nutritive Value of Foods," <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture Home &amp; Garden 
Bulletin Number</ORGANIZATION> 72: 
</P>
<P>
Kiwi -- 1 (about 5 per pound with skin), raw, without skin contains 45 
calories, 1 gram protein, a trace of fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 11 grams 
carbohydrate, 20 milligrams calcium, 30 milligrams phosphorus, 0.3 milligrams 
iron, 252 milligrams potassium, 4 milligrams sodium, 130 international units 
Vitamin A, 0.02 milligrams thiamine, 0.04 milligrams riboflavin, 0.4 milligrams 
niacin and 74 milligrams ascorbic acid. 
</P>
<P>
Sunchoke (Jerusalem-artichoke) -- 1 cup raw, sliced contains 115 calories, 3 
grams protein, a trace of fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 26 grams carbohydrate, 
21 milligrams calcium, 117 milligrams phosphorus, 5.1 milligrams iron, 644 
milligrams potassium, 6 milligrams sodium, 30 international units Vitamin A, 
0.30 milligrams thiamine, 0.09 milligrams riboflavin, 2.0 milligrams niacin and 
6 milligrams ascorbic acid. 
</P>
<P>
Although we could not find a complete breakdown for chayote and jicama, in 
"Fresh Produce A to Z" (Lane Publishing: <DATE>1987</DATE>) the editors of Sunset books and 
magazine say "Chayote provides some Vitamin A and potassium. A 3 1/2-ounce 
portion of raw chayote has 28 calories" and "Jicama is high in potassium and a 
fair source of Vitamin C. One cup of shredded raw jicama contains about 50 
calories." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Elizabeth Schneider</PERSON>, author of "Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables -- A Commonsense 
Guide" (<ORGANIZATION>Harper &amp; Row</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>1986</DATE>) adds that both chayote and jicama are low in 
sodium.

   WASHINGTON -- It's a maddening experience. Joanne Lesher,
a busy attorney, is racing against the 10 o'clock closing
time at her neighborhood Safeway supermarket, trying to
separate the label information about ingredients from the
marketing come-ons.
   "It's mass confusion," the 33-year-old shopper complains.
"Everything is `light' and `low-fat' and `no-cholesterol.'
The terms don't mean what you think they mean. I don't trust
them."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nor, in fact, does the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government. After months of
small steps, the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration this morning will
announce a wide-ranging truth-in-labeling initiative, taking
a huge leap toward overhauling the way food is labeled and
promoted in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Neither grocery shopping nor food
marketing will ever be the same.
   The initiative, involving a score of regulatory proposals
carrying out the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
<DATE>1990</DATE>, will trigger the largest product relabeling ever and
will force marketing makeovers for entire lines of food
products. Throughout the <MONEY>$280 billion</MONEY> industry, all but the
smallest Mom-and-Pop processors will be required to put
uniform nutrition labels on their products, and to follow
strict rules for making health claims and touting nutritional
attributes. The objective: Curb hype in the supermarket and
help consumers make informed purchases.
   Currently, only about half of packaged foods on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
market bear nutritional labeling. Under the <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture
Department and Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> proposals,
thousands more edibles from ketchup to capers will have to
list calories per serving; amounts of carbohydrates, fat,
fiber, protein, sugar and salt per serving; and data on
vitamins and minerals.
   "Suddenly, you're going to find virtually every food there
is carrying some type of nutritional information," says
<PERSON>Sherwin Gardner</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Grocery Manufacturers of America</ORGANIZATION> trade
group. "That's an enormous change."
   The initiative seeks to curb one of the most common
marketing devices: manipulation of the "serving size."
Manufacturers will no longer be free to simply shrink a
serving size to the point that they can call a product
"low-sodium" or "low-calorie." Instead, food products would
be divided into 176 categories, each with a set serving size.
Some denounce this as unwarranted meddling in product
marketing, but for consumers, the uniform standards will
permit meaningful comparison shopping.
   The proposed rules codify the policies behind <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>
Commissioner <PERSON>David Kessler</PERSON>'s crackdown on promotional
half-truths. Manufacturers will be barred from touting a
product as containing no cholesterol, for example, if it is
inherently cholesterol-free -- since it's of vegetable, not
animal, origin -- yet is loaded with fat. "What manufacturers
must understand," says <PERSON>Dr. Kessler</PERSON>, "is the claims they make
to sell products -- the words they choose to increase market
share -- are the very same words American consumers use in
making decisions that affect their health."
   Many of the proposed labeling changes will be challenged
by segments of the industry during a one-year comment period.
Teams of corporate lawyers, marketing executives and
nutritionists are being assembled to pore over the mammoth
regulatory package, which is expected to run 700 pages in the
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Register</ORGANIZATION>. Companies are abuzz with speculation about
the potential impact on their product lines and market niches
-- and on their corporate rivals.
   Will <ORGANIZATION>Stouffer Foods Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s recently reformulated Lean
Cuisine frozen entrees be lean enough to pass muster? What
stance will regulators take on health claims implicit in
trademarks and brand names, such as <ORGANIZATION>ConAgra Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Healthy
Choice</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Healthy Request</ORGANIZATION>?
Representatives of the three companies say it's too early to
comment.
   The proposed rules will put a premium on development of
more nutritious foods and give food scientists greater say.
Many in the industry anticipate a wave of product
reformulations well in advance of <DATE>May 1993</DATE>, the rules'
effective date. Countless companies will need to revamp
marketing and ad strategies as they adjust and reposition
products.
   "The government is going to demystify things," says <PERSON>Tom
Pirko</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> food and beverage consultant. For
marketers, the challenge will be immense. "It's very hard to
describe a product fairly and accurately and still make it
saleable," he asserts.
   The initiative is extraordinary in other respects. For the
first time, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>,
overseer of meat and poultry, are working in concert on
labeling. To a great extent, the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> proposals will mirror
the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s. The result could be a more level playing field on
which meat and poultry processors won't have an edge over
FDA-regulated manufacturers. And consumers, if they wish,
could make valid nutritional comparisons between
USDA-inspected pepperoni pizza and FDA-regulated cheese
pizza, or between turkey and tuna.
   The revolution in labeling is chiefly the work of
Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Edward Madigan</PERSON>, a former Republican
congressman from <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Louis Sullivan</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. Madigan</PERSON> co-sponsored and helped
shepherd through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> the nutrition labeling law that <PERSON>Dr.
Sullivan</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> staff is now carrying out. Once at the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>,
he jawboned meat and poultry processors into accepting
mandatory nutrition labeling.
   The FDA-USDA initiative has strong <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> support,
notwithstanding the misgivings of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management
and Budget</ORGANIZATION> and Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>'s Council on
Competitiveness about its economic impact, notably on small
business.
   Many in industry also aren't happy with parts of the
initiative. The <ORGANIZATION>Sugar Association</ORGANIZATION> lobbied in vain to keep its
product from being listed on the nutrition label, arguing
that it is consumed in moderation and doesn't cause any
health problems besides tooth decay. And several trade groups
object to the serving-size rules, which are based on portions
customarily consumed by an average person over age four. The
servings must be calculated in common household measures,
such as cups, tablespoons and ounces, as well as metric
measures, such as milligrams and grams.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Grocery Manufacturers</ORGANIZATION> trade group contends that the
government should set criteria for serving sizes, not the
serving sizes themselves. "Serving-size rules have to be
consumer-friendly," says <PERSON>Manly Molpus</PERSON>, president of the
group. "If they don't relate to the way people eat food, they
are going to be meaningless."
   The regulators decided any package containing less than
two servings will be considered a single-serving container, a
move likely to hit the beverage industry particularly hard.
The proposed serving size for soft drinks -- eight ounces --
would keep <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola Co.</ORGANIZATION> from breaking its 12-ounce can of
Diet <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> into two servings, putting the beverage above the
threshold of "very low" sodium.
   Dairy processors are angry about the proposed
one-tablespoon serving size for butter. For years, the
industry standard has been one teaspoon, or about one butter
pat. Regulators say that doesn't reflect how much consumers
typically eat. "It fouls us up from a marketing standpoint,"
says <PERSON>Jerome Kozak</PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>International Dairy
Foods Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Council on Competitiveness staff has raised such
concerns with <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> officials, and won pledges that
the agencies will try to avoid unduly cramping marketing
efforts. To this end, the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> is planning a special
accommodation for the meat and poultry industry whose
products won't meet the proposed definition of low fat. The
department's <ORGANIZATION>Food Safety and Inspection Service</ORGANIZATION> will propose
letting processors describe meat and poultry products and
fresh cuts of meat and poultry as "lean" if they contain no
more than <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> fat. Processed and fresh meat and poultry
containing no more than <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> fat could be sold as "extra lean."
   Consumer advocates, while praising most of the labeling
initiative, say the regulators appear poised to bestow too
great a break on the meat and poultry industry. The proposed
serving size for meat, poultry and fish will be notably small
-- three ounces, far less than the typical amount a consumer
eats at a sitting, according to diet surveys. "I don't
remember ever going to a restaurant and seeing a three-ounce
steak on the menu," says <PERSON>Bruce Silverglade</PERSON>, attorney for the
<ORGANIZATION>Center for Science</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Public Interest</ORGANIZATION>.
   He and others are also troubled by the plan to treat meat
or poultry TV dinners and other frozen entrees as a single
serving, and to let them be labeled lean or extra lean. "The
only thing lean in some entrees is the meat," <PERSON>Mr. Silverglade</PERSON>
says.
   Under current nutrition labeling law, food companies can't
use such terms as "lite" or "low-calorie" unless the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>
defines them. Along with the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION>, the agency will propose
today a dictionary of more than 20 so-called "descriptors"
for food producers, retailers and consumers to consult. At
the <ORGANIZATION>Council on Competitiveness</ORGANIZATION>'s urging, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> agreed to
consider adding other terms, such as "very high," as well as
to allow use of certain synonyms that might enhance foods'
appeal.
   The dictionary, if adopted as expected, promises to have
widespread repercussions in the marketplace. In <LOCATION>Petaluma</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, for example, British cereal maker <ORGANIZATION>Weetabix's
Barbara's Bakery Inc.</ORGANIZATION> unit would have to drop a freshness
claim because its granola is thermally processed and, by
definition, not "fresh." And <ORGANIZATION>Louis Rich Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Madison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION>,
would have to stop calling its turkey franks "<PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> fat-free"
because the product won't meet the proposed definition for
"low fat."
   Regulators intend to impose even more stringent
restrictions on the use of health messages that link certain
food nutrients to health conditions or diseases. Such
messages came into vogue in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> as cereal
companies and makers of dietary supplements led the rush to
cash in on diet fads and health concerns. Frequently, the
acclaimed benefits haven't been supported by scientific
evidence.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>, as directed by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, has reviewed 10 health
messages in particular, and decided there is significant
scientific agreement on the validity of only four. The agency
will propose letting companies continue to promote certain
high-calcium foods as helping to prevent osteoporosis in the
elderly, and certain low-sodium foods as helping to curb
hypertension. Companies also could continue making health
claims linking fat to heart disease and cancer.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> intends to reject four messages -- about purported
benefits of folic acid, antioxidant vitamins, zinc and
omega-3 fatty acids -- while reserving judgment on dietary
fiber. Though the agency has challenged cereal makers and
others on fiber claims and questioned the safety of adding
fibrous psyllium to cereal, it will seek more data on fiber's
possible role in reducing the risk of heart disease and
cancer.
   If the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> concludes there isn't significant agreement on
the health benefits of fiber, <ORGANIZATION>Middle East Bakery Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Methuen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, among others, will have to stop claiming that
its oat-bran pita bread "can help reduce cholesterol." <PERSON>John
Boghos</PERSON>, vice president of the family-owned business, says he
understands that fiber helps reduce the likelihood of
developing heart disease.
   "When all of the requirements are finalized, nearly every
food company will have to change nearly every label, on
nearly every food product," says an executive at one major
food company.
   The stakes are particularly high for <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods</ORGANIZATION>,
a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Philip Morris Cos.</ORGANIZATION> and the nation's largest food
processor. Its "fat-free" products, from salad dressings to
processed cheese foods, ring up annual sales of about <MONEY>$450
million</MONEY>. Once the company has had a chance to review the new
rules, it may have to reformulate some products or change
their labels.
   Whatever the case, many marketers have already grown more
savvy about avoiding the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s wrath. <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Soup</ORGANIZATION>'s new
<ORGANIZATION>Healthy Request</ORGANIZATION> soups each contain as much as 500 milligrams
of sodium per serving -- far above the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed
definition of "low-sodium." But the company doesn't claim the
soups are low in sodium. Instead, it compares the <ORGANIZATION>Healthy
Request</ORGANIZATION> varieties to its regular line of soups, which have a
higher sodium content.
   The nation's nutrition labels haven't changed
substantially since <DATE>1973</DATE>, when the government began requiring
food processors to put them on products that bear a nutrition
claim or are fortified with protein, vitamins and minerals.
Currently, nutrition labeling covers only <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> of the meat and
poultry products and <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of the other packaged foods on the
market.
   Separate from this latest initiative, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last summer</DATE>
proposed regulations that will revamp how ingredients are
listed on packages and how fruit and vegetable juices are
labeled. Last <DATE>summer</DATE>, the agency also proposed a set of
guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling by supermarkets
of fish, seafood and fresh produce. If the supermarkets balk
at posting nutrition information, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has directed the
agency to turn the voluntary program into a mandatory one,
conceivably as early as the <DATE>spring of 1994</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> is still
reviewing industry and consumer comment on the proposals.
   <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Department</ORGANIZATION> officials say they will follow the
<ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s lead on ingredient listing and will launch a similar
voluntary labeling program for fresh meat and poultry. If <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT>
of the retailers aren't participating in the program, the
<ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> is threatening to make it mandatory.
   Before the revolution in labeling is over, the industry
will spend as much as <MONEY>$2.8 billion</MONEY> on new labels and other
expenses. The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> estimates that the roughly 17,000 companies
it regulates will have to change 257,000 labels -- a gross
underestimate, according to industry officials. A
small-business exemption will spare companies with less than
<MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in annual sales from the expense. The government
estimates that the benefits to the public over 20 years would
include <MONEY>$100 billion</MONEY> in reduced health-care costs.

   LIGHT: Term may be used on foods that have one-third fewer
calories than a comparable product. Any other use of "light"
must specify whether it refers to the look, taste or smell;
for example "light in color."

   REDUCED FAT: Has no more than half the fat of an
identified comparison. Example: "Reduced fat, <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> less fat
than our regular brownie. Fat content has been reduced from 8
grams to 4 grams." To avoid trivial claims, reduction must
exceed 3 grams of fat per serving.

<TEXT>
   Supermarket shoppers, unsure what
distinguishes ``lite'' bread from regular or ``high-fiber'' cereals
from others, may be getting some help from the federal government.
   Both <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> are
considering massive revisions in the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s nutrition labeling
requirements, which date from <DATE>1973</DATE>, when the vitamin and mineral
content of foods was consumers' prime concern.
   Now, much of the focus of healthy eating has shifted to foods'
cholesterol, fat and fiber content _ areas untouched by the current
regulations.
   Even the food industry, until now a foe of compulsory labeling,
appears to be going along _ for a price.
   Says <PERSON>Dr. Frank Young</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> commissioner:
   ``The public is demanding change in this area and deserves
nothing less than our maximum efforts to accomplish this change.''
   Young, testifying before a congressional committee recently,
referred to the two biggest driving forces behind the heightened
interest in nutrition _ the Surgeon General's Report on <ORGANIZATION>Nutrition
and Health</ORGANIZATION>, which cited dietary factors in five of the 10 leading
causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, and
the report by the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>, ``Diet and Health:
Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> commissioner said both reports, issued last year,
``concluded that Americans could substantially reduce their risk of
heart disease, cancer and many other chronic diseases through
specific changes in eating habits.''
   A survey of shoppers taken this year for a food industry
organization found that <PERCENT>94 percent</PERCENT> of the poll's participants are
concerned about the nutritional content of what they eat.
Thirty-eight percent said they were most concerned about
cholestrol, a 16-point jump in just one year.
   But the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> and members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> disagree on how to give the
public what it wants.
   Since <DATE>1973</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> imposed nutrition labeling requirements
for the first time, products to which nutrients have been added or
for which a nutrition claim is made:
   _Must be labeled with quantitative listings of calories,
carbohydrates and protein.
   _Must show, by ``average'' or ``usual'' serving, the percentages
of the federal government's recommended daily allowance of protein,
vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium and
iron contained in a product.
   _Must list calories, protein content, carbohydrates, fat and
sodium.
   But those regulations were drawn up when vitamin and mineral
content was the most prevalent consumer concern.
   Now, what many shoppers want most is such information as a
product's fat and fiber content, its ``liteness'' _ or lack thereof
_ and how ``naturally'' it was made.
   Some in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> contend the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has not moved quickly enough to
address those concerns.
   Rep. <PERSON>Henry Waxman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Calif.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Sen. Howard Metzenbaum</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>,
have introduced the ``Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
<DATE>1989</DATE>.'' If passed by both houses, the bill's sponsors say revised
labels could begin appearing within 18 months of being signed by
the president.
   Twenty-three groups, including the <ORGANIZATION>American Heart Association</ORGANIZATION>
and <ORGANIZATION>American Cancer Society</ORGANIZATION>, have endorsed the bill.
   The legislation would require that labels list the serving size
and number of servings per container; total calories, and calories
broken down by total and saturated fat. Also required would be
amounts, broken down by serving, of total, saturated and
unsaturated fat; cholesterol; sodium; complex carbohydrates;
protein; dietary fiber, and other nutrients.
   The bill would also require that any health claims on labels
that characterize the amount or relationship of calories, fat,
cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, sugar, protein or dietary fiber
to a disease or condition use terms defined by the secretary of
health and human services and that the definitions be supported by
a scientific consensus.
   Another bill, introduced by <PERSON>Sen. Orrin Hatch</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Utah</LOCATION>, is similar
to the Waxman-Metzenbaum bill except that it would preclude state
labeling regulations.
   Perceptions of the two proposals vary predictably.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> says congressional action isn't necessary, that it can
meet shoppers' needs without legislation. The grocery industry
supports the <PERSON>Hatch</PERSON> bill. Activist consumer groups say any
legislation that is adopted will need to address a variety of
nutrition issues not now covered.
   For its part, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> plans to hold five hearings around the
country to ask people how they would like to see the current
regulations changed.
   For instance, the agency wants to know how much interest there
is in writing definitions for commonly used terms, such as ``low
salt'' or ``reduced fat;'' whether there should be requirements
manufacturers must meet in claiming their products help prevent
disease; if minimum standards are needed to identify certain foods,
and whether the public is willing to pay the added costs that would
likely accompany new labeling requirements.
   From the comments at those hearings, which haven't been set, the
<ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> says it will revise its regulations and that the process should
be finished early in <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   The agency's intent is to convince <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> it need not set the
<ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>'s standards, or at least to have revised regulations ready if
Capitol Hill orders the agency to change its act.
   Young told <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>:
   ``It is unclear whether legislation is necessary to achieve most
or all of our shared goals. I believe many, if not all, of the
changes contemplated can be made administratively.''
   The food industry's primary hope appears to be getting federal
legislation that eliminates state regulation.
   Says <PERSON>Jeff Nedelman</PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Grocery
Manufacturers of America</ORGANIZATION>:
   ``We would support a comprehensive reform of the dietary and
health informaton that is provided to consumers if we can come out
of this process with national standards.''
   Seeking to avoid potentially 50 different state standards, the
<ORGANIZATION>National Food Processors Association</ORGANIZATION> says regulations ``appropriate
for <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, are equally applicable to <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>''
   But some consumer groups say states should still have the
prerogative to toughen federal standards and note that <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, for instance, have often taken the lead in nutrition
issues.
   Whatever the new regulations are, these activists say they need
to reflect a range of specific consumer interests not now addressed
in the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> requirements.
   One group in the forefront of the movement to toughen labeling
requirements, the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Science</ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest, says
the regulations should:
   _Eliminate or supplement the description of quantities as
measured in ``grams,'' a metric term, unless accompanied by defined
terms such as high, low or medium.
   _Eliminate thiamin, riboflavin and niacin from labels, since
deficiencies in those elements are no longer a significant health
threat.
   _List amounts of fat, cholesterol, ``cholesterol-raising'' or
saturated fats, sodium, starch, dietary fiber and sugar.
   _Consider a diagram giving percentages of protein, sugar,
complex carbohydrates, total fat and saturated fat.
   _List the percentage of a product's major ingredients, such as
sugar and flour.

   No harm in that after-work drink with friends, as long as you
remain a social drinker and don't wander over the line to alcoholism.
   You could be wrong, say <PERSON>Joseph Barbato</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allan Luks</PERSON>, both
social drinkers and co-authors of ``You Are What You Drink''
(<ORGANIZATION>Villard Books</ORGANIZATION>).
   Even if you're not headed off the deep end, alcohol can have its
effect on your looks, how you feel and how you function, say
<PERSON>Barbato</PERSON>, former public information director for the <ORGANIZATION>Alcoholism
Council of Greater New York</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Luks</PERSON>, executive director for the
<ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Health</ORGANIZATION>.
   For example, alcohol can make your skin look red and blotchy when
it reaches the vessels just under the skin's surface. It can push
your weight up because it is a genuine appetizer, making you hungry
and at the same time confusing your sense of satiety. Alcohol also
can keep your body from absorbing nutients and vitamins,
particularly folic acid, making you tired. It can disrupt your
rapid-eye-movement sleep, producing insomnia. It also upsets your
normal immune responses, making you more vulnerable to invading
microbes. The authors also cite studies which say alcohol can make
you aggressive rather than euphoric, playing hob with your emotional
and sexual relationships.
   If that's not enough, you also can get the old-fashioned
hangover. Nausea, headache and exhaustion can follow even modest
intakes of alcohol.
   You don't have to give it up, but the authors say that you need
to know your limit and be aware of the negatives of just one more.

FOOD BRIEFS: MORE DRUG ABUSERS SAYING YES TO CATTLE RUSTLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More cattle are being stolen in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1980s</DATE> than were rustled 
at the turn of the century, according to a meat industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1988</DATE>, for instance, 2,400 animals were purloined by cattle thieves from 240 
livestock firms, <PERSON>Lean Trimmings</PERSON>, a Western States Meat Assn. newsletter, 
reported. Losses from these cow capers are estimated at about <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
State officials believe that the drug problem is partially to blame for the 
increase in thefts. 
</P>
<P>
"(With) the rise in beef prices . . . a wayward cow starts to look pretty 
inviting to (the) drug-crazed," the newsletter stated. "The <MONEY>$200</MONEY> an addict can 
get on the street for a cow is more than enough to support most habits (for a 
day)." 
</P>
<P>
The escalating cattle rustling has caused the state's <ORGANIZATION>Department of Food and 
Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> to create a special <ORGANIZATION>Livestock Enforcement Unit</ORGANIZATION>. Oddly enough, 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was forced to establish a similar anti-crime squad in <DATE>1917</DATE> when 
problems with stolen steers last arose, Lean Trimmings reports. 
</P>
<P>
Absconding with a cow, however, is not as easy as pilfering a car stereo. 
Police familiar with the problem believe that some of the disappearances are 
the work of cowhands. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires a great deal of equipment and knowledge of the cattle industry to 
steal the animals. These 'inside outlaws' often alter the cow's brands and ear 
markings, transport them across state lines and sell them to unknowing buyers," 
according to the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
But as is the case with virtually all kinds of thefts within the state, 
officials predict that there will be more rustling than ever in <DATE>1989</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Picking a Pepper -- Few people look at bell peppers as a rich source of 
nutrients, but an <LOCATION>Indio</LOCATION>, Calif.-based company hopes to change that perception 
with a series of recent advertisements promoting its hybrid variety trademarked 
as Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge Royale</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet red peppers, developed by <ORGANIZATION>Sun World International</ORGANIZATION>, are said to be a 
superior source of Vitamin C, potassium and fiber. The vegetables, each of 
which is tagged with the company's distinctive sticker, are also comparatively 
high in other nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
The innovative agricultural firm, which introduced a seedless watermelon last 
year, claims that laboratory tests demonstrate Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge Royale</ORGANIZATION> contains far 
more Vitamin C than a navel orange. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Produce Marketing Assn.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del.</LOCATION>, was 
reviewed for authenticity by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge Royale</ORGANIZATION> are generally oversized, only about three-fourths 
the size of an average pepper, or five ounces, was used for the tests. 
</P>
<P>
The findings indicate that five ounces of the Sun World pepper offer <PERCENT>180%</PERCENT> of 
the recommended daily intake of Vitamin C. By comparison, a navel orange has 
<PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the recommended amount and a whole green bell pepper has <PERCENT>130%</PERCENT> of the 
target level. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity is similar for potassium. Researchers found that five ounces of 
Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge Royale</ORGANIZATION> contained 350 milligrams of the mineral, while a banana had 300 
milligrams and a green bell pepper contained 270 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis revealed that the deep red vegetable was also a good source of 
fiber. For instance, one bowl of bran flakes contains five grams of fiber 
whereas three-fourths of a Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge Royale</ORGANIZATION> has as much as four grams. 
</P>
<P>
Sun World developed its red pepper strain by combining other varieties such as 
the <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION>, Cubanella and Bulgarian. The mixture is responsible for the Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge 
Royale</ORGANIZATION>'s distinctive color, size and shape. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sun World is decidedly proud of the Le <ORGANIZATION>Rouge Royale</ORGANIZATION>'s nutritional 
composition, it has no plans to market a red pepper breakfast juice at this 
time. Even so, the firm recommends munching on its peppers as a "healthy 
snack." 
</P>
<P>
Meal or Pills? -- Nutritional-supplement manufacturers were not cheered when a 
federal advisory body urged Americans to obtain their recommended daily 
allotment of vitamins and minerals from food rather than tablets. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,300-page study from the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION>, released earlier this 
year, generated considerable news coverage for seemingly advocating a "no 
pills" dietary regimen. 
</P>
<P>
But the report's intent was somewhat misinterpreted, according to the <ORGANIZATION>Tufts 
University Diet &amp; Nutrition Letter</ORGANIZATION>. There were a number of instances where 
the council did, in fact, say that nutritional supplements were appropriate, 
the newsletter states. 
</P>
<P>
Among groups considered potentially deficient in certain vitamins or minerals 
are pregnant women, strict vegetarians, women who suffer from excessive 
menstrual bleeding, the elderly, and sick individuals whose appetites are 
depressed. Certain medications may also cause deficiencies, the <ORGANIZATION>Diet &amp; 
Nutrition Letter</ORGANIZATION> reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, none of this means that popping a vitamin or mineral pill should be 
viewed as a panacea for a poor diet or that taking excess amounts of one or 
another nutrient is a healthful practice," the newsletter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Those who regularly consume vitamin or mineral megadoses may actually be 
placing themselves at risk. Large amounts of Vitamin A, for instance, can lead 
to liver damage. On this topic, the <ORGANIZATION>Diet &amp; Nutrition Letter</ORGANIZATION> endorsed the 
<ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION>'s advisory that consumers avoid taking supplements in excess of the daily 
recommended amount. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes taking one a day, under the guidance of a physician or dietitian, is 
a called-for step to take," the newsletter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Tomato's Changing Times -- Just as the red pepper is apparently undergoing an 
evolution, so is the tomato. In fact, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> is 
advising consumers to alter home canning methods to accommodate the modern 
tomato's characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular importance is that the fruit today is "fleshier," or contains 
more pulp than in the past. As a result, tomatoes require additional acidity 
and processing time in order to ensure a safe product. 
</P>
<P>
The revised canning guidelines now call for two tablespoons of lemon juice per 
quart of home-canned tomatoes rather than only two teaspoons. 
</P>
<P>
Processing time is also doubled, from 15 minutes to 30 minutes for the 
hot-water bath, or when the tomatoes are sealed in jars and then placed in 
boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>UC Davis</ORGANIZATION> researcher, familiar with the recent recommendations, supported the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"If these guidelines are followed (then) canned tomatoes will be very safe," 
said <PERSON>Kathryn Boor</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>UC Davis</ORGANIZATION> food scientist. "There's no reason to be gun-shy 
about home-canned tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
The precautions are necessary because tomatoes, as is true with any raw 
agricultural product, may contain bacteria. The pathogens, if given the proper 
conditions to thrive, could multiply and contaminate the food. 
</P>
<P>
Seasoning Statistics -- While red peppers are more nutritious and tomatoes are 
fleshier, herbs are becoming fresher, according to recent federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
This segment of the produce industry is, in fact, booming. The <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> reported 
that the fresh-herb market in <DATE>1987</DATE> totaled about 28.8 million pounds, an 
increase of <PERCENT>58%</PERCENT> in just five years. 
</P>
<P>
The rise has prompted the agency to begin charting sales of fresh herbs in the 
same manner that other produce items are analyzed for national production 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the herbs to be included in the ongoing government survey are anise, 
basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, rosemary, sorrel, tarragon and watercress, 
according to the <PERSON>Packer</PERSON>, a trade journal.

<LEADPARA>  Older people who consume plenty of vitamins by eating right or taking daily
supplements run a far lower risk of cataracts, the leading cause of blindness,
researchers say.;    A study found that those who regularly used multivitamin
supplements were 37 percent less likely to have cataracts. Experts suspect the
key nutrients are anti-oxidants, substances such as vitamins A and E that
counteract the damaging effects of oxygen.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VITAMINS CUT CATARACT RISK IN STUDY
GOOD DIET MAY PREVENT THE MAIN CAUSE OF BLINDNESS,
RESEARCH SUGGESTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     However, the study's authors said they were unwilling to recommend that
people take vitamins or alter their eating habits until more research is
done.;    "We know that taking vitamin supplements decreases the risk," said
<PERSON>Dr. Leo T. Chylack</PERSON>, a co-author of the study at <ORGANIZATION>Brigham and Women's Hospital</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Boston.</LOCATION>;    "We really can't make the jump between these findings and
public health recommendations," he said. "The risk of taking vitamin
supplements is low. Is there any harm? Probably not. But we can't say there is
any real benefit yet.";    The study, directed by <PERSON>Dr. M. Christina Leske</PERSON> of
the <ORGANIZATION>State University of New York</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Stony Brook</LOCATION>, was based on 1,380 people
ages 40 to 79 who were treated at two <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> hospitals. It was published in
the <DATE>February</DATE> issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.;    Biochemist <PERSON>Dr. Allen
Taylor</PERSON>, a leading researcher in the study of cataracts, said the study's
"public health ramifications are considerable.";    "The general message will
be that one can diminish the risk of developing cataracts by the use of
relatively elevated levels of some of the anti-oxidant nutrients," said
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Laboratory for Nutrition and Vision Research</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Nutrition Research Center</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Tufts University.</ORGANIZATION>;   
About 50 million people around the world are blind because of cataracts.
Surgery is the only treatment, and in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> alone doctors perform
more than 540,000 of these operations each year at a cost of <MONEY>$3.8 billion.</MONEY>;   
Cataracts are cloudy areas on the lens that block light entering the eye.;   
Experts believe that just as oxygen rusts iron, it also can damage cell
membranes and other proteins in the lens. Some vitamins are thought to prevent
this destruction by converting oxygen compounds to less harmful forms.;    In
the study, researchers found reduced risk of cataracts among people who
consumed relatively large amounts of vitamins A, B, C and E, either by taking
pills or by eating plenty of fruits, vegetables and other nutritious foods.  </TEXT>

   Genetic Engineering 

   Yields <ORGANIZATION>Viral Insecticide 

   TEXAS A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> entomologists say they have engineered a moth-killing virus. 

   The researchers say the virus, into which they engineered the insects' own water-regulating genes, infects only moths. 
Under normal conditions, these genes produce hormones that regulate the level of water in the insects' body. 
But infection with the altered virus causes overproduction of these hormones, killing the insects in about a week. 

   <PERSON>Larry Keeley</PERSON>, one of the researchers, says the group is experimenting with two water-regulating genes. 
One governs the insects' ability to eliminate water, and the other controls water retention. 
Depending upon the gene, the virus can be used either to dehydrate the insects or to "drown" them. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Keeley</PERSON> says gene-carrying viruses could be used to attack at least two dozen critical physiological processes in insects that are regulated by hormones. 

   He says viral insecticides can be formulated into liquids and sprayed on crops, targeting such pests as the cotton bollworm, corn earworm and tobacco budworm. 
But, he adds, commercialization may be five to 10 years away. 

   Mysterious PQQ <DATE>May</DATE> Be 

   An Essential Vitamin 

   RESEARCHERS at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Davis</ORGANIZATION> have identified a possible new vitamin that may enhance development of skin, blood vessels and ligaments. 

   The compound known as pyrroloquinoline quinone, or PQQ, is part of a mammalian enzyme that facilitates growth of animal and human connective tissue. 
The vitamin-like compound, found in major organs, also occurs in fruits and vegetables. 
PQQ was discovered in <DATE>1979</DATE> as an "enzyme-helper" for a number of enzymes in bacteria. 
But it hasn't been clear whether this compound is produced by an animal cell or acquired from an external source. 
The new evidence suggests it may be the latter. 

   The researchers fed pregnant mice and rats a PQQ-deficient diet and found that <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of their offspring lacked the compound. 
Moreover, they had poor skin texture, hair loss and hunched posture. 
The symptoms were corrected when PQQ was restored to their diet. 

   <PERSON>Robert Rucker</PERSON>, one of the researchers, says the experiment indicates that PQQ might be a vitamin, a nutrient that the body can't synthesize and for which it depends on external sources. 
"What we have demonstrated is the nutritional importance of the compound," he says. 

   He says humans don't run the risk of PQQ deficiency because almost all foods they consume have the compound. 
But understanding the compound could lead to "drugs that would be able to control the rate of wound healing," he says. 
"There are situations where you want the wound to heal quickly, and some where you want to slow it down to minimize scar formation." 

   He says <ORGANIZATION>PQQ</ORGANIZATION>'s presence in high concentrations in adrenal glands also "suggests its involvement in synthesis and regulation of adrenal hormones" and the possibility that the compound has additional applications. 

   Recycling Garbage 

   Into Garbage Bags 

   POTATO PEELS and other food wastes are grist for biodegradable plastic, according to scientists at <ORGANIZATION>Argonne National Laboratory</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Environmental problems have spurred development of plastics that disintegrate in sunlight or on exposure to moisture in soil. 
A majority of such plastics have involved bonding corn starch molecules to petroleum-based polymers. 
But such bonds aren't strong, and the final product generally is too weak for such uses as garbage and shopping bags. 

   Now, Argonne researchers say they have overcome the weakness problem by using lactic acid, derived from vegetable mass. 
Researcher <PERSON>Robert Coleman</PERSON> says degradable plastic can be made entirely with lactic acid, or by combining <PERCENT>90%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>95%</PERCENT> lactic acid with petroleum-based polymers. 

   He says researchers extracted starch from potato peels, converted it into glucose and fermented glucose into lactic acid. 
The lactic acid was then condensed into polylactic acid, which produced the physical properties needed to make plastic products of various shapes. 

   Sensitive Home Alarm 

   Can 'Hear' Burglars 

   RENSSELAER <ORGANIZATION>Polytechnic Institute</ORGANIZATION> researchers have developed computerized home alarms that can recognize certain sounds and ignore others. 
These devices, 10 inches long and four inches wide, have high-speed microprocessors and are "trained" by large computers to pick, say, the sound of breaking glass out of a jumble of interfering sounds. 
Once installed, the small processors fine-tune themselves. 
They store additional signals from the environment that they want to recognize or ignore, much as humans develop recognition patterns, says <PERSON>Michael Savic</PERSON>, associate professor of electrical engineering, who heads the research group. 
As a result, he says, the devices learn to recognize the breaking sound of specific types of glass they're monitoring. 

   Programming computers to pick up well-defined sounds, such as the sound of an engine or heart beat, has been an easier task. 
But it's difficult to program the computer for such fuzzy sounds as the crushing of glass or wood. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Savic</PERSON> says the software the group has developed has other noise-detecting applications, such as recognizing the opening of a safe, detecting types of heart disease and diagnosing the cause of a malfunctioning engine.

<HEAD>Colon Cancer Risk Tied To Acid Rain Pollutants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elevated rates of colon cancer in the nation's
<LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> and north-central region may be due to an acid rain
pollutant that absorbs sunlight, impairing the body's ability to
make vitamin D, reseachers say.
   Preliminary studies have suggested that vitamin D and calcium
combine to lower the risk of colon cancer.
   According to the new theory, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere
absorbs ultraviolet rays from the sun that trigger the production
of vitamin D in the skin, researchers said at a press conference
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Sulfur dioxide, produced by the burning of high-sulfur coal, is
a principal ingredient of acid rain.
   A similar effect was observed in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> more than 350 years ago,
said the originators of the new theory, said <PERSON>Cedric Garland</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> and his brother, <PERSON>Frank</PERSON>, of the
<ORGANIZATION>Naval Health Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.
   Around <DATE>1629</DATE>, Londoners began burning high-sulfur coal from
<LOCATION>Newcastle</LOCATION>, they said. Within a short time, children began
exhibiting the leg malformations characteristic of rickets _ a
vitamin D deficiency disease.
   Vitamin D aids the absorption of calcium, and calcium and
vitamin D together appear to lower the risk of colon cancer, the
<LOCATION>Garlands</LOCATION> said.
   <PERSON>Dr. Martin Lipkin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center said the Garlands' theory ``is a legitimate theory'' and
work is in progress to clarify the role of vitamin D and calcium in
colon cancer.
   ``We're looking into how many individuals might be benefited by
calcium _ and the degree to which they might be,'' said <PERSON>Lipkin</PERSON>. Two
years ago, he showed that calcium supplements could change the
growth of cells in the colons of people at high risk of colon
cancer and might therefore lower colon cancer risk.
   An authority on diet and cancer, <PERSON>Regina Ziegler</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Cancer Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, cautioned that because this was
only a theory, people should not begin taking vitamin D supplements
to protect against colon cancer.
   ``People have trouble distinguishing theories from proven
effects,'' she said. ``With evidence such as this, you certainly
don't want to start taking large doses of vitamin D. Vitamin D in
high doses can be hazardous to your health.''
   The Garlands' explanation is not the only theory to explain why
colon cancer rates are highest in the north-central and
northeastern states.
   ``Other people have hypothesized that increased exercise,
increased fruit and vegetable intake and differences in drinking
water may lead to the lower incidence in the South,'' said <PERSON>Ziegler</PERSON>.
   The Garlands cautioned that people should not spend more time in
the sun to increase their vitamin D production because exposure to
sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer. They suggested instead
that people eat foods high in vitamin D, which include anchovies,
sardines, salmon and tuna. Milk is fortified with vitamin D, but
most other dairy products are not, they said.
   Breast cancer also occurs at an increased rate in the areas
where colon cancer is highest, and the Garlands suggested that
breast cancer, too, might be indirectly related to sulfur dioxide
in the atmosphere. That theory is more speculative than the colon
cancer theory, <PERSON>Frank Garland</PERSON> said.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: RAISING POTASSIUM LEVEL LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick, name two ways to reduce the risk of high blood pressure. We're betting 
you know the answer: Lose weight, if necessary, and cut back on salt. But if we 
asked you to name a third measure, the answer might not come as easily, even 
though it's just as simple: Increase intake of potassium. 
</P>
<P>
This advice comes backed by a special committee of the <ORGANIZATION>National Research 
Council</ORGANIZATION>, which recommends that adults consume 3,500 milligrams of potassium a 
day. Some groups are already eating that much; others are not. Recent estimates 
show that 15- to 20-year-olds take in 3,400 milligrams daily. Diets of an urban 
white population provided 2,500 milligrams, while studies of black Americans 
have found intakes as low as 1,000 milligrams a day. 
</P>
<P>
Sodium may get more press, but our bodies contain twice as much potassium -- 
just over half-a-pound. Most is found within the cells. Together with sodium, 
it regulates the salt and acid-base balance of the fluid environment of healthy 
cells. The amount outside the cells, though smaller, is equally important, 
contributing to transmission of nerve impulses, control of skeletal muscle 
contractions and maintenance of normal blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Dietary deficiency doesn't usually occur. It can develop when large amounts are 
lost by prolonged vomiting, chronic diarrhea or laxative abuse. Excessive 
losses are also linked to certain diseases and use of some diuretics. Patients 
on such medications often are advised to take them with orange juice or a 
banana, both packed with potassium. 
</P>
<P>
Over several decades, evidence has mounted that eating more such potassium-rich 
fruits and vegetables may benefit not only hypertension patients but the 
population at large. Although not always consistent, some studies indicate that 
low levels of dietary sodium coupled with high intake of potassium may reduce 
blood pressure. And high potassium intake -- meaning at least 3,500 milligrams 
daily -- may by itself protect against death from stroke. In one study, it was 
estimated that an increase of just 400 milligrams a day of potassium, over a 
12-year period, led to a <PERCENT>40%</PERCENT> decrease in incidence of stroke-related death. 
</P>
<P>
Why this happens is not yet known. But until research provides the answer, 
we're left with the recommendation to take in 3,500 milligrams a day. The next 
question is, does your diet meet the test? 
</P>
<P>
Bear this in mind: Fruits and vegetables, unless processed with salt, are 
naturally low in sodium, and for this reason are often mentioned as preferred 
potassium sources. Yet most other foods also contain the mineral. A cup of milk 
has 355 milligrams, a slice of whole-wheat bread, 63 milligrams, and an ounce 
of hamburger, 81 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's run through a typical day's menu. Breakfast might include four ounces 
of orange juice (238 milligrams), a cup of oatmeal (146 milligrams), 
three-quarters cup milk (266 milligrams) and coffee (65 milligrams). The total 
is 715 milligrams: <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the target. 
</P>
<P>
A bag lunch could be a sandwich made with whole-wheat bread (326 milligrams) 
and two tablespoons of peanut butter (200 milligrams), along with carrot sticks 
(145 milligrams), a glass of milk (355 milligrams) and a fresh pear (260 
milligrams) for dessert. Lunch thus gives you 1,286 milligrams, or <PERCENT>36%</PERCENT> more. 
</P>
<P>
A dinner, consisting of four ounces of lean steak (396 milligrams), a large 
baked potato (844 milligrams), a medium stalk of broccoli (293 milligrams), a 
glass of skim milk (355 milligrams) and a cup of pineapple chunks (266 
milligrams) adds 2,154 milligrams, bringing the day's tally to 4,155 
milligrams, even without snacks that might round out this bare-bones menu. 
Clearly, a menu planned with an eye to general principles of good nutrition can 
easily provide 3,500 milligrams of potassium or more. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your meal doesn't include such potassium powerhouses as baked potato, 
there are alternatives. Dried apricots, prunes, cooked kidney beans, celery, 
spinach, avocado and winter squash all provide 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams 
of potassium per half-cup. One rung down are bananas, tomatoes, orange juice, 
cooked lentils, <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> sprouts and cantaloupe, with 200 milligrams to 275 
milligrams per half-cup. Other fruits and vegetables contain 70 milligrams to 
170 milligrams per half-cup -- and we often eat servings larger than that 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
There's no reason to suggest that taking potassium supplements will ward off 
hypertension. Yet a diet rich in potassium might be of benefit, and this 
possibility provides one more reason to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. 
Such a diet dates back to that of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, who depended 
heavily on potassium-rich roots, fruits, tubers, nuts, grains and seeds for 
calories.

Read Ingredient List on <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> Products

<P>
Question: Is it true that some turkey products have skin ground up in them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Some do, and that adds considerably to the fat content of the product. 
One way to tell whether the ground poultry you're buying contains skin as well 
as flesh is by inspecting the ingredients list. If you find the words turkey 
meat or chicken meat, you can assume you're getting the lean part only. If the 
list includes plain terms like turkey or chicken, or even chicken breast, then 
the producer may, within the limits of government regulation, add ground skin 
to the product.

Q: I buy sunflower seeds in bulk, so there is no labeling information. My 
calorie chart says that two ounces of the seeds contain 170 calories. Does that 
mean two ounces including the shell or just the edible seeds? 
</P>
<P>
A: That figure includes the shell. Two ounces of the edible seeds would contain 
about 325 calories. If you don't have ready access to a scale, you may find it 
more useful to think in terms of household measures. A cup of seeds in the 
shell, which yields about one-third cup of edible kernels, provides 255 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
As you may know, sunflower seeds are high in fat -- an attribute useful to 
birds and squirrels trying to survive the <DATE>winter</DATE> but not always so desirable 
for humans. Protein and carbohydrate account for a little more than <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the 
calories; the rest are from fat. 
</P>
<P>
Sunflower seeds contain some B vitamins and are a good source of iron. They 
also provide a bit of calcium, although in that department they're no 
competitor for milk. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've read that a nursing mother should consume about 500 calories a day more 
than normal during the first six months of her infant's life. What is the basis 
for that statement? 
</P>
<P>
A: On average, milk from well-nourished mothers contains about 70 calories per 
100 milliliters. It's estimated that the conversion of calories consumed (when 
the mother eats) to calories in milk is, on average, about <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> efficient -- 
although this varies widely, ranging from <PERCENT>76%</PERCENT> to as high as <PERCENT>94%</PERCENT>. Thus, during 
the first six months, a woman typically produces an average of about three cups 
of milk a day. So it takes an average of about 640 calories a day to meet the 
demand of producing milk. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, is the gap between the recommendation and the actual need explained? 
The generally recommended energy allowance of 500 calories assumes that the 
mother has laid down some energy reserves during her pregnancy, anywhere from 
15,400 to 23,000 calories worth. It's expected that these fat stores will 
provide the caloric deficit from 100 to 150 calories a day for the first six 
months. Obviously, women who were underweight during pregnancy or whose weight 
drops too much while they are nursing will need to raise their caloric intake 
to meet the increased demands. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, I purchased three copper pans, all lined with nickel. 
While cleaning up after a recent dinner party, a friend inquired about the 
lining material. When I told her it was nickel, she expressed concern about its 
safety, gently implying that unwittingly I might have been poisoning my guests. 
Are nickel-lined pans harmful in some way? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. While both tin and nickel are used to line copper pans, nickel offers 
two advantages: 1) it is more durable, and will outlast tin; 2) it is more 
heat-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, that means that if an empty tin-lined pan is inadvertently 
left on a heated burner, the lining will be destroyed rather quickly but a 
nickel lining will not be so easily hurt. 
</P>
<P>
From a safety standpoint there really is no difference. There is no evidence 
that either nickel or tin will migrate into the food in harmful amounts. 
Besides, both metals are poorly absorbed and readily excreted.

PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON VITAMINS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headline ("Skip Vitamins, Pregnant Women Told") and the lead in your 
front-page article were not fully in sync with all the information presented in 
the rest of the article -- including legitimate viewpoints favoring supplement 
use by pregnant women because of deficiencies in their diets. 
</P>
<P>
Many dietary surveys show a high frequency of deficient diets in the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>, with young women some of the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, supplement use prevents certain birth defects. A recent signed 
editorial comment in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Assn.</ORGANIZATION> stated, "The 
biggest challenge . . . about the benefits of taking vitamins is to get women 
of childbearing age to hear and follow this simple advice." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> committee members whose report you cited are 
not omniscient. Nutritionists with credentials equal or superior to theirs 
differ greatly over the benefits of supplement use by pregnant women. The 
committee is not even consistent -- concern with possible nutrient interaction 
(iron's interference with zinc absorption) was not reflected in its advice to 
take iron supplements during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the committee admits to "considerable variation in nutrient 
requirements among individuals," its report failed to identify how physicians 
can determine their patients' requirements. In fact, no method that is both 
inexpensive and reliable is available.

TRYPTOPHAN: UNCERTAINTY REIGNS AFTER BAN ON SALES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A $150-MILLION-A-YEAR MARKET HAD GROWN FOR THE AMINO ACID. NOW, EXPERTS 
ARE DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE SUPPLEMENTS ARE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL.

<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a golden rule of nutrition, it is a simple one: Too much of 
anything is bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements, Americans seem to 
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human 
body, one can never have too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated <MONEY>$150-million-a-year</MONEY> 
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> over the last few 
years. Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement," it 
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people, sometimes on 
the advice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders 
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is 
behind 287 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cases of a rare blood disorder, 24 of them in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of 
eosinophilia, contamination is a key suspected cause. However, because 
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body, there is also the 
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to 
harmful levels, scientists say. Tryptophan advocates, who point to years of use 
of the amino acid, say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak 
of the blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame, the situation highlights the 
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a 
"natural" way to remedy a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep well? Eating too much? Depressed? Suffering premenstrual syndrome? 
Try tryptophan, popular books advise. 
</P>
<P>
In training? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in 
your body that will bulk up muscles, the athletes' grapevine says. 
</P>
<P>
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine, isoleucine, valine and 
threonine, the grapevine also says. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based 
is preliminary at best. More importantly, it was never followed up with the 
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is 
enough -- and how much is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing 
and therapy done in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> and elsewhere. In some cases, they 
suggest, amino acid supplementation could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrist <PERSON>Priscilla Slagle</PERSON> says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids 
to treat her patients in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Encino</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION>. Among them have 
been "hundreds" of people given tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment, and I believe 
they do have powerful medical uses," <PERSON>Slagle</PERSON> said. "When people have illnesses 
and difficulties, their metabolic processes are disturbed. So we're talking 
about correcting and creating a balance again." 
</P>
<P>
Because she has concerns about quality control, <PERSON>Slagle</PERSON> tells her patients to 
use only products formulated by <ORGANIZATION>Tyson &amp; Associates of Santa Monica</ORGANIZATION>, which 
markets its amino acids only through doctors. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Don Tyson</PERSON>, president of the firm, said it does about <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> a year in 
business through "a few hundred" doctors in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> area and "a few 
thousand" throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed 
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from 
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets. These manufacturers count on 
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> has no controls over their manufacture or sale. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as 
relatively harmless, since they assume Americans taking the supplements are 
adequately nourished. 
</P>
<P>
But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person, they suggest, amino acid 
supplements might be harmful. Animal research shows that, when an animal is 
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs, giving it a high dose 
produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal, said 
<PERSON>Dorothy Gietzen</PERSON>, a biochemist who directs the <ORGANIZATION>UC Davis</ORGANIZATION> psychiatry research lab. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to 
break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of 
byproducts of the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the elegant chemical factory that is life, there are four major components: 
</P>
<P>
* The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbohydrates provide energy to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Proteins direct the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Fats store energy for use later. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein 
division of this biochemical factory. Just as a child snaps together Legos to 
build a thousand fantastic structures, the body strings together amino acids in 
countless ways to make countless proteins. 
</P>
<P>
(Amino acids come in L and D forms -- the L form being the version that the 
body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold. The D form is a 
three-dimensional mirror image.) 
</P>
<P>
When a human lifts a finger, has a thought, or just breathes, it is because 
enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of 
energy possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food, 
breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract, and then absorbing the 
resulting amino acids into the bloodstream. Unused amino acids are broken down 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly, and a deficiency in any one 
of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis. However, in adults 
only eight "essential" amino acids -- including tryptophan -- must be derived 
from food. The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by 
the body from the essential amino acids. (Babies need histidine but develop the 
ability to synthesize it as they grow.) 
</P>
<P>
Over short periods, the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential 
amino acids by digesting protein-rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal 
tract. Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person, deficiency 
results in disease, such as pellagra, caused by lack of vitamin B-6, which is 
produced when the body breaks down tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in 
whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein-building process by 
taking amino acid supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, of the <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> amino acid firm, says keeping track of his amino 
acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care 
rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain's level of the chemical 
serotonin. 
</P>
<P>
But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of 
overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime, said 
<PERSON>Richard Wurtman</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> researcher whose work 
showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wurtman</PERSON> said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are 
overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic 
precautions. It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant, 
hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs, and should never be taken before driving 
or dangerous activities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan's perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting 
contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid, the flavor enhancer 
monosodium glutamate. 
</P>
<P>
The "glutamate" part of MSG is an amino acid and, like tryptophan, is a 
neurotransmitter, affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system. 
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic, headachy 
condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using <ORGANIZATION>MSG</ORGANIZATION> might go 
home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good 
or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one 
another are complicated and, so far, not very well studied. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is we know very little about what happens in terms of flows of 
material in the body, especially for amino acids like tryptophan," said <PERSON>Dwight 
Matthews</PERSON>, associate professor at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell Medical College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. 
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their 
biological paths. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go back to almost any eating studies and look at how amino acid levels 
change after a meal, but there's not a lot in terms of the kinetics -- what 
happens to it later," <PERSON>Matthews</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
At <ORGANIZATION>UC Davis</ORGANIZATION>, biochemist <PERSON>Gietzen</PERSON> noted that studies of rats show that 
concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the 
animal has been fasting or has just eaten, the composition of the most recent 
meal, and the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a paper she uses as a reference, <PERSON>Gietzen</PERSON> said there are wide variations 
in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average. For tryptophan, the 
average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma; for 
women, it ranges from 24 to 76. 
</P>
<P>
With that wide a range, how can "normal" be determined, she asked. Before an 
individual's amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined, she said, 
multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day, for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had a consistent pattern, you could maybe recommend adding something 
to the diet -- but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to 
give it to them in pills," <PERSON>Gietzen</PERSON> said, "because they can tolerate it better 
in a combination with other amino acids than singly." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood 
disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much 
if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as 
an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the 
crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews of <ORGANIZATION>Cornell</ORGANIZATION> noted that, for his studies, he has to verify the purity of 
the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects -- and he 
frequently finds contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"Time and time again I find some very strange impurities," <PERSON>Matthews</PERSON> said. 
"That, in my opinion, is one of the best places to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product, 
but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches, he 
said. In addition, the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic 
pressure on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less 
quality control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other 
amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about natural foods," he said. "We're talking about 
specially prepared individual compounds. And in almost any case you can get the 
same effect just by eating right. You can pick natural foods that are a little 
bit richer in specific amino acids and get along just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman, in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze, wants the 
<ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> to classify amino acids as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad truth is it probably works," he said of tryptophan. "But I would hope 
very much that the perception that these amino acids sold by the present route 
may be causing big problems will cause us to rethink completely whether we 
should allow them to be sold as so-called nutritional supplements."
