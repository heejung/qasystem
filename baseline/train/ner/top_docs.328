   President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>'s bass-fishing
trip to a private lake <DATE>Thursday</DATE> will take him to a small, historic
community that once played host to another vice president, <PERSON>Aaron
Burr</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s itinerary calls for four hours of fishing with <PERSON>Ray Scott</PERSON>,
whose 55-acre lake is near the historic Pintlala site in rolling
terrain 15 miles south of <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, who became a
friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s in
<DATE>1978</DATE>. ``His fishing is so token, he doesn't have a chance to get at
it much.''
   Scott, who got a call from <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to arrange the outing, has
brought attention to a crossroads community that is little more than
a small elementary school, a library, a fire station and <PERSON>Mosley</PERSON>'s
store and service station.
   Reporters and photographers descended on <PERSON>Mosley</PERSON>'s in anticipation
of the visit. ``It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said
<PERSON>Mary Meadows</PERSON> as she prepared hot dogs for the throng <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> agents checked out ``every squirrel
nest and deer stand'' on his property.
   Scott, who built the lake a couple of years ago and now has a
whitetail deer research program on his land, said the old Federal
Road that crossed through Pintlala _ a paved portion of which now
runs in front of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s gate _ was the route taken by Gen. <PERSON>Andrew
Jackson</PERSON>, later the nation's seventh president, on his way to <LOCATION>New
Orleans</LOCATION> during the War of <DATE>1812</DATE>.
   Scott and historians also say <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, the vice president who killed
<PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> in a duel, paid an unplanned visit to Pintlala.
Burr was captured in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> in <DATE>1807</DATE> after being accused of treason
and was brought up the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Road</ORGANIZATION>. According to <LOCATION>Scott</LOCATION>, he spent
one night at <ORGANIZATION>Manac</ORGANIZATION>'s Tavern in the town.
   Burr was acquitted of treason but remained disgraced and retired
from politics.
   Scott, who founded the <ORGANIZATION>Bass Anglers Sportsman Society</ORGANIZATION> two decades
ago and sold the publishing enterprise for <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, is a
conservationist who predicted <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will rival Teddy Roosevelt in
supporting <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s outdoors.
   ``He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time
for action,'' <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said. ``He'll be reasonable but firm'' in
protecting the environment.

   President-elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s bass fishing
excursion today takes him to a crossroads community that once played
host to another vice president _ <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s itinerary calls for about four hours of fishing with
prominent <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> sportsman <PERSON>Ray Scott</PERSON>, whose 55-acre private lake is
set in rolling countryside about 15 miles south of <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, who became a
friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in
<DATE>1978</DATE>. ``His fishing is so token, he doesn't have a chance to get at

   ``He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time
for action,'' said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> in an interview. ``He'll be reasonable but
firm'' in protecting the environment.
   Scott, who got a Thanksgiving Day call from <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to arrange the
bass fishing outing, has brought attention to a farm community that
is composed mainly of a small elementary school, a library, a fire
station and <PERSON>Mosley</PERSON>'s store and service station at the junction of
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 31 and <ORGANIZATION>Federal Road</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, who also has a whitetail deer research program on his
land, enjoys talking about the legends of Pintlala, including visits
made by <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> figures prior to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   He said the old Federal Road that crossed through Pintlala _ a
paved portion of which now runs in front of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s gate _ was the
route taken by Gen. <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> on his way to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> for the
battle of <DATE>1812</DATE>. Scott and historians also say <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, the vice
president who killed <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> in a duel, paid an unplanned
visit to Pintlala in <DATE>1807</DATE>.
   Burr was was captured in southwest <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> on treason charges in
<DATE>Februrary 1807</DATE> and was brought up the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Road</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
spent one night at <ORGANIZATION>Manac</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Tavern</LOCATION>, which was located at a site about
a quarter-mile from <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s property at <LOCATION>Pintlala</LOCATION>.
   ``Pintlala is a Creek Indian word that means `fish swamp.' It
once was a heavy Creek settlement,'' said <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>. ``Manac's Tavern
was owned by <PERSON>Sam Manac</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Creek</ORGANIZATION> with large landholdings.... Manac's
son, <PERSON>David</PERSON>, was the first Indian ever to graduate from West Point.''
   The news media descended on <PERSON>Mosley</PERSON>'s store and service station in
anticipation of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s visit.
   ``It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said <PERSON>Mary Meadows</PERSON>
as she prepared hot dogs for the lunch crowd <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said
<ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> agents had checked out ``every squirrel nest and deer
stand'' on his property.
   The only overt indication that the president-elect was on his way
was a sign outside the <ORGANIZATION>Pintlala Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>. It read: ``Welcome
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. Godspeed and Good Fishing.''
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, who remains as a figurehead of the <LOCATION>B.A.S.S.</LOCATION> operation,
plays host at its fishing tournaments, some of which are carried on
cable television.
   <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> said he met <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION> about 10 years ago and was
asked to manage <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s <DATE>1980</DATE> campaign in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>. ``I'm not sure his
pickin' was too good, otherwise he wouldn't have picked me,'' said
<PERSON>Scott</PERSON>, recalling their loss to <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> in the state's primary.
   ``But I'm a good salesman. That's about all politics is anyway,''
he said. ``We just always clicked.''

<HEAD>Newly Found Letters Offer Insight Into Early American Explorers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLEN G. BREED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-hidden cache of personal letters
unveiled <DATE>Monday</DATE> should give historians new insight into one of the
leaders of the famed <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> expedition that explored the
<LOCATION>northern Plains</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION>.
   The 47 letters from Capt. <PERSON>William Clark</PERSON> - five of them written
during the 1803-1806 expedition into the newly acquired <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>
Territory - are a ``tremendous find,'' said <PERSON>James R. Bentley</PERSON>,
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Filson Club</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> historical
repository that now owns the letters.
   Among the more important illuminations are <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s thoughts on
the mysterious death in <DATE>1809</DATE> of expedition commander <PERSON>Meriwether
Lewis</PERSON> and his opinion of the treacherous <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, vice president
under <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>, whose <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Louisiana Purchase</LOCATION>
doubled the nation's size.
   The letters, dated from <DATE>1792</DATE> to <DATE>1811</DATE>, are addressed to Gen.
<PERSON>Jonathan Clark</PERSON>, the explorer's older brother. Until two years ago
the letters were hidden away in the <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> attic of <ORGANIZATION>Clark</ORGANIZATION>'s
descendants.
   Some historians have argued that <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>, then governor of the
territory he helped explore and map, was murdered on his way to
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s letters support the theory that his
friend killed himself.
   ``<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> clearly indicates in his letters that he believed <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>
was in an unstable state of mind and was very capable of committing
suicide,'' said <PERSON>James J. Holmberg</PERSON>, curator of manuscripts for the
<ORGANIZATION>Filson Club</ORGANIZATION>.
   In one letter, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> calls <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> a ``poor fellow'' who was
``much distressed'' about how the public might perceive his
handling of financial matters in the territory.
   <PERSON>Holmberg</PERSON> said that in another letter <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> tells how <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> had
asked him and others to help sell his property and settle his debts
shortly before his death.
   References to <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, perhaps best known for killing <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> in a duel, turn up frequently in the
correspondence.
   The references focus on <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>'s alleged attempts to raise an army
and overthrow the government. In his letters, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> refers to <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
as a ``second <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Holmberg</PERSON> said.
   ``He told President <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> that <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> was a real danger and
that something needs to be done about him,'' <PERSON>Holmberg</PERSON> said. ``And
something was. He was arrested.''
   The letters will force revision of several biographies, <PERSON>Holmberg</PERSON>
said, including that of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s slave, <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>, who accompanied the
group on the excursion.
   <PERSON>Holmberg</PERSON> said a <DATE>1985</DATE> book about <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> - ``In Search of York,'' by
<PERSON>Robert Betts</PERSON> - was extremely thorough. But he said new information
in the letters explains some important events in <LOCATION>York</LOCATION>'s life, such
as how <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s refusal to reunite York with his slave wife caused
an irreparable rift between the two men.
   The <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> descendants just recently completed the legal process
of turning the documents over to the <ORGANIZATION>Filson Club</ORGANIZATION>, which now owns
six of the 12 existing letters <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> wrote during the expedition.
The six others are scattered in other collections. The <ORGANIZATION>Filson Club</ORGANIZATION>
would not disclose what it paid for the letters.
   <PERSON>Winifred George</PERSON> of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, incoming president of the
1,500-member, Montana-based <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Clark Trail Heritage
Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, said it was a ``wonderful'' find.
   ``It's been some years since something new has been
discovered,'' <PERSON>George</PERSON> said. ``We often forget how important that
expedition was to the entire westward development,'' she said.
   Bentley acknowledged that the documents won't exactly rewrite
the history books, but said they offer illuminating details.
   ``What struck me most was the insight on <PERSON>William Clark</PERSON> ... It
shows a side of him that would hard to find otherwise,'' he said.

<TEXT>     <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON>, who resigned in disgrace in <DATE>1973</DATE> after pleading no contest to tax
evasion, is the only former vice president missing from the gallery of carved
figures that represents the men who toiled a heartbeat away from being chief
executive. Even the bust of the most recent former vice president -- <PERSON>George
Bush</PERSON> -- waits in storage for its pedestal.;    Across from <PERSON>Mondale</PERSON>'s bust is
the visage of his predecessor, <PERSON>Nelson Rockefeller</PERSON>, on a brown marble stand
next to the likeness of <ORGANIZATION>Gerald Ford</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON>'s successor. But on the other side
of the tiled hallway sits the bust of <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON>. And next to the
<PERSON>Mondale</PERSON> bust is an antique wooden clock.;    The likeness of the former
<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> governor, the first vice president to resign under legal fire, is
nowhere to be found on two floors of statuary decorating the place where vice
presidents have served as presidents of the Senate.;    In "The Capitol," a
picture book published by the <ORGANIZATION>Government Printing Office</ORGANIZATION>, page after page
shows marble busts. For <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON>'s entry, there is a snapshot and the caption,
"pending.";    UNDER a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> resolution passed in <DATE>1898</DATE>, the architect of the
Capitol or the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Rules Committee</ORGANIZATION> contacts the vice
president -- or his family -- after he leaves office for the commission of a
formal bust.;    "I don't know what the reason is. I guess we're waiting for
the family or the committee," said <PERSON>William F. Raines Jr.</PERSON>, a spokesman for the
architect of the Capitol, acknowledging that <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON> is the only one among the
43 former vice presidents whose bust has not been commissioned.;    "It's
generally handled by the architect's office," said <PERSON>Jim King</PERSON>, a spokesman for
the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Rules Committee.</ORGANIZATION>;    The subject of an <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON> bust comes up "from
time to time, when something might happen on that," <PERSON>Raines</PERSON> said. "We don't
have anything in the <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON> file." He added quickly, "We don't even have a file
on that.";    <PERSON>George M. White</PERSON>, architect of the Capitol since <DATE>1971</DATE>, said the
staff or family of the last several vice presidents called his office to start
the process.;    "It's probably as much my neglect as theirs," said <PERSON>White</PERSON>, who
blamed his lack of initiative on other <LOCATION>Capitol chores.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON>, a
businessman now living in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, could not be reached for
comment, but Rep. <PERSON>Helen Delich Bentley</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Md.</LOCATION>, believes that the former vice
president has been snubbed.;    'H E hasn't been treated fairly," said
<PERSON>Bentley</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> maritime commissioner. "He did step down, true, and he
was under pressure. We need to look at the whole picture. Others who have been
in that position have been under fire.";    Not only under fire but fired
upon. The nation's third vice president, <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, was charged by <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for shooting <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> in a duel but was never brought
to trial. He also was tried on treason charges but was acquitted.;    <PERSON>Schuyler
Colfax</PERSON>, vice president from <DATE>1869</DATE> to <DATE>1873</DATE>, was deeply implicated in a bribery
scandal but remained in office after the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> declined to
start impeachment proceedings.;    Both men are memorialized by marble busts,
as is former Vice President <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, whose bust was completed in <DATE>1965</DATE> --
long before <LOCATION>Watergate</LOCATION> -- and is prominently displayed outside a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> chamber
door.;    White denied that there was any deliberate effort to block the
commissioning of an <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON> bust. "Not on my part, and I'm the one who's
supposed to do it," he said.;    When White was asked whether he would contact
the former vice president about a bust, he said, "Now that you mention it, I
probably should."  </TEXT>

<HL> When President Is a Four-Letter Word
---
By Matthew Cossolotto</HL>
<DD> 02/27/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Call it four-letter chic. 
All of a sudden the <DATE>1988</DATE> presidential field is swarming with possible contenders who have one thing in common -- four-letter last names. 

   This is an odd situation. 
We have had only three four-letter chief executives: <PERSON>James Polk</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Taft</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> -- who was appointed, not elected, to both the vice presidency and presidency. 
Three out of 40 is not what you would call an overwhelming percentage. 
The odds may be stacked against the current crop of four-letter <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> aspirants. 

   Who are they? 
The Republicans boast at least four principal possibilities: Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION>Secretary of State Alexander Haig</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON>. 
Some people suggest that <PERSON>Sen. Dole</PERSON>'s wife, <ORGANIZATION>Transportation</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Elizabeth Dole</PERSON>, should consider running. 
And <PERSON>Horace Busby</PERSON>, former aide to President <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON>, includes <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Tom Kean</PERSON> on his so-called "twitch list" of potential candidates. 

   The Democrats have no shortage in this department, either. 
Until recently, there were three four-letter Democrats widely touted for the presidency: former <PERSON>Sen. Gary Hart</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Senate Armed Services Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Sam Nunn</PERSON>, and former <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Chuck Robb</PERSON>. 
The list is growing. 
A recent <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> article says <PERSON>Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore</PERSON> is a potential candidate. 
And <PERSON>Mr. Busby</PERSON>'s "twitch list" includes a prominent Democratic spokesman on foreign policy, <PERSON>Sen. Chris Dodd</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. 

   It was way back in <DATE>1845</DATE> that <PERSON>James Polk</PERSON>, the only Democrat with a four-letter name to occupy the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, became president. 
Messrs. 
<PERSON>Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robb</PERSON>, <PERSON>Nunn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dodd</PERSON> may want to take this into account as they consider their presidential prospects. 
<PERSON>Mr. Hart</PERSON>, in particular, may have some new grounds for debating the wisdom of his decision to shorten his last name from <LOCATION>Hartpence</LOCATION>. 

   Rare as four-letter presidents have been, four-lettered vice presidents have come almost as few and far between -- only four. 
One, <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, is infamous, having killed <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> in a duel. 
Another, <PERSON>William King</PERSON>, vice president in <DATE>1853</DATE> during the <PERSON>Pierce</PERSON> administration, died the same year he was inaugurated. 
The other two, <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> and <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON>, happen to be among the three most recent Republican vice presidents, <PERSON>Nelson Rockefeller</PERSON> being the multisyllabic exception. 
This recent trend, if that is what it is, may give hope to Republican vice presidential aspirants with four-letter surnames. 

   (Just for the record, 21 presidents have had two-syllable last names, while 11 presidential names have contained three syllables. 
Three presidents have had one-syllable last names not of four letters, and just one president -- <PERSON>Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON> -- has had four syllables in his last name.) 

   What can account for such a dismal showing of individuals with four-letter names? 
My own theory posits that Americans, already measurably cynical about politicians, simply want to avoid associating their national leaders with four-letter words. 
Lest the four-letter candidates get too discouraged -- and the other candidates become carried away with their good fortune -- bear this in mind: The first real test of presidential timber in <DATE>1988</DATE> comes in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, a four-letter state.

<P>
As much as any town can today, the historic colonial port of <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> has the 
look of the Old South, and like much of the South it is rife with ghosts. I 
think I may have a crush on one of them. That's really how I happened to find 
<LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered down the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> are several charming old towns that thrived 
briefly as cosmopolitan centers, and then faded into the pages of history. 
</P>
<P>
I think of the shipping port of Salem in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, which eventually 
declined as <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> grew, and nearby <LOCATION>Annapolis</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> capital that slept 
while <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> prospered. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, I stumbled this <DATE>spring</DATE> across yet another one, <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Once reputedly the world's rice-exporting capital, it now is a quiet but 
appealing backwater that was long ago overshadowed by <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Like Salem and <LOCATION>Annapolis</LOCATION>, however, it has preserved many of the gorgeous old 
homes built by wealthy families in the town's heyday before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown is about midway on the 100-mile drive down the <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> coast 
from <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
I had never heard of the town before my <LOCATION>Carolina</LOCATION> trip this <DATE>spring</DATE>, and I 
remained unaware of its colonial significance until I got there. I might have 
hurried right through, except for <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>'s daughter. 
</P>
<P>
I have read a couple of fairly recent biographies of <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, the urbane but 
notorious <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> vice president who fatally wounded <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> in a 
famous duel. 
</P>
<P>
One of the saddest periods in <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>'s always-dramatic life was the tragic death 
of his intelligent and beautiful daughter <PERSON>Theodosia</PERSON>, wife of the governor of 
<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Joseph Alston</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Planning to visit her father in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, Theodosia boarded a ship leaving 
<LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 31, 1812</DATE>. The ship vanished without a trace, an unsolved 
mystery. Perhaps pirates attacked -- one of the legends surrounding <LOCATION>Theodosia</LOCATION> 
-- or it was sunk by a fierce gale known to have hit the coast. 
</P>
<P>
For some unexplainable reason, <PERSON>Theodosia</PERSON> and the story of her untimely death 
intrigued me. I am usually forgetful of names, but I retain hers. Can I have 
formed a romantic crush across the centuries? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of the most admired women of her day. So it was with astonishment 
and great delight that I read her name on a historical marker a few miles 
outside <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
I am a sucker for these roadside snippets from the past, and more often than 
not I'm rewarded with an interesting historic anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
The sign informed me that <PERSON>Theodosia</PERSON> and her husband had lived in the <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> 
area. Their home site is now a part of <PERSON>Brookgreen Gardens</PERSON>, a large sculpture 
garden, just north of town, that's filled with an inviting mix of classically 
heroic and charmingly whimsical pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION> is the port from which <PERSON>Theodosia</PERSON> departed to meet her death. 
A huge 18th-Century mansion, the <ORGANIZATION>Man-Doyle House</ORGANIZATION>, still stands on Front Street, 
where she is said to have danced the night before the fatal trip. 
</P>
<P>
I decided I had to stop here for a while, drawn by my odd fascination with 
<LOCATION>Theodosia</LOCATION>. It is by such unexpected paths that travel discoveries are made. 
</P>
<P>
I gave myself an hour's time, but my visit stretched for another as 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION>'s attractions revealed themselves. A weekend would have been more 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Several bed and breakfast inns offer lodgings in or near the impressive 
<ORGANIZATION>Georgetown Historic District</ORGANIZATION>, which covers several blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Shaded by a canopy of moss-draped oaks, <PERSON>Georgetown</PERSON> sits at the confluence of 
four rivers forming <LOCATION>Winyah Bay</LOCATION>. It might have been <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s oldest European 
community, but the Spanish who settled in <DATE>1526</DATE> were quickly driven out by 
Indians and disease. The heritage, instead, is British, dating from <DATE>1729</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 homes, buildings and sites from the <DATE>1700s</DATE> still remain in the 
historic district. Information about escorted or self-directed walking tours is 
available at the local chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Harold Kaminski House</PERSON>, built about 1760, is a museum filled with antiques 
reflecting <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION>'s link to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is no longer a commercial crop in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s coastal low country, 
but <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> today boasts a large and active shrimp-fishing fleet, which adds 
a definite bustle to its attractive waterfront setting. 
</P>
<P>
The town's colorful history is full of ghostly legends -- actually, <LOCATION>Georgetown 
County</LOCATION> enjoys some fame as the most haunted place in the South -- and the 
shrimping fleet has its own bag of superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 shrimp trawlers operate from the <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> wharf, all of them 
sporting tall masts. The top of each mast, I noticed, is painted white. 
</P>
<P>
A curious coincidence? I wondered. Not a coincidence at all, but rather 
something of a safety feature, I was told by <PERSON>Bill Oberst</PERSON>, a young history buff 
in the <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>. His family dates back to the town's 
colonial origins. 
</P>
<P>
The local lore maintains, according to <PERSON>Oberst</PERSON>, that if a shrimping vessel 
starts to sink, the white mast provides an appropriately clean spot "where the 
hand of God can grab hold and pull the boat back up to safety." 
</P>
<P>
This city's local legends are brought to life in an annual summer theater 
production called "Ghosts of the <ORGANIZATION>Coast</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
In my short stay, I strolled along Harbor Walk, a boardwalk that stretches for 
a couple of blocks along the waterfront, where you can dine pleasantly on fresh 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
And I stepped inside the small but very interesting Rice Museum on Front 
Street, which tells the story of <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION>'s once-flourishing rice culture. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Civil War, the region supported more than 150 plantations, including 
one owned by <PERSON>Theodosia</PERSON> and her husband. But the end of slavery made cultivation 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Machines were developed that might have replaced slave labor, but they sank 
deep in the swampy soil of the low country. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>, a number of the old rice plantations have been 
restored as private homes. 
</P>
<P>
Although these fine old mansions are not open to the public, daily river boat 
tours sail past them on the same murky river ways that served the plantations 
as commercial highways two centuries ago. Watch for alligators on one narrow 
stretch of the route called "Alligator Alley." 
</P>
<P>
My two hours passed too quickly, as I sniffed the sea air and walked along 
elegant old streets exploring another chapter in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s rich history. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Oberst</PERSON> said he can stand under an old oak tree and feel things from the town's 
long past. I don't doubt him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on Front Street before the <ORGANIZATION>Man-Doyle House</ORGANIZATION>, I easily imagined that I 
saw fair Theodosia in the second-floor ballroom enjoying a final dance before 
her fateful voyage.

<HL> Who's News:
Again, Burr and Lorenzo Part Company
As People's Founder Leaves Texas Air

<TEXT>
   The last time <PERSON>Donald C. Burr</PERSON> parted company with <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, he had big plans. 
He left in <DATE>1980</DATE> to build an innovative new airline from scratch: <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Now, only a few months after <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> will be leaving <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s employ again. 
<PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON>, 45 years old, resigned effective this week as executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, a post he had held only two months. 
But this time, his plans after <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> are far less ambitious. 
"Right now is a good time to just look around," he says. 

   There has been speculation about <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON>'s departure ever since <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> reunited <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> with <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, his former low-fare competitor. 
<PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> said that his dealings with the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer were cordial, but he declined to be specific about his reasons for leaving. 
"I know -- surprise, surprise," <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> said in an interview. 
"But this was a mutually agreed-upon deal. 
We'll have to let people speculate about why." 

   The ups and downs of their past association were more conspicuous. 
In the days when the pair worked closely at <ORGANIZATION>Texas International</ORGANIZATION>, the predecessor of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> was best man at <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>'s wedding. 
After <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> left to start up <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> with another <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> International alumnus, <PERSON>Gerald Gitner</PERSON>, the two airlines competed in several markets, and both made a run at <ORGANIZATION>Frontier Airlines</ORGANIZATION> last year. 
<PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> won that round, but only to see his faltering empire bought at a cut-rate price by <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, several months later. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON>'s new role at <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> was never outwardly apparent. 
He was named executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>February</DATE>, and a board member of <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>. 
But his name was notably absent from a list of top management in company stock prospectuses last month. 
Even stranger was the sale of stock of <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> -- which many took as a clue that he was among the tight circle of executives who run <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>. 
Jet Capital, a financial holding company controlled by <PERSON>Mr. Lorenzo</PERSON>, holds a class of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> stock that controls appointments to three-quarters of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> board. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> claims there were never plans for him at <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> in the long term. 
He said the Jet Capital stock sale was part of his "incentive package" negotiated last fall. 
He received no severance package, and even laughed at the idea. 
"No golden parachute," he said. 
<PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> said he has paid about <MONEY>$125,000</MONEY>, a one-quarter down payment on the Jet Capital stock, and isn't certain whether he will keep the stock. 

   Now that the operations of <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> have been merged into those of <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION>, he said it was the proper time to leave. 
The poor service in the initial combined operations lived up to <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>'s old nickname: "People Distress." 
The combined People and <ORGANIZATION>Continental</ORGANIZATION> operations resembled People's final days -- mountains of lost bags and dozens of canceled flights, but <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> says they have improved greatly since. 

   "I don't feel like we did as good as we could have, but it could have been a . . . lot worse," <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> said. 
He said he is satisfied because no <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> employees lost jobs in the merger, though many incurred financial losses after borrowing from <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> to buy <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> stock. 

   He won't discuss his plans, beyond writing a book about his experiences at <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>, the cult-like company in which all employees were "managers," and to whom <PERSON>Mr. Burr</PERSON> would often give inspirational speeches via video screens. 
"There was some powerful learning in those strong early years," he said, "and I learned from the mistakes in the later years." 

   He hinted that perhaps that experience won't be for naught. 
"Some people are saying there's only going to be six major airlines," he said. 
"I certainly don't think it's going to be the case. 
We'll have to wait and see."

<HEAD>North Tactic Revives Old Debate: Can A President Be Forced To Testify?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The effort by <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> to compel President
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to testify at his Iran-Contra trial
has renewed a debate, almost as old as the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>, over ``executive
privilege.''
   Can a president, or a former one, be forced to testify in a legal
case? Courts have provided little guidance, but constitutional
experts said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>North</ORGANIZATION>'s legal tactic may succeed.
   No sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal
trial, but several have provided testimony or what might be
considered the equivalent.
   The personal stakes are high for North. The former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
aide is charged with theft, conspiracy to defraud the government and
several other felonies in the case involving the support of
Nicaraguan rebels with money from the sale of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.
   His trial is scheduled to begin <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE> _ just 11 days after <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
is to succeed <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>. Besides <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, subpoenas also have
been issued for other key figures in the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration,
including Secretary of State <PERSON>George P. Shultz</PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION> officials.
   The man who first tried to force a president to testify was <PERSON>Aaron
Burr</PERSON>, a former vice president who stood trial in <DATE>1807</DATE> on charges of
treason.
   Burr sought to force <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>, the president under whom
he had served, to testify at the trial.
   Jefferson resisted. But Chief Justice <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON>, presiding
over the trial, ruled against <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON>. The president eventually
avoided having to appear by releasing some information <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> had
sought.
   The closest the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has come to ruling on the issue
presented by <ORGANIZATION>North</ORGANIZATION>'s subpoena came in the <LOCATION>Watergate</LOCATION> tapes decision
of <DATE>1974</DATE>, in a case called <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> vs. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
   The court then ruled, 8-0, that President <PERSON>Richard M. Nixon</PERSON> had to
comply with a special prosecutor's subpoena seeking the surrender of
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> tape recordings.
   ``The general assertion of privilege must yield to the
demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal
trial,'' the high court ruled 15 years ago.
   <PERSON>Jerome Barron</PERSON>, a law professor at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION>
here, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the <DATE>1974</DATE> decision is a strong precedent for North.
   ``Whether <PERSON>Mr. Reagan</PERSON> or <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON> can be subpoenaed was resolved
in <LOCATION>Nixon vs. U.S.</LOCATION>, and the answer is yes,'' <PERSON>Barron</PERSON> said.
   ``If the evidence (sought by North) is material, I think <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> can be required to appear,'' <PERSON>Barron</PERSON> said.
   On the other hand, unnamed <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> sources were quoted
by <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> as saying that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> vs. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> offers support
for fighting subpoenas of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. They said the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme
Court</ORGANIZATION> emphasized that its Watergate-tapes decision did not deal with
a claim of privilege based on national security grounds.
   <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department and White House</ORGANIZATION> officials have said they will
try to have the subpoenas thrown out.
   <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Brand</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lawyer who once served as general
counsel to the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>North</ORGANIZATION> may succeed.
   ``My sense is North has a good claim. The president was involved
in the process, and one of <LOCATION>North</LOCATION>'s defenses is that he was serving
the president by following orders,'' Brand said.
   In <DATE>1975</DATE>, then-President <PERSON>Gerald R. Ford</PERSON> gave a videotaped
deposition in the trial of <PERSON>Lynette</PERSON> ``Squeaky'' <PERSON>Fromme</PERSON>, who was
convicted of trying to assassinate <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. The videotape was played
for jurors at <ORGANIZATION>Fromme</ORGANIZATION>'s trial.
   While in office, President <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> provided videotaped
testimony in two criminal prosecutions.

   A gunman described in a pyschological
examination as unlikely to harm his ex-wife burst into her house
early <DATE>Friday</DATE> and killed her, their two daughters and her new
husband before killing himself.
   Neighbors identified the man, who left a note telling his
parents he was ``sorry for what he had to do,'' as <PERSON>Ronald Richard
Burris</PERSON>, 46.
   The others, all shot to death, included his ex-wife, <PERSON>Shirley Mae
Woody</PERSON>, 41, the couple's daughters, <PERSON>Vicki Marie Burris</PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON>Anne
Marie Burris</PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON>Shirley Woody</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Robert James Woody</PERSON>,
31.
   It was one of three murder-suicides reported around the nation
on <DATE>Friday</DATE> in which 12 people died.
   In <LOCATION>Belleville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, a man identified as 48-year-old <PERSON>Kurt
Steibel</PERSON> shot and killed his wife, daughter and 1-year-old grandson,
then shot at firefighters before committing suicide by re-entering
his burning home, authorities said.
   After firefighters recovered <PERSON>Steibel</PERSON>'s body, they found the
bodies of his wife, <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON>, and his daughter <PERSON>Cindy Townley</PERSON>, whose
ages were unavailable, and his grandson, <PERSON>Eric Townley</PERSON>. X-rays
showed that they had been shot to death. Police said they hadn't
determined a motive.
   In <LOCATION>Buxton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.D.</LOCATION>, authorities said farmer <PERSON>Wayne Nygaard</PERSON>, 42,
apparently shot his wife, <PERSON>Carol</PERSON>, 40, and their 11-year-old
daughter, <PERSON>Kate</PERSON>, before turning the gun on himself. The bodies were
found by the couple's 17-year-old son; authorities did not cite a
motive.
   In the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state case, authorities said <PERSON>Burris</PERSON> was armed
with a handgun and a shotgun.
   ``We have seasoned firefighters who were disturbed at what they
found,'' Fire District Capt. <PERSON>Bruce Carpenter</PERSON> said of the scene.
   ``We don't know for sure why he did it, except here you have an
ex-husband and a divorce that wasn't the nicest in the world,''
<PERSON>Curt Benson</PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Pierce County Sheriff's Department</ORGANIZATION>,
said as he stood on the rainswept, tree-lined street outside the
home.
   Divorce and child custody and support records, along with a <DATE>1988</DATE>
court order barring <PERSON>Burris</PERSON> from contact with his ex-family, show a
19-year marriage that broke up in <DATE>1987</DATE> after <PERSON>Shirley Burris</PERSON> accused
her husband of sexually molesting their daughters.
   The accusation, investigated by state child protective workers,
did not result in criminal charges against <PERSON>Burris</PERSON>, according to
records on file at the <ORGANIZATION>Peirce County Clerk</ORGANIZATION>'s office in nearby
<LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Burris</PERSON>, who was a civilian logistics supply official at nearby
<ORGANIZATION>McChord Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, denied the allegations in the divorce and
custody papers, calling them ``a wilfull and malevolent'' charge.
   His ex-wife later called him ``so anti-mother that the girls
resent it.'' That comment was made in a sworn statement used to
uphold a <DATE>February 1988</DATE> restraining order barring <PERSON>Burris</PERSON> from
contact with his daughters and living within two miles of his
ex-wife's home.
   A psychological examination in <DATE>September 1988</DATE> found that if
<PERSON>Burris</PERSON> was ``seriously inclined to do her harm, he would already
have done so,'' according to custody dispute records. Burris
submitted to the exam as a condition for getting the restraint
order lifted.
   <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> said <PERSON>Burris</PERSON> awoke his victims when he smashed through a
sliding glass door at the rear of the house and shot <PERSON>Woody</PERSON> in the
couple's bedroom as he called sheriff's deputies to report the
break-in.
   When deputies arrived minutes later, at about <TIME>5:12 a.m. PST</TIME>,
they found <PERSON>Burris</PERSON>' body in the living room where he had committed
suicide, <PERSON>Benson</PERSON> said.
   ``We then went into the master bedroom. We found a husband and
wife on the floor. Both died of apparent gunshot wounds.''
   Anne, 6, was found dead in her bedroom, and a 14-year-old <PERSON>Vicki</PERSON>
was shot in the doorway to her room, he said.
   Principals at the schools the girls attended said they had told
their pupils of the deaths and brought in psychologists to counsel
the children.

<TEXT>
   History is repeating itself rather quickly in
the demand by <PERSON>Oliver North</PERSON> that former President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> come from
his home in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to testify for North at his criminal trial.
   There was a gap of 167 years between the time <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>
was subpoenaed and the <DATE>1974</DATE> summons to <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, by then an
ex-president. Less than 15 years passed before the subpoena for
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>.
   During the <DATE>1974</DATE> Watergate cover-up trial, former aide <PERSON>John D.
Ehrlichman</PERSON> almost succeeded in his request for <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s appearance.
It would have happened, too, had the former president not fallen
critically ill following surgery.
   ``I would have loved to have <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in court, I had a few
questions I wanted to ask him myself,'' <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge John J.
Sirica</PERSON> wrote in his memoirs.
   But at the time, a team of court-appointed doctors determined
that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> would be in no condition to travel for some time, which
would have delayed the trial. ``I ruled reluctantly,'' <PERSON>Sirica</PERSON>
remembered of his decision that the former president would not have
to appear. ``I did feel that no matter how anxious many of us were
to see <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> face the lawyers and testify under oath, having him in
court was not really critical to <PERSON>Ehrlichman</PERSON>'s defense.''
   Had he gone on the witness stand, <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> would have been the
first ex-president to do so under subpoena. That dubious
distinction will fall to <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> if <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District <PERSON>Judge Gerhard
Gesell</PERSON> accedes to <LOCATION>North</LOCATION>'s request.
   The debate whether a president must obey subpoenas and other
court orders dates to the beginning of the republic, and it is just
as volatile today as it was then.
   President <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> received a subpoena in <DATE>1807</DATE> demanding
that he turn over a letter sought by defense lawyers in the treason
case against <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON>'s first vice president.
   Burr wanted <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> to appear in court and testify about the
letter written to the president by one of <ORGANIZATION>Burr</ORGANIZATION>'s alleged
co-conspirators. Chief Justice <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON>, presiding over the
trial, declared that the president unlike a king was subject to law.
   Jefferson cited the independence of the executive branch of
government from the judicial branch and refused, at first, to
release the letter. Eventually, he turned it over but made clear
that his decision was voluntary and not in response to the subpoena.
   From then until Watergate, the concept of executive privilege
was never tested. No sitting president ever has testified in court
in a criminal trial, although several have provided testimony or
what might be considered an equivalent.
   It is not difficult to see why North's lawyers want <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> to
testify. Defense attorney <PERSON>Brendan Sullivan</PERSON> has attempted to show,
in his cross examination of prosecution witnesses, that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was
much more involved in the secret aid to the Contra rebels than was
known publicly before.
   The jury heard that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> personally approved an
NSC-recommended deal in <DATE>1985</DATE> to give Honduras <MONEY>$110 million</MONEY> in
covert economic and military aid as an inducement to support the
Contras.
   The jury also heard that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> apparently approved a plan from
North and others in the government to airdrop intelligence data and
recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose of destroying
ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government.
   Those actions all were at a time when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
military aid to the Contras.
   The closest the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has come to ruling on so-called
executive privilege was in the <LOCATION>Watergate</LOCATION> tapes case of <DATE>1974</DATE>. The
special prosecutor had subpoenaed the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> for tapes of 64
conversation and <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> didn't want to give them up.
   In the case called <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> v. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> the court ruled unanimously
that <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> had to comply with the subpoena. The specific need for
evidence in a criminal case, the court said, outweighed the
president's rights in the matter.
   In <DATE>1975</DATE>, President <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON> gave a videotaped deposition as a
defense witness in the trial of <PERSON>Lynette</PERSON> (Squeaky) <PERSON>Fromme</PERSON> who was
convicted of attempting to assassinate <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for the
administration tried unsuccessfully to have the court accept a
written statement by the president. The videotape was played in
court.
   <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>, too, as president, gave videotaped testimony _
twice. Once was as a government witness in the perjury and gambling
trial of a <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> state senator. The second time he taped
testimony for a federal grand jury that was investigating
allegations that fugitive financier <PERSON>Robert Vesco</PERSON> sought to bribe
members of the <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> administration.
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was served with the subpoena while he was still
president, along with then-Vice President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>. Both men sought to
quash the subpoenas.
   Attorney General <PERSON>Dick Thornburgh</PERSON> argued in a <DATE>Jan. 13</DATE> court
filing that the summonses ``raise profound constitutional concerns
... regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by
a former or sitting president.''
   He added that ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president
being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign
governments in the way they deal with the president now and in the
future.''
   On the day before the North trial started, <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> ruled the
defendant had not shown that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had ``relevant and material''
testimony to give and squashed the subpoena against the new
president.
   But <PERSON>Gesell</PERSON> left the decision on <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> open. He'll probably make
it this week when the defense starts presentation of its case.

<LEADPARA>  Police and prosecutors' "dream" would have been to see longtime Black Panther
nemesis Huey Newton stoop so low as to be killed while trying to rip off a
crack cocaine dealer, but that's not the way it happened, the man prosecuting
Newton's alleged murderer told jurors Tuesday.;   In a fiery second day of
closing arguments in the trial of Tyrone Robinson, Alameda County Deputy
District Attorney Ken Burr lashed out at insinuations by Robinson's attorney
that police were engaged in a "great, big conspiracy" to frame Robinson for
murder.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's ironic because 20 years ago, that's the defense <PERSON>Huey P. Newton</PERSON> used"
when he beat charges that he murdered <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> police officer <PERSON>John Frey</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
said.;   <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON>Alfons Wagner</PERSON> accused <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> police and prosecutors
of "fast and loose playing with witnesses" who escaped criminal charges
themselves while giving investigators statements that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> murdered <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>
on a <LOCATION>West Oakland</LOCATION> street to gain status in the Black Guerrilla Family prison
gang.;   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 27, an admitted crack dealer who has spent most of his
adult life behind bars, contends he shot <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> three times after <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> fired
at him first.;   <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said authorities are seeking a murder conviction
rather than believing <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s self defense claim because they don't want
the public to think they are being lenient toward the man responsible for
their nemesis' death.;   In this case, authorities "kiss off anything (pending
against witnesses) because the prosecution was going to look good in the
prosecution of the guy who killed <PERSON>Huey Newton</PERSON> in this town of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>
told the jury.;   But prosecutor <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> responded that the conspiracy theory was
fanciful and he told the jury he personally resented it.;   "It implies I am
doing something improper, and illegal, and immoral," <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.;   <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>
contends that the prosecution's key witness, <PERSON>Brian Keith Walton</PERSON>, lied in
stating he saw <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> shoot <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> first while <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>'s hands were in the
air and then twice more through the head as he lay on the ground. <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, a
friend of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s who died last year in an apparently unrelated drug-house
shooting, was facing an auto theft charge at the time he gave his taped
statement to investigators.;   During the trial, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> also presented a
string of witnesses to talk about violent incidents in <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>'s past,
including the killing of <ORGANIZATION>Frey</ORGANIZATION> -- in which a manslaughter conviction against
<ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> was overturned -- and two other killings in which <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> was
implicated. The evidence was shown to demonstrate a lifelong propensity for
violence in support of <ORGANIZATION>Robinson</ORGANIZATION>'s contention that <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was armed, even
though police found no gun near <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>'s body.;   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> acknowledged that
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was a thorn in the side of local law enforcement for more than two
decades, a radical leader who "had a way of pulling law enforcement's chain, a
way of kind of rubbing law enforcement's noses in it." Most importantly, he
got away with <PERSON>Frey</PERSON>'s murder, in the eyes of <ORGANIZATION>Frey</ORGANIZATION>'s fellow <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> police
officers.;   "What better epitaph could the <ORGANIZATION>Oakland Police Department</ORGANIZATION> write
than that . . . he's fallen so low he was killed trying to rip off a crack
dealer," <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said. "That sings.";   But in defending the investigation, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
said, the evidence showed <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> executed a defenseless <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> in the
"stupid" belief he'd "become somebody on the mean streets of <LOCATION>West Oakland</LOCATION>.";  
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON> is expected to complete his statements to the jury today.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> businessman was the paid
informant who in <DATE>1964</DATE> led the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> to the graves of three slain
civil rights workers, according to records of a defunct
segregationist state agency.
   <PERSON>Olen Burrage</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, received <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> from the
<ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> for this information,'' records from the <ORGANIZATION>Sovereignty Commission</ORGANIZATION>
show. The records quote their own informant.
   Burrage, however, denied that he had anything to do with the
killings.
   A federal judge last week ordered the records of the commission,
which tried to thwart civil rights groups in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
be opened to the public. The judge later stayed his ruling pending
an appeal.
   Portions of the records are included in the personal papers of
former Gov. <PERSON>Paul B. Johnson Jr</PERSON>. The complete records are in the
archives of the <ORGANIZATION>McCain Graduate Library</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Southern Mississippi</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Hattiesburg</LOCATION>. Portions were made available
to The Clarion-Ledger in an agreement with the attorney general.
   Burrage told the newspaper <DATE>Monday</DATE> that he had nothing to do with
the killings of <PERSON>James Chaney</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andrew Goodman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Schwerner</PERSON>.
He also denied that the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> paid him for information.
   Burrage's attorney, <PERSON>Robert Thomas</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, said his
client was tried on federal charges of conspiracy to violate the
civil rights of the three men in <DATE>1967</DATE> and acquitted.
   ``Hey, look, you can write whatever you want to,'' <PERSON>Burrage</PERSON> said
in a telephone interview with the <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> Clarion-Ledger. ``I
didn't have nothing to do with it. I'm not going to have anything
to do with it now.
   ``I've been harassed for years and years on this mess. I don't
even want to talk to you about it,'' he said.
   Commission investigator <PERSON>A.L. Hopkins</PERSON>' search for the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>
informant is contained in the commission's records. Hopkins is dead.
   <PERSON>Hopkins</PERSON> wrote a report on his investigation <DATE>Aug. 6, 1964</DATE>, two
days after the three bodies were found in a grave at the base of a
pond dam under construction on <PERSON>Burrage</PERSON>'s land southwest of
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.
   ``I have information from a confidential source ... that <PERSON>Mr.
Olen Burrage</PERSON>, a white male who owns the property where the bodies
were found, and who operates a truck line out of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, is the informant who directed the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> to the spot,''
<PERSON>Hopkins</PERSON> said in the report.
   <PERSON>Joe Sullivan</PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent in charge of the <LOCATION>Neshoba
County</LOCATION> investigation, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that <PERSON>Burrage</PERSON> never received money
for information.
   ``I didn't pay any money to anybody,'' <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said in an
interview from his <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> home. ``I certainly don't know
anything about it.''
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said a freelance writer working on the case during the
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three had
offered a reward of <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> for information leading to the bodies.
   ``That was the genesis of all the talk up there,'' <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>
said. ``I think he was affluent enough he could have paid the
reward.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> file shows an informant led agents to the dam, but
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> refused to identify the individual. ``I have never named
anybody, and I don't want to.''
   The commission was created by the <LOCATION>Mississippi Legislature</LOCATION> on
<DATE>March 22, 1956</DATE>, to preserve segregation in the state. The
commission became inactive in <DATE>1973</DATE> when then-Gov. Bill <PERSON>Waller</PERSON>
vetoed its funding. The Legislature abolished the commission and
ordered its files sealed for 50 years in <DATE>1977</DATE>.

<LEADPARA>  Amid all the testimony about Huey P. Newton's violent past, the man accused of
murdering the Black Panther Party leader has "become a forgotten man" at his
own trial, a prosecutor reminded jurors Tuesday.;   Urging the jury to focus
on Tyrone Robinson and find the admitted petty drug dealer guilty of murder,
Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Ken Burr said Robinson's claim of self
defense "does not make sense" given the pattern of three bullet wounds to
Newton's head, delivered "as you would to execute somebody."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Shorter version ran on page 8B of the Morning Final edition  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     'Looking for a way out'; In his closing argument, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 27,
is not the bespectacled "yuppie" he appears to be sitting at the defense table
but "an impatient, violent man," tired of the hard life of prison and <LOCATION>West
Oakland</LOCATION> streets and looking for a way to break out.;   The means to that end
was through killing <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>, a crack-using "has-been" hero of <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>'s black
community who used to get drugs simply by declaring "I'm <PERSON>Huey P. Newton</PERSON>," <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
said. To <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, killing <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was a way to gain notoriety in the Black
Guerrilla Family, a prison-based gang, and become a decision maker in its drug
sales network, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.;   Says <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> shot first; <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> has testified
that he shot <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> in the pre-dawn hours on <DATE>Aug. 22, 1989</DATE> after <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> fired
at him first. No gun was found near <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>'s body, and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> contended <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>
concocted that story as well as a string of run-ins he'd allegedly had with
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON> over the years. Although <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> said several people witnessed those
past encounters, he couldn't produce any of them to corroborate his story on
the witness stand.;   "He's making them up as he goes along," <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.;  
Other than his own testimony, much of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s defense consisted of
statements of law enforcement officials and others regarding violent incidents
in <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>'s past in an attempt to lend credibility to the notion <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was
armed and ready to kill. Jurors heard about <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s links to three deaths and
four assaults, although only one assault conviction ever was upheld against
him.;   Key witness attacked; In his own closing argument, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s
attorney, <PERSON>Alfons Wagner</PERSON>, attacked the credibility of the prosecution's key
witness, a <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> friend who testified at a <DATE>1989</DATE> preliminary hearing but who
was killed last year in a drug shooting police said was unrelated to the
<LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> case.;   That witness, <PERSON>Brian Keith Walton</PERSON>, gave investigators taped
statements in which he said he saw <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> fire the final two shots into
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON>'s head as he lay defenseless on the ground. <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> also said <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was
unarmed and that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> told him he killed <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> to earn status in the
Black Guerrilla Family.;   <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> granted immunity; But <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> had
much to gain by telling police investigators -- under pressure to find someone
to prosecute for <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s murder -- a story they wanted to hear. Prosecutors
dropped a pending automobile theft case against <PERSON>Walton</PERSON> and also granted him
immunity from possible charges as an accessory to <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>'s killing because he
hid the gun <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> used.;   "There's been some fast and loose playing with
witnesses in this case," <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said. <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said county law enforcement
officials, after unsuccessfully pursuing <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> on criminal charges for years,
didn't want to be accused "of letting this one slide by.";   Closing arguments
continue today.  </TEXT>

   A river-rafting guide wounded by snipers who
killed one person said he initially thought nothing of the distant
gunfire he heard while taking a couple down the <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``That wasn't unusual,'' <PERSON>Jim Burr</PERSON> said of <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s attack. ``In
the past, it hasn't been a cause of concern.''
   He said hunters and people ``just shooting'' have used the area
before.
   One of <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>'s passengers, <PERSON>Jamie Heffley</PERSON>, also was wounded; <PERSON>Mrs.
Heffley</PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>, was killed while trying to shield her.
   Burr, 36, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that even when they were first fired on,
he didn't think the snipers were seriously trying to hit them.
   ``When I got hit I realized they weren't kidding,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, a guide with the Terlingua-based Far Flung Adventures, was
shot in the thigh. He remained hospitalized in Alpine in stable
condition. <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Eastland</LOCATION>, was in stable condition in an
<LOCATION>Abilene</LOCATION> hospital.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Mexican authorities are searching for the snipers, but
have not made any arrests.
   The three were rafting through the <LOCATION>Colorado Canyon</LOCATION> area when the
snipers opened fire from atop 300-foot bluffs on the Mexican side of
the border.
   ``At the beginning of the incident, after I got shot, I started
hollering at them and running down the river. I'm hollering `There's
no money on the boat. Please don't shoot! No more! No more!''' he
said.
   ``They were hollering something back but in the distance it all
got wadded up. But I think it was Spanish,'' he said.
   ``As far as I can tell, it was totally without motive,'' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
said. ``They didn't steal anything. They didn't come down to the
boat.''

   <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION> and Mexican trackers threaded
their way across 400-foot cliffs <DATE>Monday</DATE> looking for clues left by
snipers who shot at a <ORGANIZATION>Rio Grande</ORGANIZATION> rafting party and killed a man
trying to drag his wounded wife to safety.
   Up to four snipers were believed responsible for the <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
ambush on the river in which the couple's river guide also was
wounded. He and the woman were hospitalized in stable condition
<DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the
high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments
later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their
raft,'' said <PERSON>Mike Cox</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of
Public Safety</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>. ``The woman says it was a nightmare.
   ``There was no provocation or anything. It was just an attack.''
   Cox said it was the second time this year that American tourists
have reported being shot at from the cliffs on <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>'s side of the
<LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>.
   Officials believe between 20 and 30 shots were fired, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
Searchers found 12 shell casings <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on the cliffs in an area
reachable only by boat or helicopter and once notorious for its
marijuana cultivation.
   The three were rafting down the river outside <LOCATION>Big Bend National
Park</LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> when they were fired at about noon
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Guide <PERSON>Jim Burr</PERSON> had led <PERSON>Michael W. Heffley</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON>, of
<LOCATION>Eastland</LOCATION>, down two miles of their planned 12-mile trip in the rented
14-foot inflatable raft when the shooting began.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> thought at least two people were on the bluff but
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he saw four, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Burr was shot in the right thigh, but was able to maneuver the
raft ashore. When the gunfire continued, he and the Heffleys moved
downriver. After they pulled ashore again, <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> was shot
when they got out of the raft, authorities said.
   <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON>, 40, was shot in the back and killed while he tried to
help his wife to safety, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> hid in brush, and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> set out for help
after dark, authorities said. He was spotted by a rancher <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME>.
   When the three failed to arrive at a pickup point <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>,
the rafting company sent another raft to look for them. The rescue
crew found the raft and other equipment with numerous bullet holes,
and contacted authorities.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Border Patrol</ORGANIZATION> and Customs helicopters were sent out early
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> and their crews spotted <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON>'s body near the river after
daybreak, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said. When the helicopters landed, <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> came
out of brush where she had been hiding, he added.
   <PERSON>Steve Harris</PERSON>, co-owner of Far Flung Adventures, said the trio had
started their trip at <ORGANIZATION>Rancherias Creek</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Presidio County</LOCATION> and were
supposed to have gone on to <ORGANIZATION>Grassy Bank</ORGANIZATION>, a 12-mile trip by river but
40 miles by road.
   The attack occurred in a canyon at a point where the river is 50
to 60 yards wide, he said.
   <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON> was a sales manager for <ORGANIZATION>Big State X-Ray</ORGANIZATION>, owned by <PERSON>Wade
Penn</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Chickasha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla</LOCATION>. Penn said he and wife, <PERSON>Dolly</PERSON>, were supposed
to join the Heffleys for the trip to <ORGANIZATION>Big Bend</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> had gone down a couple of weeks ago. He thought it was
such a beautiful area,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Penn</PERSON> said. ``He had taken a motorcycle
trip for a chili cookoff. He thought it was such a pretty area that
he wanted <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON> to see it.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, 36, were hospitalized in stable
condition in <LOCATION>Alpine</LOCATION>, 80 miles from the shooting scene.

   A man who threw his wife to safety just as
a sniper's bullet pierced his back during a rafting trip cried, ``My
God! I'm paralyzed,'' then told her ``I love you'' shortly before he
died, the woman said.
   <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jamie Heffley</PERSON> and their guide, <PERSON>Jim Burr</PERSON>, were rafting
on the <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> near <LOCATION>Big Bend National Park</LOCATION> when they
came under a barrage of sniper fire from atop 300-foot bluffs on the
Mexican side of the river.
   ``He threw me out of the line of fire so he took the bullet,''
<PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> from the <ORGANIZATION>Hendrick Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, where
she was recovering from two gunshot wounds.
   ```My God, I'm paralyzed!''' she recalled him saying. ``And he
said, `I love you.'''
   She said when they were pinned down by the snipers, <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON> asked
her if she was ready to die.
   ``He said, `I'm ready to die,' and asked if I was, and I said
`yes,''' said <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Eastland</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON>, 32, was shot in the left side and left shoulder.
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, 36, suffered a shotgun wound to the right thigh. Burr also
remained hospitalized.
   <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON>, 40, was killed after one of the snipers shot him in the
back with a .30-30 rifle, police said.
   ``I really consider him to be a hero,'' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said. ``He was
shielding her in a very exposed area. He gave up his life for her.''
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Mexican authorities have been searching for the
attackers, but have not made any arrests.
   Just before coming under attack, the three noticed a campfire and
heard some gunfire, but did not believe they were in danger. They
came under fire as the raft came into a clearing, <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> said.
   ``We just all looked at each other in horror,'' she said.
   At one point <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON> attempted to reason with their attackers,
yelling offers of money to spare their lives. However, she said,
this only seemed to antagonize them.
   ``There was a period there when I actually sat down and calmly
thought, `This is it. I'm not going to get out of here,''' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.
   ``It's the scaredest I've ever been. It's certainly the closest
I've ever come to dying.''
   After her husband was shot, <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> was all alone. Burr had
left for help and she had to survive the <TIME>night</TIME>.
   ``I covered myself in 3 to 4 inches of sod _ anything to
camouflage myself,'' she said. ``I sat in one place for an eternity.
It was cold _ 34 to 35 degrees. I was shaking uncontrollably.
   ``All night long I just prayed to God,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> said. ``If
He kept me alive for this long, somebody was going to save me.''
   She was pulled out by rescuers in helicopters.

<TEXT>
   Five ranch workers were charged <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in
the slayings of more than 40 wild horses and burros, in a continuing
federal investigation into the killings of at least 10 times that
many animals.
   The workers are charged with violating the Wild and Free Roaming
Horse and Burro Act, a misdemeanor punishable by one year in prison
and a fine of <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY>, said Assistant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Attorney Will Mattly.
   A federal grand jury returned indictments <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> naming <PERSON>David
Morehead</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shannon Brennan</PERSON> of <PERSON>Lovelock</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eugene John Thacker</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Winnemucca</LOCATION> and <PERSON>David Thacker</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Ronald Emory Hage of Cosgrave</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Mattly</PERSON> said.
   The indictments were handed up <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, sealed under a judge's
order so the defendants would not know they had been charged until
they were in custody.
   Mattly He said all but Hage were in custody and Hage was expected
to surrender. The four in custody were held under <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> bail.
   Morehead is charged with seven counts of killing a wild horse or
burro from <DATE>May 15 through June 1988</DATE> and one count of selling a
mustang and a burro to a livestock yard last <DATE>February</DATE>.
   He and <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> are charged in two other counts with killing 28
wild horses and two wild colts in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>; <PERSON>Eugene</PERSON> and <PERSON>David
Thacker</PERSON> and Hage face five counts each for killing five wild horses
in <DATE>August 1987</DATE>.
   Mattly said the killings were in <LOCATION>Lander</LOCATION> and Pershing counties,
where more than 500 mustangs have been found dead since <DATE>last August</DATE>.
Most of the animals had been shot.
   Mattly gave no motives for the killings and would not say how the
five men were tracked down except to credit ``an extensive
investigation on the part of the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> law
enforcement staff.''
   Bureau spokesman <PERSON>Bob Stewart</PERSON> said agents ``have very heavily
investigated since it was first brought to our attention last
<DATE>August</DATE>. We have interviewed over 200 people and done extensive
on-ground investigation.''
   <PERSON>Maxine Shane</PERSON>, public affairs specialist with the <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION>, said the
bureau considered the case to be far from ended.

<LEADPARA>  The continuing redevelopment of downtown Campbell, the search for an
acceptable use for the former Winchester Drive-in site, and the establishment
of fire protection service priorities are key issues that will command the
attention of new Mayor Donald R. Burr in the coming year.;   "There are a lot
of issues, but no big problems that I'm aware of," said Burr, Campbell's
police chief for 17 years until his retirement in 1987. "Like all cities,
Campbell is stressed financially and we have to be very select about how we
invest our money."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  West Extra  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NEW MAYOR ASSESSES ISSUES IN CAMPBELL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Of paramount importance, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said, will be how the city spends money from
the sale of bonds through the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Redevelopment Agency.</ORGANIZATION>;   The city
council has already approved residential development in the downtown intended
not only to provide needed housing, but also to create a population to support
downtown businesses. <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said the city now needs to attract other developers
to complete the redevelopment master plan.;   The downtown beautification
project, including the return of two-way traffic on <LOCATION>East Campbell Avenue</LOCATION>, is
set to begin early next year and is an important element in the redevelopment
effort.;   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> added that while downtown redevelopment is important, the
council is aware "there are other areas in the city that we can't ignore.";  
A top priority for the council will be determining <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s future fire
protection needs. The council has ordered a fire protection services master
plan to be completed next year. One of the options to be studied is the
consolidation of the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Fire Department</ORGANIZATION> with the county's <ORGANIZATION>Central Fire
Protection District</ORGANIZATION>, for greater efficiency. <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he would support
consolidation if the study overwhelmingly recommends it. "I'm open-minded and
I will rely on the study.";   The mayor also said he favors commercial
development of the Winchester Drive-in site, the largest remaining piece of
undeveloped land in the city. But he also said the recent decision by city
staff to withdraw a development application for the site, in the face of
opposition from many residents and businesses concerned about traffic, was
correct because the issue will require a lot more study.;   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, 57, vowed
communication will be the theme of his mayoral tenure and that he will make
himself available to all segments of the community. "People are going to have
questions and I'll be available to talk to any of them," he said.;   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
joined the <ORGANIZATION>Campbell Police Department</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1956</DATE> and served for 31 years, rising
through the ranks from patrolman to chief.;   He won his council seat in <DATE>1988</DATE>,
after the death of longtime Councilman <PERSON>Ralph P. Doetsch Sr.</PERSON>;   Each <DATE>November</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s five council members choose a new mayor and vice mayor. Along with
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON> last week, <PERSON>Barbara D. Conant</PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Monroe Middle School</ORGANIZATION> in the
<ORGANIZATION>Campbell Union School District</ORGANIZATION>, was elected vice mayor. Conant is the second
woman in city history to win that post.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Police Arrest Two Suspects in Sniper Attack on Rio Grande Boaters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARFA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have arrested two Mexican teen-agers
and were seeking two others in a sniper attack that killed one
person and wounded two others rafting down the <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>.
   Presidio County Sheriff <PERSON>Rick Thompson</PERSON> said the assailants
apparently began shooting at the victims on a whim.
   ``We have no motive for the shootings,'' he said. ``They saw them
coming down the river and decided to shoot at them.''
   Both suspects gave statements, but <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> declined to discuss
their statements further.
   Police arrested <PERSON>Eduardo Pineda Rodriguez</PERSON>, 17, on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at his
parents home near <LOCATION>Redford</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said. Rodriguez is a Mexican
citizen but a legal resident of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Rodriguez</PERSON> and a 16-year-old boy, whose name was withheld because
of his age, were charged in the <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> shooting death of <PERSON>Michael
Heffley</PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION>Eastland</LOCATION>. They also were suspected of wounding
<PERSON>Heffley</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Jamie</PERSON>, 32, and rafting guide, <PERSON>Jim Burr</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>
said.
   The 16-year-old was arrested by <LOCATION>Chihuahua</LOCATION> state judicial police
in <LOCATION>Ojinaga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said. Police were seeking two other
teen-age suspects, both of whom were believed to be in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>.
   Under international law, a person standing in one country who
fatally shoots a person in another country can be tried in either
nation.
   The attackers opened fire on the trio as they floated on the <LOCATION>Rio
Grande</LOCATION> through the <LOCATION>Colorado Canyon</LOCATION>, about 22 miles east of <ORGANIZATION>Redford</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said their assailants stalked them from a
300-foot-high canyon rim on the Mexican side of the river, which is
about 75 feet wide, as they abandoned their bullet-riddled raft and
scrambled up the river bank.
   Shortly after the attack, <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> recalled that her husband
``threw me out of the line of fire so he took the bullet.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> was shot in the left side and left shoulder. <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>,
36, suffered a shotgun wound to the right thigh. <PERSON>Heffley</PERSON> was killed
after he was shot in the back with a .30-30 rifle, police said.
   ``I really consider him to be a hero,'' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said. ``He was
shielding her in a very exposed area. He gave up his life for her.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Heffley</PERSON> said she was pleased to hear of the arrests.
   ``I'm glad that they are being caught and I think this incident
should be made a public example,'' she said. ``I think they should
be executed, because if they are not, relations will never get
better across the border. Nobody should have to go through this kind
of torture.''

<LEADPARA>  Huey P. Newton always beat the most serious criminal charges brought against
him, but there was no one to rise to his defense Monday when jurors heard from
witnesses to the two killings he was accused of committing in 1967 and 1974.; 
 As the posthumous trial of Huey Newton continued in the case of the man
accused of murdering him, a prosecutor who spent a good portion of his career
trying to put Newton behind bars also testified that Newton "had gotten away
with what was a very serious crime against society" by avoiding prison in the
1967 killing of Oakland police officer John Frey.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The defense attorney for <PERSON>Tyrone Robinson</PERSON>, 27, a drug dealer who admitted
shooting <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> on a <LOCATION>West Oakland</LOCATION> street corner <DATE>Aug. 22, 1989</DATE>, is putting
<ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s life on trial to show the late <ORGANIZATION>Black Panther Party</ORGANIZATION> leader was a
violent man capable of shooting at <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> first, as <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> contends. The
prosecution contends <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was unarmed and <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> "executed" him.;  
Retired <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> police officer <PERSON>Herbert Heanes</PERSON> testified about the <DATE>October 1967</DATE>
shooting in which both he and <PERSON>Frey</PERSON> were shot in an altercation with <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>.
Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, but the verdict was later
overturned on appeal and two attempts to retry <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> ended in mistrials.
Newton contended he fired in self-defense.;   Also testifying <DATE>Monday</DATE> was
<PERSON>Raphaelle Square</PERSON>, a former prostitute who said she was with <PERSON>Kathleen Smith</PERSON> the
night in <DATE>August 1974</DATE> she was shot and killed on <LOCATION>San Pablo Avenue.</LOCATION>;   Square,
who was then known as <ORGANIZATION>Crystal Grey</ORGANIZATION>, said she saw <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> get out of a <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln
Mark IV</ORGANIZATION> and pull out a gun. After running away and returning, she said, she
heard a gunshot and saw <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> "standing over" <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and "laughing at me" as
Square tried to reach her fallen friend.;   <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> fled to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> after <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>
was killed, but he returned to face the murder charge in <DATE>1977</DATE>. Two trials in
the case ended in hung juries after <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> denied being at the scene.;   <PERSON>Tom
Orloff</PERSON>, who prosecuted <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> case and now is <LOCATION>Alameda County</LOCATION>'s
second-ranking prosecutor, testified that <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> "on occasion . . . was a very
violent person.";   <PERSON>Ken Burr</PERSON>, the deputy district attorney prosecuting
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, did not cross-examine either Square or Heanes.;   From his boss,
<PERSON>Orloff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> elicited testimony that an <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> journalist who testified last
week that <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> once admitted killing <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> never took that information to
authorities. Burr is attempting to discredit the journalist's testimony, even
though <PERSON>Orloff</PERSON> and other fellow prosecutors believe <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> committed the
crime.;   At a hearing with the jury out of the courtroom last week, Superior
Court <PERSON>Judge Alfred A. Delucchi</PERSON> expressed his concern that all the testimony
about <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>'s past amounted to "trashing the victim" in order to give the
jury the impression that <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> "was such a bad guy he deserved to die.";  
But <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said the defense had a right to present such evidence and did not
object to the testimony being presented. The defense expects to rest its case
today.  </TEXT>

   The Trouble With Veeps

   Though presidential-primary results have yet to register,
it's a sure bet that politicians are already scheming and
cajoling behind the scenes in the hopes of landing the No. 2
spot on the 1992 ticket -- the Republican one, too. This
alone shows how far the much-maligned vice presidency has
come since Daniel Webster, in spurning the Whig nomination in
1848, explained: "I do not propose to be buried until I am
dead."
   Following John C. Calhoun, who was elected the seventh
vice president in 1825, no vice president was nominated to a
second term by a party convention until James S. Sherman, in
1912. As syndicated columnist Jules Witcover puts it in
"Crapshoot: Rolling the Dice on the Vice Presidency" (Crown,
450 pages, $25), through most of our history, the office was
a "certifiable dead end."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judging by the dreadful bill of particulars <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>
has assembled, this was a good thing. The overwhelming
majority of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> veeps have been dim, crooked, lowly and
loutish. Jefferson's vice president, <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON>, was indicted
for murder and tried for treason. Both of <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>'s
running mates, <PERSON>Schuyler Colfax</PERSON> and <PERSON>Henry Wilson</PERSON>, were
implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandal. <PERSON>Calvin Coolidge</PERSON>
was counting on his veep, <PERSON>Charles Dawes</PERSON>, to break a tie in a
crucial <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> vote -- but <PERSON>Dawes</PERSON> slept through it.
   <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON>'s No. 2, <PERSON>Charles Curtis</PERSON>, was nicknamed
"Egg" for his wheeling and dealing for the poultry industry.
Under <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>, the pro-Soviet <PERSON>Henry Wallace</PERSON> liked
to denounce American businessmen as "midget Hitlers." In a
delicious bit of foreshadowing, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> once said
of <PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON>'s vice president, <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Thomas
Marshall</PERSON>, "If <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> cannot raise men of presidential
caliber, she should at least try to train them to keep
silence when they have not the mental equipment to fit them
for an understanding of what is required."
   But dating from the tenure of <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON>, a scorned vice
president who turned out to be a heroic Cold War leader, the
vice presidency itself has been no joke (the current occupant
notwithstanding). Five of the past nine presidents had first
served as vice presidents, and in six of the past seven
national elections both nominees had first been presidential
understudies. Three -- <PERSON>Truman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gerald Ford</PERSON>
-- rose to the top spot following presidential death or
disgrace.
   The enhanced chance of today's vice president becoming
tomorrow's president has <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON> worried. He sees danger
in the slipshod selection process and the indifference of the
electorate.
   The fact is that advances in medicine and security make
the odds of a president dying or being killed in office
slimmer today than in <DATE>1850</DATE>. As for the vice presidency's
giving candidates a leg up in the race for the presidency,
this is due to television exposure and the ability to raise
money. In other words, it is due to politics; <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>
writes as though vice presidents ascend through black magic.
   Still, it is deplorable that presidential candidates
continue to select running mates with little regard for their
worthiness as successors: <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, for instance,
tapped <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> because he wanted <PERSON>Mike Mansfield</PERSON> to be <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>
majority leader rather than the treacherous LBJ. <PERSON>Richard
Nixon</PERSON> chose candidates who wouldn't outshine him, <PERSON>Spiro Agnew</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Mr. Ford</PERSON>. <PERSON>George McGovern</PERSON>, turned down by his first two
choices and unable to reach the third on the telephone,
picked the eventually discredited <PERSON>Sen. Thomas Eagleton</PERSON> on a
lark, thus ensuring that background checks would be part of
all future selections.
   <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> was no different from the pack in his choice
of <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>. But <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>'s partisanship keeps him from
recognizing this, as he insists against his own evidence that
<PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON> is uniquely unfit for higher office. He gives us
surely the most exhaustive list of <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s gaffes in
print, but his portrait of the man is cursory and flat, and
he has almost nothing to say about <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s substantive
record in the vice presidency, which is more impressive than
most of his predecessors'. (Even the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post has
recognized this, leaving <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON> trailing behind the
Beltway's sluggish conventional wisdom.)
   One does not have to be a fan of <PERSON>Mr. Quayle</PERSON>'s to see that
<PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON>'s huffing and puffing comes down to this: "What
if <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>, feeling his oats and prodded by his right-wing
constituency, brought in more doctrinaire conservatives to
restore the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> Revolution they feel was abandoned by
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>?" Personally, I think it would be pretty wonderful.
   The author is angry that the voters didn't punish <PERSON>Mr. Bush</PERSON>
for his choice. But for better or worse, vice presidents have
hardly ever made a difference one way or the other on
Election Day. To remedy this, <PERSON>Mr. Witcover</PERSON> wants to rob
voters of their right not to care. A new president would
submit his or her vice presidential nominee to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for
confirmation after the election, thereby eliminating
"blatantly political considerations" now impinging on the
choice. The idea that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> could make a decision free of
partisan politics, much less of character assassination, is
one that could only be held by a liberal <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
columnist.

<MEMO>  Shorter version ran P. 2B Morning Final Edition  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Robinson's attorney, <PERSON>Alfons Wagner</PERSON>, said his client will not deny shooting
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON> but will testify he did it after <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> fired a shot at him. No gun was
found near <LOCATION>Newton.</LOCATION>;   The first-degree murder trial promises, in part, to
relive the days of <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Black Panthers</ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said he will
support his defense by showing that <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> had a history of violence.;  
"Whatever else <PERSON>Huey Newton</PERSON> might have been, he was a violent, violent man,"
<PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> told the six-man, six-woman jury.;   The audience at opening statements
in the trial <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Alameda County Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> included former <ORGANIZATION>Black
Panther Party</ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON>David Hilliard</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Seale</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s widow,
<LOCATION>Fredrika.</LOCATION>;   <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON>, the party's former chief of staff, said outside the
courtroom that he found it "pretty strange" to hear an <LOCATION>Alameda County</LOCATION> district
attorney's representative run through the litany of community programs the
party sponsored after that same prosecutor's office spent years trying to put
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON> and other party members behind bars.;   He also said he didn't know
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON>, who once walked into the state Capitol with a rifle, to carry a gun in
the 1980s.;   "We put down the guns for three-piece suits and briefcases a
long time ago," <PERSON>Hilliard</PERSON> said.;   The prosecution and defense agree that
<PERSON>Newton</PERSON>, 47, was "tweaked," or high, on crack cocaine and looking for more
drugs on the morning he died. And both sides agree that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>, 27, was a
petty cocaine seller on the streets of <LOCATION>West Oakland.</LOCATION>;   Prosecutor <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> argued
that <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> "executed" <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>, shooting him once in the jaw and twice
through the brain at close range as he lay on the ground, to gain prominence
in the Black Guerrilla Family prison gang.;   <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> "wanted to be somebody
in the mean streets of <LOCATION>West Oakland</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Huey Newton</PERSON>'s death provided him with
that ticket," <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.;   Moments before shooting <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> told a
friend on the street, "I'm going to kill (<LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>), gonna get me some stripes,"
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said. And shortly after the shooting, according to the prosecutor,
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> boasted to other friends that "I'm going to be in control and you
guys are going to have to do what I tell you because I'm going to be
controlling the streets.";   <ORGANIZATION>Robinson</ORGANIZATION>'s version, which he will give as the
first defense witness, will be substantially different, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> promised.;  
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> will talk about his recollections as a child of Black Panther
Party-sponsored breakfasts, of an uncle who helped deliver clothing for the
party, and how his parents told him "about <PERSON>Huey Newton</PERSON> killing a cop" -- a
charge on which <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> was convicted but which was later overturned.;  
<PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> also will say he had several run-ins with <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> before the shooting,
<PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said, including one in which <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> shot at him as <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> passed in a
car, and another confrontation in which <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> "took off" <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> by stealing
crack cocaine from him at gunpoint.;   Although police never found a gun at
the scene, <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said there was gunshot residue evidence on <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s arms,
indicating he had recently fired a weapon.;   In addition to their perceptions
of <PERSON>Huey Newton</PERSON>, jurors will have to consider the credibility of another dead
man -- <PERSON>Brian Walton</PERSON>, the only witness to the shooting. <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>, an associate of
both <ORGANIZATION>Newton's</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s, died last year but left behind a series of
conflicting statements about what he saw. Much of the prosecution's case is
built around <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s taped statements, which he seemed to recant at times and
support at times at a preliminary hearing in <DATE>1989</DATE>.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in Handicapped Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> today told a lower court to
consider freeing <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> officials from having to continue an
educational program for a blind, severely retarded man after he
turns 22.
   The justices set aside a ruling that required continued state
support, and told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling in
light of their <DATE>June 15</DATE> decision in a <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> case.
   That decision shields states from federal court lawsuits seeking
to enforce a federal law to help handicapped children.
   The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> case involves <PERSON>Clifford Burr</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> who
turned 21 on <DATE>Dec. 30</DATE>. Burr attended, at public expense, a private
school for blind and retarded youngsters until he was 16.
   <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> officials helped pay the cost under the federal
Education of the Handicapped Act, which requires an appropriate free
public education for handicapped individuals up to age 22.
   When the private school closed in <DATE>1984</DATE>, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> was referred to a
state-supported school, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Institute</ORGANIZATION> for the Education of
the Blind.
   That school refused to accept him, saying he needed training in
``life skills'' and was too retarded to have any academic potential.
   A state <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> hearing officer ruled 18 months
after the private school closed that <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> should be admitted. The
institute appealed to the state commissioner of education, who
upheld the decision <DATE>three months later</DATE>.
   Burr was allowed to attend the institute's program for those with
multiple handicaps.
   Kenneth and <PERSON>Betty Burr</PERSON> sued in an attempt to win compensation for
the two years their son was out of school while the case was
reviewed.
   The 2nd <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> ruled in <DATE>December</DATE> that
federal regulations requiring prompt consideration of such cases
were ``grossly violated.''
   ``It is true that a handicapped child does not have a right to
demand public education beyond the age of 21,'' the appeals court
said.
   ``Nevertheless, we believe that <PERSON>Clifford</PERSON> is entitled to a remedy
for a deprivation of the right that the (federal) statute clearly
provided him _ a free appropriate education between the ages of 3
and 21.''
   The case is <PERSON>Sobol vs. Burr</PERSON>, 88-1493.

NEWSWIRE: SEAHAWKS' BURSE FAILS DRUG TEST, OUT 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second-year fullback <PERSON>Tony Burse</PERSON>, trying to earn a spot on the <LOCATION>Seattle Seahawks</LOCATION> 
roster, was suspended for 30 days by the <ORGANIZATION>National Football League</ORGANIZATION> for violating 
the league's substance abuse policy, the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were notified by the league <DATE>Friday</DATE> that <PERSON>Burse</PERSON>, who will not be 
allowed to practice with the team until <DATE>Sept. 6</DATE>, had tested positive for drugs 
in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION>'s mandatory preseason test. It was not known what substance was 
found in the test. 
</P>
<P>
Coach <PERSON>Chuck Knox</PERSON> refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Morning News Tribune</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tacoma</LOCATION> said the league told the Seahawks that <PERSON>Burse</PERSON> 
was a "Step Two" violator, meaning it was the second time he had failed a test 
since NFL Commissioner <PERSON>Pete Rozelle</PERSON> implemented his drug plan last year. A 
30-day suspension is mandatory for second-time violators. 
</P>
<P>
If <PERSON>Burse</PERSON> failed a third test, he would be banned from football for an 
indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
Burse failed one test during training camp last year. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Burse</PERSON>, 24, has not practiced with the Seahawks since suffering an ankle injury 
during practice <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. He did not play in the team's 16-10 overtime victory 
over <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tempe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 220-pound <PERSON>Burse</PERSON>, from <ORGANIZATION>Middle Tennessee State</ORGANIZATION>, was a 12th-round 
draft pick of the Seahawks in <DATE>1987</DATE>. He made <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>'s roster for the <DATE>1987</DATE> 
season and played in 12 games, mainly on special teams, but was cut during the 
<DATE>1988</DATE> exhibition season. He also tested positive for drugs for the first time 
during that period.

<DATELINE>KINGMAN, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slaughter of wild burros in the
foothills of the <LOCATION>Black Mountains</LOCATION> has revived the controversy over
their place in the delicate desert environment.
   One or more sharpshooters killed 51 of the animals recently,
about one-third of a herd in a remote area 15 miles southwest of
here in northwestern <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Their bodies were found during the
week of <DATE>April 16-20</DATE>.
   Investigators said most were killed by a shot to the head, with
small-caliber rifles fired from 100 to 300 yards away.
   ``It was done by a professional, there is no doubt,'' said <PERSON>Karen
Sussman</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>International Society</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Protection
of Mustangs</ORGANIZATION> and Burros. ``The shooting was indiscriminate _ they
shot mares about to give birth, young foals, adult burros, all of
them.''
   Her organization is offering <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the killers.
   Burros are not native to <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> but are descended from
pack animals abandoned or lost by miners. Critics say they compete
with both native species and livestock for space, water and food.
Wildlife advocates have criticized their effects on endangered
species such as the desert tortoise.
   Until <DATE>1971</DATE>, feral burros and horses were routinely killed by
ranchers and hunters. Then a public outcry resulted in the Wild and
Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.
   They were declared ``living symbols of the historic and pioneer
spirit of the West'' and placed under federal protection. Penalties
for killing them range as high as a <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> fine and a year in jail
per burro killed.
   Ranchers' perspectives on the issue were illustrated by a letter
which the <ORGANIZATION>Mohave Daily Miner</ORGANIZATION> published <DATE>Friday</DATE> from <PERSON>Jennifer
Chambers</PERSON>.
   ``I do not condone the recent method of elimination of the
burro, but I can understand the reasoning behind the action,'' she
wrote.
   ``Burros can be mean, kicking and biting ... (and) are also very
destructive, especially with water sources which in this area are
vital to the lives of wild animals in the desert. Burros will
trample a water hole into a muddy mess and, to put it politely,
relieve themselves, thus rendering the water unfit ... to drink.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Chambers</PERSON> suggested that the environmentalists arrange with
the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bureau of Land Management</ORGANIZATION> to set aside tracts of land for
burros.
   <PERSON>Ms. Sussman</PERSON> ``and her group could pay to feed the burros and
arrange adoptions and save taxpayer funds,'' added <PERSON>Ms. Chambers</PERSON>,
who did not return calls seeking further comment.
   A motive for the killings was unclear.
   ``There has been controversy, some threats against the burros
from different interests up in that area,'' said <PERSON>Anna Maria Adamo</PERSON>,
a <ORGANIZATION>BLM</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   ``But we have carefully controlled the burro herds in this area,
so there would be no conflict with wildlife. And there is no cattle
grazing at all in that area now, so we have no cause to think the
problem is rancher-related,'' she added.
   Officials have estimated there were about 150 burros in the
immediate area of the killings and an additional 450 in the <LOCATION>Black
Mountains</LOCATION>. Some hang around the old mining town of <LOCATION>Oatman</LOCATION>, where
tourists feed them.
   Sources said the carcasses were scattered over an
eight-square-mile area of almost inaccessible terrain.
   ``Given that this area was so remote and that such a large
number of animals was killed, whoever went out there really was
determined to decimate the herd,'' <PERSON>Ms. Adamo</PERSON> said.
   ``This was not just someone off on a lark, sport killing,'' <PERSON>Ms.
Adamo</PERSON> added. ``You know: `I can't find a rabbit to shoot, so I'll
shoot a burro.' This was someone who put a great deal of effort
into getting those animals.''

<HEAD>Striking UAW Local Rejects Chrysler Contract For Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FENTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking <ORGANIZATION>United Auto Workers</ORGANIZATION> at a <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler
Corp.</ORGANIZATION> assembly plant on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> narrowly rejected a new contract,
a week after walking off their jobs, a union official said.
   <PERSON>George Burr</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> Local 110, said the three-year
agreement was rejected by 41 votes, with 1,197 members voting
against it and 1,156 voting for it.
   The suburban <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> plant is the only one producing the
long-wheelbase minivan, said <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Lloyd Northard</PERSON>.
   It was the second vote on the contract, which was worked out
<DATE>last Friday</DATE>, two days after some 3,200 union members walked off
their jobs when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline.
   In a vote <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the contract was rejected by <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> of the
union's rank-and-file amid reports of illegal balloting.
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he thought the contract was rejected <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> because
of union members' concerns about outside contracting and
``outsourcing,'' the practice of shipping out work from the plant
to lower-paid workers.
   Those issues were taken away from Local 110 bargainers by the
international <ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said.
   The vote ``sends a message that the primary concern of the
people on the line and in the plant lies in the outsourcing and
outside contracting arena,'' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said. ``We recognize that this is
a problem.''
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said the local leadership would be meeting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and
would be in contact with the union's national leadership.
   <PERSON>Anthony P. St. John</PERSON>, vice president for human resources at
<ORGANIZATION>Chrysler Motors</ORGANIZATION>, said the company was ``deeply disappointed'' by
the vote because the local union bargaining committee, as well as
<ORGANIZATION>UAW</ORGANIZATION> Region 5 and the international union, had approved the
agreement last <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   ``The result is that the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> plant employees continue to
lose wages, several hundred employees elsewhere at <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> will
remain on layoff, and the corporate-wide profit sharing program for
all employees is affected adversely, as is <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION>'s loss of
revenue resulting from the strike,'' <ORGANIZATION>St. John</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``We are considering the options available to us in this no-win
situation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airline Buccaneer Donald Burr: People Express Founder Ready to Make
A Move</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Donald C. Burr</PERSON> built one of the biggest airlines
from scratch using ultra-cheap fares to draw millions of customers,
only to see his empire collapse <DATE>six years later</DATE>. Now he could be
ready to make a comeback.
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, 47, founder of defunct <ORGANIZATION>People Express Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, has
started to talk to the press after two years of shunning public
view. He has re-emerged at a time when <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, paralyzed
by a strike and in bankruptcy protection from creditors, is
tottering on extinction.
   Could Burr be putting himself forward as a ``white knight''
manager to help rescue <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, or gearing up to start a new
airline to replace it? He's dodging the question, but
circumstantial evidence indicates the answer is yes.
   Burr's formal agreement not to compete against former boss <PERSON>Frank
Lorenzo</PERSON> has just effectively expired. Lorenzo, steely chairman of
<ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp.</ORGANIZATION> which controls <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>, bought a battered <ORGANIZATION>People
Express</ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> in <DATE>September 1986</DATE> for <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY>.
   At its zenith in <DATE>1985</DATE>, <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>N.J.-based People Express</ORGANIZATION> was a
wildly successful product of airline deregulation, offering
discount fares to 150 cities and pulling in more than <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> a
year in revenue.
   ``I'm trying to find a way to reinvent the (airline) product
again,'' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said in an interview.
   Besides lecturing at universities and writing a book about
<ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> during the past two years, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he has
informally looked at a few potential new airline deals.
   Industry sources say he spoke with Lorenzo before the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
strike about the possibility of running the carrier. Burr would
only say that he's had ``conceptual'' talks with the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>
chief. Lorenzo has refused to comment.
   What if the rebellious unions at Miami-based <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> approached
him to help take over or run the airline? ``I'd have to consider
it,'' he said.
   Burr talks with evangelical enthusiasm about the airline
industry, whether he's reminiscing about triumphs and travails of
<ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> or looking forward to the next chapter of
deregulation. It's a talent he's honed on the lecture circuit,
where he commands <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> a speech.
   ``The airlines are on the verge of unprecedented
profitability,'' he said, perched on the edge of a chair at the
<ORGANIZATION>Harvard Club</ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. ``I would love to see the
airline industry evolve toward high-commitment service
organizations.''
   Burr's career path, and life, have been closely intertwined with
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>'s __ he even served as best man at <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s wedding in
<DATE>1972</DATE>. They are only a year apart in age and were both born in <DATE>May</DATE>
under the sign of Taurus, the bull. Yet their personalities seem
poles apart.
   With his boyish good looks and disarming ebullience, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> is a
study in contrasts with the gaunt, fierce-looking <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON>, who has
become a leading target of organized labor because of his avowed
anti-union strategies.
   Burr, born in suburban <LOCATION>South Windsor</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, has been described
by people in the industry as a preppie entrepreneur. Lorenzo, 48,
grew up in tough, street-wise <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   People familiar with the two personalities find it difficult to
imagine <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> working for <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>, which he did twice, and fencing
with him in one of the most brutally competitive businesses of the
<DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   They both attended <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business School</ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> got
his MBA in <DATE>1963</DATE> and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> received his in <DATE>1965</DATE>. Burr then went to
work as a financial analyst for <ORGANIZATION>National Aviation Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
investment company, while <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> was an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Trans World
Airlines Inc.</ORGANIZATION> and later for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>.
   Burr was elected president of <ORGANIZATION>National Aviation</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1971</DATE> _ two
years after <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> created <ORGANIZATION>Jet Capital Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the aircraft leasing
company that was to become the core of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1973</DATE>, after
<PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> acquired ailing <ORGANIZATION>Texas International Airlines</ORGANIZATION>, he recruited
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION>National Aviation</ORGANIZATION> had been an investor in <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>'s
takeover.
   Burr became president of <ORGANIZATION>Texas International</ORGANIZATION>, where he helped
Chairman Lorenzo introduce discount ``Peanut Fares'' that
revolutionized the industry and made the airline the
fastest-growing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> carrier.
   In <DATE>January 1980</DATE>, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> left <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> International to take advantage
of the <DATE>1978</DATE> deregulation of the industry that let airlines set
their own fares and fly where they wished.
   He started his own low-cost airline, <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>, which
created an enormous new market of air travelers with a
pay-on-board, lug-your-own bags approach that made his planes the
Greyhound buses of the sky.
   After a quick takeoff and supersonic growth, <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>
eventually crashed as big competitors undercut <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>'s discount
fares to prevent him from taking away their customers. After it was
sold to what was now <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>September 1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> went back to
work for <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION>, but not for long.
   He is careful not to join the Lorenzo-bashing that has become so
popular. The strongest thing <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> will say about <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> is he's a
``low-cost warhound.''
   Burr says he's too busy thinking about what he calls
``reinventing the product'' to dwell on the past. But as for
whether he's preparing to fill a void created if <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
disappears, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> is evasive.
   ``I'm after the same thing I've been after my whole lifetime,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   A businessman was the informant who led
<ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents in <DATE>1964</DATE> to the graves of three slain civil rights
workers in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>, according to files of the state's
old segregation agency.
   The files naming <PERSON>Olen Burrage</PERSON> were obtained by The
Clarion-Ledger. Its account <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> represented the first time the
tipster who purportedly led agents to the bodies in an earthen dam
has been publicly identified.
   Burrage on <DATE>Monday</DATE> denied any connection with the killings of
<PERSON>James Chaney</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andrew Goodman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Schwerner</PERSON> and denied being
an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> informant.
   ``I didn't have nothing to do with it,'' <PERSON>Burrage</PERSON> told the
Clarion-Ledger. ``I'm not going to have anything to do with it now.
   The state never charged anyone with the murders, which have
become the focus of renewed attention since being dramatized in the
movie ``<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Burning.'' Several men were convicted of civil
rights violations in the case.
   The <DATE>1964</DATE> report to <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>'s now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>Sovereignty
Commission</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Burrage</PERSON>, on whose land the bodies were found, was
paid <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> by the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> to reveal the location of the graves. The
report was prepared by commission investigator <PERSON>A.L. Hopkins</PERSON>, who
has since died, and quotes an anonymous informant.
   <PERSON>Joe Sullivan</PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent in charge of the
investigation, refused to identify the informant who <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> files said
led agents to the bodies. He added in an interview from his <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION> home, ``I didn't pay any money to anybody.''
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said a free-lance writer working on the case during the
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three civil
rights workers had offered a reward of <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> for information
leading to the bodies.
   The commission, created in <DATE>1956</DATE> to preserve segregation, became
inactive in <DATE>1973</DATE> and was disbanded in <DATE>1977</DATE>.
   The Legislature ordered its files sealed for 50 years. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
District <PERSON>Judge William H. Barbour Jr.</PERSON> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> ordered the files
opened to the public, but <PERSON>Barbour</PERSON> stayed his own order pending an
appeal.
   The newspaper said it obtained the report from the personal
papers of the late Gov. <PERSON>Paul B. Johnson Jr</PERSON>.
   Documents that have leaked from the files over the years show
the agency routinely kept files on civil rights activists and
individuals friendly with them.

<LEADPARA>  In an unusual alliance between prosecution and defense, attorneys in the trial
of Huey P. Newton's alleged murderer persuaded a judge Tuesday to allow jurors
to hear details about the numerous times the late Black Panther Party leader

<HEADLINE>  RARE ALLIANCE IN NEWTON TRIAL
ATTORNEYS WANT JURY TO HEAR OF SLAIN BLACK
PANTHER'S ARRESTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The testimony will be part of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s efforts to convince jurors that
<LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> fired first when <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> killed him on a <LOCATION>West Oakland</LOCATION> street <DATE>Aug. 22,
1989</DATE>. No gun was found near <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>, and Deputy District Attorney <PERSON>Ken Burr</PERSON>
contends <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> "executed" Newton.;   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, whose colleagues long sought to
put <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> behind bars but were often frustrated in those attempts, agreed
that testimony about <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>'s past is fair game. With the jury out of the
courtroom, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> even persuaded <PERSON>Judge Alfred A. Delucchi</PERSON> to allow testimony
about <PERSON>Newton</PERSON>'s <DATE>1964</DATE> conviction in a knife attack after the judge had said he
wouldn't allow it. It was the only conviction of <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> for a violent act that
was never overturned.;   "Yes, that type of stuff hurts (the prosecution
case)," <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said, "but at the same time, (<PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>) has got a point.";   In
coming days, the jury will hear <LOCATION>Alameda County</LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON>Charles Plummer</PERSON> talk
about arresting the then 16-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1958</DATE> for hitting someone with a
hammer. <PERSON>Plummer</PERSON> was then a <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> police officer.;   Also now scheduled to
testify will be an officer who witnessed the <DATE>1967</DATE> shooting of an <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>
police officer, a case that resulted in a manslaughter conviction for <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION>
that later was overturned. And <PERSON>Tom Orloff</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Alameda County</LOCATION>'s second-ranking
prosecutor who described <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> as a "gangster" after his death, will be
called to talk about <ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION>'s reputation.;   In testimony <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, jurors
heard from an <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION> man who described an all-night crack cocaine binge with
<ORGANIZATION>Newton</ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> was shot. <PERSON>Willie Payne Jr.</PERSON> described how <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> would run
out of crack, head to the streets and show up again with another collection of
"rocks" to smoke.;   He also testified that <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> said he was going to "take
some dope" -- meaning steal -- from <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> when he headed out of <ORGANIZATION>Payne</ORGANIZATION>'s
house near the shooting scene for the last time.;   <PERSON>Payne</PERSON> said he didn't see
whether <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> had a gun, but <LOCATION>Newton</LOCATION> had talked about killing people who were
rumored to be looking for him for allegedly ripping off drug dealers.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Man Killed, Wife and Guide Shot on Remote Raft Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least two snipers, firing
from Mexican cliffs along the <LOCATION>Rio Grande</LOCATION>, opened fire on three
rafters, killing one and wounding the other two, authorities said
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The river guide walked through thick brush after <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s
attack in southwestern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, and was seen by a farmer when he
reached a highway on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>. A woman who was shot hid in
brush overnight.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Mexican authorities flew over the area in a helicopter
and spotted the dead man's body on the riverbank, said <PERSON>Mike Cox</PERSON>, a
spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of Public Safety</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>.
   Cox said it was the second time this year that American tourists
in the area have reported being shot at from Mexican bluffs.
   Between 20 and 30 shots were fired, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the
area where shell casings were found was remote and reachable only by
boat or helicopter and was once notorious for its marijuana
cultivation.
   The casings were 30-30 caliber, which are used in rifles;
.44-caliber Magnum; and .22-caliber, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``The woman says it was a nightmare,'' Cox said. ``There was no
provocation or anything. It was just an attack. They were just a
married couple who were tourists in the area. The woman believed
that two people were on the bluff. The guide said he saw four.
   ``They were in an area of high bluffs on the river,'' <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
``The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the
high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments
later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their
raft.''
   Guide <PERSON>Jim Burr</PERSON>, 36, had led the raft about two miles downriver
from a remote camp area when the shooting began about noon <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``They were in what is known as <LOCATION>Colorado Canyon</LOCATION> on the American
side of the river in an area about 30 miles east of Presidio,'' Cox
said.
   Burr was shot first, in the right thigh, but managed to get the
raft to shore, where all three got out, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The snipers continued shooting, and the three got back into the
raft and went farther downstream, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``He (Burr) thought he could get to a better point of safety, so
they got back in the raft and hugging closely on the shore
(continued) to get on down the river,'' Cox said.
   As the shots continued, the trio pulled ashore again to seek
shelter in the brush. As they were getting out of the raft, <PERSON>Jamie
Heffley</PERSON> was shot in the left side and left shoulder, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said. Her
husband, <PERSON>Michael W. Heffley</PERSON>, 40, was trying to help her to safety
when he was shot in the back and killed, <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said. The injured were
taken to <ORGANIZATION>Brewster Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alpine</LOCATION>, about 80 miles from
the national park, where night supervisor <PERSON>Joyce Rutledge</PERSON> said <DATE>late
Sunday</DATE> they were in stable condition.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Mexican officials were working together to find the
snipers.
   The Heffleys were from <LOCATION>Eastland</LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION>Abilene</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Burr: Eastern Crisis Raises Specter of Re-Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>People Express
Airlines</ORGANIZATION> says the labor crisis gripping <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Airlines</ORGANIZATION> has raised
the prospect that the government will try to re-regulate the airline
industry that it opened up a decade ago _ a task he says the
government is ill-equipped to handle.
   <PERSON>Donald C. Burr</PERSON>, the founder of <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> and former employee
of <ORGANIZATION>Texas Air Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON>Frank Lorenzo</PERSON>, says the government
already is failing to oversee the industry adequately and would be
unable to do so if it again re-imposed stiff regulations on fares.
   Eastern has been virtually grounded by a two-week-old strike by
its <ORGANIZATION>Machinists</ORGANIZATION> union, which has been supported by most of the
airline's pilots and flight attendants. The near shutdown of its
operations forced the carrier to file for bankruptcy protection from
creditors on <DATE>March 9</DATE>.
   The possible disappearance of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> from the skies and the
temptation for its rivals to hike fares has given rise to public
debate about competition within the industry _ and, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said in an
interview <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, has raised the prospect of re-regulation.
   The federal government deregulated fare competition in the
airline industry in <DATE>1978</DATE>, giving rise to cut-rate carriers such as
<ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, 47, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Business School</ORGANIZATION>, has placed
himself in the public eye again after about two years of shunning
the press and the spotlight. That fueled speculation he could be
putting himself forward as a possible participant in an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
buyout.
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he would ``have to consider it'' if the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> unions
approached him about leading a buyout, but he stressed that is not
his primary intention.
   ``I've been president of three companies; I've already done
that,'' he said. ``I'm after the same things I've been after my
whole lifetime ... I would love to see the airline industry evolve
toward high-commitment service organizations.''
   <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said he has talked about broad concepts with <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> from
time to time before the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> strike that started <DATE>March 4</DATE>.
   Despite <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>'s travails, deregulation on the whole has been
``a stunning success'' that has opened air travel to more Americans,
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON> said. ``It freed the industry to be marketplace-oriented.''
   Burr quit his job as president of <ORGANIZATION>Texas International</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Air</ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, in <DATE>January 1980</DATE> to start up no-frills <ORGANIZATION>People
Express</ORGANIZATION>.
   Spurred by the removal of federal restrictions on fares, the
discount carrier quickly grew, by <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>'s reckoning, into the world's
fifth-largest airline with revenue of about <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> at its peak
in the <DATE>summer of 1985</DATE>.
   People Express eventually was defeated by competitors who were
able to match and undercut its fares _ in addition to offering
full-fare services _ and to offer their own powerful computer
reservations systems, said <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>, who sold <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Texas
Air</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> in <DATE>September 1986</DATE>.
   His faith in deregulation undaunted by the experience, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>
points to <LOCATION>Lorenzo</LOCATION> as the current ``low-cost warhound.''
   If Lorenzo's <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION>Continental Airlines</ORGANIZATION>
fail, ``we would lose the last major low-cost product,'' <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> warned.
   That event also could open the field to a new low-cost carrier _
which some observers say <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> might be inclined to start up.
   He currently is writing a book on <ORGANIZATION>People Express</ORGANIZATION> and lectures at
several universities, including <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts
Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION>. He
says he also has looked at possible new airline deals from time to
time.

<P>
BEANBALL BY TOM SEAVER WITH HERB RESNICOW (WILLIAM MORROW: $16.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gary Dretzka, Dretzka is TV/radio editor for the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, what does a guy do while he's sitting around waiting to be voted into 
baseball's <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame? Well, if that person is 311-game winner <PERSON>Tom Seaver</PERSON>, he 
might try his hand at writing whodunits. 
</P>
<P>
This would seem to be an unlikely career change for most athletes, but <PERSON>Seaver</PERSON>'s 
been successful in many ventures, and he is a personable, informed and 
well-traveled gentleman. That he should take up the novelist's pen, as he has 
the broadcaster's mike, is no great shock. In fact, he's already written a few 
nonfiction books, including "The Art of Pitching" and "How I Would Pitch to 
Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Beanball" co-author <PERSON>Herb Resnicow</PERSON> must be quite a salesman. Not only 
did he convince the great right-hander -- a former member of the Mets, Reds, 
<ORGANIZATION>White Sox</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> -- to join him on the mystery train but, in <DATE>1986</DATE>, he also 
managed to talk <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> of Fame quarterback <PERSON>Fran Tarkenton</PERSON> into adding his name to 
"Murder at the Super Bowl" (PaperJacks: <MONEY>$3.95</MONEY>). He also wrote "The World Cup 
Murder" with soccer great Pele. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to report that <PERSON>Tom Terrific</PERSON>'s mystery is as masterful as his 
pitching, but, alas, it isn't. This has less to do with <PERSON>Seaver</PERSON>'s literary 
prowess, however, than it does with <PERSON>Resnicow</PERSON>'s peculiar sense of how things get 
done in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
In his first such effort, "Murder at the Super Bowl," it wasn't easy to tell 
exactly where <PERSON>Tarkenton</PERSON>'s input ended and <ORGANIZATION>Resnicow</ORGANIZATION>'s began. "Beanball" makes it 
clear where that line is drawn because the books are practically identical: 
same plot, same suspects, same goofy characters, same dilemmas. The difference 
is the sport and the victims: Fran killed off a football coach, <PERSON>Tom</PERSON> ices a 
baseball owner. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Resnicow</PERSON> formula sets forth that a professional sports team based in 
<LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> has just captured its division's championship and, against all odds, 
is pitted against a heavily favored competitor for the overall league 
championship. Sometime before that game, however, an important member of the 
<LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> squad is killed. 
</P>
<P>
Enter <PERSON>Marcus Aurelius Burr</PERSON>, an excruciatingly yuppified sportswriter who really 
wants to become an investigative reporter ("Uncover one major scandal and your 
fortune's made. Books, movies, TV.") Burr always manages to stumble upon the 
murder victim hours before anyone else and, like a true "Front Page" 
journalist, calls his editor before he alerts the police -- which hardly 
endears him to the homicide boys downtown. Seaver's and <PERSON>Tarkenton</PERSON>'s input seems 
to come chiefly in providing sports color and inventing game strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not <PERSON>Travis McGee</PERSON>, but so far, so good. The problem -- and it's a 
huge one -- comes in the fact that <PERSON>Resnicow</PERSON> hasn't the foggiest notion how a 
real newspaper is run, especially as it pertains to the relationship between 
reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
In both books, <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> and his crusty old sports editor gnaw on each other about a 
dozen different things, which isn't all that unusual. What is peculiar, 
however, is that an editor would allow his reporter -- who also triples as a 
columnist, copy editor and photographer -- to become the chief investigator for 
the police and then use his column space to provoke the killer into revealing 
himself. Maybe in <LOCATION>Mayberry</LOCATION>, R.F.D., but not in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It also doesn't help that, in two books, columnist <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> hasn't written a 
paragraph that is remotely interesting to read. <PERSON>Jim Murray</PERSON> he ain't. 
</P>
<P>
In "Beanball," the <PERSON>George Steinbrenner-like</PERSON> owner of the <LOCATION>Brooklyn Bandits</LOCATION> is 
killed by a 90-mile-per-hour fastball thrown at him while he is walking in a 
dark tunnel in his stadium. The suspects include the opposing World Series 
managers, a coach, a trainer, a couple of players and <PERSON>Burr</PERSON> himself. 
</P>
<P>
When <ORGANIZATION>Burr</ORGANIZATION> isn't busy playing detective, he must -- get this -- write a daily 
column, scribble additional sidebars, edit a women's sports section, take 
photographs, defend himself against a sex-discrimination lawsuit, avoid hurled 
hardballs, practice gymnastics and keep his longtime girlfriend from throwing 
him out of their loft. Whew! I guess this explains how only <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> Kent could be 
Superman and a reporter at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness the three-time Cy Young Award-winning <PERSON>Seaver</PERSON> was around to 
construct an entertaining World Series battle to distract the reader from all 
the other silliness. The games and players themselves are interesting, and the 
situations -- while highly unlikely -- are resolved with credibility and humor. 
Tarkenton similarly served <PERSON>Resnicow</PERSON> in "Murder at the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite blunder in "Beanball" occurs every time <PERSON>Resnicow</PERSON> mentions that the 
<LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> "side of the stadium went wild." If pressed, I'm sure <PERSON>Seaver</PERSON> would 
have told him that, in baseball, unlike high school football, a team's fans 
occupy the whole stadium, with a handful of seats set aside for the opponent's 
wives and executives. 
</P>
<P>
A small point, perhaps, but -- compounded by two dozen other, similar groaners 
-- this annoyance made me want to throw the book on the ground and hit it with 
a <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> Slugger.

<PERSON>Perry Mason</PERSON> turned up once again with one of his plodding two-hour vehicles on 
<DATE>March 11</DATE>. If you're a fan of <PERSON>Raymond Burr</PERSON>, you could describe his acting as 
laid back and underplayed. 
</P>
<P>
If not, you could call it stilted, ponderous and boring. Whatever, "The Case of 
the Desperate Deception," which was filmed in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, seemed carelessly done. If 
<PERSON>Burr</PERSON> comes to life at all in this series of movies, it is usually during the 
trial scene. This time out, he couldn't manage that. <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION>'s secretary, <LOCATION>Della</LOCATION>, 
seemed uncaring about her few telephone scenes. And <PERSON>William Moses</PERSON> is no 
substitute for <PERSON>William Katt</PERSON>, who had pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Gargantuan gaffe of the film was <PERSON>Burr</PERSON>'s line (misread, perhaps?): "The 
court-martial begins tomorrow at <TIME>10 a.m. in the morning</TIME>." Can anyone recall 
when 10 a.m. came in the afternoon?

<NOTE>For Release Sun, June 5</NOTE>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Robert Dole.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Vice President <PERSON>Aaron Burr</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton</PERSON> might've
settled it at 50 paces. Dole and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> returned to the campaign.
   High noon on the <ORGANIZATION>Evening News</ORGANIZATION>.
   Dan Rather wanted to talk about Iran-Contra. <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> wanted
to talk about education and the deficit. Rather said he wanted to
set the record straight. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said Rather had impugned his
integrity. Rather said he didn't want to be argumentative, but.
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said it was unfair to judge his whole record by <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and (as
if bringing up a family scandal) ``how would you like it if I
judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the
set?'' Rather said it was more important to discuss <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
qualifications for president than (as if delicately paraphrasing a
profanity) ``what you just referred to.''
   The temperature rose, the pace quickened and soon both were
talking at once and, mercifully, neither could be heard.
   In their traveling debates, the candidates pelted each other,
relentlessly, with marshmallows while audiences coast to coast
wondered if the cavalry would never come. Democrat or Republican,
the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front-runner
since he had the most votes and some might drop loose. Issues were
as hard to find as passion.
   Almost invariably, nobody picked on <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> or the reincarnated
<PERSON>Hart</PERSON> because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other's
non-existent. Jackson, once the voice of protest in the land, took
on the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided the
others when they lost their heads and became adversarial.
   Jackson, of course, couldn't do anything about <PERSON>Dole</PERSON>. On national
<TIME>TV one night</TIME>, <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> of ``lying'' about his record, and
across the land political behaviorists tsked and said wasn't that
shocking?
   Through the <DATE>last century</DATE>, calling presidential candidates liar
was a relatively polite form of discourse. They were also called
traitor, lecher, murderer, thief, drunkard, atheist, pickpocket,
syphilitic, gorilla.
   In the campaign of <DATE>1800</DATE>, <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>' Federalists described
<PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> as a ``mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of
a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> mulatto father ...
raised wholly on hoecake made of coarse-ground Southern corn, bacon
and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.''
   Jefferson's Republicans lashed back by spreading a story that
President <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> was plotting to marry off one of his sons to a
daughter of <PERSON>King George III</PERSON> to begin an American dynasty and revive
royal links with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
   In the politesse of the <DATE>1988</DATE> primary campaign, candidates
grappled more with their image than with each other. Media
consultants and other unfrocked shrinks along the way agreed that
<PERSON>Dole</PERSON>, for example, had to fight a mean streak; <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, a wimp streak.
   Other perceived streaks to be resisted were <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>,
mechanistic; <PERSON>Alexander Haig</PERSON>, militaristic; <PERSON>Pierre Samuel du Pont
IV</PERSON>, rich; <PERSON>Simon</PERSON>, dull; <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>, ``funny facts.''
   They tried various disguises. Dole smiled more. Bush thrashed
Rather. Dukakis danced to bouzouki music. Simon flipped pancakes.
Haig cozied a baby pig. Du <PERSON>Pont</PERSON> said call me <PERSON>Pete</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Biden</PERSON> brought the Democrats odd headlines. <PERSON>Pat
Robertson</PERSON> took care of the Republicans.
   In his autobiography, <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> wrote that God had told him a
minister should not run for public office. Then he announced he
might run for president. Then his book was re-issued, with God's
injunction excised. Then he announced that God was now telling him
to run. No other candidate claimed that endorsement.
   In <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> let it be known that the Russians
still had nuclear missiles in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. Not true, said the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>,
but its source was a satellite only 2,000 miles up. Did <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>
have word from higher authority?
   In <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> said he knew where the American hostages
were held in <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> wondered
aloud why he hadn't shared that information with the government.
   And then <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> put on his cowboy boots, <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> donned his
down-home smile, <PERSON>Mike Dukakis</PERSON> packed up the old folks, <PERSON>Pat
Robertson</PERSON> dusted off the family album and away they went, to Super
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, on a frantic steeplechase across 20 states in which the
corn pone of Dixie was mixed with the slick sell of <PERSON>Madison Avenue</PERSON>
and a handshake was replaced by a greeting from outer space.
   No primary day ever before had demanded so much travel. So
candidates flitted around like nervous fleas on a dog having a
nightmare, and the constant motion, the merciless speechifying, the
pounding TV commercials produced a numbing blur. The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
Post called it Stupor <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Gone were the leisurely ``coffees'' the candidates had with
voters in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. Now they hopped from airport to
airport, saw no voters, talked fast for local TV and were gone
again. Or they holed up in a hotel room and took questions from TV
stations hundreds of miles away and answered via a satellite 22,300
miles above the equator.
   Back on earth and lacking only a magnolia in his ear, <PERSON>Pat
Robertson</PERSON> strode the red clay hills of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> proclaiming,
``I'm the only candidate who was born at <ORGANIZATION>Stonewall Jackson
Hospital</ORGANIZATION>. I'm the only one who went to college where <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>
was president.''
   And to the condos of south <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> they came, to the homes and
the pools of senior citizens who take their franchise seriously.
<PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON> appeared in their living rooms with a glowing TV
benediction from a local hero, Rep. <PERSON>Claude Pepper</PERSON>, 87. Dukakis
showed up with former <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.</PERSON>, 75, who
spoke highly of <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON>' position on Social Security and Medicare.
   Gephardt sent his 80-year-old mother to the condos in person.
Dukakis rallied. He sent his 84-year-old mother and his 79-year-old
father-in-law.
   And the crocuses came and they campaigned in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> and the forsythia came and they campaigned in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and the dogwood came and they campaigned in
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and the azaleas came and they campaigned in
<LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and, each in turn, like the petals of a
flower whose time had come, they fell gently to earth, all but
three.
