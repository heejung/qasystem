<FÊP=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> will pay an 
official visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> shortly. This event is taking place 
nine months after the visit to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by Vietnamese Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>. Here is our comment on the event: 
  The visit to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by Vietnamese Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van 
Kiet</PERSON> in last year is considered a historic event in bilateral 
relations and so it will be the coming visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> by 
Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>. [sentence as heard] 
  These significant events taken place in less than a year 
prove that relations between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have reached 
a turning point in cooperation for mutual benefit. 
  During the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, the relations between the two 
countries have seen wonderful developments. In <DATE>1992</DATE>, the trade 
turnover between the two countries was less than <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> and 
the figure is 120 times now, reaching <MONEY>$252 million</MONEY>. At present, 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is the sixth biggest investor in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> with 23 
projects worth <MONEY>$2.65 billion</MONEY>. However, leaders of the two 
countries will wish to further develop bilateral cooperation, 
especially in trade. These wishes are likely to be achieved. 
  On his visit to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van 
Kiet</PERSON> reaffirmed that the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese Government</ORGANIZATION> welcomes and will 
create favorable conditions for Australian companies wishing to 
do business with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. 
  For his part, the Australian prime minister also affirmed 
that his country is ready to help <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in transport, 
telecommunications, infrastructure, energy, and (?oil and gas) 
exploration. 
  It is expected that there will be new and positive decisions 
made during the coming visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> by the Australian prime 
minister to make the bilateral cooperation and relationship more 
fruitful.

official, friendly visit to the LPDR from 5 to 6 <DATE>April</DATE>. During 
the visit, <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> and his 
delegation were accorded a warm welcome by <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON> and the multiethnic Lao people. <PERSON>H.E. Paul 
Keating</PERSON> and the delegation paid a courtesy call on <PERSON>H.E. Nouhak 
Phoumsavan</PERSON>, president of the LPDR, in an atmosphere of warm 
friendship. It was considered a very significant event in the 
history of good relations between <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
  An official consultative meeting to exchange views between 
<PERSON>H.E. Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON> and <PERSON>H.E. Paul Keating</PERSON> was held at the 
<ORGANIZATION>Prime Minister's Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vientiane</LOCATION> in an atmosphere of 
profound friendship and mutual understanding. During the 
meeting, the two prime ministers informed each other about the 
domestic situation as well as lines and policies in their 
respective countries, the lines and policies which serve as a 
firm basis for effectively strengthening cooperation for the 
benefit of the peoples of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, thus contributing 
to the common trend of establishing and promoting peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries 
in the region and the rest of the world. 
  Noteworthy is that following the consultative meeting, the 
two sides reached an agreement on investment promotion and 
protection between the two countries. This agreement is 
considered an important basis for improving cooperation between 
the Lao and Australian peoples to a new level -- a level which 
will bring about ever greater benefits for the two countries. 
Following the meeting, the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> pledged to 
continue its support and assistance to <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. Regarding this, 
beginning in <DATE>1994</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> will establish a 
47.5 million Australian dollar four-year aid project for <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. 
In addition, the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> has decided to give, 
through the WHO, gratis aid in the form of food worth <MONEY>one 
million Australian dollars</MONEY> to <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. It will also continue to 
support and encourage more and more Australian businessmen to 
invest in the LPDR. 
  During the visit, <PERSON>H.E. Paul Keating</PERSON> also attended the hand 
over ceremony of the <ORGANIZATION>Border Control Station</ORGANIZATION> at the Lao-Thai 
Friendship Bridge, which was built with gratis financial aid 
from the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> and people as a gift to the LPDR. 
The assistance given to the LPDR by the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> 
and people in building the <ORGANIZATION>Border Control Station</ORGANIZATION> as well as the 
Friendship Bridge and other projects in the recent past has 
substantially reflected the long-standing relations of 
friendship between <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, which have fruitfully 
developed with each passing day. 
  The multiethnic Lao people highly assess the effective 
assistance in various fields given by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and consider it 
an important contribution to the development of economic 
infrastructure for the LPDR. The multiethnic Lao people also 
would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of <PERSON>H.E. 
Paul Keating</PERSON> and delegation on their visit to the LPDR, a visit 
which will contribute to further strengthening the already 
effective friendly relations and cooperation between <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> for the benefit of the Lao and Australian people as 
well as in the interests of peace, stability, friendship, and 
cooperation for the development in Asia-Pacific and the rest of 
the world.

  [Text] Dear friends: Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul 
Keating</PERSON> will pay his first official friendship to our country at 
the invitation of Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>. In today's issue, 
NHAN DAN carries an editorial pegged to this event entitled: In 
the Interests of the Vietnamese and Australian Peoples and for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Sake of Peace</ORGANIZATION>, Cooperation, and Development. The editorial 
reads in part as follows: 
  Following the first official visit to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by our prime 
minister in <DATE>May 1993</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> visit by Australian Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> has drawn the attention of broad sections 
of public opinion in the region and other parts of the world. 
This important event marks a new developmental step in the 
friendly and cooperative ties between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> established diplomatic relations in 
<DATE>1973</DATE>. The friendly and cooperative ties between the two 
countries have continued to develop with each passing day since 
then based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual 
understanding, equality, and mutual benefit. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> highly 
valued <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s renovation achievements in all fields as well 
as <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s foreign policy of diversification and 
multilateralization and its efforts to improve relations with 
many countries in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> lifted its trade embargo at an early date and 
resumed its development aid for <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. It has also shared its 
experiences and stepped up cooperation with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. The 
cooperative ties between the two countries have been improved 
step by step. Both sides have worked together toward the goals 
of implementing agreements on economic and trade cooperation, 
thereby creating favorable conditions for increasing the value 
of bilateral trade activities to <MONEY>$70 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1991</DATE> from <MONEY>$2 
million</MONEY> in <DATE>1982</DATE> and to <MONEY>$252 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1992</DATE> and then to <MONEY>$366 
million</MONEY> in <DATE>1993</DATE>. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has become <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s seventh trade 
partner and ranks fifth on the list of foreign investors in 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> with 26 projects valued at <MONEY>$776 million</MONEY>. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has also helped our country with the training of 
hundreds of specialists; the formulation of laws on mining, 
telecommunications, and state management over 
telecommunications; and the enhancement of farmland irrigation, 
hydrometeorological, public health, and tourist sectors in which 
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has a need and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has great potential and high 
technologies. 
  Regarding many regional and international issues, <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have reached more and more consensus on the need for 
peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region 
that the two countries have regarded as the top priority 
objectives of their foreign policies. 
  We hope that Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>'s official 
friendship visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> will end in success, help strengthen 
mutual understanding, and lead the multifaceted cooperation 
between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to a higher level, a larger scale, 
and a broader scope for the sake of each country's prosperity 
and in conformity with the common trends of peace, cooperation, 
and development in the Asia-Pacific region.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, has 
arrived in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> for last stop on an Asian tour which has also 
included <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> is the first Australian 
leader to visit <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>. Tomorrow, he will hold talks with top 
Vietnamese leaders including President Le <PERSON>Duc Anh</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Communist 
Party General Secretary Doi Muoi</ORGANIZATION>, and the Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van 
Kiet</PERSON>. 
  Australian officials say <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> will take a low-key 
approach to human rights issues despite calls for a strong 
statement from Vietnamese Buddhist group and some Australian 
parliamentarians. The officials say they hope Vietnamese 
officials will finalize arrangement for an Australian 
parliamentary human rights delegation to visit <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> later 
this year, but diplomats say the visit will concentrate on 
expanding economic links with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is currently 
the third largest investor in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> taking <MONEY>$620 million</MONEY> 
[currency not further specified], mostly for oil and 
telecommunications projects. Two-way trade last year was worth 
<MONEY>$366 million</MONEY> with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> running up a <MONEY>$136 million</MONEY> surplus 
through crude oil sales to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> has spent his first 
afternoon in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> sightseeing in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>. The formal part of 
the visit will begin in the morning with an official welcome 
before beginning talks with Vietnamese leaders. Graeme Well 
reports <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>'s main purpose in going to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is to 
assess the potential for economic development and what further 
role <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> can play. 
  [Begin recording] [Well] <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> says <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has a 
great opportunity to develop and he believes <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> can help 
make a difference in areas like aid programs, education, social 
policies, and commerce. Responding to a call for him to change 
his itinerary to acknowledge Australians who died in the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
War, <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> said he does not discriminate in commemorating 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s war dead. He repeated comments he made last year at 
the opening of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Memorial in <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Keating</ORGANIZATION> in progress] ...[Words indistinct] same faith in 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the same belief in our values as every other 
service person did in other (?theaters) of the war. But 
again.... This in <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> and, really, in places I am visiting 
there is no natural opportunity as there was in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>. [end

[LPDR] of <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>. He said the visit

and good cooperation between <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
  <PERSON>H.E. Khamtai</PERSON> expressed the hope that his consultative

and exchange of views with his excellency the Australian prime 
minister will enable both sides to understand ever more 
profoundly the internal situation and policies of each country. 
He said the understanding will serve as a firm basis for 
effective enhancement of cooperation for the benefit of the 
peoples of the two countries, and that it will also contribute 
to common trends for the establishment and promotion of peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries 
in the region and the rest of the world. <PERSON>H.E. Khamtai</PERSON> also 
informed his excellency the Australian prime minister about 
certain problems in the socioeconomic development of the LPDR 
which is entering the eighth year of the implementation of 
comprehensive restructuring. He said: Through the

has been progressively developed; the average rate of economic 
growth per year is as high as <PERCENT>6.58 percent</PERCENT>; the prices of 
commodities and the kip currency are stable; the living 
conditions and cultural life of the people have explicitly 
improved; and the assistance and cooperation given to <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> by 
foreign countries and international organizations have also 
increased. There are now as many as 410 direct investment 
projects valued at <MONEY>$580 million</MONEY> by foreign countries in <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, 
excluding investment in large-scale hydroelectric projects. 
  Regarding Lao-Australian relations, <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON> noted that efforts have been made by the two 
countries to promote relations in various fields. He pointed 
out that as of now, bilateral relations between <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have expanded ever more extensively and rapidly. <PERSON>H.E. 
Khamtai</PERSON> expressed gratitude to the Australian Government and 
people for their precious assistance given to the Lao Government 
and people in carrying out the socioeconomic development cause 
in the LPDR, in particular in building the communications 
infrastructure as well as training technicians of various 
branches and in community development. <PERSON>H.E. Khamtai</PERSON> reiterated 
that the LPDR is ready to increase cooperation with <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in 
the economic, cultural, scientific, and technical fields. He 
also expressed the hope that the Australian Government will 
continue to support and encourage more and more Australian 
businessmen to invest in the LPDR. 
  Replying, <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> expressed thanks to 
the 
<ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> and people of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> for the warm welcome accorded him 
and his delegation during the visit. <PERSON>H.E. Keating</PERSON> noted: 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> have maintained diplomatic relations for 
more than 40 years. It can be assured today about the great 
potential of the friendship. We are two different countries 
which have endured similar problems, for example problems in the 
areas of trade and investment, with a view to making our people 
enjoy security and prosperity. The Australian Government 
pledges to support <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> in carrying out its reform to achieve 
development in the same way other countries do. Regarding 
implementation of reform, the LPDR has put into force the law on 
investment, a law which guarantees security for foreign 
investors. Various Australian companies are now ready to invest 
in <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. 
  In conclusion, the Australian prime minister said: We can 
contribute to the construction and development of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, and on 
the basis of this spirit the <ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> has decided 
to render aid to <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> for the construction of this bridge across 
the <LOCATION>Mekong River</LOCATION>. In addition, beginning in <DATE>1994</DATE>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Australian Government</ORGANIZATION> has decided to set up a four-year 
assistance and cooperation project for <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. This project costs 
more than <MONEY>40 million Australian dollars</MONEY>. Besides, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has 
given <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> gratis aid in the form of food worth <MONEY>one million 
Australian dollars</MONEY>, and another <MONEY>one million dollars</MONEY> of gratis 
aid to preserve the environment in the LPDR. 
  The meeting lasted one hour. Later, <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Prime Minister

<FÊP=106> [Editorial from 5 <DATE>April PASASON</DATE>: "Wholeheartedly Salute and </F>
Welcome the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of Australia Government Delegation</ORGANIZATION>"] 
  [Text] In response to an invitation from His Excellency 
[<LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION>] <PERSON>Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON>, prime minister of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], <PERSON>H.E. Paul Keating</PERSON>, prime minister of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of Australia</ORGANIZATION>, will lead a <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of 
Australia Government</ORGANIZATION> delegation on an official, friendly visit 
to the LPDR on 5 <DATE>April</DATE>. The multiethnic Lao people throughout 
the country -- elated at this event, which is significant in 
Lao-Australian relations -- feel greatly honored to have the 
opportunity to welcome the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of Australia Government</ORGANIZATION> 
delegation. 
  This official, friendly visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and his delegation 
follows the official, friendly visit to the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth of 
Australia</ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON>H.E. Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON> in <DATE>mid-December 1993</DATE>. The 
visit is considered a new and significant event since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 
over four decades ago. This visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and his delegation 
reflects the Australian people's good friendship with the 
multiethnic Lao people. It is also considered a very 
significant event in the history of relations between the two 
countries. It will, therefore, serve as a firm basis for 
strengthening friendly relations and cooperation effectively in 
the immediate and long terms in the interest of the peoples of 
<LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, thus contributing to the common trend for 
the establishment and promotion of peace, stability, friendship, 
and cooperation among various countries in this region and the 
rest of the world. 
  Laos and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have maintained good relations for a long 
time. Over the past 10 years or so, the two sides have made 
efforts to promote relations in various fields. It is 
noteworthy that following the visit to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>H.E.</LOCATION> Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON>, Lao-Australian relations have 
developed ever more extensively and rapidly. On this occasion, 
the multiethnic Lao people would like to express their profound 
gratitude to the Australian Government and people for the 
significant support and assistance they have rendered to the Lao 
Government and people in building and developing the LPDR's 
economy and society, especially in building the communications 
infrastructure, training technicians in various branches, and 
developing communities. The assistance in the construction of 
the Friendship Bridge, which serves as a good token of the 
friendly relations and fruitful cooperation between <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, is noteworthy. 
  We wish <PERSON>H.E. Paul Keating</PERSON>, prime minister of the 
Commonwealth 
of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and his party glorious success in this official, 
friendly visit to the LPDR. Its success which will contribute 
to further promoting and expanding relations and cooperation 
between the two countries ever more fruitfully for the benefit 
of the peoples of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.

<FÊP=106> [From the "International report" program] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, is on his 
way home after a three-nation tour of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>'s trip 
took him to <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, and finally <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, where he 
invited the communist party leader, Do Muoi, to visit <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
It's an invitation the Vietnamese leader accepted and this is 
sure to cause unhappiness among some of the Vietnamese who fled 
their country after the communist's victory in <DATE>1975</DATE> and now live 
in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Christopher Kremmer</PERSON> reports from <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Mr. Do 
Muoi</PERSON> will be seen as a more provocative figure than the 
reformist prime minister, <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>, whose presence in 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> last year led to demonstrations by Australian 
Vietnamese. 
  [Begin Kremmer recording] It's the oldest rule of war -- 
both 
sides on two-fronts -- and <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> has broken it. His 
invitation to communist party chief Do Muoi proved alienating an 
important lobby group, which so far has remained relatively 
quiet about his visit to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. The invitation was issued 
during what one official described as unusually long and 
interesting talks between <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> and the 76-year-old party 
leader in <LOCATION>Ho Chi Minh City</LOCATION> yesterday. The <ORGANIZATION>VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY</ORGANIZATION> 
later reported that it has been accepted by Do Muoi with 
pleasure. As the party chief has in recent months been visiting 
neighboring <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> countries, an invitation to come to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> 
was unexpected. Even a reformist leader like Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo 
Van Kiet</PERSON> attracted the wrath of a small section of the 
Vietnamese community when he visited <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> last year. But 
Do Muoi, head of the party which maintains armed [word 
indistinct] party-rule over <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is an entirely different 
matter. He represents to some Australian Vietnamese a painful 
reminder of a war which did so much damage and deprecation to 
their lives. And as <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> [word indistinct], that it was not 
just the allies who were responsible for atrocities in the war. 
Terror was a weapon used by both sides to polarize communities 
and keep villagers on side. A communist party government is 
still accused by <ORGANIZATION>Asia Watch</ORGANIZATION> and other human right and religious 
groups of serious infringements of civil liberties and political 
rights. Above all the right of the people to choose their 
government at free election. As one commentator remarked 
recently a great deal of history stands between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The same could be said of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
The commentator went on to observe that while communism may be 
dead in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, authoritarianism is thriving. That affects the 
relatives of Australian Vietnamese still living here. Do Muoi's 
communist party is seen by some as bearing most responsibility. 
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> has observed that the wounds of war are still deep 
in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, but the wounds are also deeply felt by Vietnamese 
who fled their homeland for <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and many of them are 
unlikely to be impressed by the invitation. [end recording]

delegations during the visit will provide a good opportunity for 
both sides to develop their existing friendship, create better 
understanding, and expand cooperation between the two countries 
in the exploitation of their energy and potentials. The meeting 
will also enable both sides to find ways to enhance their roles 
in increasing the regional dynamic and collaboration. In 
addition, the prime minister expressed his admiration for 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s constructive role in the Southeast Asian and 
Asia-Pacific regions. Australian participation in the opening 
of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge is an historic event that 
reflects a great achievement resulting from international 
cooperation. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is thereby considered to have a role in 
the process of establishing peace and progress in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION>.

all <LOCATION>Indochina</LOCATION>. 
  From either side of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have one 
thing in common, that is to contribute to the construction of

  [Text] <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> VNA <DATE>April 11</DATE> -- Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> 
gave a banquet here this evening in honour of his Australian 
distinguished guests. At this event, he delivered a speech 
which read in part : 
  `It has been only a year since our first meeting in 
<LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION>, 
but we have every reason to be satisfied with the rapid 
development of the multi-sided Vietnam-Australia cooperation, 
especially in the economic, trading, educational and training 
fields. We greatly appreciate <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s active help to us in 
building a North-South 500 KV grid, a nearly-completed important 
project in our national construction. We also highly value the 
effective implementation of the Australian aid to train 
Vietnamese officials, as well as <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s active contribution 
to a break-through in the relations between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and the 
international financial institutions. 
  `I am optimistic about the prospect for the development of 
friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries. 
Despite thousands of miles separating us and the difference in 
historical circumstances and cultural traditions between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, both of us have been looking towards the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> 
and identifying ourselves with the common desire for an expanded 
regional cooperation. 
  `We are satisfied with the results of the open and frank 
exchanges of talks between us today. We are convinced that the 
agreement between us in many fields will contribute to further 
consolidation and development of the on-going fine cooperation 
between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'. 
  Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>, for his part, said: 
  `The effect of the changes you have introduced, combined 
with 
the skill and enterprise of the Vietnamese people, have brought 
this country high levels of economic growth and have opened up 
new opportunities for our bilateral relationship. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, 
too, has been through a process of 'economic renovation'. We 
have opened our industry to competition and our economy to the 
world. 
  `I know, <PERSON>Mr</PERSON> Prime Minister, how difficult the task can be. 
But, like you, I also know how large are the rewards for our 
countries at the end of the process. 
  `And, like <LOCATION>Vietnam Australia</LOCATION> is also seeking closer links 
with our region not only economically but culturally, 
politically and strategically as well. 
  These parallel interests are creating unprecedented new 
opportunities for us. 
  Trade between <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE> was <MONEY>2 million 
dollars</MONEY>. In <DATE>1993</DATE> it was <MONEY>366 million dollars</MONEY>. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is now <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s third largest foreign investor, 
with nearly <MONEY>800 million dollars</MONEY> invested here. 
  We are also developing new avenues for cooperation on 
regional issues. 
  And <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> can count on warm support from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> as you 
move towards greater involvement in regional organisations. 
  Bilaterally, we are finding new opportunities to work 
together. 
  `I was also pleased to be able to tell you <DATE>today</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Prime 
Minister</PERSON>, that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> has committed more than <MONEY>200 million 
dollars</MONEY> in a new four-year aid program, which we hope will cover 
areas such as education, health, infrastructure and legal 
training.

  [Excerpt] <LOCATION>Vientiane</LOCATION> -- Visiting Australian Prime Minister 
<PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> yesterday urged <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, a close communist ally of 
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>, to help defuse nuclear tension in the Korean 
peninsular, said Foreign Minister Samsavat Lengsavat. 
  The request was raised during <PERSON>Keating</PERSON>'s talks with his 
Laotian counterpart <PERSON>Khamtai Siphandon</PERSON>. Laos' response, however, 
was cautious. 
  Somsavat said despite the government's policy fostering 
world 
peace and stability, <LOCATION>Vientiane</LOCATION> respected countries' individual 
rights to find solutions to their own problems. 
  "We (<LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>) in fact have good relations. Our 
two countries were the victims of aggression in the past," said 
Somsavat. [passage omitted]

<FÊP=106> [By Kulachada Chaiphiphat] </F>
  [Excerpts] Laotian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Somsavat Lengsavat</PERSON> 
will lead a delegation to <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> soon for talks on the 
maintenance and administration of the Thai-Lao Mittraphap bridge 
across the <LOCATION>Mekong River</LOCATION>, informed sources said. 
  Talks, set tentatively for 8-9 <DATE>February</DATE>, will also focus on 
official preparations far His Majesty the <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s visit to 
<LOCATION>Vientiane</LOCATION> on the eve of the historic <DATE>April 8</DATE> opening. 
  The bridge, financed and built by <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, completes the 
first land link between <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. 
  The opening will be presided over by the <PERSON>King</PERSON> and the 
President of <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Nouhak Phomsavan</PERSON>, in the presence of Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Chuan Likphai</PERSON>, Laotian Prime Minister General <PERSON>Khamtai 
Siphandon</PERSON>, and Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON>. 
  However, the build-up to the handover is being plagued by a 
lack of agreement on the question of boundaries. Visa issues 
have also yet to be settled. [passage omitted] 
  <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> maintains that the boundary on the bridge should be 
drawn at the deepest point of the river, the same line which 
marks the frontier along the <LOCATION>Mekong River</LOCATION> between <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> has argued that the two nations should each have 
jurisdiction over and responsibility for half the bridge, in 
accordance with international practice. This boundary would not 
replace the official frontier. 
  The differences have embarrassed both sides, as such basic 
issues were supposed to have been smoothed over earlier in 
anticipation of the historic inauguration of the "friendship" 
bridge that symbolizes cordial ties between the two neighbors. 
  The sources however said the talks are unlikely to focus on 
measures to facilitate the two-way entry into both sides through 
the bridge.

<ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation</ORGANIZATION>] at <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Merdeka 
Palace</LOCATION> <TIME>this morning</TIME>. Minister-State Secreatary Murdiono briefed 
reporters on the details of the meeting: 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] During the talks, the two leaders 
exchanged views on various issues, including bilateral, 
regional, and international events, as well as events related to 
<ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> after the grouping's meeting in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE>. Several 
points I can tell you are that the two leaders share the view 
that ties between <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> have progressed 
smoothly, while mutual understanding has also been enhanced 
since the two leaders met some time ago. We all know that Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> a few months ago. 
  The two leaders also noted that bilateral trade ties have 
steadily increased and that there are more frequent exchanges of 
visits between the two countries' officials, both at the 
national and regional level. The president pointed out that in 
some Australian states, the Indonesian language has become the 
second language taught in schools. The two leaders also believe 
that relations between businessmen and private citizens should 
be further intensified because, geographically speaking, the two 
countries are indeed close neighbors which share similar views 
and objectives for the future, namely boosting cooperation for 
the progress of both countries. 
  The two leaders also discussed matters relating to <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION>, as 
well as the <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> leaders' meeting on <LOCATION>Blake Island</LOCATION>. They noted 
that follow-up actions have been taken and these will be useful 
for preparations to hold the second <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> summit meeting 
scheduled in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> in <DATE>November</DATE>. The Australian prime 
minister also expressed his desire to extend his assistance to 
make the upcoming <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> meeting successful. That is all I can 
tell you; thank you for your attention. [end recording]

  [Text] During their formal meeting at <ORGANIZATION>Government House</ORGANIZATION> 
today, Prime Minister <PERSON>Chuan Likphai</PERSON> and Australian Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> discussed expanding bilateral trade and 
investment cooperation and promoting free trade practices. 
  Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION>Prime Minister's 
Office</ORGANIZATION>, disclosed that in addition to trade and investment 
policies, the Australian side expressed its desire to use 
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> as an aviation center for <ORGANIZATION>Qantas Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. The Thai 
side asked the Australian delegation to protect Thai products 
which have difficulties when imported to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and those 
products which were once accused of market dumping by asking 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> to use various cautious measures. Aphisit said: 
  [Begin recording] Besides bilateral issues, the two sides 
exchanged views extensively on how to use the multilateral 
cooperation framework to serve the two countries' trade, 
investment, and economic interests. In particular, the two 
sides have recognized the important role of the economic 
cooperation forums such as the <ORGANIZATION>Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION>, and discussed possible ways to further 
expand cooperation in different areas. They discussed the 
possibility of linking economic cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 
Free Trade Area and the economic cooperation zone, the so-called 
CER, of which <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> are members. This issue 
has never been brought up for official discussion previously. 
However, both the Thai and Australian sides agreed that further 
actions must be taken in this regard. <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> itself can bring 
up this matter during <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> meetings, while <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> seeks 
consultations with <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> as well as members of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>AFTA</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> Free Trade Area], and other groupings. Multilateral 
economic cooperation itself is very significant. The two sides 
agreed that it is a framework that can effectively prevent and 
discourage any country from resorting to unilateral trade 
measures which threaten and cause damage to the economies of 
others. Moreover, the stability is also a byproduct of 
multilateral cooperation. Despite the end of the Cold War, the 
two sides deemed it necessary to continue consultations on the 
security issue. [end recording] 
  Speaking to reporters during an interview after the meeting, 
Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON>Suphachai Phanitchaphak</PERSON> disclosed that the 
two sides agreed to turn <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> into a multilateral economic 
cooperation grouping. Suphachai said: 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] We discussed multilateral 
cooperation with <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION>. The Australian side reiterated its 
concern over this issue. It noted that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is 
moving toward multilateral cooperation and that this is the 
right move. A multilateral basis means many countries are 
involved in any agreement. <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> does not want the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> to resort to bilateral actions similar to what it is 
doing with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. Therefore, <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> asks <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> to help to 
build up the strength of <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> was established with 
support from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> politicians and economists who support the 
principle of multilateral trade. They do not want to see <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> 
lay idle for fear that certain elements in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
might turn to practicing trade harassment on a unilateral basis. 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Chuan</PERSON> reaffirmed that <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> has always 
supported and wants to see a strong <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION>. However, he suggested 
that <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> apply <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> agreements as soon as possible and try to 
comply with <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> rules. He also noted that <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> members are not 
equally developed like countries in the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>. This 
issue must also be considered. [end recording]

<FÊP=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>, says he is 
ready to establish full diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> immediately. In a rare interview, <PERSON>Mr. Kiet</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Radio 
Australia</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> correspondent, <PERSON>Christopher Kramer</PERSON>, that 
disputes between the two sides over property and assets left 
over from the <LOCATION>Vietnman</LOCATION> War presented no hurdles to normal ties. 
And the 71-year old Vietnamese leader indicated his willingness 
to stay at the helm of government for another couple of years, 
despite being past retirement age. From <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Christoper Kramer</PERSON> 
filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [<PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>] In his first interview since the 
lifting of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade embargo in <DATE>February</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Kiet</PERSON> spoke 
for almost an hour about regional issues and relations with 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He said the recent visit of 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> had seen a frank exchange of views 
based on friendship, leading to agreement on bilateral and 
regional issues. 
  Regarding the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Kiet</PERSON> said the lifting of the embargo 
had improved the conditions for the continuing search for 
<ORGANIZATION>American MIA</ORGANIZATION>'s and the disputes over property and assets left 
over from the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War presented no obstacles to full 
normalization of relations with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
intends that the normalized relations between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> inevitably will come. We are ready at any point of 
time for that because the normalized relations between the two 
countries are not only in the interests of the two countries but 
also in the interests of the region and the world over. 
  [<PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>] On the domestic situation, <PERSON>Mr. Kiet</PERSON> said the 
elimination of poverty was his government's main priority. But 
asked whether <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> wanted to move toward some form of 
multiparty democracy, he said maintenance of political stability 
was more important. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Looking 
around as well as looking at the situation in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, we 
could see that there is such a lesson. 
  [<PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>] <PERSON>Mr. Kiet</PERSON> did, however, commit the communist party 
to continued political as well as economic reforms. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] We 
clearly see the interrelationship and the mutually supporting 
relationship between the economic reform and the political 
reform -- these two areas are closely linked with each other and 
one gives [word indistinct] for the other. 
  [<PERSON>Kramer</PERSON>] Since <PERSON>Mr. Kiet</PERSON> came to office in <DATE>1992</DATE>, he has 
presided over <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s spectacular return to the world 
community, but on the domestic front he faces a widening gap 
between rich and poor and the daunting task of managing the 
country's transition from communism to free market economy. 
  Along with the president and communist party leader, he is 
widely expected to step down at around the time of the next 
communist party congress late next year or in early <DATE>1996</DATE>. But 
having seen him in action on the tennis court, I can report that 
the prime minister is fighting fit and in no mood to step down. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] If I am 
be able to contribute to the development of the country in line 
with the already identified projects, and if my personal health 
permits me, and if there is a need expressed by the people, then 
I try my best. [end recording]

<FÊP=106> [By <PERSON>Jack Taylor</PERSON>] </F>
  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>SYDNEY</LOCATION>, Feb 15 (AFP) -- <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> Governor <PERSON>Chris 
Patten</PERSON> left a meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> on 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> without winning <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s public endorsement of 
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s drive for greater democracy in the colony. But <PERSON>Patten</PERSON> 
said that since he didn't come to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> seeking <PERSON>Keating</PERSON>'s 
support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was 
delighted with what he described as "an extremely satisfactory 
meeting." 
  Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official 
residence in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> ranged over bilateral trade links, regional 
issues such as the <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Pacific Economic Co-operation (<ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION>) 
group and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s future after the British colony reverts to 
Chinese sovereignty in <DATE>1997</DATE>. <PERSON>Patten</PERSON>, who is on a six-day 
official visit at <PERSON>Keating</PERSON>'s invitation, told reporters his visit 
was aimed primarily at persuading even more Australian 
businesses to use <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> as a springboard to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. [passage 
omitted] 
  <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> has never denied reports that he told Chinese 
Premier 
<PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> <DATE>last June</DATE> that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> did not support 
<PERSON>Patten</PERSON>'s push for greater democracy in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>. "<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is 
not particularly impressed with <PERSON>Patten</PERSON>'s modus operandi or his 
taking an interest in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s political situation so late in 
the peace," <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> reportedly said. 
  However, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON> subsequently told 
parliament that <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> had consistently expressed to both 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> its "support for democratic reform" consistent 
with the terms of the <DATE>1984</DATE> Sino-British declaration paving the 
way for <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s handback in <DATE>1997</DATE>. [passage omitted] 
  An Australian government official said later that the 
meeting 
had focused on the importance of economic links, but he did not 
know if <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> had privately endorsed <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s position. 
  "The Prime Minister underlined the importance to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> 
of 
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s continuing prosperity and stability in the 
transition to Chinese sovereignty in <DATE>1997</DATE>," the official said.

<FÊP=106> [Report by station correspondent] </F>
  [Summary] Dear friends: This morning in the capital city 
of <LOCATION>Phnom Penh</LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and his entourage paid 
a courtesy call on Acting King [title as heard] <PERSON>Chea Sim</PERSON>. Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> was accompanied by <PERSON>Norodum Sirivut</PERSON>, 
Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs 
and international cooperation. Acting <PERSON>King Chea Sim</PERSON> cordially 
received Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and his entourage. He 
expressed his gratitude to the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese Government</ORGANIZATION> for its 
constant efforts to help bring about peace in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>. He was 
convinced that this historic visit by Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> 
will contribute to strengthening the friendship between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> a step further. He briefed Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van 
Kiet</PERSON> on the current situation in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> and informed him that 
<PERSON>King Norodom Sihanouk</PERSON>'s health condition was good and that the 
<ORGANIZATION>King</ORGANIZATION> would return to <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> on 8 <DATE>April</DATE>. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> 
thanked 
the Cambodian leaders for having accorded the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese 
Government</ORGANIZATION> delegation a warm welcome. He assured His <PERSON>Excellency 
Chea Sim</PERSON> of the desire and persistent efforts of the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese 
Government</ORGANIZATION> and people to do all they can to preserve and promote 
friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the 
Kingdom of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>. He expressed his belief that with the 
goodwill and efforts of both sides, these ties will continue to 
be consolidated and developed with each passing day. 
  Afterward, at <DATE>0900</DATE>, Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and First 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Ranariddh</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Second Prime Minister Hun Sen</ORGANIZATION> 
signed the Vienamese-Cambodian joint communique on the 
conclusion of the visit to the <LOCATION>Kingdom</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> by Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON>. The signing ceremony was held at <ORGANIZATION>Chamka 
Mon Palace</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Next, Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON>Nguyen Manh Cam</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Norodom 
Sirivut</PERSON>, Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, signed the agreements on 
cultural, educational, training, and scientific-technological 
cooperation as well as on the establishment of a joint economic, 
cultural, and scientific-technological cooperation committee. 
Vietnamese Trade Minister Le Van Triet and <ORGANIZATION>Cambodian Commerce 
Minister Va Huot</ORGANIZATION> signed the agreements on economic and trade 
cooperation and on goods transit between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and the comrades accompanying him 
left <LOCATION>Phnom Penh</LOCATION> for home <TIME>this morning</TIME>. Seeing the Vietnamese 
delegation off at <LOCATION>Pochentong International Airport</LOCATION> were First 
Minister <PERSON>Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh</PERSON>, Second Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON>, and many other high-ranking <ORGANIZATION>Cambodian 
Government</ORGANIZATION> officials. Also on hand to bid farewell to Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and his entourage were members of the 
diplomatic corps, representatives of international organizations 
in <LOCATION>Phnom Penh</LOCATION>, and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>. 
  Prime Minister <PERSON>Ranariddh</PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON>Hun Sen</PERSON> invited 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> to step on a red-carpeted honorary 
stand as a military band played the national anthems of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Next, the two Cambodian prime ministers accompanied 
Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> as the latter reviewed the guard of 
honor and bade farewell to Cambodian and foreign officials. The 
special plane carrying Prime Minister <PERSON>Vo Van Kiet</PERSON> and the 
comrades accompanying him took off at 1000 sharp. 
  Twenty-four hours is too short for an official friendship 
visit. Yet, thanks to the positive efforts of both sides, this 
visit brought about fine results and opened a new step in the 
development of relations between <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>.

<FÊP=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australian Prime Minister <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> is on his 
way to <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> this afternoon with his eyes firmly set on what 
he calls one of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s most important international 
relationships. The focus on the interests the two countries 
share in the Asia-Pacific means that the Indonesian media 
crackdown is well down on the Keating agenda. <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> is 
under pressure from some Australian lobby groups to take 
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> to task after <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> closed the country's 
three leading weekly news magazines -- TEMPO, EDITOR, and <LOCATION>DETIK</LOCATION>. 
But the prime minister says he'll be using his informal talk 
with President <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> tomorrow to discuss the <ORGANIZATION>APEC</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation</ORGANIZATION>] Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in 
<LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> in <DATE>November</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> told <PERSON>Graeme Dobell</PERSON> that the 
<PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> government's closure of its three leading news magazines 
was a backward step during a period of rapid change: 
  [Begin recording] [<PERSON>Keating</PERSON>] <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> is like many countries 
in the region; it's in a state of constant change where there 
are many imperatives starting to impact on the country: the 
growth imperative and all that brings with it for change, and 
diversity and plurality of opinion. I don't doubt that these 
are pressures which haven't been as evident in bygone days as 
they are now. For our part, <PERSON>Gareth Evans</PERSON> as foreign minister 
has made clear <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s disappointment about the fact that 
these [word indistinct] have been changed. But again, from our 
point of view, I mean there are the same, similar things -- 
there is press control in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and we're still doing trade with 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, there is a fairly tight control of the press in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> 
and we are still doing trade with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>. I think, you know, 
this relationship now has many links to it and it does give us 
the opportunity, I think, to, you know, maintain a working 
relationship despite some of these things which are 
disappointments to us. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Dobell</ORGANIZATION>] Does it symbolize [words indistinct] to put on the 
brakes? Is it a step back from the policy of openness that 
President <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> has been talking about? 
  [<PERSON>Keating</PERSON>] Well, I think it may be that we will witness in 
many countries similar to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> -- such as <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, 
similar to <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> -- that there'll be, you know, (?full) four 
steps forward and one back and four forward and one back and 
then I think we'll see a bit of this. But, there's also strong 
public opinion -- reactions -- about this, where there is any 
crimp on information, wherever it occurs in most places, and I 
understand this to be the case in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> as well. 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Dobell</ORGANIZATION>] One of the comments from <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> has been from the 
head of <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s largest Muslim organization, <PERSON>Abdulraham 
Wahid</PERSON>, who said that he thought you, as a friend, should speak 
to the president on this. Do you have a duty perhaps as a 
friend to speak to <PERSON>Suharto</PERSON> on this? 
  [<PERSON>Keating</PERSON>] <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> is not the international news and media 
plurality policeman. Now, there is a sort of view around that 
because we have a very free press we ought to be arguing for a 
press similar to ours wherever we go. Well, we are an open and 
plural country and that's part of our strength, and we're also 
very forthright. But, you know, I mean I could make my next 
visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. The first item on the agenda I'll put press 
freedom and plurality. We [words indistinct] first agenda item 
no one should choose. [End recording]

<FÊP=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Mission to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>"] </F>
  [Text] After the black comedy of <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>'s mad 
squabble with the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans, readers will be relieved to 
hear that there was a serious purpose to the Prime Minister's 
visit to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and that, by all accounts, 
it went quite well. 
  The excuse for the trip was the opening of the Friendship 
Bridge over the <LOCATION>Mekong River</LOCATION> on the border of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>. 
  The real purpose, however, was to further strengthen 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s relations with two of the most important nations in 
the region. 
  In <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, the political focus naturally has been on the 
Vietnamese part of the trip because <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is the flavour of 
the month, because of the row with the veterans and because this 
is the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister since the war. 
  However, that should not be allowed to overshadow the 
importance of the visit to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>. By far the biggest economy 
on <PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON>'s itinerary, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is also of growing 
strategic and diplomatic importance to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>. 
  Economically, diplomatically and militarily, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is a 
major player in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> and a friendly rival of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION>'s other 
major players, <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION>. 
  For <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, that makes <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> a particularly important 
friend. The Thais' shrewd and predictable diplomacy and their 
distance from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> mean that Australian-Thai relations tend 
to be more stable than our relations with <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>. (Curiously, distance does seem to be an important 
factor; for example, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s human rights lapses seem to 
attract less attention here than <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>'s.) At moments of 
tension between <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>, the Thais 
have interceded on <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s behalf. 
  <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is a longstanding friend and an alternative 
diplomatic and economic "gateway" to the region, always ready to 
accept Australian investment and trade if other countries are 
not so inclined. That, undoubtedly, has a calming effect on 
<LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s relations with its more volatile <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> neighbours. 
  With its well-developed defence forces (including 
significant 
naval forces) and its borders with <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 
is also an important player in the development of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Indo-China</LOCATION>. 
  <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s importance is more strategic than economic. 
  Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long-term 
potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to 
come. 
  Strategically, however, it is of enormous potential 
importance in the region, mainly because of its large and 
well-educated population and its border with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
  The Chinese are paranoid about <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, which is why they 
spent a fortune to support the <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
south-western flank. 
  The central objective of Western policy towards <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> must 
be the country's successful economic and political integration 
into the international community. 
  Vietnam needs massive infusions of capital and technology to 
rebuild and expand its basic infrastructure (which is 
insufficient for even its current needs), to develop its rich 
natural resources and to create employment in labour-intensive 
manufacturing. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Vietnamese Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> is terrified of the kind of 
political instability that has plagued <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, and with 
good reason. <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s young population (the median age is 19) 
means that the labour force is growing at a rate of <MONEY>1 million</MONEY> a 
year. The rationalisation of inefficient State-owned industries 
means that jobs will be scarce for a good while yet. 
  <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s policy is both to contribute to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>'s 
development and to share in it. 
  As aid projects, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON>'s proposed high-profile projects 
-- including a <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> bridge over the <LOCATION>Mekong River</LOCATION> and the 
preservation of <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>'s historic architecture -- sound as 
questionable as the <ORGANIZATION>Hawke Government</ORGANIZATION>'s Friendship Bridge that 
<PERSON>Mr. Keating</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> to open. 
  However, <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> obviously expects the political and 
economic benefits to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> of the projects (in terms of 
goodwill and access of Australian companies to the increasingly 
competitive Vietnamese market) will make up for any shortfall in 
their economic or social value to the Vietnamese people. 
  Of course, other countries are also trying to share in the 
Vietnamese revival. <PERSON>Mr Keating</PERSON> was the sixth leader and the 
14th senior politician to visit <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in a month. 
  For that reason, the importance to the Vietnamese of <PERSON>Mr. 
Keating</PERSON>'s visit and offer of aid should not be overestimated. 
  Nevertheless, they undoubtedly represent a significant, 
positive step in the development of Australian-Vietnamese 
relations.
