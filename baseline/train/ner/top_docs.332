   The Soviets hope to develop an atomic-powered
rocket engine to provide the propulsion for a manned mission to
Mars early in the <DATE>21th century</DATE>, a Russian scientist said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Vasiliy I. Moroz</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Space Research Institute</ORGANIZATION> said
experts in his nation believe that ``a new type of rocket'' will
have to be developed to make a planned 1{-year voyage to and from
Mars.
   <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said Soviet engineers are working on an
``atomic-electric'' rocket engine that would be used to accelerate
a Mars explorer craft once it has been boosted into <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit.
   The Soviet scientist, speaking at a news conference at the 20th
general assembly of the <ORGANIZATION>International Astronomical Union</ORGANIZATION>, declined
to give any details on the atomic-electric rocket, but he said none
of the current chemical rockets used by the Soviets is large enough
for a Mars mission.
   Included in the Soviet fleet of launch rockets is the <LOCATION>Energia</LOCATION>,
the world's largest, but <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said even it is not powerful enough.
   American space scientists long have recognized the need to
develop propulsion systems that did not depend upon the chemical
reaction of fuel and oxidizer. The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> has conducted some research on electric and ion
drive rockets, but the project has never been received money for
development.
   <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said the Soviets are giving the exploration of Mars a high
priority. Two Soviets probes to <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>, a moon of <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, were
launched last month.
   In <DATE>1994</DATE>, he said, the Soviets will send an unmanned craft to
Mars carrying a robot rover that would explore hundreds of miles on
the planet's surface. The rover also would take drill samples and
measurements of the atmosphere.
   The next stage of the program, <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said, is testing in space
new technical elements needed for a manned mission, including the
atomic-electric rocket and a rocket to return to orbit from the
Mars surface. The Soviets also plan a robot craft that would land
on Mars, collect soil samples and then return them to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   A manned Martian mission could be mounted by the year <DATE>2005</DATE> or
<DATE>2010</DATE>, <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said. Preliminary plans call for a six-member crew to
make the voyage in a two-stage craft that would be assembled in
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit, he said.
   Although the Soviets have gathered a great amount of information
about the de-conditioning effects on the human body of longterm
space flight, <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said the Mars mission may use artificial
gravity to keep the crew members healthy.
   Both American and Soviet studies have shown that long exposure
to the weightlessness of space causes the heart to weaken and the
body to lose bone mass.
   <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said the Soviets hope that American scientists and
astronauts will take part in the Mars mission, but even without
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> participation, the Soviets are determined to explore the red
planet.
   Mars has been only partially explored by the American Viking
spacecraft, he said, adding: ``It is our impression that it is time
to return to Mars.''
   Soviet scientists want to search for traces of liquid water on
the Martian surface and still hold out hope that there may be life,
even though Viking found no traces, <PERSON>Moroz</PERSON> said.
   ``You can't give guarantees that life in some form doesn't exist
there now, despite the negative findings of Viking,'' he said.

To Examine Earth
And Explore Mars

<TEXT>
   Astronaut <PERSON>Sally Ride</PERSON>, warning that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has relinquished its leadership in space in crucial areas, urged a detailed examination of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> from orbit and the human exploration of Mars early in the next century. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON>'s long-awaited report represents the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s latest effort to get the beleaguered <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space program back on track following last year's Challenger accident. 
The space shuttle catastrophe made <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s "shortcomings starkly apparent," said <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON>, who will leave the space agency next month to take a post at a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> think tank. 

   The report to <PERSON>James Fletcher</PERSON>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, said that while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pioneered exploration of Mars using unmanned spacecraft, no American spacecraft has visited the planet since <DATE>1976</DATE>. 
By contrast, the Soviets have announced an extensive exploration program using robots. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> also is far behind the Soviets in inhabiting "low-earth orbit" space stations; while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hasn't had a space station since <ORGANIZATION>Skylab</ORGANIZATION> was vacated in <DATE>1974</DATE>, the Soviets have had eight space stations in orbit since the mid-1970s, the report said. 

   In mapping a blueprint for the revitalization of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space effort, <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON> studied four options: 

   --"Mission to Planet Earth," which would use satellites in low-earth orbit, an orbit as far as 350 miles from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, to examine the earth's atmosphere, ocean topography and vegetation. 

   --Exploration of the solar system, which would send unmanned spacecraft to a comet, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Mars for detailed study. 

   --"Moon Output," which would call for a return to the moon by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>, leading eventually to a permanent lunar base for research and observation. 

   --"Humans to Mars," which would aim at landing Americans on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> early in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON>, in evaluating the options, didn't give the space agency explicit advice on how to proceed. 
But she did suggest that the most constructive strategy would be to focus initially on the Earth-observation program, while making plans to return to the moon and eventually to visit Mars. 
At the same time, she urged the agency to "solidly support" unmanned planetary exploration through the next decade. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON> didn't provide cost estimates, but said such programs will have to stay within the fiscal constraints that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will face in coming years. 

   While acknowledging that exploring and settling Mars "should be the ultimate objectives of human exploration," <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON> warned against a "rush headlong toward Mars." 
She added, "We should adopt a strategy to continue an orderly expansion outward from the earth." 

   <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON>'s report may displease those who have urged <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to adopt, with great fanfare, the human inhabitation of Mars as the space agency's next big goal. 
Some believe that only such a glamorous, high-profile project can recapture the public's interest in the space program. 

   But others have argued that the space agency should follow a more gradual approach to future exploration. 
In her report, <PERSON>Ms. Ride</PERSON> seemed to endorse the latter by calling for "a strategy of evolution and natural progression."

   A Soviet space official says <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> may push
back the planned launch date of an unmanned mission to Mars to
incorporate improved technology in both the spacecraft and the
robotic rover that will retrieve samples of the red planet.
   <PERSON>Genrich A. Avanesov</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Space Research Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, told a space conference <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that it may be
in the Soviets' interest to put off the planned <DATE>1994</DATE> mission for
about two years.
   ``Technically we do have the possibility to send a mission by
<DATE>1994</DATE> with a Martian rover, but we're not sure it's worth doing,''
<PERSON>Avanesov</PERSON> said after a presentation to the conference on space
automation and robotics. ``It may be worth doing a more intellectual
mission later.''
   Asked whether funding for the mission was a problem, he said:
``Money is a problem today for us, too.''
   Avanesov emphasized that no official decision has been made on
the timing of the mission.
   Rescheduling the mission would enable the Soviets to use findings
of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> mission to Mars that is planned for <DATE>1993</DATE>. On that mission,
an unmanned probe called the Mars Observer is to take photographs of
Mars' surface while orbiting the planet for about two years.
   The Soviet mission will send a robotic rover to explore the red
planet's surface and return samples of its soil and atmosphere to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Experts in both countries have agreed that unmanned missions to
probe the surface of Mars will be necessary before a manned mission
can be launched, but it will take several years to develop the
necessary automation and robotics.
   ``No research breakthroughs seem to be required, but a great deal
of applied research and technology development and demonstration
will be needed,'' <PERSON>Lew Allen</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said in a paper presented to the conference.
   A Martian rover will need to be able to avoid hazards on the
planet's surface when it lands, negotiate the terrain, preserve soil
and atmospheric samples, and rendezvous with its launcher, he said.
   ``We see that the rover should be an intellectual one,'' with
sophisticated automation, <PERSON>Avanesov</PERSON> said. ``The question of the
autonomy is a very serious one ... and should be specially
considered.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> is considering
a second unmanned mission to the planet to follow the Mars Observer,
<PERSON>Aaron Cohen</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Johnson Space Center</ORGANIZATION>, told the
conference.
   He said a mission could be launched in <DATE>1998</DATE> to land a robotic
rover on the surface of Mars, gather samples of soil, rock and
atmosphere, and return the samples to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in <DATE>2001</DATE>.
   ``The delivery and return phases ... offer many technical and
engineering challenges,'' he said. ``It taxes our automation
capabilities.''
   Soviet plans to explore Mars, culminating with a manned mission
around <DATE>2010</DATE> to <DATE>2015</DATE>, are the top priority of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s space program,
<PERSON>Avanesov</PERSON> said, adding: ``We think this Mars project will give us
broad opportunity for international cooperation.''
   His paper to the conference said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> could work together on certain aspects of a Mars program,
including organization of a joint ground-based network of data
reception, joint data interpretation, creation of a joint data bank
on the Martian atmosphere and other exchanges of information.
   Soviet and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials have met twice this year in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
to exchange information. They also are making plans to fly American
instruments on future Soviet missions and Soviet instruments on
future <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flights.

   Robby, a <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> robot rover vehicle
designed to explore Mars, successfully picked its way along a rocky
dry river bed without human help, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``This is the first time that an autonomous vehicle has ever
navigated rugged terrain using video cameras,'' said <PERSON>Roger Bedard</PERSON>,
planetary rover program manager at the space agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``Robby himself wouldn't go to Mars. He's a
test vehicle.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> called the <DATE>Sept. 13</DATE> test ``a significant milestone'' in
developing a planet-roving, computer-guided vehicle that would
explore Mars to find suitable landing sites for a manned mission to
the red planet.
   It will be about <DATE>1995</DATE> before engineers fully develop rover
technology, and about <DATE>2000</DATE> before one can be built to go to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Bedard</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   During the test, <PERSON>Robby</PERSON> took four hours, 20 minutes to crawl
along a 109-yard course in the rugged <PERSON>Arroyo Seco</PERSON>, a dry river bed
in a canyon next to the laboratory. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> wants a real Mars rover to
travel about 13 miles daily.
   <PERSON>Bedard</PERSON> said engineers told <PERSON>Robby</PERSON> where it was and where it was
supposed to go, but the six-wheeled vehicle used its twin
television cameras and computer to navigate a safe course around
boulders and other obstacles. Other tests were conducted last week.
   Robby is about 15 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall. It was
named after <PERSON>Robby</PERSON> the Robot in ``Forbidden Planet,'' a <DATE>1956</DATE> science
fiction film.
   The robot's television cameras give it stereoscopic vision,
allowing it a three-dimensional look at objects about 6{ feet in
front of it. Robby moves about 6{ feet at a time, then stops to
survey another 6{-foot stretch of terrain before proceeding.
   Robby runs on a battery recharged by an onboard gasoline
generator. A Mars rover would be powered by the radioactive decay
of plutonium, <PERSON>Bedard</PERSON> said.
   The only unmanned rovers to explore another planet were two
Soviet Lunakod vehicles that explored the moon in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>,
<PERSON>Bedard</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> astronauts used a manned vehicle on the moon.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> doesn't yet
have specific plans to put rovers on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bedard</PERSON> said. The Soviets
are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a
<DATE>1994</DATE> mission to Mars.
   During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would
repeatedly rise and settle on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>' surface were tested in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s desert by engineers from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and
the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary Society</ORGANIZATION>, a group that advocates space exploration.
   Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough
terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian
surface at night to take measurements.
   <PERSON>Bedard</PERSON> said rovers can be directed to explore areas of
scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on
prevailing winds.

   WASHINGTON -- A National Academy of Sciences report
proposed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union work closely
together to explore Mars with robots.
   Eugene Levy, who headed the academy report, said he
envisioned a $10 billion project in which the U.S. launched
three "excursions" that would land robotic rovers on Mars as
early as the year 2000, dig for soil samples and return them
to Earth. The U.S. would also set up a series of robotic
weather and seismic stations on Mars. The Soviet Union, he
said, would be expected to launch three similar missions of
its own.

   Exploring Mars has long been the dream of planetary
scientists and government space officials world-wide. But
there is a sharp difference of opinion over whether
astronauts must be part of this exploration. Astronauts have
abilities to explore that machines can't begin to match, but
astronauts drive the costs to mind-numbing levels. For
instance, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
estimates the cost of setting up a manned base on the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON>
and sending astronauts to Mars early next century at about
<MONEY>$500 billion</MONEY> in <DATE>1991</DATE> dollars.
   Any manned exploration of Mars would be preceded by
robots. But <PERSON>Mr. Levy</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>'s
planetary science department, said that robotic missions
should be judged independently. "The overall social and
technological benefits of a robotic Mars exploration are so
large it would be a mistake to forgo them," he said.
   Robotic missions would require exceptionally sophisticated
machinery, computers and communications. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> now is
experimenting with vehicles that use wheels or legs to cross
rough terrain, and have sufficient intelligence to avoid
areas they can't traverse. Mars is so distant that
controllers wouldn't be able to steer the vehicles from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The academy report said that robotic exploration could
best be accomplished by closely planning separate missions
with the Soviets. That way each country's robots could
explore different areas and the findings would be shared,
reducing the overall cost and expanding the scientific return
for both sides. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> also would probably
participate, the report said, but on teams controlled by the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   The report recommended against a joint project with the
Soviets, however, in which the Soviets probably would develop
rockets and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would make the robots. A cooling of
political relations between the countries could doom the
project before it was completed, the report warned. A joint
mission would also deny each participant the ability to fully
develop new technologies, the report said, and lead to
worries about transferring valuable technology to a potential
adversary.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has said it would begin talks with
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and other countries about cooperating in the
exploration of the <LOCATION>Moon</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, but hasn't said what
structure it prefers.
   <PERSON>Mark Craig</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s director of exploration, said he
favored closely related, but separate missions with the
Soviets. "You date before you get married," he said.
   Returning samples from Mars could help settle questions of
whether life ever existed on Mars, and why Mars and Earth
evolved so differently. Scientists have long pondered what's
known as the "Goldilocks paradox" of planetary evolution:
Mars turned out too cold, <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> too hot and Earth just right
for life to develop.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> now is debating which of several unmanned planetary
missions to ask <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to approve for the year beginning
<DATE>Oct. 1, 1996</DATE>, including possible missions to <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is laying the groundwork to send the next
generation of astronauts beyond the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s orbit early in the <DATE>21st
century</DATE>, with missions to Mars and a space station on a Martian moon
among the possibilities.
   In a report released <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> said the nation must make a ``modest investment of
resources'' during the <DATE>1990s</DATE> to prepare the nation for a range of
opportunities in space.
   ``This ability is critical to <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> leadership in
space,'' said the report titled, ``Beyond Earth's Boundaries: Human
Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.''
   The report examined several strategies for exploring the inner
reaches of the solar system, including establishing a manned lunar
observatory, setting up a space station on the Martian moon Phobos
or sending astronauts to the red planet itself early in the next
century.
   The ambitious blueprint addresses President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s directive on
space policy issued last <DATE>January</DATE>. The directive sets as a long-range
goal ``to expand human presence and activity beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit into
the solar system.''
   <PERSON>Frank Martin</PERSON>, assistant administrator of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Office of
Exploration</ORGANIZATION>, said ``there's every indication'' the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration will support that policy.
   The underpinnings of any strategy to send space explorers to the
moon and beyond in the next two decades will be increased <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
funding for development of new technology, life sciences research,
unmanned robotic missions, development of a new fleet of launch
vehicles able to lift heavier loads, and continued commitment to
Space Station Freedom, which is planned for Earth orbit in the
mid-1990s.
   If those conditions are met, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could send
astronauts to Phobos in <DATE>2003</DATE> or to Mars in <DATE>2007</DATE> or establish by <DATE>2005</DATE>
a lunar base from which astronauts could build a Mars outpost in
<DATE>2015</DATE>, said <PERSON>John Aaron</PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Exploration</ORGANIZATION> during
production of the report.
   <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates
for the missions studied in the report. ``We are not talking about
missions that are cheap,'' he said, but ``we think these are
affordable.''
   <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said such missions probably could be accomplished at less
real cost than the Apollo program, which put <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> astronauts on the
moon in <DATE>1969</DATE>. At its height, the Apollo program cost about <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>
of the federal budget annually, which in today's dollars would be
about <MONEY>$25 billion</MONEY>, he said.
   ``You can't do the civil space program on the cheap,'' he said,
noting the nation now spends about <MONEY>$11 billion</MONEY> annually on <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
programs. The fiscal <DATE>1989</DATE> federal budget is about <MONEY>$1.1 trillion</MONEY>.
   ``We're not a poor nation. We can figure out how to do these
things if they're important to us,'' he said, adding that
international cooperation could help support these missions.
   <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> must leap many technological hurdles before it
can accomplish the goal of establishing a permanent human presence
in space, but ``I don't see any show stoppers there.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Project Pathfinder, under whose umbrella much of the
research will be done, gets <MONEY>$40 million</MONEY> this year and the same
amount next year, despite <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s request for <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>. <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>
said annual funding for the program must increase to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>
soon.
   The report focused on four case studies for sending astronauts to
the moon, Phobos and Mars. One scenario would send astronauts to
Phobos and then on to Mars; another would launch astronauts directly
to Mars; a third would establish a manned observatory on the far
side of the moon; and a fourth would use an outpost on the moon as a
stepping stone to Mars.
   Aaron, who is now special assistant to the director at <ORGANIZATION>Johnson
Space Center</ORGANIZATION>, emphasized that the four case studies are not proposed
missions, but rather vehicles for assessing exploration techniques
and validating assumptions.
   A key finding, <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> said, is that a mission to Phobos could
significantly offset the scale and uncertainties of a direct mission
to Mars.
   An Earth-to-Mars mission would require many new technologies,
including advanced propulsion and braking systems, and would require
advanced operations such as in-orbit assembly, long-term storage and
in-orbit transfer of propellant. Much work in the life sciences also
would be needed, and because the mission would last more than 14
months artificial gravity might be needed to maintain the health of
the crew, the report said.
   Phobos is believed to be an asteroid ``captured'' by <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>'
gravity and is thought to contain a substantial amount of water and
carbon-based materials, which could offer potential sources of
rocket fuel that could be tapped for exploratory missions to Mars.
   ``Phobos is an attractive way to go to Mars,'' <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. ``I
would be surprised if Phobos isn't a part of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> going to
Mars.''

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space <DATE>Friday</DATE> to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and the
evolution of our own <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Liftoff is scheduled for <TIME>2:24 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, and six hours later,
<PERSON>Atlantis</PERSON>' five astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in <DATE>1978</DATE>, and <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
the planet,'' said <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the <DATE>1978</DATE> Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from <LOCATION>Atlantis</LOCATION> this year. The <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is
to set forth in <DATE>October</DATE>.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in <DATE>1986</DATE>. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s Venera 1, which scouted Venus in <DATE>1961</DATE>. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has successfully sent five probes to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>,
six to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, four to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, three to <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, and one each to
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. And in <DATE>August</DATE>, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has sent 19 successful spacecraft to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 <DATE>last September</DATE> while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> may represent what
might happen to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

<HEAD>U.S. To Help Soviets Pick Mars Landing Site For Robot Craft</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to help pick a landing site on
Mars for a robot craft that the Soviets will launch in <DATE>1994</DATE>,
American and Soviet scientists announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at a joint news
conference.
   <PERSON>Samuel W. Keller</PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> delegation that has been
negotiating with Soviet scientists, said that the Soviets have
picked four candidate landing sites after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> provided
detailed maps of the Martian surface.
   <PERSON>Keller</PERSON> said the Soviets have now asked for more data and details
on the candidate sites.
   He made the comment at a news conference marking the end of a
week of negotiations between representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> and a delegation representing
the Soviet solar system exploration program. The two groups met to
work out areas of cooperation.
   Academician <PERSON>Valeriy L. Barsukov</PERSON>, head of the Soviet delegation,
said that the four candidate Mars landing sites are all located
within 30 degrees of the equator, but he declined to be more
specific.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> accumulated a vast amount of detailed images and maps of
Mars during Viking spacecraft missions between <DATE>1975</DATE> and <DATE>1980</DATE>. The
Viking program put two craft in orbit of Mars and two on the surface.
   The Soviets plan to launch a spacecraft in <DATE>1994</DATE> that will orbit
Mars and drop a lander that will scoop up soil and return it to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Barsukov</PERSON> said that in picking a landing site the Soviets are
considering such issues as a search for water and life, getting
comprehensive samples of the geology, and gaining insights into the
Martian evolution.
   <PERSON>Keller</PERSON> said other agreements reached during negotiations this
week included:
   _Using the <ORGANIZATION>American Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION> to help track and
communicate with Soviet Mars probes.
   _An exchange of scientific personnel for work on specific
missions.
   _An exchange of data on <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, a planet extensively explored by
both countries. <PERSON>Keller</PERSON> said the U.S.-Soviet studies are being
combined to produce four detailed maps.
   _An exchange of lunar material gathered by the Apollo program for
meteorite material collected by the Soviets.
   _An exchange of scientific instruments for use on planetary
probes.
   <PERSON>Barsukov</PERSON> said that the Soviets feel that a manned Mars landing is
``inevitable'' and that it probably will take place in the middle of
the next century.
   But before a manned mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> is attempted, <PERSON>Barsukov</PERSON> said
there probably will be new manned flights to the moon. He declined
to elaborate.

BUSH'S CALL FOR MISSION TO MARS RECEIVES BROAD SUPPORT FROM SPACE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without spending a nickel, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> won widespread support from dissident 
elements of the space community <DATE>Thursday</DATE> when he committed the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to 
embarking on a megabillion-dollar mission that will test human engineering and 
endurance to the limits. 
</P>
<P>
The manned expedition to Mars that the President endorsed is not simply a 
longer journey than a trip to the moon, which takes only about a day and a 
half. It could cost <MONEY>hundreds of billions of dollars</MONEY> over the next three decades 
and the crew aboard the spacecraft would have to endure enormous risks during a 
voyage that would last between two and three years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those obstacles, leaders within the nation's space community hailed the 
President's proclamation because for the first time in more than a decade the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has a goal in space exploration mandated from the top. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blueprint Remained Dormant 
</P>
<P>
"He has set our sights very clearly," said <PERSON>Thomas O. Paine</PERSON>, head of the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> during the Apollo moon landings 
and the chief architect of a congressionally mandated blueprint for the future 
of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space program -- a blueprint that has remained dormant since it was 
submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said <PERSON>John M. Logsdon</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Space Policy 
Institute</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> and a leading space analyst. "The 
President did exactly the right thing. He gave the kind of overall direction to 
why we are putting humans in space that so many have thought has been lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the President's speech, the nation's space community began 
healing some deep, self-inflicted wounds. Various factions have fought bitterly 
over which projects should get the highest priority, and that lack of unity has 
threatened to undermine congressional support for space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I have not been a chronic admirer of Republican presidents," said 
Caltech planetary scientist <PERSON>Bruce Murray</PERSON>, who directed the <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> during one of its most productive periods. "But <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said this is 
where we ought to go and that (sense of direction) has been the central problem 
since the end of Apollo." 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of other scientists across the country, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> has been pushing 
for years for a manned expedition to Mars. He has consistently criticized plans 
to build a manned, orbiting space station, claiming that the <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> 
project -- which faces stiff opposition in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- is just another piece of 
equipment, not a goal. 
</P>
<P>
That criticism softened considerably <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on the heels of the President's 
speech because the space station, like so many other projects in the space 
program, could play a role in any effort to send astronauts to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Louis Friedman</PERSON>, executive director of the Pasadena-based Planetary Society and 
another outspoken critic of the space station, also eased his position after 
hearing <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s speech. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest criticism of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s statement stemmed from the fact that he did 
not outline the role that other nations would have in a manned expedition to 
Mars, and many believe that only an international program is likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"International really means the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>," noted <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>, because the 
Soviets have the best information about the effects of long-term exposure to 
space. The record -- one year -- is held by a Soviet cosmonaut. 
</P>
<P>
A manned expedition to Mars would be costly, "probably <MONEY>hundreds of billions of 
dollars</MONEY> over a long period of time," but it's "not going to cost much extra 
over the next five years," <PERSON>Logsdon</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed now, <PERSON>Friedman</PERSON> said, is to work out the details on how such a 
mission should be approached. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the projects that would be precursors to a Mars mission are already on 
the drawing boards. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is already developing plans 
for robotic, unmanned missions to Mars that would collect the information 
needed long before a manned expedition could be launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Space Station would serve as the beginning step toward a permanent 
manned presence in space. It would be followed by an "international spaceport" 
where large vehicles could be assembled in space so that they could be launched 
toward Mars without having to burn the fuel necessary to overcome <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s 
gravity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of Mining 
</P>
<P>
A manned laboratory on the moon would allow astronauts to learn how to mine 
materials for permanent facilities, and possibly even extract oxygen and 
hydrogen from the lunar surface to fuel their rocket ships. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all of that could be carried out successfully over the next couple of 
decades, the actual trip to Mars would be filled with such profound challenges 
that it may be beyond human endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years-long trip, the astronauts would be faced with the 
possibility of a meteoroid ripping through their spacecraft, causing rapid 
decompression that would kill them within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A violent storm on the surface of the sun could blast the spacecraft with 
deadly radiation. So the craft would require some sort of storm shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout much of the trip, the craft would be so far from Earth that the 
astronauts would be pretty much on their own. It would take about 30 minutes 
for messages to travel back and forth between the craft and Earth by the time 
the astronauts reached the vicinity of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts would probably have to spend a year there, waiting for Mars to 
reach the right point in its orbit for them to launch themselves back toward 
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And it would take about a year to get back.

   Scientists searching for life on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>
agreed <DATE>Saturday</DATE> that they must be patient and focus on learning

   ``If we're going to find life on Mars, it's not going to be just
sitting around in the dust someplace,'' said <PERSON>John D. Rummel</PERSON>, who
directs life biology research for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We're going to have to find places on Mars that are more
likely to contain life forms than you would find at random,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Rummel</PERSON> was among two dozen scientists from <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> who attended the International
Symposium on the <ORGANIZATION>Biological Exploration of Mars</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Florida State
University</ORGANIZATION>.
   Three speakers cautioned that it was too soon to conduct direct
life experiments on Mars, but <PERSON>Rummel</PERSON> said most of the scientists
agreed the planet should be studied for insights that could lead to
a discovery of life on the planet.
   ``Mars is not considered by many people to be a lifeless
planet,'' <PERSON>Rummel</PERSON> said.
   Ten years ago, the landings on Mars during the Viking missions
detected no signs of life on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, the most Earth-like planet in
the solar system.
   Scientists believe the planet was once more hospitable for the
evolution of life than it is now. Conditions grew harsher,
primarily drier and colder.
   <PERSON>Rummel</PERSON> said some scientists believe that signs of life, either
past or present, might be discovered deeper under the surface, near
heat sources where water might be found.
   The latest data from Mars came from unmanned Soviet missions in
<DATE>1988</DATE>. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> plans to send a spacecraft to orbit Mars in
<DATE>1992</DATE> and the Soviets plan a <DATE>1994</DATE> mission that would land an
unmanned robotic rover vehicle and balloons to explore the planet's
surface.
   On Earth, scientists are studying volcanoes, ocean bottoms,
lakes and rocks in <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION> and Siberian permafrost to see what
kinds of life can survive under Martian-like conditions.
   E. <PERSON>Imre Friedmann</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> researcher who organized the
meeting, said there's a good likelihood that life once existed on
Mars.
   ``You cannot really express it numerically, you cannot quantify
it, but it is certainly good enough to justify serious effort to
verify whether or not this is really the case,'' <PERSON>Friedmann</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>     The <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> plan was scheduled to be presented today to the <ORGANIZATION>National Space
Council</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, which advises the president on space policy.;   
Although the idea of a joint U.S.-Soviet mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> was proposed several
years ago by President <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, planning for the effort never got under way
and each country has been pursuing its own scheme.;    The American version,
endorsed by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> two years ago, includes building a space station
and a lunar base before going to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, at a total cost of up to <MONEY>$540 billion.</MONEY>;
   The cost of the space station plan has been the focus of intense debate in
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted earlier this month to keep funding alive for another
year, rejecting an earlier vote by the appropriations committee to scuttle the
project.;    Thousands of jobs in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and elsewhere hinge on the <MONEY>$30
billion</MONEY> space station plan. <ORGANIZATION>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION>'s largest employer, has estimated it would lose <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> in
space-station-related contracts over the next decade if the plan is scuttled.;
   Critics of the space station plan, however, contend it would rob funds from
other space programs and from social programs for the poor.;    The <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>
plan bypasses both the space station and the moon base in favor of going to
Mars directly.;    Sometime around the year <DATE>2012</DATE>, a series of spacecraft
carrying cargo and crew would be boosted into low Earth orbit aboard the
Soviet Energia rocket, which can carry much heavier loads than anything <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
now has to offer.;    They then would be flung out of orbit like rocks from a
sling for the nine-month journey to Mars.;    When the crew of three men and
three women arrived, they would find apartments and a garage with tracked
exploration vehicles waiting for them, sent up in advance by an unmanned
rocket. They would stay about a year before embarking for the nine-month
journey back.;    The total cost: <MONEY>$60 billion</MONEY>, including several preliminary
unmanned missions to map the Martian surface and explore it with robots.;   
Scrapping the space station -- now estimated to cost up to <MONEY>$120 billion</MONEY> over
its lifetime -- and a <MONEY>$10 billion</MONEY> heavy-lift rocket would save money and more
than 10 years.;    The no-frills mission would also take two steps to protect
the health of the astronauts during their long flight. It would incorporate 22
tons of water and other shielding into the spacecraft to insulate them from
cosmic radiation, which could reach a lethal peak during solar storms.;    And
the craft would rotate four times per minute to provide some artificial
gravity in the hope of avoiding deterioration of the astronauts' hearts, bones
and blood vessels.;    The plan was drafted by graduate students in a <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>
space systems engineering class taught by <PERSON>Bruce Lusignan</PERSON>, professor of
electrical engineering. The <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> team also included a former vice
president of <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION>'s spacecraft engineering division, <PERSON>Emery Reeves</PERSON>; an expert in
robotics, <PERSON>Thomas Binford</PERSON>; and <PERSON>Larry Colin</PERSON>, former chief of the space science
division at NASA/Ames.;    Although it was done as an educational exercise,
<PERSON>Lusignan</PERSON> is scheduled to present it to the <ORGANIZATION>Space Council</ORGANIZATION> at the urging of
scientists who reviewed it.;    <PERSON>Roy Merrill</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Lawrence Livermore</PERSON> software
engineer specializing in robotics who reviewed parts of the plan, said it was
based on conservative, tested technology. "It's definitely a viable way to
tackle the problem," he said.;    <PERSON>Colin</PERSON> said some people are hoping the
<ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> plan could push <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> into taking a mission to Mars more seriously. He
added, "You don't need a space station. You don't need a lunar program. You
can just go to Mars.";    The study was partly funded by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ames Research
Center.</ORGANIZATION>;  <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> team; The Mars exploration plan was drafted by graduate

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> left the first human
footprints on the <DATE>moon two decades ago</DATE>.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
is not too hopeful.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s program when he meets with <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and their
command module pilot, <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, on <DATE>July 20</DATE>, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> won the race to the moon, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON> in <DATE>1969</DATE>
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as <DATE>1976</DATE>, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and a manned
mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said <PERSON>Paine</PERSON>, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until <DATE>Jan. 28, 1986</DATE>, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had gained some hope from President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s endorsement of
a strong space program and from his <DATE>1984</DATE> State of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In <DATE>1985</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, <PERSON>Paine</PERSON> stood in the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> and
gave <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of <ORGANIZATION>Paine</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>1969</DATE> plan.
   Reagan <DATE>two years later</DATE> signed a Presidential Directive on
<ORGANIZATION>National Space Policy</ORGANIZATION> that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit into the solar system.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s policy set in motion a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, headed by
Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> needs a decision from <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has requested <MONEY>$2.05 billion</MONEY> in the budget for fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE> to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will
trim that by <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$700 million</MONEY>, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> agreed to invest nearly <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY> to build sections of it.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said in <DATE>1984</DATE> it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in <DATE>1992</DATE> and estimated the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> cost at <MONEY>$8
billion</MONEY>. In <DATE>1987</DATE>, agency officials revised the pricetag to <MONEY>$14.6
billion</MONEY>. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be <MONEY>$25.02
billion</MONEY>, with Phase Two raising the cost to <MONEY>$32.8 billion</MONEY>.
   The schedule began slipping. And <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   Some in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> believe <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the <DATE>moon 20 years ago</DATE> think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, who orbited the moon while <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
<LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, we went to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION>, and then vertically. Starting
with the <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> brothers, <PERSON>Chuck Yeager</PERSON> through the sound barrier,
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

<TEXT>
   Space officials from more than a dozen countries converged on a Central Asian steppe yesterday for the launching of the first of two probes to <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>, the potato-shaped moon of Mars. 

   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> says the mission will help prepare for manned flight to the planet. 

   Soviet media said final preparations were being made at the Baikonur launch site in <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> for the liftoff today of Phobos I, a joint East-West project to study Phobos and Mars itself. 
Phobos II, the second satellite, is scheduled to be launched <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 

   Soviet television this week showed the silver-white Phobos I and its 60-yard-tall Soviet-made <ORGANIZATION>Proton</ORGANIZATION> rocket being moved into place. 

   The satellites will enter Mars's gravity in <DATE>January</DATE> and begin a three-month remote study of the surface and atmosphere of the planet. 
After that, scientists said, they will draw closer to Phobos and drop descent vehicles carrying laser, ionic and radar equipment to help determine the internal structure and composition of the moon. 
The probes are expected to be sent to Phobos in about <DATE>April</DATE> of next year, according to <PERSON>Roald Sagdeyev</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Academy of Sciences' Space Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 

   Soviet space scientists said <PERSON>Phobos</PERSON> is an important step toward a manned flight to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, which they hope can take place in the <DATE>early 21st century</DATE>. 
Officials including Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> have proposed that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> take part in the mission. 

   "First, it is necessary to draw up a more accurate map of the Mars surface in order to choose a place for the future landing," said <PERSON>Vyacheslav Balebanov</PERSON>, a deputy to <PERSON>Mr. Sagdeyev</PERSON>. 

   "Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet. 
The study of Mars renewed under the Phobos program should provide answers to those questions," he said in an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION>Sovietskaya Rossiya</ORGANIZATION>. 

   The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said that the Phobos television system will provide color photographs and that a memory unit will permit transmission of up to 1,100 pictures to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 

   Soviet space officials said the launching itself will cost about <MONEY>$65 million</MONEY> and that the total cost of the project was about <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY>. 

   Also participating in the project are <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION>. 
Many of those countries have provided equipment for experiments to be conducted by Phobos. 

   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, a late entry into the Martian mission as relations have warmed with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, will be represented at the launching by a group headed by Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Donald Cromer</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> space division, said <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Marguerite Squire</PERSON>. 

   The Deep Space Network of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will provide tracking data to permit two 100-pound landers to reach Phobos, and then will begin to track the Martian moon precisely using antennas in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, and a Soviet radio telescope in the <LOCATION>Crimea</LOCATION>. 

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> scientists say the Deep Space Network can determine distance within yards, and the velocity of spacecraft billons of miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Balebanov</PERSON> said scientists also suspect that Phobos is gradually drawing closer to Mars. 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tracking may help to determine if that is true. 

   The Phobos craft will carry a plaque commemorating <ORGANIZATION>Phobos</ORGANIZATION>'s discovery by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> astronomer. 

   The probe is launched while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is still trying to recover from the loss of the space shuttle Challenger in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
Since then, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has had several space achievements, including the 326-day mission of cosmonaut <PERSON>Yuri Romanenko</PERSON> aboard the Mir orbiting space station. 

   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> first sent a satellite toward Mars in <DATE>1962</DATE>. 
The Mars-1 craft was the first of about 15 Soviet and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> probes that gathered a large amount of data from the planet, but not enough to determine the feasibility of a manned mission, Soviet scientists say. 

   Phobos "is a logical development of the Soviet program of Mars exploration that was started about a quarter of a century ago," cosmonaut <PERSON>Alexei Leonov</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> launched an unmanned probe
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on a six-month trip to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>' moon, <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>, for a
mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red
planet.
   The 180-foot-tall booster rocket spewed orange and blue flames
as it illuminated the nighttime sky at the Baikonur space center in
the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION>.
   The launch of the <ORGANIZATION>Proton</ORGANIZATION> rocket carrying the probe, Phobos I,
was carried live on Soviet television, which reported that the
spacecraft's flight was proceeding normally.
   More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to
swoop close to the surface of Phobos and drop probes onto the
little, potato-shaped Martian moon that scientists say may hold
clues to how the universe was formed.
   Delegations from around the world gathered at Baikonur for the
launch of Phobos I, a joint East-West project to study the moon and
Mars itself.
   A companion probe, <PERSON>Phobos II</PERSON>, is scheduled for launch on <DATE>July 12</DATE>.
   If all goes well, the two spacecraft will enter the
gravitational pull of Mars in <DATE>January 1989</DATE> and fall into orbit just
behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the surface and
atmosphere of the planet. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the craft will drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they will release two small landers.
   The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that in one
experiment, a laser beam will be used to split a tiny piece of
Phobos' rocky surface and trap a specimen for close examination.
   One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in
stationary position, sending back data. Another is designed to leap
around the little moon in 20-yard hops gathering soil samples and
analyzing them.
   This is the most sophisticated and ambitious of 18 Soviet and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unmanned missions to study Mars.
   Soviet space scientists have characterized the Phobos mission as
an important step toward a manned flight to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, which they hope
will be possible in the <DATE>early 21st century</DATE>.
   The Phobos probes will help map the surface of the planet ``in
order to choose a place for the future landing,'' said <PERSON>Vyacheslav
Balebanov</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Academy of Sciences' Space Research
Institute</ORGANIZATION>. ``Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil
characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet.''
   Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> has proposed that the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> join in the prospective manned mission, but American
officials have been cool to the idea, saying it would be very
expensive and would require solutions to many difficult problems,
one of which is the problem of astronauts' physical deterioration
during long periods of weightlessness.
   Soviet space officials have put the cost of the Phobos mission
at <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY>.
   In addition to the Soviets, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>East
Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the
<ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION> are participating in the flight. The <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, a late entry, will provide tracking data with its Deep
Space Network that can determine distances within yards and the
velocity of objects billions of miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The Phobos craft also will carry a plaque commemorating the
moon's discovery by an American astronomer.

<HEAD>Soviet Mars Probe Lost in Space Because of Controller's Error</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar space probe designed to
unlock the secrets of Mars fell into a ``deep lethargic sleep'' and
is worthless because of a ground controller's error, a scientist
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   It was the second Soviet space mishap revealed this week.
   ``Only a miracle can save it now,'' <PERSON>Roald Z. Sagdeyev</PERSON>, head of
the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Space Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   Ground-control operators are unable to communicate with the
Phobos 1 probe, now millions of miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   This week, a Soyuz TM-5 capsule carrying two cosmonauts came
close to being marooned in space because of equipment problems and
mistakes by the ship's commander delayed its return to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Sagdeyev said scientists would now have to rely on a sister
ship, Phobos 2, that is also racing toward the <ORGANIZATION>Red Planet</ORGANIZATION>. Phobos 1
was launched <DATE>July 7</DATE> and Phobos 2 <DATE>five days later</DATE> in missions that
cost <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY>.
   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and in
<DATE>January</DATE> drop behind <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>, the larger of the planet's two moons,
to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Phobos 1 was to drop a lander that would stay in one place on
the surface of the moon for a year. Phobos 2 was to deploy a lander
that would hop around on the moon in 20-yard leaps, gathering and
analyzing soil samples.
   Phobos 1 is still moving in space, but it may not be on its
planned trajectory because the orientation and guidance systems
aren't functioning. It was not immediately known how the original
plan would be modified now that one of the probes is useless.
   Sagdeyev said a ground control operator at the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Mission
Control Center</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> sent an incorrect command to Phobos 1
during the night of <DATE>Aug. 29-30</DATE> and that a computer failed to detect
the error and flash the signal, ``bad command.'' He did not say
whether the faulty computer was on the ground or on board the
spacecraft.
   ``The command signified the slow suicide of the machinery,
Phobos 1,'' said <PERSON>Sagdeyev</PERSON>. ``It lost orientation, and the solar
panels stopped looking at the sun. In two to three days a
cooling-down of the craft occurred.''
   ``The machinery has simply frozen. It fell into a deep,
lethargic sleep,'' the scientist said.
   The mistake was only discovered three days later. Sagdeyev said
investigators also determined that no second operator was on duty
to check the work of the controller who made the mistake, violating
the control center's rules. He did not say if either controller was
punished.
   Sagdeyev, the most prominent Soviet space scientist and a major
supporter of the exploration of Mars, said ground controllers were
still sending signals to Phobos 1 to restore orientation, but were
having no luck. He suggested they now turn their attention to
Phobos 2 and ``do everything to prevent a repetition of the mistake
with the second machine.''
   The space research chief spoke to a reporter during a reception
at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador's residence in honor of <PERSON>Andrei D. Sakharov</PERSON>,
the Soviet physicist and human rights activist who is the <DATE>1975</DATE>
Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON>Vladimir Lyakhov</PERSON> and his Afghan
crewmate, <PERSON>Ahad Abdul Mohmand</PERSON>, had to postpone landing of their
Soyuz TM-5 capsule because a sensor used to orient the craft and a
computer malfunctioned.
   In addition to the equipment problems, <PERSON>Lyakhov</PERSON> said later he
acted improperly during one landing attempt and made the problems
worse. The two, who were running low on air and food, returned to
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> safely <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>American National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>, was to have helped the Soviets track Phobos 1 next
month, but <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON>Raymond J. Amorose</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the
Soviets reported they lost contact with the craft.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> was also supposed to have worked with Phobos 1 in a joint
U.S.-Soviet study of the sun.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency indicated that scientists were in normal
contact with Phobos 2 and said it was 11.8 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   After a 111 million-mile trip, both craft were to have fallen
into orbit behind Phobos for a three-month remote study meant to
help unlock mysteries of Mars, which some scientists believe may
once have hosted life. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the craft were to drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they were to release two small landers.
   It is the most ambitious of about 18 Soviet and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unmanned
missions to study Mars, which, next to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, is believed to be
most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.

   In the glow of celebrating the Apollo 11
anniversary with the men who landed on the lunar surface, President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> proposed a commitment to go back to the moon _ ``this time,
back to stay.''
   The trip he laid out for the nation would be step-by-step: a
space station first, then the moon, and eventually Mars. ``Each
mission should and will lay the groundwork for the next,'' the
president said.
   That's akin to laying the groundwork for a driving trip across
country by wheeling around the block for a few years and then
gaining experience in the next suburb for a few years more.
   Predictably, advocates of exploring with satellites and probes _
which don't need expensive creature comforts _ were aghast. But
manned space flight supporters rushed to praise the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> outline,
delivered <DATE>Thursday</DATE> on the 20th anniversary of the first moon
landing.
   Space station yes. Mars yes. But why go to the moon?
   ``In my view there is no good reason,'' said <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Cornell</ORGANIZATION> astronomer who has led the scientific community's fight for
sending humans to Mars. ``The moon is not much like Mars. It's not
any closer to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, in the idea of a way station or stepping stone.
   ``Scientifically it is very different. Mars has an atmosphere,
polar caps, evidence of past running water. It has the possibility
of ancient life. The moon has none of that. The moon is static,
airless, pretty dull.''
   <PERSON>Lewis Friedman</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary Society</ORGANIZATION>,
said: ``The case for a moon base has not yet been made. The idea of
permanently occupying the moon is one that is not justified.
   ``We haven't permanently occupied the oceans. The notion that we
are going back to the moon to stay, and all that implies, is not
yet well founded.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Bill Nelson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Fla.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> space
subcommittee, said he would prefer to send astronauts straight to
Mars ``unless there is extraordinary scientific value for that
being a first step.'' There's been no such evidence, he said, and
``common sense would say it will delay us in time and it will cost
us more if we go back to the moon.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION>, in an editorial, called a return to the moon
``a failure of imagination and fresh thought'' and pointed out that
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> already has a ton of moon rocks.
   The president offered neither timetable nor money in his
expansive vision for ``a journey into tomorrow'' whose bills will
come due long after he has moved out of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. What he
offered is American leadership.
   ``Why the moon? Why Mars? Because it is humanity's destiny to
strive, to seek, to find. And because it is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s destiny to
lead,'' he said.
   The budding controversy is joined by those who, like Rep. <PERSON>Bill
Green</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.Y.</LOCATION>, think only machines belong in space, not humans.
   ``Currently, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is split between science and go-man-go,''
he said. ``I see no scientific justification for putting a colony
on the moon and no scientific justification for visiting Mars.''
   And, he added, one cost of sending men to the moon first is to
get to Mars later. ``If you're going to Mars directly, you are
looking at (the year) <DATE>2009</DATE>. But if you are going to do it via the
moon, you are looking at the <DATE>second decade in the 21st Century</DATE>.''
   None of this comes as any surprise to <PERSON>Frank Martin</PERSON>, who heads
the exploration office of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I'm sure we are going to have a nice debate over this in the
next six months,'' he said. ``As you can imagine, we put a lot of
thought into this. Recognizing in the long term that Mars is
sexier, it's the long range view we need to be taking.''
   Nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the Apollo program of the
<DATE>1960s</DATE>, when getting to the moon and returning home was the only
goal: to beat the Soviets.
   The moon is attractive as an outpost, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said, because
``it's possible to have significant achievements in 10 years. When
you start asking people to work and asking the nation to focus on
something, it's got to be something where the milestone is
achievable in some finite period.''
   Other good reasons, said <PERSON>Martin</PERSON>, are:
   _ ``We know a great deal about the moon, we have ... a good data
base of understanding of what's there and how to work with that.
   _ ``It's nearby, it's three days away. When you commit people to
Mars you are talking six months to a year just to get there.
   _ ``Mars is one third of the gravitational field of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>;
the moon is one sixth <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> gravity ... if they do well in the one
sixth gravitational environment we know they will do well in
one-third G.''
   In addition, he said, the technical and engineering experiences
on the surface of the moon can be used to develop the systems to be
used on Mars.
   In <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON>'s view that's not a good argument for a moon stop.
   ``I understand the institutional reasons for wanting an
intermediate goal,'' he said, ``but what worries me is that the
milestone may supplant the objective _ that the moon may be a dead
end. It might gobble up all the fiscal, intellectual and practical
resources. There is no test for Mars exploration we can't do more
cheaply or safely in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit or on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> itself.''
   Sagan and <PERSON>Friedman</PERSON> praised the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> speech.
   ``It is, after all, the first commitment by an American
president to send humans to Mars,'' said <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON>. ``If it contained
absolutely nothing else, I'm for it.''
   <PERSON>Friedman</PERSON> said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> should be commended ``for finally being a
president who stepped up to say space has a national purpose to
serve the country.''
   Both scientists said they wished <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had proposed the Mars
journey as an international venture with the Soviets, who have said
they wanted to do it that way.
   ``Missions of this scale cannot be justified to satisfy the
curiosity of scientists to provide some vicarious sense of
exploration by the American people,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said. ``It's too much
money. Just as Apollo needed a major political justification, the
competition with the Russians, so this needs a major political
justification. It can't be just competition; it has to be
cooperation.''

   The Desultory World of Space Politics

<LP>
   Here's a book about space exploration in which intrepid
robot spacecraft explore distant worlds, while astronauts and
NASA bureaucrats generally muck things up. Given the dismal
failures of the manned space shuttle and the glorious
triumphs of Voyager, the premise sounds about right.
   But in "Exploring Space: Voyages in the Solar System and
Beyond" (Random House, 448 pages, $24.95), William F. Burrows
manages to make space exploration unbearably dull. He's
written a book about soulless machines built by the dullest
humans on Earth. To get a better sense of the joy of
discovery, turn on "Star Trek" or "Nova."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the title of his book promises more, <PERSON>Mr. Burrows</PERSON>
delivers a history of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s program for unmanned planetary exploration.
He catalogs in excruciating detail 30 years of space
launches, starting with the early failures of the Pioneer and
Ranger craft and ending with the successes of Voyager. But
<PERSON>Mr. Burrows</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>'s science and
environmental reporting program, forgets the first rule of
journalism -- or writing for that matter. To entice someone
to read a story, you need characters, plot, theme and so on.
Instead he offers lists and factoids.
   <PERSON>Mr. Burrows</PERSON> tells the reader that the <ORGANIZATION>Mariner</ORGANIZATION> spacecrafts
that zoomed past <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and Mars in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> had on board a
radio, data encoder, video storage equipment, a command
system and about a dozen other machines. He says they used
less power than a refrigerator light bulb. But he doesn't say
much at all about the dreams or characters of the people who
built the <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> or how the craft's first glimpses of the
planets changed the way people back on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> thought about
the heavens.
   Combine this fault with plain bad writing -- "If {Apollo}
was a circus, {scientists} at least had the consolation of
knowing that they numbered among its shareholders," he notes
at one point -- and you have a book that plods when it should
soar.
   <PERSON>Mr. Burrows</PERSON>'s weaknesses didn't matter much in his earlier
book, "Deep Black," a popular history of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spy satellites.
In the highly classified reconnaissance program, so little is
publicly known that machines become the main story. The
question of whether a spy satellite can read a license plate
on the ground, as claimed, or just a street sign takes on
more significance than it merits in spy-satellite books. But
the machines really are impressive. They help us keep tabs on
our enemies and represent one of the few high-tech areas left
where we still clearly lead the Japanese.
   "Exploring Space" does have some strengths. <PERSON>Mr. Burrows</PERSON>
describes in detail the bureaucratic battles that precede
each major planetary project, giving outsiders a look at the
desultory world of space politics. He also gives ample
evidence that the space shuttle was oversold, underfunded and
bound to run into trouble -- a disturbing parallel to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
planned <MONEY>$37 billion</MONEY> space station.
   But he just can't make space exploration come alive.
That's a terrible shame, because the planetary program is
populated by a host of colorful scientists. Among many others
are <PERSON>James Van Allen</PERSON>, whose first space probe discovered that
the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is surrounded by radiation belts, and who
relentlessly opposed the space shuttle; <ORGANIZATION>Edward Stone</ORGANIZATION>, the
unflappable chief Voyager scientist who meticulously jots
down every observation in numbered notebooks; and <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON>,
the most eloquent of the planetary scientists, and the most
maddening.
   None of these men or scientists of similar stature are
described in detail in "Exploring Space." Indeed, the book's
sole vivid character is <PERSON>Wernher Von Braun</PERSON>, the proselytizer
for manned exploration, who wanted <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to build giant
rotating space stations and colonize Mars. <PERSON>Mr. Burrows</PERSON>
clearly thinks that such manned extravaganzas are a waste of
time and money. But he describes unmanned planetary missions
with such leaden prose that the reader might wonder why the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ever bothered launching them.
   What's missing is a recognition that the planetary program
has genuinely changed intellectual thought in the <DATE>20th
century</DATE>. Before these space probes were launched, scientists
and the many others believed that Mars and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> might teem
with life, while most of the other planets were dull blobs.
The robots proved that all wrong.
   Now we know with near certainty that we are the only life
in the solar system. But we can also marvel at the stunning
diversity of the worlds around us -- on one moon geysers ooze
ice; on another, they propel gasses 60 miles into the
atmosphere. And we can only guess at the mysteries that lie
deeper in the universe.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> may have to conduct extensive
psychological testing, including some experiments that could last
years, before it can select crews for deep space flights such as a
voyage to Mars, an advisory panel said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   In a study of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s future needs for space exploration, the
panel said the agency will have to conduct extensive test programs
and develop new criteria for the selection of astronauts.
   The study, ``Exploring the Living Universe,'' outlines in broad
terms the changes the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>
must make in order to be ready to staff a space station in <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
orbit for months at a time, or to develop the equipment and
personnel for exploration beyond <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit.
   ``Life sciences as it has been is inadequate to support the
goals of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON>Frederick C. Robbins</PERSON>, a Nobel laureate who
was chairman of the study committee.
   <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON> said the space agency must strengthen research areas not
only to learn how to send humans into space for long periods of
time, but also to explore the universe for possible life forms and
to study the planet central to the human species _ the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   He said the studies should gather more knowledge about the
effect of mankind on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s environment because ``the threat
to our environment is real and is becoming more important to us all
the time. I would suggest that this (research) might provide a
mechanism for our continued existence on this planet.''
   <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will have to gain significantly more knowledge
about the effects of weightlessness and forced confinement on the
human body before the agency can hope to attempt long-term space
flight aboard the space station or to attempt a voyage to Mars.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experience in long-term space flight is limited to the 84
days of Skylab 3, and this is not enough data to commit to missions
lasting years, such as a voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON> said.
   He said the Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON>Yuri Romanenko</PERSON> holds the world
space record of 326 days, but the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has yet to share the
specific phsysiological data collected on that mission.
   The weightlessness of space causes muscles to atrophy, bones to
lose minerals and become thinner, and the cardiovascular system to
decondition. This reaction, called the space adaptation syndrome,
must be understood thoroughly before long-term space flight is
possible.
   <PERSON>Gerald Carr</PERSON>, a former astronaut who commanded the 84-day Skylab
flight and who helped prepare the report, said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also must study
the psychological aspects of long-term space flight.
   <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> said the current astronaut selection methods are not
adequate for choosing crew members for flights that could last
years.
   ``<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is going to have to conduct very long-term tests in
situations where the test crew knows it can't `king's X' and walk
away from it,'' <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> said. He said what is currently known about
the confinement for years of small group of people in hazardous
situations, such as space flight, is inadequate ``because nobody
has ever done a study.''
   <PERSON>Carr</PERSON> said that the criterion used for selecting astronauts in
the past must be changed because future astronauts will face
stresses far more complex than those known to the people of Apollo
and <ORGANIZATION>Skylab</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>William C. Schneider</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> executive who headed the
Skylab program and who also was on the study committee, said it is
``quite likely'' that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will have to conduct tests that could
last 500 days to 600 days to determine the criteria for selecting
crew members for long-duration space flight.
   ``There simply is no other way to gather the data,'' he said.
   In other recommendations, the committee said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should:
   _Conduct an intensified program of orbital experiments on human
life support in space, including development of self-contained
systems that recirculate oxygen and water.
   _Increase studies on the effects of gravity and weightlessness
on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> life forms, including plants.
   _Increase studies related to the possible existence of life
forms beyond the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and on issues related to the evolution of
life.

   The shuttle Atlantis and its five
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission
to start a robot craft streaking toward <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the cloud-shrouded
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists.
   The crew finished final spacecraft checks and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials
said the space probe called <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was ready as the 23-minute
launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no
earlier than 2:24 <PERSON>p.m.
   Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said launch of the
explorer craft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will mark ``a resurgence of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
planetary program.'' The last American probe to deep space was
dispatched in <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. A
launch control commentator announced ``all conditions look good''
for launch time weather in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. Officials kept close watch on
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the
<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>.
   Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at <TIME>2:24 p.m. EDT</TIME>, heading to
orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Launch pad workers completed fueling <TIME>early this morning</TIME>. After
breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits
they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> workers
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours
after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile
unmanned trip of its own.
   Mission specialists <PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON> will operate remote
controls that propel <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Atlantis is commanded by <PERSON>David M. Walker</PERSON>. The other crew members
are pilot <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON> and mission specialist <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>.
   The liftoff opportunity, dictated by <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s path to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23
minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history.
   After its release from the shuttle, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s own rocket will
send it out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will
fly around the sun 1{ times before settling into an orbit of Venus
in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>.
   Venus has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward
and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar ``star'' of
the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after
sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon.
   Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million
miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets
since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily:
Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, which has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet.
   An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the
surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.
The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the
Venusian surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then
sending the image back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for computer enhancements.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the surface
while orbiting <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON> day.
   The last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary probe was the Pioneer-Venus, launched in
<DATE>1978</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said that in the 11 years since, ``we had a planetary
program that was in danger of being an also-ran.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of American planetary
exploration missions.
   Voyager 2, a probe launched in <DATE>1977</DATE> and an earlier visitor to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus, will fly past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. In
<DATE>October</DATE>, the robot craft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A
space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to
the sun in <DATE>October 1990</DATE>, and to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said at a <DATE>Thursday</DATE> news conference.
   Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of Venus and until the
Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space
probes have been sent to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, including four by the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been
photographed.
   <PERSON>Stephen Saunders</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project scientist, said the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
studies may help scientists understand how the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> developed into
a place where life flourishes while <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> became a world of torrid
heat.

   A bedeviled, beleaguered <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is hoping
the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft's rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> next month will
provide our best look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> unmanned device,
centerpiece of a <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY> mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE> after a 15-month journey from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. And <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Saunders</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the <MONEY>$1.5 billion</MONEY> Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said <PERSON>Phil Allin</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> project official at the
<ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer <ORGANIZATION>Ferdinand Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot <PERSON>Mount Maxwell</PERSON>, which is a mile
taller than <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said <PERSON>Jim Head</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> science
team and a geologist at <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>May 4, 1989</DATE>, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At <TIME>9:31 a.m. PDT</TIME> on <DATE>Aug. 10</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>
to <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said.
   If scientists are lucky, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>.
   Venus is the planet most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> since the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and from <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Pioneer Venus orbiter in <DATE>1978</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>'s Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will radio the
information back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION>
stations in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>.
   Computers at <ORGANIZATION>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON>
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>'s main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is <MONEY>$744 million</MONEY>, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said <PERSON>Bill Dimmer</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s
comptroller's office in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for <MONEY>$413 million</MONEY> of that total, he said.

<HEAD>Council Says U.S. Should Explore Use of Nuclear Power in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space explorers will have to use nuclear power
on Mars, and the <ORGANIZATION>National Science Council</ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
should study employing nuclear rockets to get travelers to the
planet.
   In a <DATE>Friday</DATE> report to Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, the council
acknowledged ``formidable barriers of public acceptance'' to the
use of nuclear power in space.
   However, it said the use of such power ``eventually will be
essential'' on both the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> and Mars because of heavy energy
demands.
   It also recommended testing and possibly a demonstration in
space of the feasibility of sending rockets to Mars by nuclear
propulsion.
   The report analyzed a study done by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> as part of President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s initiative to put
bases on the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> and Mars early in the next century.
   Among its findings:
   _<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> needs to study the effects of long-term space flight on
human beings because on the basis of present knowledge ``a
multiyear exposure to weightlessness, even with on-board exercise
and countermeasures and an intermediate stay on the surface of
Mars, presents unacceptable risks to the crew.''
   _Operation of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space station by the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> as
scheduled is a ``reasonable assumption,'' but plans for the station
are not adequate for a Moon-Mars mission. The station ``may not be
the most appropriate staging base for the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> and Mars'' and it is
possible that ``an additional station ... will eventually become
necessary.''
   _Although the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> proposals envision bases on <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, ``it
appears that a station in Mars orbit requires a less demanding
infrastructure than a surface base and might serve a useful purpose
in the early stages of human space exploration.''
   _Possibilities for international cooperation should be explored
because breakthroughs have been made in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and elsewhere
and ``most importantly, the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> has substantial relevant
capability, demonstrated continued interest in Mars, and an
apparent strong desire for cooperation with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in Mars
exploration.''
   The council's study, made by a 14-member committee named in
<DATE>January</DATE>, said nuclear rockets would reach Mars in one-half to
one-third the time needed for single-stage chemical propulsion
systems. Unmanned spacecraft have made the 111 million mile voyage
to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in six months.
   ``The use of nuclear technology in space faces formidable
barriers of public acceptance, however, especially if employed in
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit,'' the council said. ``Therefore, issues of safety are
paramount in research and development.''
   It said one type of nuclear technology, known as the NERVA
class, ``is available for full-scale development'' and ``should be
evaluated for injection to Mars in competition with hydrogen-oxygen
chemical systems.''
   ``If careful systems studies ... show a significant advantage
for nuclear rockets in trip time or in weight to orbit, an in-space
demonstration of this technology should be done as soon as
possible,'' the council said.
   ``It will not be feasible to select the nuclear rocket as a
baseline in a system architecture until such a demonstration has
been conducted.''
   After announcing the <ORGANIZATION>Moon-Mars</ORGANIZATION> initiative <DATE>July 20</DATE>, the <DATE>20th
anniversary</DATE> of the first Moon landing, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>, chairman
of the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, to explore ways of carrying it out.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> made a 90-day study, and <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION>National Research
Council</ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the congressionally chartered <ORGANIZATION>National Academy
of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, to evaluate it.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> probe to cloud-shrouded <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the best
look yet at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> sky
at <TIME>2:47 p.m. EDT</TIME>, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator
<PERSON>Dale Meyers</PERSON>.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The <MONEY>$550 million</MONEY> craft, which had to be launched
by <DATE>May 28</DATE> or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> emergency landing site.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s first attempt to launch Atlantis last <DATE>Friday</DATE> was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander <PERSON>David M.
Walker</PERSON>, pilot <PERSON>Ronald Grabe</PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON>Norman Thagard</PERSON>,
<PERSON>Mary Cleave</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Lee</PERSON>.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> out of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
<DATE>Monday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Edwards Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
must follow to reach <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until <DATE>May 28</DATE>. At that point, <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> would have moved out
of alignment and the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> mission would not be possible for two
years.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> marks the beginning of a new era in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since <DATE>1978</DATE>.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> because it is so close in size
to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will rendezvous with <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> in <DATE>August 1990</DATE>. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in <DATE>1978</DATE>, was the last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space launch and <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>
said <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, will fly past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> in <DATE>August</DATE>. It
earlier visted <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. In <DATE>October</DATE>, the robot
craft <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in <DATE>1990</DATE>,
and to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE>.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>.

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials hope that a
disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
will be en route to Venus by <DATE>April</DATE> as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s first
interplanetary explorer in 11 years.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> showed off the
scattered pieces of the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to reporters and
photographers four days after the spacecraft's arrival by truck
from the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta</ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>.
   If all goes well, the parts will be assembled and checked out
over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in
<DATE>March</DATE> to be loaded aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, said <PERSON>Jo Ann
Morgan</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION>'s director of payloads projects
management.
   The scheduled launch date is <DATE>April 28</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will have only 25 days, until <DATE>May 23</DATE>, to get Atlantis off
the pad before <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> moves out of its favorable alignment with
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Otherwise the <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> voyage will have to be delayed about
two years, said <PERSON>Charles Brown</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> program manager for <ORGANIZATION>Martin
Marietta</ORGANIZATION>, which built the probe for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466-day trip
to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   It will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as
well as the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> planetary mission since two Pioneer
spacecraft were dispatched in <DATE>1978</DATE> to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>' atmosphere.
   <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> is to settle into an elliptical orbit around <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>
ranging from 155 miles to 1,180 miles above the surface. Each
circuit of the planet will take 3.1 days, and during the 40 minutes
the craft is nearest the surface, an advanced radar will peer
through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface,
which will be relayed to an <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> station.
   During each orbit, the radar, supplied by <ORGANIZATION>Hughes Aircraft Co.</ORGANIZATION>,
will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10,000 miles long.
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said it would take 1,853 such swaths, recorded over 243 days,
to chart the entire planet.
   ``The spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how
Venus was formed,'' <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> told a news conference. ``To find out, we
need to know the topography of the planet.
   ``We now have the topography of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, the moon, Mars and
<ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>, but we don't have the topography of Venus because of the
cloud cover,'' he said. ``The imaging radar will give us that
topography.''
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> will enable scientists for the first time to
study detailed images of Venus like those formed by wind or flowing
liquid, craters and large landslides.
   While Venus is <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s closest neighbor in the solar system, the
two planets are vastly different. Venus has a surface temperature
of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmopshere is almost entirely
carbon dioxide, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the
two planets evolved so differently.

   Debate Over Space Policy May Produce Program
   That Delays Plans, Wastes Funds, Pleases No One

   WASHINGTON -- The current fight over the future of U.S.
space exploration may eventually yield a program that sets
the nation firmly on the course of a permanent presence in
space -- or a program that delays projects, wastes money and
in the end satisfies no one.
   At the heart of the controversy is the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's plan to build by the
end of the decade a $30 billion orbital space station manned
by four astronauts. The space station is central to the
administration's broader aim of using astronauts to explore
the solar system -- a goal that divides Congress and dismays
space scientists backing a variety of unmanned space --
science projects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   True believers dominate the debate. Space exploration
requires "a leap of faith, above and beyond analysis," says
<PERSON>Richard Darman</PERSON>, the powerful <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> budget director who
says he has believed since childhood that humans will someday
live on other planets. "Almost by personality type, you want
to press limits, press frontiers, or you don't."
   But many space scientists say manned expeditions are more
folly than frontier. Much of the effort in manned programs
goes into protecting astronauts from space hazards rather
than pushing the limits of technology, says <PERSON>Eugene Levy</PERSON>, head
of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION>'s planetary program. He says
that sending unmanned spacecraft to Mars would cost far less
than the space station, and would do much more to advance
research in computers, robotics and communications.
   "These are the critical technologies in which <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is
eating our lunch," he says.
   Scientists have been battling manned projects, without
much luck, since the beginning of the Space Age; President
<PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> rejected the advice of his science adviser when he
decided to land a man on the moon. But the influence of
scientists has been growing steadily as first the space
shuttle, then the space station, ran into trouble from
spiraling costs and design flaws.
   Last <DATE>December</DATE>, a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> panel ranked unmanned
projects ahead of manned exploration as a goal for the space
program. Then, last month, an influential <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
appropriations subcommittee voted to kill the space station
while preserving big increases for other forms of space
science. Space scientists were elated; <PERSON>James Van Allen</PERSON>, the
famed <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION> physicist who discovered the
radiation belts that ring the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, speaks for many of his
colleagues when he calls the station "a monster that will
kill off a lot of space science." Physicists, geologists,
chemists and astronomers all lobbied against the space
station.
   But during a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> vote on the station earlier this month,
lawmakers who had ignored the space program for years rose to
defend not only the station but manned space expeditions,
too. Many of the lawmakers had been lobbied fiercely by the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and aerospace contractors; some also had <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
centers or aerospace firms in their states. But the fervor of
their rhetoric indicated that they were moved as much by the
romance of space exploration -- and the memories of the
Apollo moon landings -- as by pork-barrel politics.
   "We are the first nation to effectively move into outer
space," said Republican Rep. <PERSON>Don Ritter</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, a
former engineering-school professor who supports the station.
"It is the pinnacle of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s national achievement." Added
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON>Jack Brooks</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairman,
whose district includes the Johnson Space Center: "The future
of the universe is in space."
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> finally voted 240-173 to build the station, but
at the cost of freezing all <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> projects at their current
levels. The biggest loser was space science, which had been
slated to receive big increases for an X-ray space telescope,
two unmanned spacecraft to explore <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and a comet, and a
satellite project to study the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s climate.
   The vote didn't resolve the dispute over space priorities;
it just made the battle more bitter. The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
promise they will lobby to restore science funds in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. But the comet mission will probably be canceled,
congressional and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials say, and the others face
substantial cutbacks and delays before they reach the launch
pad. The agency's plans to build an infrared space telescope
and launch an unmanned probe to the sun are also in limbo.
"If we get pushed hard enough, we'll have to reassess all the
{science} programs," says <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION>Richard Truly</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>John Bahcall</PERSON>, an astrophysicist at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for
Advanced Study</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, who organized opposition
to the station, says he's bewildered by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to
sacrifice science projects. "If <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> were a mental patient
instead of an agency, you'd say it has schizophrenia," he
says. <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON>, the budget director, contends that station
opponents want to protect their research grants, not help the
space program. "They're not engaged in big-think," he says.
   <PERSON>Alex Roland</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> space historian, says he
sees a disturbing parallel between the current battle and the
<DATE>one a decade ago</DATE> over the space shuttle. Then, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> slashed
spending for a series of science missions to conserve funds
for the shuttle. Between mid-1978 and mid-1989, for instance,
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> didn't launch a single planetary probe. With
continuing budget constraints, <PERSON>Mr. Roland</PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will be
forced to make similar sacrifices to build the station. He
calls the space station "the son of shuttle."
   This time, though, not only science will lose, but
exploration too, warns <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Robert
Traxler</PERSON>, who heads the appropriations panel that tried and
failed to kill the station. Indeed, so far, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has
shown no willingness to fund the expensive propulsion
technologies that the administration says are crucial if
astronauts are ever to go beyond the station and off to Mars.
Rep. <PERSON>Traxler</PERSON> calls the administration's exploration plans "an
enormously expensive fantasy which will have severe adverse
effects on domestic programs."
   Not at all, says <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON>. He insists the administration
is committed to preventing the station from cannibalizing the
rest of the space program; one idea being explored is the
creation of a space trust fund, modeled on the interstate
highway trust fund, to pay for construction in space.
("There's no funding source, so it's not a viable idea yet,"
the budget director concedes.)
   Mostly, though, <PERSON>Mr. Darman</PERSON> counsels faith. The space
station is just the first small step in manned exploration of
the solar system, he says. Station astronauts will explore
the effects of weightlessness on materials, themselves and
other living organisms. After that, other uses for the space
station will emerge -- and with them an even broader
political constituency for manned exploration. "People's
earthly interests will grow and grow," he prophesies.

President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, charting a course for an American return to space exploration, 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> challenged the nation to commit itself to a permanent manned presence 
in space and, in the next century, to send a manned spaceship to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the <DATE>20th anniversary</DATE> of the Apollo moon landing, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the 
Apollo astronauts "left more than flags and footprints on the moon. They also 
left some unfinished business." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> must begin a journey "back to the moon, back to the 
future, and this time, back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
But, although <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> threw his support solidly behind a pending <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> 
program to launch a manned space station called Freedom, the President stopped 
short of advocating specific timetables or budgets for more distant space 
exploration targets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quayle to Work Out Details 
</P>
<P>
Instead, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> directed Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, to work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s address, delivered on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution's Air and 
Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>, apparently helped head off a serious political defeat for the 
space program in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. Acting just hours later, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> rejected an 
attempt to strike <MONEY>$714 million</MONEY> from the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s budget for the space station program. 
</P>
<P>
The scuttled amendment, proposed during <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> debate on a <DATE>1990</DATE> appropriation 
bill, would have shifted the money to medical programs for veterans, pollution 
control efforts and housing assistance. The <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> 
already had cut <MONEY>$400 million</MONEY> from the <MONEY>$2 billion</MONEY> sought by the <ORGANIZATION>Bush 
Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints About Expense 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s speech drew a cautious response from lawmakers, who complained that 
the space station alone has proven too expensive for a <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> already under 
intense fiscal pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't see how we can 
afford expensive manned programs in space in the near future," said Rep. <PERSON>Bill 
Green</PERSON> (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that funds <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"People also dream of a home in the country or a trip around the world," Green 
said, "but like couples with big mortgages and kids in college, this country 
has bills to pay before taking costly adventures." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the President, <PERSON>Michael Collins</PERSON>, the astronaut who commanded the 
Apollo spaceship 20 years ago while his fellow astronauts walked on the moon, 
defended the space program in the face of competing national priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot launch our planetary probes from a springboard of poverty, 
discrimination or unrest," <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said. "But neither can we wait until each 
and every terrestrial problem has been solved. Such logic 200 years ago would 
have prevented expansion westward of the <LOCATION>Appalachian Mountains</LOCATION>, for assuredly 
the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Seaboard</ORGANIZATION> was beset by problems of great urgency then, as it is 
today." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>Richard H. Truly</PERSON> said his agency has devised no firm cost 
estimates for the more ambitious goals advocated by the President. But 
independent experts have said that an aggressive program designed to establish 
a permanent moon presence and to launch a manned Mars probe could cost <MONEY>$30 
billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$35 billion</MONEY> annually, almost doubling current expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the budgets will turn out to be, but I can assure you that 
they are very affordable, I believe, in the total context and over a long 
period of time," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
Truly said that earlier independent space commissions have called for such 
undertakings as the manned exploration of Mars and the establishment of a 
permanent research station on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Until <TIME>this morning</TIME>, we really have not had a President who laid out in broad 
terms his view and his series of goals so that the <ORGANIZATION>Space Council</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> can 
flesh them out," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
In advocating a return to the moon and an eventual mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 
appears to have seized the initiative from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. For years, those 
programs have been long-term goals of Soviet scientists and space officials, 
said <PERSON>Nicholas L. Johnson</PERSON>, an advisory scientist with <ORGANIZATION>Teledyne-Brown Engineering</ORGANIZATION> 
and an expert on the Soviet space program. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the nation's first space priority is the space station, which would 
be lofted into orbit in phases, beginning in <DATE>1995</DATE>. He called the future 
spacecraft "a new bridge between the worlds and an investment in the growth, 
prosperity and technical superiority of our nation." 
</P>
<P>
The President and <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> officials also emphasized the space station's role in 
researching earthly problems, such as global warming, also known as the 
greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The space station will also serve as a steppingstone to the most important 
planet in the solar system, Planet Earth," <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.

   Bookshelf: The Red Planet Beckons

   There was a collective national "frisson" when JFK
announced in the early 1960s that the U.S. would put a man on
the moon by the end of the decade. When President Bush
announced recently that he wanted to reach Mars by 2019, the
response was far from deafening. There was some discussion,
there were some magazine covers -- but no true universal
cheer.
   Americans now are not looking toward the stars. They are
looking at a burgeoning federal deficit and other hard fiscal
realities. Americans also have seen our country's grand
scientific achievements either perish in a ball of flame (the
Challenger disaster) or end in grotesque failure (the Hubble
Telescope's imitation of Mr. Magoo). This is why an excellent
book such as "Mars Beckons" (Knopf, 244 pages, $24.95) by
John Noble Wilford still gives one mixed emotions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON>, a science correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION>New York
Times</ORGANIZATION>, paints a picture that is pleasing to our adventurous
eye. But one can't help but be seized by the skepticism of
the present day, for it will be quite hard to slip the surly
financial bonds that stricture <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s expeditionary
yearnings.
   Yet <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON> sounds the theme of inevitability in his
book: "Humans will go forth to Mars. In the next two or three
decades perhaps, in the twenty-first century almost
certainly, astronauts will make the long journey," he writes.
"They may be Americans or Russians, traveling separately or
together, and they may be Europeans, Chinese, and Japanese as
well. Their journeys should be only the beginning of human
expansion out into the solar system."
   We will go to Mars, he argues, in part because of our
ancient fascination with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Planet</ORGANIZATION>, and he chronicles
its appeal through the ages at the beginning of "Mars
Beckons." In a sweeping preamble, the reader is taken to the
very beginning of Martian studies, a study first steeped in
astrological mysticism that then grew and matured as the
scientific mind matured.
   Mars was an object of awe for the ancients in <LOCATION>Mesopotamia</LOCATION>,
an object of scientific study for the likes of astronomers
<PERSON>Tycho Brahe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Johannes Kepler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Percival Lowell</PERSON> and an
object of fear exploited by <PERSON>H.G. Wells</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION>. We
have always had this longing for some sort of life on Mars.
We've always wanted more than an echo when we gave a call
across space. Our fanciful visions of Martian canals,
beautiful Martian women and advanced Martian civilizations
stayed with us -- right up until the point we went there.
   His Martian history lesson concluded, <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON> shows us
the long path to Martian exploration. After years of spinning
Martian yarns and peering through telescopes, we finally
reached Mars with The Little Spacecraft That Could -- Mariner
4. His description of the craft, which reached Mars in <DATE>1965</DATE>,
brings to mind an old piece of intricately spun Steuben:
"Simple and small . . . The solar blades shone purple from
the thin sapphire-glass coating . . . the craft's silvery
octagonal body . . . carried 138,000 delicate instruments . .
."
   Soviet and American Martian exploration had been checkered
by many failures before Mariner 4, prompting American
planetary engineers to imagine a "Great Galactic Ghoul" that
ate spacecraft. But the pictures Mariner 4 sent back showed
no canals, no ancient civilizations, no beautiful women, not
even a small ghoul.
   Even so, we went forward, with more orbiters, with robotic
landers. But the ultimate goal, the goal that <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON> is
very excited about, is a manned mission to Mars. "The time
for decision is at hand," insists <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON>. The end of the
Cold War and growing pro-Mars sentiment are cited as two
reasons why we can explore the <ORGANIZATION>Red Planet</ORGANIZATION>. The entire world
-- <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> -- should take
part in the exploration of this red world. And soon, too. A
perfect date to announce these grand plans, he thinks, would
be in <DATE>1992</DATE>, the 500th anniversary of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>'s
discovery of the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>, a feat that required great
fortitude.
   But <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had to sail over the edge of the world; we
now have to sail beyond it. How we can do it technically is
discussed in depth in "Mars Beckons."
   But what is lacking in the book is a true sense of the
political and financial barriers to the Martian endeavor. <PERSON>Mr.
Wilford</PERSON> cites the rhetoric of politicians, the supposed
willingness of the Soviets to cooperate, the technological
capacity of the present day and the technological progress of
the near future as foundations for a Mars mission.
   One wants to believe in <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON>'s vision, like a
sinner wishing for salvation at a church revival. But
reality, like Old Scratch, always seems to ruin things.
Budget negotiators continually eye <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s budget hungrily.
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> isn't playing it smart in this day of fiscal crunch --
its reliance on huge, expensive projects prone to failure
(<ORGANIZATION>Hubble</ORGANIZATION>, the proposed Space Station Freedom) has not endeared
the space agency to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> or the American people. The
clamor over AIDS, the environment and the homeless, among
other things, drowns out the discussion about Mars. The
debate over whether the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> should support "big science"
projects like the Space Station or whether we should support
smaller, less ambitious and less costly endeavors dominates
discourse nowadays -- and present reality seems to be tilting
us toward smaller projects.
   Yet, <PERSON>Mr. Wilford</PERSON> offers us a compelling vision of our
past, present and (hopefully) future with Mars. He obviously
is excited about our future: Someone should set this book to
the tune of "Blue Danube." "The call to Mars," he writes,
"echoes through centuries of human history." The grand vision
of setting foot upon Mars is tantalizing, but our present
problems threaten to muffle and drown out this ancient call
to explore.

<HEAD>Scientists See Little Chance to Regain Contact with Mars Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials worked around the clock <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to
restore contact with a space probe circling the Martian moon
Phobos, but hopes were fading that they could save the <MONEY>$500 million</MONEY>
project.
   A commission has been formed to determine the cause of the
failure of Phobos II and present its conclusions in a week, said
<PERSON>Sergei Zavgorodny</PERSON>, an official at <LOCATION>Glavkosmos</LOCATION>, the Soviet space
agency.
   In an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION>Izvestia</ORGANIZATION>, Glavkosmos head
<PERSON>Alexander Dunayev</PERSON> said scientists were awaiting the commission's
findings before taking further action.
   Scientists at <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Space Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which developed
the project to explore Mars and Phobos, its biggest moon, met
throughout the day <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   One expert emerged and gave a gloomy assessment of the future of
the spacecraft, whose companion probe Phobos I became lost in space
in <DATE>September</DATE> after a ground controller sent an erroneous computer
command.
   ``The situation is bad and honestly, there are fewer and fewer
hopes. Chances to regain contact with the probe are very small,''
said <PERSON>Alexander Zakharov</PERSON>, a project scientist.
   A Soviet TV commentator suggested that Western news reports
claiming the problem was ``catastrophic'' were exagerrated and
cited successful studies by the craft of solar radiation and the
surface of Mars itself conducted before the communication failure.
   The report on the <TIME>evening</TIME> news program ``Vremya'' featured
detailed maps of the Martian surface compiled photos taken by the
spacecraft.
   Ground control has received sporadic radio signals from the
spacecraft, an unmanned spacecraft launched in <DATE>July</DATE>, but no regular
contact, he said.
   Izvestia said the problem occurred <DATE>Monday</DATE> when ground
controllers were trying to reorient the spacecraft to take
photographs of the Martian moon. After the maneuver, it said,
controllers were unable to contact the craft despite repeated
attempts.
   Dunayev said there were seven or eight possibilities as to why
communications failed. He did not elaborate, and efforts to reach
him were unsuccessful.
   Loss of Phobos II would be a severe setback for the <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY>
international Phobos project led by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. Twenty-two
countries and the <ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION> have contributed technology
or experiments to the project, and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was helping
track the two craft with <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Deep Space Network</ORGANIZATION>.
   Loss of communications apparently would prevent Phobos II from
dropping two small landing craft onto the surface of the Martian
moon. Soviet news reports in <DATE>January</DATE> said the spacecraft was to
approach the moon next month to analyze its soil with a laser and
then release two landers.
   <PERSON>Roger Bonnet</PERSON>, science director of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION>European Space
Agency</ORGANIZATION>, said ``there is some hope'' of regaining contact with
Phobos II. ``It's not zero,'' he added in an interview.
   ``It's a disappointment. But the Mars phase was a great success.
We obtained unique information on the surface of Mars, its
atmosphere, its magnetic field and its environment,'' <PERSON>Bonnet</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Jeff Vincent</PERSON> said the Soviets had
not asked the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for help but that the agency's tracking
network is monitoring the craft. ``There is nothing we can do for
them,'' he said.
   Tass announced <DATE>Jan. 30</DATE> that Phobos II went into orbit around
Mars the previous day after a six-month, 111 million-mile voyage
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and was studying the planet's climate and soil.
   Soviet space officials have said the mission would help them
prepare a manned mission to Mars early in the <DATE>21st century</DATE>.
   Phobos II was launched <DATE>July 12</DATE> in a program to unlock mysteries
of the red planet and <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said. In <DATE>December</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said
some instruments aboard Phobos II failed, but most were fixed and
the problems would not prevent the completion of its program.
   Phobos I was lost only three months after it was launched <DATE>July
7</DATE>, and ground controllers have been unable to communicate with it.

   A Soviet space official said <DATE>today</DATE> that a ground
control operator sent an incorrect message to a Soviet space probe
bound for Mars, and the unmanned spacecraft is now worthless.
   ``Only a miracle can save it,'' <PERSON>Roald Z. Sagdeyev</PERSON>, head of the
<ORGANIZATION>Soviet Space Research Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>The
Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>.
   Earlier, the official <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency announced that ground
control had lost communications contact with the Phobos 1 probe,
which is millions of miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and racing toward a
rendezvous with the planet Mars.
   The Phobos 1 mishap follows a foul-up earlier in the week that
delayed the landing of a Soviet space capsule carrying a Soviet and
an Afghan cosmonaut.
   The unmanned Mars probe, Phobos 1, was launched <DATE>July 7</DATE>, and a
twin spacecraft, Phobos 2, on <DATE>July 12</DATE>.
   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and in
<DATE>January</DATE> drop behind <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>, the larger of the Red Planet's two
moons, to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Sagdeyev, however, said that a ground control operator at the
<ORGANIZATION>Soviet Mission Control Center</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> sent an incorrect command
to Phobos 1 during the night of <DATE>Aug. 29-30</DATE> that left the spacecraft
``sleeping'' and ``frozen.''
   He said the mistake was discovered <DATE>three days later</DATE> and that
ground control operators were trying to correct the problem by
sending new commands to Phobos 1. But the spacecraft was not
responding, he said.
   Sagdeyev said the probe could virtually be written off as a
total loss.
   The Soviet space research chief spoke to a reporter during an
afternoon reception at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador's residence in honor of
<PERSON>Andrei D. Sakharov</PERSON>, the Soviet physicist and human rights activist
who is the <DATE>1975</DATE> Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   Tass, in its report, indicated that Soviet space officials had
not had any contact with Phobos 1 for at least a week.
   ``In the two months that elapsed after the blastoff, the space
probes performed 75 radio communications sessions during which
measurings of trajectory parameters were made and operation on
onboard systems and scientific equipment was monitored,'' <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``On <DATE>Sept. 2</DATE>, another planned session of radio communication
with the Phobos 1 station failed to materialize,'' <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said. ``At
that time, the station was 17 million kilometers (10.5 million
miles) from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. On <DATE>Sept. 9</DATE> (today), it was 19 million
kilometers (11.8 million miles) from the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.''
   Phobos 1 was supposed to navigate with a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> navigation system,
and a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON>Raymond J. Amorose</PERSON>, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the Soviets
notified the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> that
they had lost contact with the craft.
   Tass indicated that scientists were in normal contact with
Phobos 2, and said <DATE>today</DATE> it was 11.8 million miles from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   ``According to transmitted information, onboard systems and
instrumentation of the Phobos 2 station function smoothly,'' it
said.
   Regarding the Soviet space capsule, the state-run Soviet press
said both equipment problems and errors by the Soviet flight
commander, <PERSON>Vladimir Lyakhov</PERSON>, forced a postponement of the scheduled
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> landing of the Soyuz TM-5 capsule. The spacecraft, also
carrying <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>'s first man in space, <LOCATION>Ahad Abdul Mohmand</LOCATION>,
landed safely <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on its third attempt.

MARS MISSION POSES PROBLEMS BUT HAS POSSIBLY BIG REWARDS

<P>
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s goal of sending a manned expedition to Mars within 30 years 
poses unprecedented scientific and technological challenges but it also may 
lead to new insights into human and planetary evolution -- and perhaps even to 
material returns. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the obstacles is the debilitating, and possibly fatal, effects of 
prolonged exposure to zero gravity. 
</P>
<P>
But a Mars mission also would require more durable and lighter-weight building 
materials, better ways to protect spacecraft from debris and astronauts from 
radiation and -- above all -- more powerful rockets, perhaps nuclear-fueled, 
capable of launching massive vehicles and their components to the distant 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it's a much larger challenge than going to the moon," said <PERSON>John E. 
Pike</PERSON>, associate director for space policy at the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American 
Scientists</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, however, the asteroid belt between Mars and <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> is 
studded with minerals such as cobalt, nickel and platinum that, if mined, could 
be worth hundreds of <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY>. "Those materials are available to the 
first nation that gets there," said one scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Close-up studies of <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>' surface and atmosphere also may provide new 
understanding of the basic forces that govern the solar system's evolution and 
possible signs of whether life ever existed there. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, astronomy conducted from Mars would be able to explore the cosmos 
with hundreds of thousands of times greater clarity than previously possible -- 
the new orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, there are some political realities to be dealt with on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- at a time of whopping 
deficits and rising interest rates -- will go along with the mission's 
estimated price tag of <MONEY>$500 billion</MONEY>. President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> did not mention the 
projected cost in either of his two major speeches on Mars, the most recent on 
<DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The technological challenges may be more formidable. 
</P>
<P>
One current <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scenario calls for Mars-going spacecraft to be assembled at 
the orbiting <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> space station, which the space agency hopes to 
complete around the turn of the century. Such spaceships might then shuttle 
between <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing travel time looms as the central challenge to a human mission to Mars 
because of the deleterious effects of zero gravity on astronauts. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> 
scientists believe nuclear-powered rockets might reduce the one-way trip from a 
year to several months. 
</P>
<P>
But whether such an advanced technology is feasible is "too speculative" for 
now, according to scientists at the <ORGANIZATION>George C. Marshall Institute</ORGANIZATION>, a science 
think tank in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. "No element of research in preparation for the 
missions is more important," they said in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
The withering effect of prolonged weightlessness on bones and muscles were 
strikingly demonstrated when two Soviet cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after more 
than a year in orbit: They had enormous difficulty walking -- despite having 
exercised strenuously each day they lived in space. 
</P>
<P>
Experiments in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Skylab suggest that loss of bone mass could amount to 
<PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> during a two-year round trip to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, leaving the legs and spine 
dangerously fragile. Other tests have shown that serious immune deficiency 
could develop, while calcium loss could cause kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>'s scientists, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> acknowledges the importance of the 
zero-gravity problem but the agency has yet to recognize the need to conduct 
research and development into artificial gravity as a possible solution. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the hazards of prolonged zero-gravity would be 
exacerbated by the spacecraft's rapid deceleration upon arrival at Mars. The 
sudden braking could put severe stress on the crew's weakened cardiac systems 
and skeletal structures. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> scientists called for creation of a presidential commission, made 
up of experts from academia, industry and government, to oversee the mission.

   It doesn't think like C-3PO or R2D2, but this
robot can amble along the rocky surfaces of Mars or the moon as
well as any ``Star Wars'' machine did in a galaxy far, far away.
   Scientists at <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Mellon University</ORGANIZATION> unveiled the prototype
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Nicknamed the ``Ambler'' by the team that has been
working on it since <DATE>October 1987</DATE>, the aluminum robot stands 12 feet
tall and has paired stacks of three legs that enable it to traverse
uneven terrain.
   ``A walking robot was needed as an alternative to the
traditional line of wheeled rovers,'' said <PERSON>David B. Lavery</PERSON>, manager
of the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary Rovers</ORGANIZATION> program at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``What we want to do is demonstrate that legged vehicles ...
have an acceptable place,'' he said. ``I think the <PERSON>Ambler</PERSON> has
successfully done that.''
   <PERSON>William L. Whittaker</PERSON>, one of three <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Mellon</ORGANIZATION> robotics
experts heading the project, said the robot moves like a
cross-country skier.
   ``A single leg reaches out in front of the others, places itself
firmly on the ground like a ski pole and then pulls the machine
forward,'' he said.
   Robots using <PERSON>Ambler</PERSON> technology are slated for use in a series of
mechanized missions to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lavery</PERSON> said. He estimated walking
robots could be on the Martian surface by the end of the decade.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> last week set a deadline of <DATE>2019</DATE> for Americans to
walk on Mars. The date is 50 years after <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Michael
Collins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> first landed on the moon.
   The Ambler, which recently took its first steps, is one project
being evaluated by the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> rovers program, <PERSON>Lavery</PERSON> said. The other
projects under consideration are all wheeled rovers, he said.
   ``The intent for the vehicles ... is for them to be capable of
operating on their own with just a very general set of
directions,'' he said.
   That objective has been met in the <LOCATION>Ambler</LOCATION>, according to <PERSON>Takeo
Kanade</PERSON>, <PERSON>Whittaker</PERSON>'s associate.
   ``Our goal is basically to demonstrate that actual exploration
of planets is possible,'' <PERSON>Kanade</PERSON> said.
   The <PERSON>Ambler</PERSON> has the ability to assess its environment, make
decisions, move and interact with or manipulate objects, he said.
   ``The <PERSON>Ambler</PERSON> is one of very few systems that embody all four
capabilities,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Kanade</PERSON>, who serves as co-director of <ORGANIZATION>Carnegie Mellon's Robotics
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON>Ambler</PERSON> prototype will never go into space. But
the robot's technology should be ready for space flight within a
decade.
   Meantime, <PERSON>Kanade</PERSON> envisions other uses for the technology.
   ``It's not just the very narrow, kind of strange applications of
space exploration. It has a very broad impact,'' he said.
   Independent walking robots designed to adapt to a variety of
environments could be used for construction projects on the moon
and to clean up hazardous waste on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he said.
   ``These machines will have to contend with rugged and soft
terrain, low temperatures, high winds, dust and equipment
failure,'' <PERSON>Kanade</PERSON> said. ``These are robots that work in
environments that are not traditionally designed for robots.
   ``The impact of this kind of program is phenomenal.''
   <PERSON>Kanade</PERSON> said the university has spent <MONEY>$4.5 million</MONEY> in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> grants
to develop the <PERSON>Ambler</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>, <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Collins</PERSON>, at a ceremony
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
<DATE>July 16, 1969</DATE>, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for a celebration outside the <ORGANIZATION>National Air and Space
Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>
   There, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> he was weighing different ideas.
   At <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, told 6,000 flag-waving space
workers and their families <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that they should ``allow ourselves
just a touch of pride, a touch of satisfaction, that we were
participants and witnesses to the birth of a new human era.''
   He said historians in future centuries will identify the <DATE>20th
century</DATE> ``as the time when the human species broke the bonds of
gravity that had heretofore bound them to this planet.''
   In brief remarks, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>, who walked on the moon with <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>,
and <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, who remained in lunar orbit in the command ship, looked
to future space exploration.
   ``One of these years, and I hope it won't be too long, this
country will decide to press on again far out into space, perhaps to
the planet Mars,'' <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> said.
   Aldrin said <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Freedom space station, to be assembled in
orbit in the mid-1990s, should serve as a stepping stone to a manned
lunar base and human flights to Mars.
   He called President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s commitment to the moon
landing goal 28 years ago ``a starter's gun for our pioneering giant
leap for mankind.''
   ``We're not yet ready for that go again. But perhaps we are at
the starting line, prepared to take our marks or get set,'' <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON>
said.
   Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a
20-mile-motorcade from the space center to <LOCATION>Cocoa Beach</LOCATION>, where they
attended a luncheon in their honor. An estimated 10,000 people lined
the route to cheer the spacemen and to take pictures.
   For <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Aldrin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Collins</PERSON>, the ceremony was the second
stop on a week-long sentimental journey that began <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with a
visit to the <ORGANIZATION>Marshall Space Flight Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, where
their <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket was designed.
   In <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean had a more
pessimistic view of space exploration in the near future.
   Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon, said that until the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> decides to put a man on the moon or take some other
such step, Americans will be complacent about their space
achievements.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   Bean, who walked on the moon on <DATE>Nov. 19, 1969</DATE>, and later flew
aboard Skylab 3 for 59 days in <DATE>1973</DATE>, said he didn't want to see
another 1960s-style space race.
   ``I'd rather have space cooperation. I'd think that would be much
better for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>,'' he said.

Turning away from a capital immersed in its latest budget battle, President 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> set his sights on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
He renewed his commitment to landing Americans on the planet -- and for the 
first time set a public deadline for the mission: <DATE>July 20, 2019</DATE>, the 50th 
anniversary of the first moon landing by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> astronauts in the Apollo space 
program. But he did not say how the multibillion-dollar centerpiece of his new 
"Age of Exploration" would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to open up the final frontier. There can be no turning back," <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th anniversary of its landing on 
the moon, the American flag should be planted on Mars," the President said in a 
commencement address at <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;I University</ORGANIZATION> here. 
</P>
<P>
While the President's deadline for a landing on Mars does not amount to a firm 
commitment to spend the necessary <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> that will be needed to 
achieve the goal -- that commitment can be accomplished only with the 
cooperation of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- his fiscal <DATE>1991</DATE> budget has asked for a <PERCENT>24%</PERCENT> increase 
in spending for the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>, the largest 
increase in funding for any major government agency next year. Under the 
President's plan, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> would receive <MONEY>$15.2 billion</MONEY> in the fiscal year beginning 
<DATE>Oct. 1</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s renewed focus on Mars, and space exploration in general, reflects a 
commitment he made last <DATE>July 20</DATE>, on the 20th anniversary of man's arrival on 
the moon, to return <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to the business of space exploration and to send a 
manned spaceship to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, however, he set no timetables or budgets for the Mars mission, 
directing Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, to 
work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
The President also has set a goal of placing an operating space station in 
permanent orbit around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> by the end of the century as the first step toward 
a permanent manned presence in space. He called for establishing sometime 
afterward a manned laboratory on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The Mars mission would cost <MONEY>hundreds of billions of dollars</MONEY> over the next three 
decades -- one estimate has it costing <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$35 billion</MONEY> annually -- 
and would culminate in a dangerous space voyage of two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked aboard <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> One as he was about to leave <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 
whether the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could indeed reach his Mars goal in 30 years, he 
replied: "You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out there." 
</P>
<P>
As for where the money would come from, he replied, "Thirty years is a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The risks of the journey are awesome: The astronauts' spaceship could collide 
with a meteoroid that could cause rapid decompression -- and death; violent 
storms on the surface of the sun could blast them with deadly radiation, if 
their craft is unprotected, and the team could be forced to spend a year on 
Mars, waiting for the planet to be aligned properly with Earth to allow them to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
For his speech <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> chose a 65-year-old university in the southern tip 
of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, a state heavily involved with the aerospace industry. <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;I</ORGANIZATION> 
has an enrollment of nearly 6,000 students, <PERCENT>57%</PERCENT> of whom are Latino. It 
graduated 407 students <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said that the nation's renewed commitment to exploration of space -- and 
his related plan to use space vehicles to better chart conditions on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, 
including changes in climate -- would generate widespread benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Our space program will help rekindle public interest in science and 
mathematics and revitalize an area of our educational system that has become 
disturbingly weak," the President said. "It will revolutionize everything from 
computers to communications, from medicine to metals, regaining and retaining 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s high-tech competitive edge. It will create new technologies, new 
industries and new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
While the mission to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION> is the most dramatic element in <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s overall space 
policy, the program dubbed "Mission to Planet Earth" is geared to produce more 
immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
It is intended to use satellites with a new array of sensors to measure sea and 
land temperatures, deforestation, and other elements in the phenomenon known as 
global warming over a period of several years.

<TEXT>
   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE> for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said <PERSON>Norm Haynes</PERSON>, Voyager project manager at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at <LOCATION>JPL</LOCATION>,'' joked <PERSON>Franklin
O'Donnell</PERSON>, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on <DATE>Aug. 20, 1977</DATE>.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: <ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>
at <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to <LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like <PERSON>Marco Polo</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Jurrie</PERSON> van der Woude, a <ORGANIZATION>JPL</ORGANIZATION> spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until <TIME>8:59 p.m.
PDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, when Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in
<DATE>1986</DATE>.
   As of <TIME>9 a.m. PDT</TIME> <DATE>Monday</DATE>, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and 3.211 million miles from <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in <DATE>1977</DATE>, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> flyby.
   Sending Voyager to <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
<PERSON>Charles Kohlhase</PERSON> and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> will conduct
daily news conferences starting <DATE>Monday</DATE> and continuing through <DATE>Aug.
29</DATE>.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to <LOCATION>Nereid</LOCATION> and
backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION>Triton</ORGANIZATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   _A magnetic field surrounding <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s Van <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> belts.
   The <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter is the climax of the <MONEY>$865 million</MONEY>,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1980</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Haynes</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> when the probe starts to pass behind
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Ellis Miner</PERSON>, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, <ORGANIZATION>Miner</ORGANIZATION> said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, <ORGANIZATION>Voyager</ORGANIZATION> will start a 49-minute trip through
<LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION>'s shadow. Instead of photographing <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

<TEXT>
   If President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, in his Apollo anniversary
speech on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, hands <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> the job of sending Americans back to
the moon and on to Mars, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> will first have to provide the
billions to rebuild a much-weakened space agency.
   ``Today's <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> can't do it,'' said the agency's administrator,
<ORGANIZATION>Richard Truly</ORGANIZATION>, last week.
   Since the heyday of Apollo, which put 12 Americans on the moon in
the late <DATE>1960s</DATE> and the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s work force has shrunk by
14,000 from 36,000. The managers of Apollo are retiring or have
gone; in recent months many of the top officials have resigned.
   The space agency's contractor force, which builds the
sophisticated equipment needed for such a venture, also is down from
a peak of 400,000 in the Apollo days to slightly more than 100,000
today.
   For any of the goals the president is likely to set, a space
station is a bottom line necessity and there has been considerable
opposition in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for spending the <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> that alone will
require.
   During Apollo the nation spent between <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of
its federal budget on space. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for <MONEY>$13.3
billion</MONEY> next year _ about <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of the <MONEY>$1.16 trillion</MONEY> for <DATE>1990</DATE>.
   ``To do these kinds of programs, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget would have to
increase by a factor of two at the minimum, and possibly a little
higher,'' said <PERSON>Frank Martin</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>NASA Office of Exploration</ORGANIZATION>.
He estimated space spending would quickly climb to <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> a
year to land men on Mars in <DATE>2020</DATE>.
   Martin's office outlined four potential manned expeditions late
last year, two of them involving moon bases, one establishing a Mars
outpost and the other a base on the Martian moon Phobos.
   One of the moon bases would not be permanently staffed, serving
chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where telescopes _ free of
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>'s atmosphere _ could study the most distant galaxies and
search for life. The base would be serviced by visiting astronauts
every every three years.
   The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be manned
permanently.
   Many astronaut crews would be required to construct an
Antarctic-type facility, using lunar soil that is rich in metals and
silicon which could be mixed with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen, which can be extracted from rocks on the moon, could be
mixed with hydrogen brought from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to provide water and also
supply rocket fuel for Mars or other space expeditions.
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has studied two approaches for exploring Mars: one using
humans, the other a robot capable of moving around the surface. A
combination of those two would place astronauts on Phobos to guide
the rover on Mars.
   ``An expedition to Phobos would establish early leadership by
sending the first human travelers to the Martian moon to explore,
conduct resource surveys and establish a science station,'' said the
exploration office in an annual report.

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft when it zoomed past the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>
on its long voyage to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said <PERSON>Torrence Johnson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the last good
pictures before <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the <DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. It used <ORGANIZATION>Earth</ORGANIZATION>'s gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>. It used <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> for the same purpose
last <DATE>February</DATE> and will fly past <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> again in <DATE>December 1992</DATE>.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
on its <MONEY>$1.4 billion</MONEY> mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in dress
rehearsals for exploring <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>.
   Three of <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s new photographs of the moon and <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> were
released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> zoomed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows <PERSON>Mare
Orientale</PERSON>, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Because of
the way the moon orbits <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s third picture shows half of <LOCATION>Antarctica</LOCATION>, including the
<ORGANIZATION>Ross Ice Shelf</ORGANIZATION> and mountains poking through ice near <LOCATION>McMurdo</LOCATION> Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and moon as if we were alien observers,'' <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said <PERSON>Clark Chapman</PERSON>, a researcher from the <ORGANIZATION>Planetary
Science Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tucson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to release more pictures <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> during a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and more distant peeks at <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Baja California</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Andes</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 18,
1989</DATE>.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. But after the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> decided it was too risky to launch <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> today was weighing costs and
timing as he neared a decision on a <ORGANIZATION>Space Council</ORGANIZATION> recommendation to
set up a manned outpost on the moon and send astronauts to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>,
officials said.
   ``There's a lot of analysis that needs to be considered,
especially in terms of cost'' to maintain a human outpost on the
moon and a Mars mission, <ORGANIZATION>White House Press</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Marlin
Fitzwater</PERSON> told reporters. ``It is a costly venture and those aspects
need to be considered.''
   One administration official close to the issue said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> appeared
likely to endorse the language before him in a draft speech that
calls for building a permanent moon post as a way station to Mars.
But what timetable he might set was unclear.
   ``It's not a question of whether we will go to Mars. Someday we
will go to Mars. It's a question of how quickly,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source added that
the president was mulling how specific he should be about dates for
the venture.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s speech <DATE>Thursday</DATE> will mark the 20th anniversary of man's
first steps on the moon, taken by Apollo 11 astronaut <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON>
on <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>.
   Sources said the draft speech on <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s desk contained no
pricetag or timetable for such a project.
   Dr. <PERSON>Frank Martin</PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s exploration office, said
such a project would more than double the current <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget of
some <MONEY>$13 billion</MONEY> a year, bringing it to about <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> or <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT>
of the total federal budget.
   While a strong supporter of an agressive space program, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> did
not want to set expensive goals that could not reasonably be funded,
officials said.
   Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, a principal booster of the proposal
that came to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> through the <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>
chairs, expected to talk to the president about it by telephone
today between speaking engagements in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, said his press
secretary, <PERSON>David Beckwith</PERSON>.
   Aides noted that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> could make significant revisions in the
speech before delivering it. <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said ``there are all kinds of
choices and options available here ... timing questions and so
forth.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was noncommittal about what he will say in the
speech, which has been billed as a major space policy address.
   ``I'm not ready to say whether we're going to have a new space
initiative. I want to be sure that what I propose passes any test of
fiscal sanity, fiscal reasonableness,'' he told reporters traveling
home with him from his European trip.
   Another idea _ the possibility of a joint space venture with the
Soviets _ was not included in the recommendations sent to him,
according to two officials. The administration looked at the speech
more in terms of setting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> goals in space, independent of what
the Soviet agenda might be, one said.
   But that did not mean space cooperation with the Soviets has been
ruled out, the two officials said,
   The president also is expected to push <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for renewed
funding of the ongoing Space Station project whose budget is
threatened by congressional cuts. Funding reductions proposed by the
<ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee recently would ``seriously
undermine'' that project, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   Quayle on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> hinted at a bold proposal. In a speech in <LOCATION>San
Diego</LOCATION>, he said the administration ``is moving forward to put the
pieces in place for another great leap forward in space.''
   He said the nation ``must begin to think about the voyage of a
new Mayflower _ about expanding the human presence into the solar
system _ as a long-term goal.''
   The only specifics <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> mentioned were continued <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
backing for three projects already announced _ Space Station
Freedom, a new Earth observation satellite, and the national
aerospace plane.
   He said that by the year <DATE>2000</DATE> the nation ``must be on our way to
pioneering the Solar System and establishing outposts on the moon
and Mars.''
   Space boosters want <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to issue a call reminiscent of President
<PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s <DATE>1961</DATE> challenge to the nation to land a man on the
moon by the end of the decade.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> officials preparing <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s <DATE>Thursday</DATE> message on space
asked for extensive briefings on a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plan called ``Mission to
Planet Earth,'' a proposal for an intense environmental study of the
planet from space, sources said.
   ``There was talk that by supporting the Mission to Planet Earth
the president could help his image as the environmental president,''
a source at the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> said.

FT  28 AUG 93 / New flights of fantasy: George Graham on Nasa's future after
the loss of Mars Observer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 980m <PERSON>Mars Observer</PERSON> was supposed to bring back the first new
pictures in nearly 20 years of the planet Mars. Instead, it is lost in space
without a radio. At best, the spacecraft may have swerved automatically into
an orbit around Mars, and there is an outside chance it may re-establish
contact with earth. At worst, it may have exploded.
'I'm betting it blew up on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>,' said <PERSON>Mr John Pike</PERSON>, a space specialist
at the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American Scientists</ORGANIZATION>. 'If it was a big explosion, it's
in little bitty pieces.'
<ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> scientists suspect a faulty transistor and acknowledge they probably
face a 'non-recoverable situation'.
Back on earth, the Mars Observer's problems translate easily into an
uncomfortable metaphor about the once-proud <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> has suffered a series of mishaps on its programmes. Flawed mirrors have
hobbled the Hubble space telescope. Jammed antenna are hampering the <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>
probe to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>. And there have been delays and cancellations for space
shuttle launches - although these last-minute cancellations are preferable
to the kind of disaster that destroyed the Challenger shuttle in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
<ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> officials say that even the glorious era of the Apollo moon missions
was not free of problems.
'We had glitches and failures back then in the heydays. We had engine
shutdowns on the pad - the very same kind of things that are happening
(today),' says <PERSON>Mr Wes Huntress</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space
science.
'We have established some very tough goals for ourselves in the space
programme. If they were easy to meet, anybody could meet them,' adds <PERSON>Mr
William Piotrowski</PERSON>, acting director of its solar system exploration
division.
But the space agency's reputation for being able to manage a budget
disappeared in smoke years ago. The <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION>, the audit arm
of the <ORGANIZATION>US Congress</ORGANIZATION>, reported this year that <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> underestimated costs on 25
out of 29 big projects. The recent technical setbacks have dealt further
blows to what remains of its image.
<PERSON>Mr John Logsdon</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Space Policy Institute</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, says <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s recent setbacks are not merely
problems of the kind that can afflict even the best-run organisation; they
reflect the reality that <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> lost its technical and managerial excellence
in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and <DATE>1980s</DATE>.
Not even <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s critics - and they are many and varied - are rubbing their
hands at the Mars Observer's apparent failure. From the protesters who claim
<ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> is hiding evidence of intelligent life on Mars to the space analysts
who say the agency spends too much money on the costly shuttle to the
detriment of unmanned missions that could bring more knowledge, all had high
hopes from Mars Observer.
The disappointment is acute for those who had hoped that breathtaking
photographs of the surface of the red planet, the first since Viking in
<DATE>1976</DATE>, could help to rekindle the public imagination in a way that the
shuttle astronauts, who have turned into little more than space hauliers,
have not.
After its days of glory, <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> became overweight. Whereas in <DATE>1972</DATE>, when the
Apollo era ended with the last manned moon landing, <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> and its contractors
employed 138,800 people, today they employ 100,000 more.
<PERSON>Mr Timothy Ferris</PERSON>, a science writer at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at
<LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> and adviser to several <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> space exploration missions, says many
employees have fallen into a attitude where their main concern is justifying
their jobs. In the old days, however, 'people at <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> worried about getting
to the moon'.
Where once President <PERSON>John F Kennedy</PERSON> sparked <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> to excellence by
challenging it to put a man on the moon, such political leadership as <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>
received in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and <DATE>1980s</DATE> degenerated into prodding from members of
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> anxious to ensure that the agency diverted work to their
constituencies.
The agency became a master of the art of extracting money from congressional
appropriations committees, by distributing largesse to as many supporters as
possible. When lobbying last year to save the space station Freedom from the
budget axe, <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> circulated maps showing that the station generated jobs in
37 of 50 states and 151 of 435 congressional districts.
'<ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> sees its primary mission as the securing of appropriations from
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in turn understands the importance of big aerospace
programmes in maintaining jobs in the aerospace industry,' says <PERSON>Mr Ferris</PERSON>.
But <PERSON>Mr Daniel Goldin</PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s administrator <DATE>18 months ago</DATE>, has won
some acclaim outside the agency for beginning to change all this.
When appointed, <PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON> was viewed with some suspicion by <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, who resented the ousting of his predecessor, the former astronaut
<ORGANIZATION>Admiral Richard Truly</ORGANIZATION>. Some saw <PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON> as a cat's paw for Vice-president
<PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, who took the lead on space issues for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration.
<PERSON>Mr Al Gore</PERSON>, who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Science</ORGANIZATION>, Technology and <ORGANIZATION>Space
Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> before he replaced <PERSON>Mr Quayle</PERSON> as Vice-president, was one of the
most vocal in questioning <PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON>'s independence.
After some hesitation, President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> kept <PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON>, with 25 years
of private sector experience at the <ORGANIZATION>TRW</ORGANIZATION> engineering group's space division,
to spearhead the assault on <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s bureaucracy.
<PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON> won more favour with the president for the alacrity with which he
took up <PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON>'s challenge to redesign the space station, a permanently
manned orbiter <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> plans to launch by <DATE>2001</DATE>, so that it would cost less and
do more.
The new scaled-down station will include elements from the original Freedom
design, but should cost Dollars 8bn to <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 9bn less to build than
Freedom by its projected launch date and perhaps Dollars 18bn less to
operate over a 10-year life span.
<PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON> has also drafted a budget that cuts <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s five-year spending plan
by <ORGANIZATION>Dollars</ORGANIZATION> 15bn to Dollars 80.4bn. Although he has fought hard to keep the
space station alive, he is <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s fiercest critic, lambasting its 'appalling
management structures'.
'I personally am tired of Apollo stories. It's time we started writing
history and not reading it,' he told a meeting of space scientists recently.
<PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON> himself may not write much history. His task is more to shape <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>
into the kind of entrepreneurial organisation that will once again do so.
Outsiders in the scientific community believe <PERSON>Mr Goldin</PERSON> has already done
much to shake out <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>'s bureaucratic stuffiness, though much remains to be
done.
Writing history, however, will require more than managerial excellence. <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION>
needs a new sense of mission to replace the urge to compete with the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> that spurred earlier space probes.
<PERSON>Mr Clinton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr Gore</PERSON> offer <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> an opportunity, by seeking to swing the
pendulum back to civilian pursuits and away from the <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> and military
projects that dominated space programmes under Presidents <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
But they also want <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> to spend more time and money on aeronautics research
with practical dividends for civil aviation. Manned missions to explore the
planets, they have warned, are a long way in the future.
Practical dividends have recently come to dominate other considerations, to
the extent that supporters of the space station conduct their annual battle
to preserve its budget by inventing ever more farcical claims that
everything from Aids to arthritis could be cured if only scientists could
experiment in zero gravity.
But a vital part of <ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> has always been the dream of pushing back the
boundaries of space. That dream has also been important to public support
for the agency and its budget.
<ORGANIZATION>Nasa</ORGANIZATION> may not be lost in space without a radio. Without that dream, however,
it might turn into little more than an earthbound technology agency.

   It should be spectacular. 

   Next <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, if plans work out, the space shuttle Discovery will roar from its launch pad as a million spectators cheer its rise into orbit. 
The future of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space program rides on the flight. 

   It is the first attempt to put Americans into space in the nearly three years since a shuttle explosion here killed seven astronauts, including a young teacher. 
Discovery "will restore <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> as an agency that sails on the ocean of space," says <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON>, once head of the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But another tragedy would doom <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> manned space exploration. 
Even a triumphal mission won't resolve fundamental problems dogging the shuttle program. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> dreams of exploring the solar system by sending shuttle astronauts to launch giant telescopes, construct a manned space station and fetch satellites. 
But military and scientific critics complain that the shuttle is too expensive, too fragile and too unreliable for such missions. 
They want to turn to unmanned spacecraft instead. 
Even some of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s biggest supporters want to reduce shuttle launches to lessen the risk of another crash. 

   "The nub of the debate is: What do you do with humans in space?" says <PERSON>Richard DalBello</PERSON>, a space analyst for the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Technology Assessment</ORGANIZATION>, a research arm of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. 
"You don't need the shuttle if manned space isn't important." 

   The shuttle's great sophistication -- Russian cosmonauts thud to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in charred capsules, while shuttle astronauts glide down in airliner style -- also works against it. 
The shuttle performs more like a costly Indy 500 race car than the cheap, reliable cargo truck <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> once promised. 

   At a time of huge budget deficits, shuttle costs keep rising. 
In the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> talked about launching a shuttle a week for about <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> a launch. 
Now it wants to send up one a month for maybe <MONEY>$300 million</MONEY> a launch. 
Shuttle travel is so pricey that even an alchemist who could magically turn a cargo of lead into gold in space might lose money, says <PERSON>William Michael</PERSON>, a space expert at the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION>. 

   "The shuttle was clearly a mistake," grumbles <PERSON>Sen. William Proxmire</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Democrat who heads the subcommittee that handles <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s budget. 

   The spacecraft's complexity raises safety questions. 
A tiny flaw can send complex shuttle machinery hurtling toward disaster. 
<PERSON>Joseph Lombardo</PERSON>, director of the orbiter's main engines, worries that a small heating-coil leak could shut down the engine or blow it up. 
In the past year, he says, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> found two heating-coil leaks during tests, although neither proved disastrous. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>James Fletcher</PERSON> frets about the redesigned booster. 
"It's a more complicated beast than we thought it was," he says. 

   There is reason for concern. 
Already, <ORGANIZATION>Discovery</ORGANIZATION>'s boosters are outfitted with only half the test instruments originally planned because <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> rushed to meet an early launch date, says <PERSON>Myron Uman</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> panel overseeing the booster redesign. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will drop most of those sensors after flight three, instead of flight six, he adds, because of budget problems. 
If <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> successfully launches a few shuttles, pressure will increase to quicken the pace -- and to slide a bit on safety. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> must become enormously more efficient, or cut safety margins, or give up on meeting its schedule. 
In <DATE>1985</DATE>, the year before the Challenger disaster, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> managed nine shuttle flights by working shuttle crews at the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Space Center</ORGANIZATION> to exhaustion and by recklessly cannibalizing spare parts from sitting shuttles. 
Now it takes three times as long as it once did to assemble shuttle boosters and refurbish the orbiter. 
But <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> still hopes to launch seven flights next year, 10 the year after that and, eventually, 14. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> managers swear they have learned the lessons of the Challenger disaster and won't scrimp on safety. 
Hot gases escaping from a faulty solid-rocket booster seal destroyed the shuttle in <DATE>January 1986</DATE>. 
Since then, the agency has redesigned about 500 parts in the orbiter, booster and external fuel tank that constitute the shuttle, and tested the changes thoroughly. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> even riddled one booster with holes during a test firing to make sure it didn't blow up when damaged. 

   A successful launch will revive flagging interest in manned space exploration, the space agency hopes. 
"The public looks at the shuttle as the main event," asserts <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Mr. Fletcher</PERSON>. 
"They're interested in seeing people in space, not robots." 

   Initially, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will be content if it can launch its shuttle backlog of <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> spy satellites, unmanned planetary spacecraft and occasional commercial satellites without a glitch. 
But the agency also wants to spend <MONEY>$1.2 billion</MONEY> for a new generation of rocket boosters and about the same to build an unmanned shuttle that can lift three times the load of the current model. 

   With these improvements, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> figures it can more easily construct a permanently manned space station and, from there, head out to the moon and Mars. 

   "<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will lead the world into a high-tech era of space exploration," predicts <PERSON>Mr. Paine</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> chief who has mapped out a plan for colonizing Mars. 

   But some of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s most important customers say they don't need a manned space shuttle to work in space, raising the question of exactly what <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should use the shuttle for. 
After the Challenger disaster, President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> banned the shuttle from carrying communications satellites, hoping to spur the growth of privately owned rocket companies. 

   Now the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION>, spooked by <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s earlier attempts to grab all military payloads for the shuttle, wants to eliminate as many shuttle flights as it can. 
It is spending lavishly to build a new fleet of unmanned rockets and has indefinitely "mothballed" a shuttle launch site it spent <MONEY>$3.5 billion</MONEY> to build at <ORGANIZATION>Vandenberg Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 

   Space scientists want to be next to dump the shuttle in favor of unmanned launchers. 
<PERSON>Mr. Fletcher</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s chief, concedes that the shuttle has been a disaster for planetary probes because it isn't dependable enough to launch during the brief time periods -- sometimes only a week -- when the planets are properly aligned. 
An unmanned mission to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION>, named <ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>, is 10 years late and <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> over cost because of missed launch dates and other shuttle problems. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> once planned to equip planetary probes with powerful rockets for interplanetary travel, but after the Challenger disaster <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> discarded the rockets as too dangerous to fly on the shuttle. 
<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION>'s replacement rockets are so underpowered that the <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> spacecraft must travel first to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and then back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> before it can pick up speed to head to <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> -- adding four years to the journey. 

   <PERSON>John Bahcall</PERSON>, an astrophysicist at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Advanced Study</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, argues that the shuttle also will cripple <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to launch four big telescopes, called "The Great Observatories," to plot the birth and evolution of the universe. 
The first observatory, the <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION>, is already six years late because of shuttle delays. 
The other three face similar delays unless they fly on unmanned rockets, he says. 
"The shuttle has set back space science in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> by at least a decade," he complains. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Fletcher</PERSON> disagrees. 
He says the shuttle will be able to rescue the space telescopes should they run into trouble. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> also plans to send shuttle astronauts to replace aging telescope parts with advanced instruments. 

   "You can use the shuttle to maintain {the telescopes} for decades, and even improve the electronics," adds <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s space science division. 

   The future of the shuttle is tied tightly to whether <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> finds the money to start projects to colonize the moon or Mars, or whether it is forced to settle largely for unmanned ventures. 
That is a choice <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has tried to avoid since the moon landings because it fears its budget and its public support will shrivel without astronaut heroics. 
"<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has no incentive for soul-searching," says <PERSON>Walter McDougall</PERSON>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning space historian. 

   Just how the presidential election will affect the shuttle program isn't clear. 
Neither of the candidates says what he will do with the shuttle. 
The program's <MONEY>$3.5 billion-a-year</MONEY> budget will make any efforts to reduce the deficit more difficult, especially when combined with <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s plans to build a space station. 

   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to ask for <MONEY>$7.6 billion</MONEY> for the space station over the next three years as part of a project costing up to <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY>. 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans as many as 20 shuttle launches in the mid-1990s to haul up space station parts and bolt them together. 
So if the president or <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> should decide to scale back the station to reduce the huge deficit, the need for the shuttle would drop. 

   Even some <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> supporters urge the space agency to reduce shuttle flights because a fatal accident anytime soon could doom manned exploration. 
<PERSON>Byron Leonard</PERSON>, an aerospace risk-assessment consultant in <LOCATION>El Segundo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, says that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should cut its planned flights from 14 a year to seven to stretch out the probable time between crashes. 
<PERSON>Mr. Leonard</PERSON> estimates that the shuttle has about a <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>3%</PERCENT> chance of a major failure in flight, but says it is impossible to predict the disasters. 

   Other <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> boosters say the agency should enhance the shuttle's scientific value rather than promoting it as a cargo vehicle. 
During the Discovery mission, for instance, the shuttle's five astronauts will concentrate on releasing a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> communications satellite -- something unmanned rockets have mastered for 25 years. 

   But the Discovery astronauts will also try to grow protein samples used in AIDS and cancer research that are difficult to make on earth, but which may blossom under near-weightless conditions. 
"There's a whole host of biological problems that we're approaching with this flight," says <PERSON>Larry DeLucas</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Alabama</ORGANIZATION> molecular biologist. 

   Future shuttle missions could boost scientific research even more. 
<ORGANIZATION>Spacehab Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, plans to outfit shuttle missions with a lab deck that would increase the number of experiments astronauts could run on the shuttle to 23 from about three. 
<ORGANIZATION>External Tanks Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, proposes packing the shuttle's external fuel tank with instruments so it can take atmospheric measurements when it is jettisoned to earth. 

   <PERSON>Louis Frank</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Iowa</ORGANIZATION> physicist, sketches even bolder experiments. 
The shuttle could launch a small scientific satellite and circle around it while zapping it with radio waves, ion beams and electrons to measure the upper atmosphere and predict how satellite communications may be affected by turbulence. 

   Shuttles could also be modified so astronauts could spend 30 days in orbit, rather than 10, making them guinea pigs for scientists studying the effects of weightlessness. 
The shuttles then could spend weeks visiting smaller, cheaper space stations that could be built for, say, producing materials. 
"It would be like a lighthouse tender visiting an automated lighthouse" for servicing, says <PERSON>Mr. Paine</PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator. 

   While these missions wouldn't be as dramatic as manned journeys through the solar system, they could make sensible use of the shuttle while the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> decides whether it wants to commit to more grandiose goals. 
Even some of <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s sternest critics admit they would like to get to Mars. 
"It would be fabulous," says <PERSON>Mr. Bahcall</PERSON>, the astrophysicist. 
"It would be like building the pyramids -- something to remember."

   Voyager 2's <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> encounter marks the
last planetary flyby by a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spacecraft, but missions to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> and Mars mean <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will keep exploring space, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>
official said <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   ``We are embarking on the second golden age of space science,''
said <PERSON>Lennard Fisk</PERSON>, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> plans to launch
35 space science flights in the next five years _ the highest launch
rate ever _ and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spacecraft will be exploring planets
continuously from next year until <DATE>2006</DATE>, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said during a visit to
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Fisk was at the lab to watch Voyager 2's brush with <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> <DATE>last
Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> _ the probe's final encounter after it explored
<ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1981</DATE> and Uranus in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   ``In many ways, this is the end of an era, the last time we will
see a planet for a first time, the end of the reconnaissance phase
of planetary explorations,'' he said. There are no plans to explore
<LOCATION>Pluto</LOCATION>, the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft
   But <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> listed several missions that will orbit planets rather
than fly past them:
   _<ORGANIZATION>Magellan</ORGANIZATION>, launched from a space shuttle last <DATE>May</DATE>, arrives at
Venus next <DATE>August</DATE> and will study that planet for several years.
   _<ORGANIZATION>Galileo</ORGANIZATION> will be launched from the shuttle Atlantis on <DATE>Oct. 12</DATE>,
arriving in orbit around <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1996</DATE> and studying the planet
until the end of the century.
   _The <ORGANIZATION>Hubble Space Telescope</ORGANIZATION> is due for launch from a shuttle next
<DATE>March</DATE>, and is so powerful that from its orbit around <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> it will
be able to ``observe the universe back to the beginning of time,''
<PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in <DATE>1992</DATE>, reaching the red planet
in <DATE>1993</DATE> and studying it until <DATE>1996</DATE>.
   _<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to approve the Comet Rendevous-Asteroid
Flyby and <ORGANIZATION>Cassini</ORGANIZATION> missions, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION>CRAF</ORGANIZATION> would fly past an
asteroid, then orbit a comet from <DATE>2000 through 2002</DATE>, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said. The
similar spacecraft on the <ORGANIZATION>Cassini</ORGANIZATION> mission would drop a probe onto
<ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>, then orbit <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>2002</DATE> through <DATE>2006</DATE>.
   Fisk disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will
suffer financially because of the shuttle program, saying that <PERCENT>70
percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of non-military shuttle flights will be
dedicated to space science.
   <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said space science studies suffered in recent years not from
a lack of funds, but because of delays in developing the shuttle and
the <DATE>1986</DATE> explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and halted
launches until last <DATE>fall</DATE>.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. should develop nuclear-powered
spaceships if it wants to send astronauts to Mars, a White
House panel on space exploration recommended.
   The group, headed by former Apollo astronaut Thomas
Stafford, recommended a series of technologies and proposed
missions to explore the moon with astronauts in about 2005,
and Mars about 10 years later. Vice President Dan Quayle, who
heads the National Space Council, had directed the panel to
search broadly for technology that could cut costs and
advance the pace of space exploration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the 27-member group, packed with veterans of the
Apollo manned flights to the moon, largely recommended
dusting off Apollo technology that the <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> had shelved in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> when
lunar exploration was canceled. Along with nuclear
spaceships, the <ORGANIZATION>Stafford</ORGANIZATION> report recommended resurrecting
engine technology from the <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> moon rockets and
Apollo-style capsules for astronauts to splash down in after
traveling to Mars.
   "Why are we using that old technology? Well it's good,
solid technology," said <PERSON>Max Faget</PERSON>, a panel member who
designed the Apollo capsules. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>Richard
Truly</PERSON> said the report showed that "there's only a limited
number of ways to get to space."
   Using older technology could reduce costs somewhat from
the <MONEY>$500 billion</MONEY> exploration program <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> proposed in <DATE>1989</DATE>,
said <PERSON>John Pike</PERSON>, a space analyst at the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American
Scientists</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> study recommended fewer vehicles
than the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> proposal and also said it didn't need to use an
Earth-orbiting space station as a transportation center for
spacecraft traveling to and from Mars.
   Nevertheless, he estimated that the project would still
cost <MONEY>hundreds of billions of dollars</MONEY>. The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> study
didn't contain any cost estimates, but <PERSON>Mr. Stafford</PERSON> said the
group didn't expect any "blank check" to fund the proposals.
   The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> study said nuclear-powered craft could
reduce the round-trip travel time to Mars to about 320 days
from 400 days, reducing the debilitating effects on
astronauts of weightlessness and space radiation. In
addition, the powerful nuclear craft could lug more cargo
than similarly sized chemical rockets.
   Nuclear-thermal rockets heat low-weight propellant,
usually hydrogen, to high temperatures, and they produce
thrust in much the same way as conventional rockets. The
spacecraft envisioned by the study would use large,
conventional rockets to lift off from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and a nuclear
upper-stage for propulsion from Earth-orbit to Mars. Upon
returning from Mars, the crew would jettison the nuclear
stage into a solar orbit before the crew capsule landed on
<LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. For moon trips, nuclear rockets wouldn't be needed.
   The study "will set a path for the permanent manned
exploration of space," said Vice President <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>. But so far
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has cut nearly all funds for manned expeditions, and
the panel's strong endorsement of nuclear power is certain to
raise objections from environmentalists. When <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> canceled
its last big nuclear rocket project in <DATE>1972</DATE>, it had
field-tested a reactor on the ground, but had never flown one
in space.

<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> plans to land robot probes on a comet and
on a moon of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> early next century in new programs that would
cost <MONEY>$1.6 billion</MONEY> over the next seven years.
   In testimony prepared for a budget hearing before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>
committee on science, space and technology, <ORGANIZATION>National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON>Lennard A. Fisk</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that
the unmanned spacecraft would allow the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to maintain
world leadership in exploration of the solar system.
   Fisk, the associate <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator for space science and
applications, said a mission called Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby,
or <ORGANIZATION>CRAF</ORGANIZATION>, would be launched in <DATE>1995</DATE> and would streak through space
for five years before meeting in space with the comet <PERSON>Kopff</PERSON> and
dropping a probe to its surface.
   He said the probe from the spacecraft would penetrate to the core
of the comet and study the chemistry of material that may date from
the beginning of the solar system.
   A second mission, called <ORGANIZATION>Cassini</ORGANIZATION>, would be launched in <DATE>1996</DATE> and
arrive in an orbit of the planet <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION> in the year <DATE>2002</DATE>.
   Once there, <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said, the craft would drop a robot lander to the
surface of <ORGANIZATION>Titan</ORGANIZATION>, one of <ORGANIZATION>Saturn</ORGANIZATION>'s moons, and conduct a chemical
analysis.
   This study, said the scientist, could provide a fundamental
understanding about the origins of life.
   ``The chemistry that gave rise to life in the past is no longer
available for us to study (on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>),'' he said. ``However, we
believe that a chemistry similar to that on the early Earth ...
exists today on Titan.''
   The two missions, said <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON>, will both study primordial, pristine
matter, ``the material from which the solar system formed, the
material from which life on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> formed, and the chemistry which
gave rise to that life.''
   <PERSON>Fisk</PERSON> said that the missions will require an appropriation of <MONEY>$30
million</MONEY> in <DATE>fiscal year 1990</DATE>, with increases every year that follows
for a total of about <MONEY>$1.6 billion</MONEY> by the time the spacecraft are
launched.
   He said the opportunity to fly the missions may be lost if the
money is not approved this year because the planetary alignment will
change and make the missions impossible.

Attention Vice President and <ORGANIZATION>National Space Council</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>: If 
you're looking for something important and innovative that the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration</ORGANIZATION> could actually do -- during your lifetime, 
perhaps even in this Administration -- here it is. How about a space 
environmental-study initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Recent news that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Tiros-N weather satellites did not detect any 
global-warming trend from <DATE>1979</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE> raises a question: Why isn't science in 
space being used to answer questions that are driving everybody crazy on the 
ground? 
</P>
<P>
Environmental unknowns are a central topic of U.S political debate -- up to the 
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, where top <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> Administration figures have been sparring over how 
serious the prospects for global warming are. Many in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> are calling for 
major policy commitments as preemptive measures against environmental 
emergencies that may or may not be happening. International organizations are 
already issuing greenhouse-effect manifestoes. So where is <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>? 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s current budget request bulges with capital for a continuously manned 
space station, an expensive -- <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY>-<MONEY>$60 billion</MONEY> -- project whose returns 
to the public even its supporters have difficulty explaining. Millions more are 
allocated to the study of fantastically exorbitant -- perhaps <MONEY>$400 billion</MONEY> -- 
bases on the moon and expeditions to <ORGANIZATION>Mars</ORGANIZATION>, which both the President and vice 
president have rhapsodized about, because they sound incredibly nifty in 
non-binding speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Grand human ambitions such as a Mars flight will surely be realized someday. 
But today, in the Year of our Lord <DATE>0005</DATE> GR (fifth annum post-Gramm-Rudman), 
wasting breath on such notions may charitably be described as wacky. Meanwhile, 
there's comparatively little in the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget for pragmatic environmental 
space missions that not only might provide information benefits for the 
taxpayers who foot <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s bill, but also should be relatively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting its annual money request to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> last month, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> rolled the 
drums for what it called a new environmental focus. This "focus" turns out to 
be repackaging projects in the pipeline for years -- lately under the name 
Mission to <LOCATION>Planet Earth</LOCATION>. Funds involved represent less than one-third of the 
probable cost of the initial overnight stay in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s beloved orbiting motel, 
the space station. Several projects, such as a pair of improved 
Earth-observation satellites, are great ideas. But amazingly, though <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> is 
hyping its environmental focus as a "crash" effort, some of the spacecraft 
involved won't go up for 15 years. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> went from exploding rocket prototypes 
to a moon landing in far less time. 
</P>
<P>
From an environmental standpoint, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> science missions usually point in the 
wrong direction. Most are oriented toward the outer planets and the far heavens 
-- fascinating, but with no meaningful effect on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. The sun, source of 
all <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> life, has received surprisingly little investigation; the same for 
<PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and, more to the point, a 
planet with a runaway greenhouse atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most influential global warming document in the <ORGANIZATION>Bush White House</ORGANIZATION> 
has been a paper, written principally by the astronomer and "Star Wars" 
advocate <PERSON>Robert Jastrow</PERSON>, arguing that by the sun's sheer power, tiny 
vacillations in solar output are more likely to be the root cause of earthly 
climate variations than human mischief such as carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Jastrow contends that although the pattern of global temperature ups and downs 
in this century does not sync with greenhouse theory -- the thermostat has 
bounced around instead of rising smoothly -- it does appear to correspond with 
what's known about fluctuations in the sun's luminosity. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists understand amazingly little about the internal processes of the 
sun: Accurate information about its energy output is notoriously scarce, 
because such data is best collected in space. Sound like a promising field of 
inquiry? Yet <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> continues to devote more funds to studying other stars than 
our own. 
</P>
<P>
This <DATE>October</DATE> the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>, an 
international robot spacecraft that will examine the sun's polar regions, 
unobservable from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. Ulysses is the first probe of the sun in more than a 
decade. Next year the shuttle <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to carry aloft an automated 
solar study station called Atlas, which will be brought back down and taken up 
throughout the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
These are sound ideas, but fall short. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> should be designing a major series 
of probes and satellites to ring the sun on a continuing basis -- not during 
brief shuttle trips as with Atlas. Such an initiative might not only help 
answer some of the pressing ecological questions: It could provide an early 
warning system for any changes in the fusion generator that sustains earthly 
existence. What if the sun cooled? We'd need to know that. 
</P>
<P>
Next consider <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, whose size and composition are Earth-like, but whose 
900-degree surface temperatures are believed to result from a runaway 
greenhouse effect. <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> has a billion-dollar orbital research station in 
transit to <LOCATION>Venus</LOCATION>, for compiling radar maps of the topography of this 
carbon-clouded world. Such diagrams are likely to be interesting to astronomy 
graduate students and worthless from a practical standpoint. Yet the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> has no plans to fire probes into the Venusian atmosphere to find out 
what went wrong there -- knowledge that might bear directly on the terrestrial 
greenhouse debate. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, of course, isn't oblivious to the potential for reorienting temporarily 
toward environmental studies of immediate benefit to <LOCATION>Earthlings</LOCATION>. But in recent 
years budgetary circling of wagons has become the agency's claim to fame. Since 
Challenger, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> management has exhibited absolute bureaucratic terror about 
offending any interest group, manufacturer or congressman's district by 
altering any plan once made. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, space environmental research would be carried out by boring, 
affordable automated spacecraft rather than marvelous budget-boosting manned 
chariots. A decade of inconclusive study of Mars flight is probably worth more 
to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s empire than a program to produce environmental information quickly. 
</P>
<P>
At minimum, the Mission to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> projects should take precedence over 
feasibility studies about growing hydroponic oranges on Mars. Crash efforts 
focusing on the sun and <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> should be initiated. Everyone complains that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> 
lacks a mission relevant to the man on the street. Here's one.

   An unmanned Soviet research probe is orbiting Mars
on a research mission to learn more about the planet's climate and
soil, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Phobos II went into orbit <DATE>Sunday</DATE> after a six-month,
111-million-mile voyage from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The spacecraft is carrying instruments and experiments prepared
by 12 countries and the <ORGANIZATION>European Space Agency</ORGANIZATION>. Soviet officials say
the mission will help them prepare for a manned mission to Mars in
the <DATE>early 21st century</DATE>.
   Phobos II was launched <DATE>July 12</DATE> in an ambitious program to unlock
mysteries of the Red Planet and its largest moon, <LOCATION>Phobos</LOCATION>.
   The probe is supposed to record daily and seasonal temperature
changes on Mars, make a temperature map of the surface, and identify
areas where the soil is permanently frozen, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said. Data on the
planet's minerals and atmosphere also will be collected.
   The spacecraft is to approach within 50 yards of the moon Phobos
in early <DATE>April</DATE> to analyze its soil with a laser and drop two small
landing craft onto the surface.
   The Phobos program is the most ambitious of nearly 20 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
Soviet unmanned missions to study Mars, believed to be the planet
most like <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> after <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>.
   But problems have marred the <MONEY>$480 million</MONEY> mission.
   In <DATE>September</DATE>, a Soviet ground controller sent an erroneous
computer command to a sister ship called Phobos I. That spacecraft,
launched <DATE>July 7</DATE>, froze in space and ground controllers have been
unable to communicate with it.
   The probes carry similar equipment, but Phobos I also is equipped
to study neutron radiation and the magnetic field around Mars.
   Last month, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said some instruments aboard Phobos II had
failed but that most have been fixed. It said the problems would not
prevent completion of its research.
   Tass said <PERSON>Phobos II</PERSON> is the first spacecraft to orbit Mars.
However, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials say American probes orbited Mars during the
Viking missions of the <DATE>1970s</DATE>.

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Must Go Back to Moon, on to Mars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after man's first step on the
moon, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> Americans must commit to the
permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then
embarking on a ``journey into tomorrow,'' a manned mission to
distant Mars.
   The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program
that could cost <MONEY>hundreds of billions of dollars</MONEY> but said it would be
worth the cost ``because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to
seek, to find. And because it is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s destiny to lead.''
   His proposal was made in a ceremony, on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Air and Space Museum</ORGANIZATION>, marking the historic moment <DATE>July 20, 1969</DATE>,
when American astronauts <PERSON>Neil Armstrong</PERSON> and <PERSON>Buzz Aldrin</PERSON> stepped on
the moon's <ORGANIZATION>Sea of Tranquility</ORGANIZATION> to fulfill a pledge made eight years
earlier by President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>.
   The two moonwalkers stood with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> <DATE>Friday</DATE>, along with <PERSON>Mike
Collins</PERSON>, the third Apollo 11 crewman who said, ``We have rested on
our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving again.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposal _ to establish a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> moon base early in the next
century and then mount a manned Mars mission _ likely will ignite a
long national debate both in a budget-minded <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and among
those who believe federal dollars should not be spent on costly
space endeavors but on solving more earthly problems.
   At a time of huge budget deficits, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> already is balking at
the start-up costs for <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s <MONEY>$30 billion</MONEY> space station, which <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
said was ``a first and necessary step for sustained manned
exploration.''
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, he said, is ``where the future of the space station _
and our future as a space-faring nation _ will be decided.''
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offered few details beyond his broad goals and said he was
leaving it to Vice President <PERSON>Dan Quayle</PERSON>, as head of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Space Council</ORGANIZATION>, and to <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to come up with ``realistic timetables.''
Putting the space station in orbit has been scheduled for after <DATE>1995</DATE>.
   The president chose to look beyond the budget debate over the
space station budget.
   ``We must commit ourselves anew to ... the permanent settlement
of space,'' he said. ``We must commit ourselves to a future where
Americans and citizens of all nations will live and work in space.''
   Richard Truly, the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> administrator hailed <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s initiative as
``dynamite'' and said that if the program is approved, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> will be
ready to establish a moon base ``in the dawn of the new century.''
   Truly said cuts in the <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> budget in recent years have weakened
the agency so that in its present structure it could not carry out
such visionary plans.
   Truly said he had no estimate on how much <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s program would
cost. But he noted that during the heyday of the Apollo program
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s funding represented more than <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> of the national
budget compared with about <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> now.
   He said the job could be done with less than <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT>.
   Other observers have estimated that if <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s proposal were
adopted, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s present budget request of <MONEY>$13.3 billion</MONEY> would have
to more than double within a few years and that the whole package
eventually could cost as much as <MONEY>$800 billion</MONEY> to <MONEY>$900 billion</MONEY>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will need to forge an alliance with Democratic leaders to
win the funding for serious space exploration, and initial skeptical
reaction came from Rep. <PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mo.</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> majority
leader.
   ``The real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can
marshal the words but the resources to restore <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s preeminence
in space,'' <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> said. ``In sum, <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, there's no such
thing as a free launch.''
   The proposal also drew opposition from a key member of the house
committee that oversees <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> appropriations.
   ``Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't
see how we can afford expensive manned programs in space in the near
future,'' said Rep. Bill Green of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   Rep. <PERSON>Dennis Eckart</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Ohio</LOCATION>, said <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was ``calling for one great
leap for mankind'' but not even providing the money for ``one small
step,'' using a take-off of <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION>'s first words from the lunar
surface.
   <PERSON>Sen. Albert Gore</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Tenn.</LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee
charged with the space agency budget, said: ``By proposing a return
to the moon and a manned base on Mars, with no money, no timetable
and no plan, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> offers the country not a challenge to inspire us,
but a daydream to briefly entertain us.''
   Meanwhile, the full <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> handily defeated an attempt by Rep.
<PERSON>Charles Schumer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, to transfer <MONEY>$714 million</MONEY> from the proposed
fiscal <DATE>1990</DATE> budget for the space station to programs for veterans'
medical care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s ceremony with the astronauts blended his glimpse into the
future with reminiscences of the Apollo program.
   He unveiled a new postage stamp commemorating the first moon
landing, then signed a proclamation marking Space Exploration Day.
He invited the astronauts and their families back to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>
for a picnic lunch.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recalled the first moon landing <DATE>two decades ago</DATE>, saying,
``Some called it quixotic, impossible ... but <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> did it.'' Now,
he said, it is time for the nation to head ``back to the moon, back
to the future, and this time back to stay.''
   Under <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> scenarios outlined last year, a permanently manned
base on the front side of the moon would require astronaut crews to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, mixing mineral-rich lunar soil
with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen extracted from moon rocks could be mixed with hydrogen
brought from <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> to fuel expeditions to Mars and elsewhere.
   To explore Mars, one <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> option would use humans, the other a
robot to move around the surface. A third would place men on the
Mars moon Phobos to guide the rover on Mars.
