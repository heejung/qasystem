FT  05 NOV 93 / Belgium urges early active role for EMI

<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, the Belgian finance minister, yesterday suggested that
the planned <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> could start actively co-ordinating
the monetary policies of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states with low inflation after it starts
operations in <DATE>January</DATE>.
At a seminar on economic and monetary union organised by the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trust
for Education and Research</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers International</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON>
floated the idea of low-inflation <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries agreeing a common monetary
growth target. The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> could then use this to organise monetary
co-ordination and monitor progress towards the achievement of durable price
stability in the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>.
The minister, who is current president of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> council of
economics and finance ministers, also suggested that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> might take over
announcing policy decisions such as interest rate changes of member central
banks agreeing to a common monetary target during the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
which begins in <DATE>January</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, which will be based in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> and is seen as a forerunner of a
European central bank, has so far been given only vague guidance on the
scope of its operations and <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON>'s remarks yesterday represented an
attempt to set an agenda for the institute.
In view of the 'rather long' second stage envisaged for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, it was
important to launch a qualitative step towards further European integration
and to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is not perceived as an empty shell, he said. <PERSON>Mr
Maystadt</PERSON> said that national central banks would continue to make independent
monetary policy decisions.
But he admitted that his idea of an <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> monetary target would push the
bankers and the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> towards the 'ultimate goal of conducting a single
monetary policy at <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> level'.
Not surprisingly, his approach found no UK support. <PERSON>Mr Christopher Taylor</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>'s chief European adviser, said the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s role should be
advisory and consultative, and it should have only a small staff.
<PERSON>Mr Taylor</PERSON> said the UK was wary of monetary aggregates and stressed that the
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> 'must not interfere with, or cut across, the monetary and exchange rate
policies of member states.'
<PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON> warned the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> against trying to operate the European exchange
rate mechanism with widened 15 per cent fluctuation margins until full
monetary union. The approach of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> could trigger competitive currency
depreciation and threaten the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> single market, he said.
He admitted that <DATE>January 1 1999</DATE> was now a more realistic target for
transition to a fully fledged monetary union than the original objective in
the Maastricht Treaty of <DATE>1997</DATE> for stage three.

<TEXT>
EUROPE is entering a 'test phase' for monetary union, when individual
central banks have it within their power to create a solid basis for it, the
president of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday.
Countries now had to prove the credibility of their national monetary
policy, rather than engage in disputes over the framework of European
monetary union (<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>) as set down in the Maastricht treaty, <PERSON>Mr Hans Tietmeyer</PERSON>
told the <ORGANIZATION>VWD</ORGANIZATION> news agency.
This would be the only way that monetary union had a chance of being
successfully implemented in practice, <PERSON>Mr Tietmeyer</PERSON> cautioned. Countries
would have to show a firm commitment to monetary stability in the years
ahead and implement the institutional changes necessary to give national
central banks the necessary independence.
It was also important for public opinion to develop a 'stability culture',
he said. <PERSON>Mr Tietmeyer</PERSON> was giving his reaction to the <ORGANIZATION>German Constitutional
Court</ORGANIZATION>'s ruling on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s ratification of the Maastricht
treaty was valid.
The second stage of monetary union is due to to start on <DATE>January 1</DATE> next year
when the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI) will start operations. <PERSON>Mr
Tietmeyer</PERSON> said its role would be to strengthen co-operation between <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
central banks and to co-ordinate the monetary policy of member nations with
a view to price stability.
But responsibility for monetary policy will remain with national central
banks during the second stage of monetary union, and all important decisions
on the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> will continue to be taken unanimously, he said. <PERSON>Mr Tietmeyer</PERSON>
reiterated his call for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to be located in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
THE Belgian presidency of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> president,
and <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> employers, yesterday threw their weight behind
existing plans for economic and monetary union.
<PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, Belgian finance minister, said the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION> - forerunner of a European central bank - should play a forceful
role in preparing for a single currency by <DATE>1999</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will begin its work on <DATE>January 1, 1994</DATE>, provided <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders can
decide on a site for the institution at their summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON> also stressed the importance of the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> objectives, and the role
of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. In an interview for Belgian television, he said the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> would
'round up the lost sheep (among <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> economies), give new stability to a
relatively fixed exchange rate system, and lead to economic convergence'.
The currency turmoil of the last year has left the European monetary system
in disarray and recession has raised doubts about the original plans for
economic union. <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, the British prime minister, recently
dismissed the timetable for a single currency as 'folly'.
But <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s longest-serving finance ministers, said
yesterday that the Maastricht deadline of <DATE>1999</DATE> for monetary union was still
feasible, even if the more ambitious target of <DATE>1997</DATE> would be difficult to
achieve because of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s economic problems.
In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON> also defended the
nomination of <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> as the first president of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. The
choice should be confirmed by <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mr
Lamfalussy</PERSON>, Belgian general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for International
Settlements</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Basle</LOCATION>, would give a new impetus to the Maastricht aims. 'We
know that <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> is really convinced of the need for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to go to
a single currency: he's a true believer in the single currency and that's
not the case with all the bank governors.'
He said the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> would be 'a more permanent and more objective supervisory
body for the European monetary system' than existing inter-governmental
bodies like the secretive <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> monetary committee. <ORGANIZATION>Unice</ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
employers' federations, also called for <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders to refocus on the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
objectives. 'We think that the single market without a stable monetary
relationship will be very difficult to sustain,' said <PERSON>Mr Carlos Ferrer</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Unice</ORGANIZATION>'s president.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Economics Notebook: Reality plays tricks with Emu theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is, according to one old saw, better to travel hopefully than to arrive.
But as in so many things in life, the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> is turning
conventional wisdom on its head. Increasingly, the transitional second stage
of economic and monetary union, which starts on <DATE>January 1</DATE>, is shaping up to
be an especially difficult venture with many incalculable problems.
By contrast, the third and final stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, with its planned single
currency and central bank, has been subject to so much analysis and
discussion over the past five years that its hazards, although real enough,
appear familiar and less daunting.
The second stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is supposed to pave the way for fully fledged
monetary union towards the end of the decade. In it, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states are to
strive for ever greater convergence of economic performance, particularly in
terms of price stability and sound public finance, and to step up policy
co-ordination.
Such far reaching changes are best attempted on a sound institutional basis
and against a favourable economic background. The past year's crises in the
European exchange rate mechanism and the continuing recession on the
continent mean neither condition applies at present. Compounding the
difficulties are policy inconsistencies, notably in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and widely
divergent ideas among member states as to how far the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> should move down
the path of institutional integration in stage two.
With the community heading for yet another year of sub-optimal growth, the
economic background is especially bleak. Although <PERSON>Mr Henning Christophersen</PERSON>,
the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s economic affairs commissioner, has suggested that <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> growth could
be as high as <MONEY>2 per cent</MONEY> next year, others are far less hopeful.
The commission's own forecasters have suggested that growth next year will
be about 0.9 per cent, largely because they believe <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is heading for
another year of declining economic activity. <PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, the
Belgian finance minister and current president of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> economic and
finance ministers' council, noted last week that the commission was likely
to revise its growth forecasts upwards. But he added that many countries,
including <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, would not be following suit.
Low growth will make it more difficult for member states to control their
budget deficits and so will hamper progress towards meeting the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht
Treaty</ORGANIZATION>'s convergence criteria, which include a 60 per cent limit for the
ratio of government debt to gross domestic product.
In the absence of draconian public spending cuts, which would be politically
risky, public debt is bound to keep rising as a percentage of GDP in those
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries where economic growth rates are lower than real interest rates.
This condition applies in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s case, where the
ratio of debt to GDP is around 130 per cent, the outlook is one of further
deterioration unless and until growth exceeds real interest rates. In spite
of <DATE>last month</DATE>'s easing of <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> monetary policy, that date is probably
some way off.
Doubts about convergence will make <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> economies vulnerable to financial
market pressures in stage two. <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s debt problem has exposed its
currency the Belgian franc to selling pressure in recent weeks.
International investors have also been looking askance at other signs of
economic divergence that are not singled out in the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s sharply rising unemployment rate was a key factor behind the loss
of confidence in the French franc ahead of the <DATE>July</DATE> and <DATE>August</DATE> currency
crisis that culminated in the widening of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> fluctuation bands to 15
per cent. Looking ahead, there is no early sign that French unemployment
will decline from its current 11.8 per cent level, while youth unemployment
at about twice that rate is especially disturbing.
The joint Franco-German convergence programme, unveiled on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, has
caused surprise among some European officials for its optimistic view that
French growth could be as much as 3.5 per cent after <DATE>1995</DATE>. One non-official
view, expressed last week by Professor Christian de Boissieu of the <ORGANIZATION>Sorbonne
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, was that growth would be nearer 2.5 per cent.
As worrying to European monetary officials is an apparent lack of coherence
in French monetary policy. At a recent monetary conference in <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr
Andre Icard</PERSON>, director general of research at the French central bank,
insisted that currency stability was the main plank of monetary policy, in
spite of the franc's decline against the D-Mark since <DATE>August</DATE>. But he also
said <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> would pay more attention to the M3 money supply measure than in
the past.
Those who took his remarks at face value were left wondering how the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of
France</ORGANIZATION> would react to conflicting signals from its chosen indicators. Others
concluded that <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s current monetary policy was to shadow German
interest rates.
According to <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON>, the planned <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which is
due to begin operating in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE>, is the ideal institution to
iron out such wrinkles and demonstrate consistency of decisions among
national central banks in the run up to stage three.
But that presupposes that <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states will have achieved a consensus on
what the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> should do and on the technicalities and instruments of an
eventual Europe-wide monetary policy.
Although discussion on the role and functions of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is just beginning,
it is already clear that there are wide divergences between authorities such
as the Belgian finance ministry that see it as an instrument to force
integration and the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> which think its role
should be mainly advisory.
It is too early to predict that the problems of stage two will prove so
great as to jeopardise the goal of monetary union. But they are much greater
than when the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> was signed in <DATE>February 1992</DATE> and throw an
unflattering light on the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s habit of setting deadlines for policy change
without regard to economic developments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> should respect the timetable for achieving monetary
union, <PERSON>Mr Alain Lamassoure</PERSON>, French minister for European affairs, said
yesterday. He played down remarks by Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> that the target
dates for creating a European currency might need extending.
'Let us keep to the calendar that we have together settled and on which we
are all agreed,' <PERSON>Mr Lamassoure</PERSON> said in a radio interview.
The German chancellor had warned on <DATE>Monday</DATE> that strict insistence on
economic convergence between <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states could delay creation of a
single European currency 'by a year or two.' Under the Maastricht treaty on
European union, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> members are to introduce a single currency in <DATE>1997</DATE> or at
the latest by <DATE>1999</DATE>.
But some French officials indicated a flexible stance on the timing of
monetary union. They said <PERSON>Mr Lamassoure</PERSON>'s comments were mainly concerned
with the second stage of monetary union, which involves establishment of a
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, precursor to a European central bank, and does
not involve strict convergence targets on inflation and budget deficits.
This stage is due to take effect from <DATE>January 1</DATE> next year.
As to the third and more demanding phase of monetary union, French officials
said that, if <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member countries had difficulty in achieving the economic
convergence criteria, it might be better to extend the timetable than to
relax the required criteria.
One French official said that the question of the timetable for monetary
union would be discussed by the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> heads of government at their special
summit planned for <DATE>October</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Lamassoure</PERSON> denied any discord between <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and expressed
optimism about continued progress towards European integration.
Belgian Finance Minister <PERSON>Philipe Maystadt</PERSON> said that creating a single <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
currency by <DATE>1999</DATE> remained realistic, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
He said Chancellor <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>'s remarks merely indicated 'in a realistic manner
that the timetable for a single currency is more likely to be <DATE>January 1,
1999</DATE>, than <DATE>January 1, 1997</DATE>,' he said.

<TEXT>
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has cast doubt on the ability of <ORGANIZATION>European
Community</ORGANIZATION> member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained
in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published
yesterday.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Civil Service</ORGANIZATION> committee's report says it is not confident
that seven of the 12 member states, including <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, will be able to
fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in <DATE>January 1997</DATE>.
It will not be achieved before <DATE>1999</DATE> if <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> does not meet the criteria
within the next four years, says the committee, but in view of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s
present difficulties this may not happen.
In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread
belief among politicians in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and probably elsewhere in the
community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in <DATE>1997</DATE>. The
view among most member states is that there should be considerable
flexibility in interpreting the convergence criteria, a view not shared by
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean
that prospects for monetary union would disappear, says the report.
'It is important not to underestimate the strength and depth of commitment
to monetary union amongst politicians elsewhere in the community,' it says,
adding that a number of member states would probably seek to create an
alternative institutional framework to pave the way for monetary union
should the Treaty be rejected.
The committee believes political pressure on the UK from other member
countries to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism will grow.
Non-membership following UK ratification of the Maastricht treaty would
'cause difficulties' it says.
The report says that only limited progress has been made in practical
preparations for the establishment of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> and
the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>, 'a fact that may reflect the wider uncertainties
surrounding the prospects for monetary union'.

<TEXT>
<LOCATION>BELGIUM</LOCATION>, which takes over the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> presidency in <DATE>July</DATE>, will press ahead with
implementing <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht</ORGANIZATION>'s goals during the second half of the year, even if
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> fails to ratify the treaty. But <PERSON>Mr Willy Claes</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s foreign
minister, said <TIME>last night</TIME> the Danish referendum result made him confident
all 12 member states would soon be ready to move towards greater European
union.
Priorities for the six-month Belgian presidency would include preparing the
next phase of economic and monetary union, and a common foreign policy.
The second stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> - including establishing a <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, forerunner of the central bank - begins next <DATE>January 1</DATE> and should
end with a single European currency in <DATE>1999</DATE> at the latest.
<PERSON>Mr Claes</PERSON> said <TIME>last night</TIME> that the demanding timetable was essential. But he
added that Maastricht's tough economic criteria for joining a monetary union
might have to be renegotiated if recession continued. <PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>,
Belgian finance minister, came out in favour of amending the criteria at the
<DATE>weekend</DATE>.
Earlier in the day, in a speech entitled 'Against Euro-pessimism', <PERSON>Mr Claes</PERSON>
said the original Treaty of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and the Single European Act, which laid the
foundation for the barrier-free internal market, were not enough to respond
to the economic and political challenges of the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 'It's time to take a
further step and the Maastricht treaty gives us the means to do so,' he
said.
Pressed on the possibility that certain member states might not ratify the
treaty, <PERSON>Mr Claes</PERSON> told an invited audience in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> that the Belgian
presidency would still continue the task of deepening the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> with 10
or 11 member states, 'because there is no alternative'.
He said <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> intended to 'exploit all the new possibilities offered by
the Maastricht treaty for following a true common foreign and security
policy'. That would include preparing the administrative framework for such
a policy, and asking member states to define the areas in which common
action could be developed.

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has cast doubt on the ability of <ORGANIZATION>European
Community</ORGANIZATION> member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained
in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published
yesterday.
The <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Civil Service</ORGANIZATION> committee's report says it is not confident
that seven of the 12 member states, including <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, will be able to
fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in <DATE>January 1997</DATE>.
It will not be achieved before <DATE>1999</DATE> if <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> does not meet the criteria
within the next four years, says the committee and in view of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s
difficulties this may not happen.
In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread
belief among politicians in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, and probably elsewhere in the
community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in <DATE>1997</DATE>.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean
that prospects for monetary union would disappear, it says.
The report says that only limited progress has been made in preparations for
the establishment of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>European
Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Special EC summit idea takes shape

THE IDEA of a special autumn <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit to discuss implementing the
Maastricht treaty received the backing yesterday of <PERSON>Mr Hans</PERSON> van den Broek,
European commissioner for external political relations.
Speaking in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, he said such a meeting would provide 'new and credible
impulses for carrying out and bringing forward the integration process'.
The proposal was made on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by six Christian Democrat leaders, headed
by Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>. The idea of calling a special summit to mark the
ratification of the Maastricht treaty fits in with the German chancellor's
desire to revive popular enthusiasm for the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> and give it 'a special
push ahead'.
One idea which could be explored is the possibility of bringing <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> before the end of <DATE>1995</DATE>, as
currently planned.
A second theme would be to offer a better deal to eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> countries
whose full <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> membership is a much more distant prospect.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr van den Broek</PERSON> said he was optimistic that the regular
six-monthly <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit to be held in <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION> later this month would
endorse Commission proposals for further liberalisation of trade with
central and eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
The measures are due to be discussed by <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers in <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
As for the suggested special summit, there is some doubt in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> whether it
should try to settle the thorny problem of siting new <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> institutions, in
particular the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>. It would require tough
negotiations, particularly between <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which wants the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, which would prefer any other site.
Such haggling would be out of keeping with an optimistic, smiling summit,
which is clearly what <PERSON>Mr Kohl</PERSON> wants.
Just when a summit could be called depends not only on the British
parliament, but also on the German constitutional court, which is
considering a series of legal challenges to ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
The court is expected to hold its oral hearing into the complaints by the
end of <DATE>June</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Kohl</PERSON> hopes that a final decision will come before the <DATE>summer</DATE>
recess, but other officials are more cautious, suggesting that it may not be
ready until mid-September, or even early <DATE>October</DATE>.
That would still allow the special summit to be held by the end of <DATE>October</DATE>.
The incoming Belgian presidency of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> yesterday declared its
determination to set up the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> on schedule by
<DATE>January 1, 1994</DATE> - the start of the second stage of European monetary union,
<PERSON>Lionel Barber</PERSON> adds from <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
In a speech in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, Belgian finance minister,
called upon <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states to make the process toward <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> irreversible.
Failure to do so would encourage currency speculators, he said.
Federalist-minded <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> takes over the presidency from <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 1</DATE>.

<TEXT>
The Belgian presidency of the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> yesterday called for a stronger
role for the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> in the co-ordination of monetary
policies and the management of the exchange rate mechanism.
<PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, Belgian finance minister, said the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis and
introduction of wider fluctuation bands last <DATE>summer</DATE> made closer co-operation
imperative.
Without 'a significant qualitative improvement' in this area, the goal of
monetary union by the end of the decade could be at risk.
In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION>European Finance Convention</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON> also
admitted that the <DATE>January 1, 1999</DATE>, deadline was more realistic than the
original <DATE>1997</DATE>.
He offered several proposals for filling the political vacuum in the wake of
the <DATE>August</DATE> crisis which led to the introduction of 15 per cent fluctuation
bands for <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> currencies.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> should be given 'an explicit role' in decisions leading to the entry
or realignment of an <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> currency.
States with low inflation might consider aligning their monetary policies to
a 'common intermediate target', in which case the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> might be allowed to
issue joint statements on national policy decisions taken by central banks
in this low-inflation zone.
The <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> should be strengthened, possibly through a more equitable sharing of
potential exchange rate losses arising from open-ended interventions. This
is a response to <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> criticism that its obligations to defend other
currencies was undermining its domestic monetary policies.

<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva</PERSON>, the Portuguese prime minister, yesterday said he
hoped the newly-formed European monetary institute would help persuade
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to cut interest rates more quickly to boost European economic
growth.
His comments are likely to increase German fears that the Frankfurt-based
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> could interfere with the statutory independence of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>.
In remarks plainly directed above all at <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Cavaco Silva</PERSON> criticised
'national egoism' in economic policy. He said the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> would require 'a
commitment for everyone to pursue a community monetary policy'.
He added: 'I have some expectations for the work of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. Before, it was
quite clear that monetary policy co-ordination was not strong. I hope from
now on it will not just be a question of adapting to the decisions of the
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>. The 12 members of the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> - all of them - will have a
say in monetary policy.'
Decision-making power will remain formally in the hands of national central
banks during stage two of the move to economic and monetary union, which
began on <DATE>January 1</DATE>. However, <PERSON>Mr Cavaco Silva</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, which had its
first meeting on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, would have to play more than just an advisory
role.
'<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is more than just the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>,' he said.
His remarks yesterday put <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> firmly on the side of countries such as
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> which want the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to play a more active
role.
<PERSON>Mr Cavaco Silva</PERSON> also said <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> needed a single currency to accompany the
internal market. However, he admitted it was now unlikely that monetary
union could take place before <DATE>1999</DATE>, compared with the earliest date
prescribed in the Maastricht treaty of <DATE>1997</DATE>.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders are likely to back <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> next
week as a compromise candidate to head the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>,
forerunner of a European central bank.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> was nominated for the post by <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> central bank governors
yesterday in a move which increases the likelihood of a deal at next week's
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> summit on the sensitive question of where to site the European
central bank. <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> is the leading contender.
But his selection, if confirmed, may disappoint enthusiasts for European
monetary union who were looking for a political heavyweight to give added
impetus to the process of economic and monetary integration.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will prepare for full European economic and monetary union by <DATE>1999</DATE>,
strengthening the co-ordination of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> members' monetary policies and
supervising all aspects of the development of a single currency.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>, a Belgian, is currently general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for
International Settlements</ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by 33 central banks. He would hold
the office of <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president for three years initially, beginning on <DATE>January
1, 1994</DATE>, when the next stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is due to start. He would not
necessarily become president of a European central bank.
The governors' recommendation was announced in a letter from <PERSON>Mr Wim
Duisenberg</PERSON>, head of the Dutch central bank and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> central
bank governors' committee, to <PERSON>Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene</PERSON>, the Belgian prime
minister, who will chair next week's summit.
EC leaders will consider the <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON> nomination along with bids for the
location of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> and the central bank, as well as lesser institutions.
EC finance ministers and the European parliament will be consulted on the
nomination before the summit, as required by the Maastricht treaty.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: Hurdles en route to Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the <PERSON>Danes</PERSON>' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> takes over as president of the
<ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>. Can <PERSON>John Major</PERSON> give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
IF THE Maastricht treaty were ratified, which now seems to depend mainly on
French voters, economic and monetary union would appear to be certain. Not
later than <DATE>January 1999</DATE> - just six and <DATE>a half years</DATE> from now - the <LOCATION>Ecu</LOCATION> is to
become the single currency of an economic and monetary union (<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>) covering
some members of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>.
Things are not quite that simple. Even before the Danish 'no' vote,
financial markets did not believe that an <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> embracing all members of the
<ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> would be established; or, if they did, believed that
substantial realignments of some currencies were likely to occur beforehand.
The Danish vote, however, has significantly changed the markets' views of
the odds only in the cases of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> itself, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
If <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, which are improbable initial participants, are left
aside, and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> is left aside as well, as a virtually certain one, the
financial markets currently divide <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> members into three groups vis a vis
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the country without whose presence <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is deemed pointless:
The <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, which has a long-term bond yield differential in relation
to German Bunds of three-tenths of a percentage point and thus an expected
depreciation against the D-Mark of a mere 2 per cent by <DATE>1999</DATE>.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, where long bond yield
differentials range from three-quarters of a percentage point in the case of
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, to <PERCENT>1.1 percentage points</PERCENT> in that of the UK. These imply overall
depreciations of between 5 and 7 per cent by <DATE>1999</DATE>.
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, where yield differentials are 4.1 percentage points and 5.1
percentage points, respectively. These imply expected depreciations of 23
and 28 per cent.
Once markets digested the Danish 'no', Dutch yield differentials have
declined. Those in the second group have increased rather little, by most in
the case of <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, which experienced a jump of about three-tenths of a
percentage point. But <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s differential has risen by almost four-tenths
of a point and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s by almost half a point.
Markets expect a high degree of exchange rate stability within the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>.
Their view is consistent with an <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> covering, in descending order of
probability: <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>
and the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>. Denmark would be able to join if it wished. But <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>
are deemed outside chances, like <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>.
How do these market expectations compare with the performance of countries
against the convergence criteria agreed at Maastricht? At present, only
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> meet all the criteria precisely. Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>
seems to be much too far away on the fiscal criteria.
But remember the escape clauses:
The government fiscal deficit can exceed 3 per cent of gross domestic
product, provided at the time of evaluation it has declined substantially
and continuously, reaching a level close to 3 per cent.
The ratio of government debt to GDP can exceed 60 per cent, provided it 'is
sufficiently diminishing' and approaching that level at a satisfactory pace.
If the criteria are not applied too strictly, the eight countries now most
favourably judged by the markets should be able to join. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> might be able
to join too.
It appears then that the convergence criteria, judged against current and
expected performance, would allow a move to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, even in <DATE>1997</DATE>. What could
still go wrong?
The Maastricht treaty could fail to be ratified.
Countries could refuse to do what they are committed to do, with the already
known exception of the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, One reason might be high unemployment, low growth
and a desire for large currency realignments. Another might be the German
desire to retain the D-Mark.
Such recantations, even just realignments, could create a serious crisis.
If, as now seems possible, the recantation would be by <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the crisis
could be terminal.
Yet even the end of the project for an <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> need not end hopes of greater
monetary integration within <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Moves towards irrevocably fixed exchange
rates without divergence bands would be possible. The financial markets are,
in fact, convinced that a high degree of stability is likely. It is up to
the governments to prove them right.

FT  08 OCT 93 / A caravan lost in the sands: Hard thinking on prospects for
European monetary union has begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a secluded hotel outside <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers
gather today for a strategy meeting that could also represent a session of
revelatory group therapy. For the first time since the <DATE>summer</DATE> monetary
crisis which led to the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate
mechanism, the ministers will discuss what went wrong, and what happens
next.
Although French and Belgian politicians have made intermittent statements
blaming 'Anglo-Saxon speculators' for the currency unrest, the public debate
on the lessons of the July-August debacle has barely begun.
But in private, there has been plenty of hard thinking about the future of
European monetary co-operation and the goal of economic and monetary union.
The question is whether the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> has the political will to chart a new course
to restore confidence in the project for economic and monetary union - or
whether European currencies will continue to drift apart.
The emergency agreement on <DATE>August 2</DATE> on wider <MONEY>15 per cent</MONEY> fluctuation bands
in the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> brought the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> a breathing space after the successive currency
upsets since <DATE>autumn 1992</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, the German chancellor, has forecast a slippage of 'a year or
two' in the Maastricht timetable. The <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>,
however, maintain that the band widening leaves the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> fundamentally on
track for the Maastricht aim of achieving <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>1997</DATE> at the earliest and
<DATE>1999</DATE> at the latest. In spite of discomfort in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> over the weakening of
the French franc's link with the D-Mark, this view is backed by the French
government.
<PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, the UK prime minister, has struck a jarring note by saying
the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> plan has 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same
potency' - a statement which has caused irritation in the <ORGANIZATION>EC Commission</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
In some German business and financial circles, there is agreement with <PERSON>Mr
Major</PERSON>'s view that the Maastricht timetable is unrealistic - but this is a
long way from the official line in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>.
One point seems to be undisputed: there will be no return to the old <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>, in
which most currencies fluctuated around a 2 1/4 per cent band, until the
recession on the Continent has clearly come to an end. Earlier hopes of a
progressive narrowing of the 15 per cent fluctuation bands by the end of the
year have been quietly dropped.
Yet the common European interest in monetary stability should not be
under-estimated. Most member states want to avoid competitive currency
devaluations - shown by the way that <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> members have not used their
new-found flexibility during the last two months to lower their currencies
significantly against the D-Mark.
Far less common ground exists on what might replace the old narrow-band <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>
which was supposed to represent the route to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EC Commission</ORGANIZATION> president, has toyed with the idea of
curbing currency speculation by placing exchange controls on speculative
borrowing. His sentiments are fairly widely shared on the continent, but his
suggestion has drawn criticism from the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, and even the French government
regards it as a non-runner.
Sir <PERSON>Leon Brittan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EC Commissioner</ORGANIZATION> for external affairs, has meanwhile urged
states to stick to the Maastricht objectives but to make use of their
greater exchange rate flexibility. He has called on countries such as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> to take advantage of the looser <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> arrangements to cut interest
rates and promote economic recovery.
In <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> is pinning its hopes on the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION>. It is to be set on <DATE>January 1, 1994</DATE> - at the beginning of
so-called 'stage two' of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> - as the forerunner of a future <ORGANIZATION>European
Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
One idea circulating in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> is that individual central banks should
pool resources so the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> can intervene to defend embattled currencies. This
idea is, however, rejected by the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, which wants to retain complete
autonomy before the planned establishment of a fully-fledged <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> central
bank.
A broader goal of most <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> governments is to use the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to help persuade the
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> take other countries' economies into account when taking interest
rate decisions. <PERSON>Mr Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON>, the Spanish prime minister, said this
week he hopes the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will ease the 'frustrations' of having to wait 'week
by week' for the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates.
So far, member states have failed to agree on the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s location or its
president. EC leaders will try to break the deadlock at a special summit on
<DATE>October 29</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> is expected to place the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
However sensitive the question of where to site the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, the real issue is
the drive by other <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> members to draw the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> into a more formal
system of monetary co-operation.
Much will depend on the state of the Franco-German alliance, which was badly
bruised during the <DATE>summer</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Horst Teltschik</PERSON>, former foreign policy adviser
to Chancellor <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>, and now a board member with the Munich-based <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> motor
group, describes French requests for unlimited support for the franc during
the monetary upset as irritating: 'They sometimes confuse our interests with
theirs,' he says.
One senior member of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> council singles out for criticism <PERSON>Mr
Edmond Alphandery</PERSON>, the French economics minister, over his much-publicised
call in <DATE>June</DATE> for the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates: 'He is a beginner,
and he made a beginner's mistakes.'
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> wanted to take advantage of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s perceived economic weakness
caused by reunification to push for greater monetary co-ordination. The
signs are that <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has not abandoned this strategy.
In <DATE>August</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Edouard Balladur</PERSON>, the French prime minister, persuaded <PERSON>Mr Kohl</PERSON>
to agree to a 'convergence' programme which <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> officials
believe could pave the way for more institutionalised co-operation.
The immediate outlook, however, for progress along the path towards <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
appears gloomy. Three obstacles are apparent.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s own post-unity problems. Large fiscal transfers from west to east
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> - currently more than DM150bn a year - will be needed for at least
another decade to maintain east German living standards. During this period
of strain for the 'anchor' economy in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is unlikely to be
politically or economically ready to subsume its D-Mark into a single
European currency.
The diminishing chances that member states can meet the Maastricht
convergence targets, set down as conditions for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. This year, general
government deficits across the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> will average about 6 per cent of GDP -
double the 3 per cent target set at Maastricht.
The increasing temptation for European countries to see exchange rate
flexibility as a means of solving economic problems. <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>
have shown that devaluation can be the clue to lowering interest rates and
restoring modest economic growth.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s position is crucial. It remains torn between its desire to maintain
a tight link with the D-Mark and its need to engineer an economic recovery.
The <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> government's cautious monetary policy since <DATE>August</DATE> has allowed
French long-term interest rates to fall again to German levels. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is
hoping for a faster lowering of German interest rates next year, and a
corresponding weakening of the D-Mark. But this is a gamble for the Balladur
government as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> heads towards the <DATE>1995</DATE> presidential elections.
The French strategy underlines how the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> remains the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s supreme
monetary arbiter. Mr <PERSON>Hans Tietmeyer</PERSON>, its new president, last week signalled
that the central bank's policies would remain geared to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s economic
priorities, not the rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
Thus for all the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>'s new-found flexibility, the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>'s
anti-inflation stubbornness could still cause difficulties. Some <ORGANIZATION>EC
Commission</ORGANIZATION> officials worry that members of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> 'hard-core' such as
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> will be unable to maintain their recent currency
stability unless they soon act to restore economic growth through more
aggressive cuts in interest rates. If these cuts do not materialise, these
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> officials believe, another currency upheaval could be in store - an
event which would postpone <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> until the next century.

EC LEADERS yesterday restored a semblance of unity to the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>
with a decision to base the future <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> as
part of a wide-ranging agreement on the location of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> institutions.
But the deal struck at a special European summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> followed an
acrimonious battle over the division of 'Euro-spoils', including veto
threats by the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> unless they got the European Agency for the
<ORGANIZATION>Evaluation of Medicinal Products</ORGANIZATION>.
After several hours of haggling, the prize went to the UK which immediately
praised the deal as creating several hundred jobs and confirming <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> as
a world leader in the pharmaceutical industry. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was given two sites as
a consolation prize - the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> trade-mark office and a new institution
responsible for monitoring health and safety.
The summit, chaired by the Belgian presidency of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, was called to
revive <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s faltering progress toward greater political and monetary
integration after the near failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The choice of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> as the location for the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>
 -the forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> - was seen as a minimum step
towards rebuilding credibility in <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION> after the <DATE>August 2</DATE>
currency crisis.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which stands to surrender the D-Mark under the Maastricht treaty at
the end of the century, fought tenaciously for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>.
Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>'s argument that the choice of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> was necessary
to reassure Germans about the loss of their symbol of post-war stability
carried the day over reservations from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> said <TIME>last night</TIME> the decision was 'a pity, not for the
City but for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, whose president will be <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, is the
institutional anchor for the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> due to begin on <DATE>January 1,
1994</DATE> under the Maastricht treaty.
With the treaty set to enter force on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders used the one-day
summit to pledge closer co-operation in foreign policy and the fight against
organised crime, as well as a broad endorsement of the goal of a European
monetary union by the end of the decade.
They steered clear of any new initiatives to tackle mass unemployment in
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, preferring to wait for the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s White Paper on
competitiveness, employment and growth which will be presented at the next
summit in <DATE>December</DATE>.
They also avoided a damaging row over the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION> world trade talks in
which <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is holding out for more concessions on farm trade. But the
final communique warned of the of the community 'turning in on itself.'
Despite relief that the log-jam over the location of more than 10 new
institutions had been broken, there was also an air of contrition among <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
leaders and a general admission that mistakes had been made before and after
the Maastricht agreement.

<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>ALEXANDRE Lamfalussy</PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>,
has promised to be a strong critic of 'unbalanced' economic policies which
threaten the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s objective of monetary union.
In the first public indication of how he sees his role - contained in
written answers to members of the <ORGANIZATION>European Parliament</ORGANIZATION> - <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> also
cast doubt on a return to the old European exchange rate mechanism, saying
he was not sure it was 'a realistic objective'.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> is due to appear tomorrow before the parliament's committee on
economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy. MEPs must deliver an
opinion on his candidacy before he can be formally confirmed as president of
the Frankfurt-based forerunner of a European central bank. He is currently
general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for International Settlements</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Basle</LOCATION>. His
written replies to the committee's questions were obtained yesterday by the
<ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will supervise the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, beginning on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>,
and advise <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> members on monetary and exchange rate policy leading up to
full currency union by <DATE>1999</DATE>.
In his reply to the parliament's questionnaire, <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>
would be more than just a passive observer of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> economic and monetary
policy.
In particular, he said he would be prepared to highlight any imbalances
between monetary and fiscal and other economic policies which could
jeopardise the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> aims. 'I shall make it my duty to draw attention to the
risks arising from an unbalanced policy mix,' he said.
He indicated he would be ready to act decisively if monetary and economic
policies appeared to be contradictory, and make full use of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s power
to encourage dialogue between central banks and governments.
'At a certain point . . . if and when divergencies persist, public opinion
should be made aware of potential conflicts and of their possible
consequences,' he said.
Referring to <DATE>August</DATE>'s decision to allow <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> currencies to fluctuate more
widely, <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> said the currency crises of the past 18 months had
removed the 'disciplinary framework' which had helped promote convergence of
monetary policies.
He said co-ordinating monetary policies effectively in such a situation
would be one of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s main challenges.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> 'should spare no effort' to prevent exchange rate fluctuations
undermining the single market, he said. But he added: 'I am sure that it
would not be advisable to set any precise timetable for re-establishing a
more constraining exchange rate mechanism.' Member states should wait until
the business cycle had improved and renewed progress could be made towards
'broadly based convergence'.

FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Now real debate on European union
begins - Vote is unlikely to end crisis of legitimacy surrounding the treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>DENMARK</LOCATION>'S decisive Yes to Maastricht will cause the political establishments
across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to breathe a sigh of relief. In the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, the result should tip
the scales decisively in favour of <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON> as he pushes the Maastricht
bill through its final stages in the UK parliament. Barring an upset in the
British or German courts, ratification seems secure.
Yet the Danish Yes is unlikely to end the crisis of legitimacy surrounding
the treaty. When <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed Maastricht in <DATE>December 1991</DATE>, they hailed
it as point of departure for European political and monetary union; but even
the latest Commission polls show public support for European integration is
tumbling.
The Danish endorsement does not amount to a true test of public support for
European union. The version of Maastricht which <ORGANIZATION>Danes</ORGANIZATION> approved yesterday
contains legally binding opt-outs on core elements of the treaty, including
the single European currency, European citizenship and defence policy.
A senior <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> official declares the treaty will have no
obvious impact on the fundamental problems facing the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> such as rising
unemployment, low investment, public spending crises in almost all the
member states and monetary instability.
The Danish Yes should free the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> and member-states to focus on the
<ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>'s pressing challenges: enlargement negotiations with <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>; the political and economic integration of the
former Communist countries of eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>; and the issue of European
competitiveness in relation to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, itself the subject of an
in-depth study ordered by <PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> president.
A senior <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> official listed several 'tests' for the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> in the coming
months: making the single market work, including the removal of lingering
restrictions on the free movement of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> citizens; concluding the <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>
Round in the <ORGANIZATION>Gatt</ORGANIZATION> trade talks; and ensuring stability inside the European
exchange rate mechanism so as to maintain the credibility of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> to
monetary union by <DATE>1999</DATE> at the latest.
Paradoxically, the Danish Yes may reignite the debate on European union. The
run-up to European parliament elections next year is an obvious launch-pad;
so, too, the sense among the European federalists that they no longer need
worry about frightening the minimalist <PERSON>Danes</PERSON> or the British as they edge
toward ratification. <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, which takes over the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> presidency from
<LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 1</DATE>, is in the lead.
<PERSON>Mr Alain Juppe</PERSON>, French foreign minister, is coming from a different
direction. In a speech to the French parliament yesterday, he spoke of a new
division of labour within the Community so that countries such as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> could take the lead on security matters. He also hinted
that the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> needed to make institutional changes to cope with 16 or more
members. The first clues on <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> thinking will probably come next
month when it offers an opinion on <LOCATION>Malta</LOCATION>'s request for membership.
Last <DATE>weekend</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, Belgian foreign minister, came out in
favour of watering down the strict Maastricht 'convergence' criteria for
monetary union - a move which would allow an inner core of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member states
to move forward to fixed exchange rates, but which would alarm the
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, which has insisted that Maastricht must be respected to the
letter.
All this may simply be letting off steam; but it may also suggest that the
debate on the future course of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> may be about to begin. For if
Euro-sceptics and Euro-enthusiasts agree on anything, it is that Maastricht
settled nothing.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Tietmeyer warning on Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>Mr Hans Tietmeyer</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, warned strongly yesterday
against rushing towards European monetary union before a joint monetary
policy had been worked out and full central banking independence achieved.
He was speaking the day after <PERSON>Mr Giovanni Ravasio</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s
director-general for economic and monetary affairs, had held out the
possibility of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> as early as <DATE>1997</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Tietmeyer</PERSON> said: 'I am convinced that
monetary policy integration in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> can only be the outcome of a lengthy
process.'
The struggle to devise the best monetary policy strategy and the right
instruments to implement this 'could prove to be even more difficult and
time-consuming than the preparations for issuing banknotes and coins,' he
warned in a speech to a <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> banking congress.
He said satisfactory monetary results could not be obtained without proper
independence for the future European central bank - it was indispensable to
have 'not only theoretical but also a far-reaching degree of actual
independence'.
The Maastricht treaty does not call for central banking independence until
stage three of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON>Mr Tietmeyer</PERSON> said it was 'crucial to enhance
the independence of national central banks at an early stage.'
The <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> and the central banks of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> are independent,
while the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> is subject to government control. Others are under
varying degrees of government influence.
The European central bank's independence could not be achieved at short
notice, he said.
On monetary policy, he criticised suggestions that an all-European, or
transnational, monetary target should be set now, in stage two of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. The
technical and institutional pre-conditions did not yet exist for an early
switch to a common monetary policy. Opinions on future policy also differed
widely.
<PERSON>Mr Tietmeyer</PERSON> was speaking in the week of the first council meeting of the
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI) at its new <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> headquarters. One of
its tasks is to recommend by the end of <DATE>1996</DATE> what type of inflation or money
supply targets should be pursued by the future central bank to achieve price
stability.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s goal is to produce a 'turnkey' European central bank that could
begin operating as soon as <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> receives the political go-ahead.
<PERSON>Mr Kenneth Clarke</PERSON>, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday supported
the objective of European economic and monetary union, but said the
timetable laid down by the Maastricht treaty for a single currency was
invalid, while <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, the UK prime minister, claimed the question of
a single currency did not arise at the moment.

<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> member states have turned a corner and could realistically consider the
prospect of a single European currency, <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, president
of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>,
declared yesterday.
Falling interest rates, low inflation and close monetary co-ordination among
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, <PERSON>Mr
Lamfalussy</PERSON> said. In one or two years, there could be some 'pleasant
surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and
monetary union.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>'s upbeat remarks to the European economic and social committee
in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> came ahead of weekend talks among <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers in
<LOCATION>Lindau</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Lake Constance</LOCATION>. They will discuss the procedures for dealing
with big national budget deficits, one of the most important tests for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
membership.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which holds the rotating <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> presidency, has signalled it is unhappy
with the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> recommendation to exclude <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> from the
'excessive deficits' rules. <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>, the only country which meets
<ORGANIZATION>Maastricht</ORGANIZATION>'s deficit criteria, is also excluded.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the
Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> does
not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with
bigger debt problems, such as <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, to become full <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> members.
The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s secretive monetary committee, meeting in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> yesterday, was
said to have approved <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> proposals for deficit reduction procedures
by <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> states other than <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a
'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s ruling Christian Democrat party and its <ORGANIZATION>CSU</ORGANIZATION> coalition partner
proposed last week that the hard core should consist of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> stressed it was too soon to predict which <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> members would be
ready to form a monetary union by <DATE>1997</DATE> or <DATE>1999</DATE>, the two dates named in the
Maastricht treaty.
Without mentioning <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president paid tribute to
countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation',
even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary
upheaval of 1992-93.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Plan to create 'dual anchor' for ERM: European Monetary
Institute to be urged to move more quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR <PERSON>Phillipe Maystadt</PERSON>, finance minister of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> which presides over the
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, yesterday hinted at a plan to create a 'dual anchor' for the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>, with
the D-Mark locked to a new form of 'hard' Ecu, or European currency unit.
The plan is due to be unveiled next month by the <ORGANIZATION>European Parliament</ORGANIZATION>'s
monetary affairs committee.
Its essence is that the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI), due to be set up
by <DATE>January</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>'s second stage, should assume more quickly the functions
of the European central bank it is meant to prefigure, by issuing and
managing the Ecu as a joint anchor to the system alongside the D-Mark.
The Ecu would be fixed against the D-Mark, with other <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> currencies having
their weighting in the Ecu 'basket' adjusted according to whether they
appreciated or devalued, but with much tighter monetary co-ordination, and
more joint intervention capability.
<PERSON>Mr Joao Cravinho</PERSON>, the Portuguese socialist and economist who has devised the
plan, has already discussed it with <PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION>
president, the Belgian presidency, the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, and the Spanish prime
minister, <PERSON>Mr Felipe Gonzalez</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is the country most worried that if hard
currency member states try to establish a mini-Emu to salvage something from
the wreckage, both the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> project and the single market will come apart.
The plan will include proposals that:
Member states turn over 20 per cent of their gold and foreign exchange
reserves to the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to manage;
The member states issue all new debt in <LOCATION>Ecus</LOCATION>;
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> assume joint responsibility for holding the
Ecu/D-Mark parity;
The Twelve set a joint 'interest rate indicator';
The Twelve evolve a joint incomes policy linking wage rises to productivity.
'If you're going to keep <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> on track the problem of the anchor (to the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>)
has to be tackled,' <PERSON>Mr Cravinho</PERSON> said.

meeting in <LOCATION>Lindau</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Lake Constance</LOCATION>, will discuss politically sensitive
procedures for dealing with big national budget deficits, one of the most
important tests for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> membership.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which holds the rotating <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> presidency, has signalled it is unhappy
with the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> recommendation to exclude <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> from the
'excessive deficits' rules. <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>, the only country which meets
<ORGANIZATION>Maastricht</ORGANIZATION>'s deficit criteria, is also excluded.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the
Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> does
not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with
bigger debt problems, such as <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, to become full <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> members.
The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s secretive monetary committee, meeting in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> yesterday, was
said to have approved <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> proposals for deficit reduction procedures
by <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> states other than <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a
'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>. The
ruling Christian Democrat party and its <ORGANIZATION>CSU</ORGANIZATION> coalition partner proposed last
week that the hard core should consist of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>.
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and the Benelux are often viewed as the most likely nucleus
of the planned monetary union. But <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> stressed it was too soon to
predict which <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> members would be ready to form a union by <DATE>1997</DATE> or <DATE>1999</DATE>, the
two dates named in the treaty.
Without mentioning <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president paid tribute to
countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation',
even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary
upheaval of 1992-93.
This turbulence, which led to the widening of fluctuation bands in the
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>August 1992</DATE>, appeared to be over, said <PERSON>Mr
Lamfalussy</PERSON>. However, he insisted that the wider <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> bands should be
preserved in order to defend currencies against speculative pressures.

summit settles wrangle over institutions

EC LEADERS yesterday restored a semblance of unity to the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>
with a decision to base the future <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankurt</LOCATION> as part
of a wide-ranging agreement on the location of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> institutions.
But the deal struck at a special European summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> followed an
acriminious battle over the division of Euro-spoils which included veto
threats by the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
The summit chaired by the Belgian presidency of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> was called to revive
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s faltering progress toward greater political and monetary
integration after the near failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The choice of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> as the location for the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>
 -the forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> - was seen as a minimum step
towards rebuilding credibility in <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION> after the <DATE>August 2</DATE>
currency crisis which led to the suspension of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which stands to surrender the D-Mark under the Maastricht treaty at
the end of the century, fought tenaciously for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut
Kohl</PERSON>'s argument that the choice of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> was necessary to reassure
Germans about the loss of their symbol of post-war stability carried the day
over reservations from <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> said <TIME>last night</TIME> the decision was 'a pity, not for the
<LOCATION>City</LOCATION> but for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>.'
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, whose president will be <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, is the
institutional anchor for the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> due to begin on <DATE>January 1,
1994</DATE> under the Maastricht treaty.
With the treaty set to enter force on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders used the one-day
summit to pledge closer co-operation in foreign policy and the fight against
organised crime, as well as a broad endorsement of the goal of a European
monetary union by the end of the decade.
EC leaders steered clear of any new initiatives to tackle mass unemployment
in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, preferring to wait for the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s White Paper on
competitiveness, employment and growth which will presented at the next
summit in <DATE>December</DATE>.
They also avoided a damaging row over the <LOCATION>Uruguay Round</LOCATION> world trade talks in
which <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> is holding out for more concessions on farm trade.
Despite relief that the log-jam over the location of more than 10 new
institutions had been broken, there was also an air of contrition among <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
leaders and a general admission that mistakes had been made before and after
the agreement on the Maastricht.
<PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, president of the European commission, said: 'In future,
all the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s insititutions must be careful to be more transparent. This is a
pre-condition for the progress of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.'
During protracted lunchtime haggling yesterday, both the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>
threatened to veto the sites package unless they got the European Agency for
the <ORGANIZATION>Evaluation of Medicinal Products</ORGANIZATION>.
After several hours, the prize went to the UK which immediately praised the
deal as creating several hundred jobs and confirming <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> as a world
leader in the pharmaceutical industry. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was given two sites as the
consolation prize - the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> trade-mark office and a new institution
responsible for monitoring health and safety.

<TEXT>
The <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, expected to be established on <DATE>January 1</DATE> to
supervise the move towards economic and monetary union, will lead a phantom
existence for the first six months of its life.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, forerunner of a European central bank, will be based in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
But its shareholders - national central banks from <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> countries
 -will take at least until the end of next month to decide where to house
the institute.
The provisional nature of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s initial running arrangements symbolises
the faltering progress towards <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> after the emergency widening of
fluctuation bands forced by the <DATE>summer</DATE> currency crisis.
Governors of the 12 central banks will hold a formal inaugural meeting of
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>January 11</DATE> in the rebuilt fifteenth century <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> city hall.
At least until the <DATE>summer</DATE>, though, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will be run from <LOCATION>Basle</LOCATION>,
headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for International Settlements</ORGANIZATION> and the site of the
present 34-strong secretariat of the committee of European central bank
governors.
That means that <PERSON>Mr Andrew Crockett</PERSON>, who takes over as <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION> general manager on
<DATE>January 1</DATE>, will 'cohabit' for several months in <LOCATION>Basle</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Mr Alexandre
Lamfalussy</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s president-designate, and the <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION>'s current general
manager.
<PERSON>Mr Crockett</PERSON>, at present the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>'s international director, was
selected in the <DATE>autumn</DATE> to succeed <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is looking for an office that will hold no more than 150 to 250
people. A larger site capable of housing a fully-fledged central bank has
been ruled out.
Although no budget for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s first-year costs has been drawn up, central
banks are expected to face a 'nasty surprise' on the high cost of
refurbishment, according to one well-informed official. In particular, it
includes the task of equipping the chosen office for the task of holding
three simultaneous round-table meetings of European central bankers.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is expected to employ between 130 and 150 staff by the end of <DATE>1994</DATE>,
many of whom will be seconded from central banks. Most will be economists
and statisticians.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will pool information about European financial developments, help to
harmonise monetary statistics and instruments, and host regular meetings of
European central bankers.
During the so-called stage two of the move to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, which begins on <DATE>January
1</DATE>, monetary decision-making will remain in the hands of national central
banks. Joint decisions on monetary policy will not be made until the
irrevocable fixing of exchange rates under stage three of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. According to
the Maastricht treaty, that is due between <DATE>1997</DATE> and <DATE>1999</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will take over some of the technical arrangements for running the
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION> which are at present handled by the <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION>.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): Optimism about union dims -
Europe has embarked on the arduous task of making Emu a reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAMA is over; now comes the hard work. After the excitement of the
Maastricht summit at the end of <DATE>last year</DATE> which settled on the terms for
European economic and monetary union, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has embarked on the arduous
task of making <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> a reality.
In its third and final phase, <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is aimed at ushering in a single currency
for a large part of western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Monetary policy across the region would
be set by a new <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> (ECB).
According to the Maastricht timetable, the final phase is to start up
between <DATE>1997</DATE> and <DATE>1999</DATE>. It would involve a core group of countries - not
necessarily the whole of the existing <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> - with membership
of the union set by which countries wish to join and how many meet the
economic criteria.
As a prelude to phase three, stage two of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is intended to start in <DATE>1994</DATE>
with the creation of a <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI). This body will be
based on the existing committee of European central bank governors, and will
oversee policy co-ordination and preparation for the final phase.
Ultimately, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> would evolve into the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION>.
Progress towards <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> has been disrupted by a variety of developments:
Political arguments. In several community nations a debate has broken out -
rather late, given the detail of the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> protocol sketched out at <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION>
 -about whether handing over monetary sovereignty to the new pan-European
central bank is in their interests. Discussion along these lines will
surface during the rest of the year, when the Maastricht treaty is due to be
ratified in all 12 <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries.
Particular worries are being expressed in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> - <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s strongest
economic power - over whether <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s interests will best be served by
giving up the D-Mark for the uncertainties of a single European currency. It
looks as though the Maastricht terms will be subject to ratification by the
German parliament around <DATE>1996</DATE>.
This will probably give <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> the same powers to opt out of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
has by dint of the special treaty clause which it negotiated at Maastricht.
Since an <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> without <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would look like Hamlet without the Prince, the
rumblings from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> could easily scupper the project.
High borrowing. Inflationary forces in several <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries remain strong,
much of this due to the rising prices sparked in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> by unification in
<DATE>1990</DATE>. That has led the <ORGANIZATION>German Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> to increase interest rates, leading
to tight monetary policies across much of the rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and weakening
growth prospects.
As a result, several European countries, particularly <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, may find it difficult to reduce government borrowing quickly enough
to meet the tough fiscal targets set as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> timetable. According
to the Maastricht fiscal policy criteria, countries should bring down their
budget deficits to no more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product while
outstanding government debt is required not to exceed 60 per cent of GDP.
Effects of high interest rates. The high German rates have - due to
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s anchor role in the European Monetary System - required other
countries to keep their borrowing rates high also. Some regard this
development as underlining the inherent lack of flexibility in semi-fixed or
fixed exchange rate systems. They contend the problems would be still worse
in a monetary union with only one currency for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. In the past year or
so the problems of high German interest rates have been particularly intense
for countries such as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> which in all cases would
probably have liked to cut rates to stimulate their flagging economies.
Role of the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION>. There remains much work to be done on defining the powers
of the bank - especially in the area of financial regulation and acting as a
lender of last resort. If the bank is to function efficiently, it may also
need to play a part in the area of pan-European fiscal policy, a role which
could place it in conflict with national governments.
Lack of economic convergence. <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> will make sense only if the nations that
seek to enter a union have similar economic performances, as measured by
criteria such as growth and inflation. The Maastricht protocol set out tough
specific criteria that have to be met if countries want to join <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. These
include the stipulation that average inflation over one year in each member
nation should be within <PERCENT>1 1/2 percentage points</PERCENT> of the rate of the three or
fewer European countries where inflation is lowest.
But there is a question mark over the number of countries likely to make
progress in moving closer to each other on such criteria. In particular,
this could make it difficult for some of the southern European nations such
as <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> to qualify.
If such countries made such a determined effort to meet the inflation
criteria that they opted for policies which led to large rise in
unemployment, then it could be argued that the social costs of meeting the
<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> conditions are too high.
Practical details. No one has worked out the arrangements for minting or
printing the coins and notes of the new European currency units. Also to be
settled would be the way in which pounds, D-Marks and francs  - assuming
these currencies are ultimately subsumed in a monetary union - are replaced
by the new currency. The decisions would have to focus not only on ordinary
transactions at the consumer level but on arrangements for financial markets
covering currencies and bonds. Bearing in mind the huge disruption which can
be entailed by just one nation changing currency - as happened in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1971</DATE> when it introduced a new decimal coinage - the potential for
difficulties in this area could be immense.
Emu optimists can, however, point to one area where the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> process has got
off to a reasonable start. The exchange rate mechanism of the <ORGANIZATION>European
Monetary System</ORGANIZATION> has proved successful in keeping its 10 member currencies
within set limits according to either 6 per cent or 2.25 per cent
fluctuation bands. The <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> is a vital part of planning for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>; assuming <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
proceeds as planned at <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION>, ultimately the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> should disappear to be
replaced by a system of irrevocably locked exchange rates. In other words,
the room for fluctuation in the current bands would be brought down to zero,
leading to the single currency.

SIX Christian Democrat leaders headed by Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> <TIME>last night</TIME>
agreed in principle to convene a special <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summitimmediately after full
ratification of the Maastricht treaty to relaunch the drive to political and
monetary union.
The move underlines impatience among federalist-minded Europeans at the
delay in ratifying the treaty and their determination to put all aspects of
Maastricht into force, whatever the reservations in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
Meeting in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> yesterday were the heads of government of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> as well as the Italian
foreign minister.
<PERSON>Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s prime minister, said <TIME>last night</TIME> the summit
could help end uncertainty about the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s future. 'It would send a message
to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that we know where we are going.'
A more specific goal would be to settle the site of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, forerunner of a European central bank in the planned monetary
union (<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>).
Prospects for agreement at next month's <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION> are
considered slim, but the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is due to start operation next <DATE>January 1</DATE> - the
official launch of the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
The idea of an special summit emerged during talks between Chancellor Kohl,
President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON>, and Prime Minister <PERSON>Edouard Balladur</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
which ended in <LOCATION>Beaune</LOCATION> yesterday. The Christian Democrat leaders gave the
initiative broad support without taking a final decision.
<PERSON>Mr Dehaene</PERSON>, who will chair <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> heads of government meetings when <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>
takes over the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> presidency on <DATE>July 1</DATE>, said he needed to discuss it with
his coalition partners.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Europe's new monetary forum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At a season associated with the arrival of wise men, the establishment of a
new institution to supervise European monetary arrangements might be
heralded as a sign of hope. The <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> is being
formally set up on <DATE>January 1</DATE> as part of the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION>'s so-called
'second stage' of progress towards economic and monetary union. By
concentrating on a few necessary tasks, firmly defined by governments and
central banks, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> can improve the prospects for successful monetary
integration.
Conceived as an embryonic European central bank, the institute will have to
lower its sights from the ideas that inspired its creation. An important
priority will be to improve co-ordination within the present <ORGANIZATION>European
Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>, which is a long way from carrying out its original and
still badly needed function of providing a stable exchange rate environment
for European business.
In view of the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> disturbances since <DATE>autumn 1992</DATE>, along with other setbacks
to the Maastricht timetable for a single currency, the gestation period for
the new monetary body has been highly problematic. Because of delays in
deciding to place the institute in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will not even be able to
move to a permanent home in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> before the <DATE>summer</DATE>.
In <DATE>1988-89</DATE>, when plans for setting up the institute were first laid, the
<ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, backed by the French and Italian governments, wanted it
to carry out some fully-fledged central banking operations. This idea has
been watered down, above all because of opposition from the German
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>. Monetary decision-making will remain the preserve of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s
12 member central banks. French-backed proposals for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to help manage
currency reserves look unlikely to get off the ground.
Harmonisation drive
The task of <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s designated president, will
thus be to assemble a staff of statisticians and economists, rather than to
wield power.
This does not mean that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will not have a job to do. First, it will
have to accomplish detailed technical work to prepare for the harmonisation
of monetary statistics and money market instruments that forms an essential
precondition for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. If the harmonisation drive leads to an increase in
efficiency of different countries' monetary systems, then the benefits would
extend beyond making <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> more viable.
Second, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> can provide a forum for general debate on European monetary
matters. <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> sees the need to uphold the consensus on the
desirability of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, but he also has the experience and independence to
speak plainly about the hurdles that lie in its path. He will be helped in
his task of nurturing public understanding of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s unhealthily secretive
central banking system, if the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is required to publish detailed minutes
of its monthly meetings of central bank governors.
Vital arbiter
Third, in a less high-profile role, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president can function as an
arbiter, providing advice and assistance to member countries. The
misunderstandings and mismanagement evident during the monetary system
flare-ups in <DATE>September 1992</DATE> and <DATE>July-August 1993</DATE> could have been lessened
had an intermediary been on hand to adjudicate between countries pursuing
different monetary priorities, or even to ensure that rival positions were
clearly communicated and understood.
After the upsets of the past 17 months, it seems still more likely than
before that <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, if it takes place at all, will be reached first by a
relatively small group of countries willing to combine a lasting political
commitment to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> with a readiness to gear their monetary policies to
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s. If monetary convergence stops short of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, the task of managing
that process will require expertise and sensitivity of the highest order.
Creating a new institute will not, by itself, solve <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s monetary
problems. But if it can successfully combine the roles of trouble-shooter
and think-tank, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will have a good chance of bringing <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> closer to
objectives that individual central banks are incapable of fulfilling. It is
a welcome addition to the institutional landscape of the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
<PERSON>MR JACQUES DELORS</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, will today begin a
campaign to breathe life into the Maastricht treaty to build up momentum
ahead of <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s special <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
Working with the Belgian Presidency of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON> will call for
closer macro-economic co-operation and a strengthening of the faltering <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
'growth' initiative at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers today in
<LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>.
The meeting marks the start of an intensive round of European diplomacy
which could end on <DATE>Friday</DATE> with a decision on the site of a future <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> central
bank, more openness in the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>, and new 'joint actions' to intensify
humanitarian operations in former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> and monitor the parliamentary
elections in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> set for <DATE>December</DATE>.
However, the summit could still be clouded by disagreements over
implementation of economic and monetary union. <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, the British
prime minister, yesterday dismissed attempts by some of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s European
partners to re-establish the Maastricht timetable for a single currency as
'folly'.
He also indicated <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would strongly resist any watering down of the
economic convergence criteria for economic and monetary union, saying the
criteria - covering such things as relative inflation rates and the size of
public sector deficits - were 'desirable in their own right'.
<PERSON>Mr Kenneth Clarke</PERSON>, UK chancellor, is expected to reinforce that point at
today's meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers by telling colleagues that
the criteria have a role independent of the proposed timetable for a single
currency in promoting sustainable economic growth.
Elsewhere, the pre-summit mood has been improved by the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>'s
unexpected decision to trim short-term interest rates by half a point.
However, member states such as <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> remain wary of cutting
rates for fear of breaking their link with the D-Mark in spite of the
increased flexibility offered by wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the
European exchange rate mechanism,
<PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON> views <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s summit as a chance to relaunch the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> after
months of drift caused by the delay in ratification of Maastricht. He wants
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders to agree to closer macro-economic co-operation exploiting the
provisions of the treaty.
At today's <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> meeting, finance ministers will put the final touches
to legislation allowing the second stage of Europeon monetary union to begin
on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>. This would also create the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>,
the precursor of the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>.

<FP=106> [Editorial: "<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s New Monetary Forum"] </F>
  [Text] At a season associated with the arrival of wise men, 
the establishment of a new institution to supervise European 
monetary arrangements might be heralded as a sign of hope. The 
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> [EMI] is being formally set up on 
<DATE>January 1</DATE> as part of the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>'s so-called second stage 
of progress towards economic and monetary union. By 
concentrating on a few necessary tasks, firmly defined by 
governments and central banks, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> can improve the prospects 
for successful monetary integration. 
  Conceived as an embryonic European central bank, the 
institute will have to lower its sights from the ideas that 
inspired its creation. An important priority will be to improve 
co-ordination within the present European Monetary System [EMS], 
which is a long way from carrying out its original and still 
badly needed function of providing a stable exchange rate 
environment for European business. 
  In view of the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> disturbances since <DATE>autumn 1992</DATE>, along 
with 
other setbacks to the Maastricht timetable for a single 
currency, the gestation period for the new monetary body has 
been highly problematic. Because of delays in deciding to place 
the institute in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will not even be able to move 
to a permanent home in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> before the <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
  In <DATE>1988-89</DATE>, when plans for setting up the institute were 
first laid, the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, backed by the French and 
Italian governments, wanted it to carry out some fully-fledged 
central banking operations. This idea has been watered down, 
above all because of opposition from the German <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>. 
Monetary decisionmaking will remain the preserve of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s 
12 member central banks. French-backed proposals for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to 
help manage currency reserves look unlikely to get off the 
ground. 
<H5>  Harmonisation Drive </H5>
  The task of <PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s designated 
president, will thus be to assemble a staff of statisticians and 
economists, rather than to wield power. 
  This does not mean that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will not have a job to do. 
First, it will have to accomplish detailed technical work to 
prepare for the harmonisation of monetary statistics and money 
market instruments that forms an essential precondition for <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>Economic Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION>]. If the harmonisation drive leads to 
an increase in efficiency of different countries' monetary 
systems, then the benefits would extend beyond making <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> more 
viable. 
  Second, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> can provide a forum for general debate on 
European monetary matters. <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> sees the need to 
uphold the consensus on the desirability of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>, but he also has 
the experience and independence to speak plainly about the 
hurdles that lie in its path. He will be helped in his task of 
nurturing public understanding of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s unhealthily secretive 
central banking system, if the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is required to publish 
detailed minutes of its monthly meeting of central bank 
governors. 
<H5>  Vital Arbiter </H5>
  Third, in a less high-profile role, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president can 
function as an arbiter, providing advice and assistance to 
member countries. The misunderstandings and mismanagement 
evident during the monetary system flare-ups in <DATE>September 1992</DATE> 
and <DATE>July-August 1993</DATE> could have been lessened had an 
intermediary been on hand to adjudicate between countries 
pursuing different monetary priorities, or even to ensure that 
rival positions were clearly communicated and understood. 
  After the upsets of the past 17 months, it seems still more 
likely than before that <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>, if it takes place at all, will be 
reached first by a relatively small group of countries willing 
to combine a lasting political commitment to <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> with a 
readiness to gear their monetary policies to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s. If 
monetary convergence stops short of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>, the task of managing 
that process will require expertise and sensitivity of the 
highest order. 
  Creating a new institute will not, by itself, solve <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s 
monetary problems. But if it can successfully combine the roles 
of trouble-shooter and think-tank, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will have a good 
chance of bringing <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> closer to objectives that individual 
central banks are incapable of fulfilling. It is a welcome 
addition to the institutional landscape of the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION>.

FT  24 OCT 94 / People: Europe's realistic banker - Alexandre Lamfalussy of
the European Monetary Institute explains his hopes for monetary union to
Peter Norman and Andrew Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are busy days for <PERSON>Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>European
Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>. After 10 months squatting in buildings belonging to the
Basle-based <ORGANIZATION>Bank for International Settlements</ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of the
planned European central bank is about to move to its new home in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>
and start working at full speed.
From the 35th floor of an office block re-christened the 'Eurotower',
<PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON> will preside over a staff of around 150, who will be charged with
making possible European monetary union according to the procedures laid
down by the Maastricht treaty.
It is a two-pronged task. The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s job is to make the preparations needed
for setting up the European System of Central Banks and, with that, a single
monetary policy and single currency, if and when the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> moves to the third
and final stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
The institute also has to help prepare for Stage 3 by co-ordinating monetary
policy among the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s 12 central banks and promoting the convergence of the
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> member states' economies on a path of sustained low inflationary growth
in the present Stage 2 of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
Although the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is about 10 months behind schedule - thanks to prolonged
wrangling among <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> countries over its eventual site - <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON>
is hopeful it will be able to achieve its goals.
Interviewed in his still-temporary headquarters in the <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION>, he says: 'Things
are not as negative as they looked a year ago. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is enjoying a
broad-based, non-inflationary recovery. If this goes on for two to three
years it will create a climate which at least provides a framework for the
political decisions to move ahead.'
Like most Belgians, the 65-year-old <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON> is a card-carrying <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
enthusiast. In his previous capacity as <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION> general manager, he was a member
of the Delors committee of central bankers that in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> plotted
the three-stage route march to monetary union, later adopted in the
Maastricht treaty.
But <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON> is also a realist. Achieving <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>1997</DATE>, the earliest
possible date envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, he says 'is not very
plausible' because it is difficult to imagine seven of the 12 <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> member
states fulfilling the treaty's strict economic convergence criteria by then.
On the other hand, his belief is that there will eventually be a European
central bank 'in five, six or 10 years' time.'
'The degree of internationalisation and integration of our economies is so
fast and the European single market is moving ahead so fast and is going so
deep, that so many vested interests will want stable exchange rates,' he
says.
His gut feeling, speaking as an economist, is that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> will be unable to
stand aside from <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. But whether the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> joins <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is a matter of high
politics. The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> has to focus on nitty-gritty matters and achieve agreement
on such technically difficult issues as the preparation of banknotes to be
used after the introduction of a single currency, as well as the drawing up
of common features of payments systems in the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>.
A potentially difficult issue is management of the single monetary policy.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> is actively promoting the notion that the proposed European
central bank should follow its example and set monetary policy according to
a money supply measure, while the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> is promoting its more
eclectic approach of steering policy according to an inflation target.
Here, too, <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON> is relatively sanguine. There is, he explains, 'no
cleavage in ideology' among the European central bank governors that make up
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s council. All agree on the need for low inflation and the paramount
importance of governments reducing their fiscal deficits.
There may be different techniques of monetary management but there are also
similarities. The <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>, for example, looks at narrow and broad
money figures as part of its policy for controlling inflation.
Reconciling differences will be a big part of <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON>'s job at the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>.
As president, he is both chief executive officer and chairman of the board.
His task will be 'to make sure things are going to happen,' driving the
technical committees - comprised of <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> staffers and national central bank
officials - so that they come with answers to problems.
He has been able to hand-pick his senior staff and has managed to avoid
placing people in posts according to national quotas.
Although Frankfurt-based, the institute's working language will be English.
But language will be the least of <ORGANIZATION>Lamfalussy</ORGANIZATION>'s problems. He has perfected
his English since a spell as a research student at <ORGANIZATION>Nuffield College</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>,
in the <DATE>1950s</DATE>. That was shortly after he fled to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> at the
age of 20 to escape communism.
He was a bank economist and academic until the mid-1970s, when he became an
executive director and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Banque de Bruxelles</ORGANIZATION>. He joined the
<ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE> and was general manager of the central bankers' bank from <DATE>1985</DATE>
until the end of <DATE>last year</DATE>.
He can claim to be the inventor of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> because, as a member of the
Delors committee, he proposed that <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s central banks should create a
joint subsidiary to advance the progress of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> in Stage 2.
The job of running the institute is 'different from anything else I have
ever done before,' he says. He admits that he had more power as <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION> general
manager because, as the man in charge of the central bankers' bank, he was
'living the markets' and had to take banking decisions.
It is the banking that he misses most: 'It was great fun, of great interest,
and it gave me, as an economist, a lot of feedback'.
On the other hand he believes he has much greater influence as head of the
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. 'I have a much more politically exposed profile, there is no doubt
about that. Even if you define the job in a narrow technical way, it still
has very deep political connotations.'
Then there is challenge of building a new institution. 'I have never built
an institution in my life. You can't imagine what it means to build up
something from scratch. It is a very, very full time job.
'I am trying to use the present relatively calm waters to make the
institution function, to build up its staff and working methods. If and when
a crisis breaks, we will see how I shall be able to handle it'.
Lamfalussy has been appointed for three years. At the moment he has no
intention of seeking to extend his term beyond <DATE>1996</DATE>.
But given <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s recent turbulent monetary history there is no guarantee
that he will avoid adding crisis management to his workload.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Race for Europe's central bank hots up: An acrimonious
tussle between governments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN <PERSON>Mr Jacques Chirac</PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, entertained Sir <PERSON>Brian Jenkins</PERSON>, Lord
Mayor of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, to lunch last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the two men had <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY>
on their minds.
Sir <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, accompanied by <PERSON>Mr Pen Kent</PERSON>, an associate director at
the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>, as part of a Pounds 1.5m campaign by the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> to try to
bring the future European central bank (ECB) to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
It was the latest move in an acrimonious tussle over the site of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s
planned supranational monetary institution, a dispute primarily pitting
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> against <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which has lodged a strong bid to make <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> the
<ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION>'s home.
Under plans for European monetary union (<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>) by the end of the century, the
<ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION> would operate interest rate policies across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and pool huge
quantities of foreign exchange reserves. At stake is not simply the prestige
of hosting the bank which controls European money, but also the additional
financial business activity which could be brought in its wake.
EC heads of government are scheduled to decide on the issue by the end of
the year, possibly at the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>. Initially they
have to choose a site for the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI), the
embryonic central bank which is due to open its doors at the start of stage
two of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will be converted into a fully-fledged central bank when the third
and final stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> starts  - either in <DATE>1997</DATE> or in <DATE>1999</DATE>, on present <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
plans.
Because of the complexities of the problem  - which also involves decisions
on the sites of a number of other European institutions  - the matter may
drag on into next year. The <ORGANIZATION>Paris Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, for instance, says
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> will block any decision on the site of the central bank until the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
agrees that <LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION> will be the permanent home of the European
parliament.
Central bankers warn that postponement would greatly damage chances of
choosing staff and facilities for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in time for its planned start-up.
<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> has not put in a bid to attract the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION>, although both <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> and
<LOCATION>Strasbourg</LOCATION> are contenders. But <PERSON>Mr Chirac</PERSON>, as one of the leaders of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s
right-wing opposition, will play a role in forming public opinion on the
issue.
Sir <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> met <PERSON>Mr Chirac</PERSON> above all to try to enlist <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s support to stop
the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION> going to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> have
energetically backed <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, arguing that a decision in the city's favour
is necessary to combat unease in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> about giving up the D-Mark.
A more likely outcome of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s high-profile campaigning, however, will be
to encourage <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> governments to place the bank in a city outside one of the
continent's three largest financial centres. This would prevent either
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> claiming that one of the other centres was
clinching an unfair competitive advantage.
On this reckoning, <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> is a clear favourite as a compromise.
'People know that smaller countries get their chance when larger countries
disagree. Then the choice should be for <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION>,' says one Dutch official.
If <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> was held to infringe the competitive status of, say, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>,
then a still more modest financial centre  - <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>  - would come into
the running.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s insistent pro-Frankfurt stance is prompting criticism from other
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> countries. One top European central banker  - from a country not seeking
for itself the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION> site  - said: 'They (the Germans) are bringing it to a
level at which it is difficult to have a reasonable discussion.'
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s candidature, on the other hand, is greeted with derision from
German officials. They point out that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is the only <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> country not to
have declared its willingness to proceed to the (final) stage three of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is stepping up the drumbeat in favour of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> has stopped
short of suggesting it will not ratify the Maastricht treaty unless the
<ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> opts for <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr Theo Waigel</PERSON>, the finance minster, has
however said that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> will find it more difficult to accept a single
European currency unless the decision-making centre is <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
According to <PERSON>Mr Martin Kohlhaussen</PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Commerzbank</ORGANIZATION>, the
third largest German bank, <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> is the 'obvious and logical' choice. In
view of the symbolic importance of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> as the home of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Mr Kohlhaussen</PERSON> argues that a vote for any other city would appear as if
'stability as the precondition of a hard currency was no longer seen as so
important'.
Central bankers point out that, for money dealing purposes, the geographical
location of the bank is irrelevant.
The decision will be a matter of pure politics. Other matters, for instance
on the application of the Maastricht criteria drawn up to decide which
countries should join <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, are economically more important. The wrangling
indicates, however, that  - nearly five years before the earliest date at
which monetary union could actually start - the political consensus behind
<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is still remarkably fragile.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Economics Notebook: No need to rush through Ecu timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Democracies are notoriously bad at making long-term plans.
So it is not surprising that between the Danish 'no' vote in <DATE>June</DATE> and the
French referendum on <DATE>September 20</DATE>, few policymakers seem to be thinking hard
about more distant issues relating to European economic and monetary union.
Admittedly, the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> is heavy going. But while last week's
opinion polls in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> showed a slip in support for Maastricht, the odds
must still be in favour of a French 'yes' vote.
In these circumstances, European finance ministries and central banks should
be thinking hard about the many difficult issues still to be solved along
the route to a single European Currency Unit and central bank. And arguably,
no nation should be giving more thought to the minutiae of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> than <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.
The Maastricht Treaty determined that the Ecu should be the eventual
European currency but left much else unclear about the final shape of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
and about how much responsibility for managing it will be left to the
individual <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> states.
Since Maastricht, much attention has focused on the need for governments to
agree a home for the proposed <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> and its forerunner, the
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>. As the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is due to start preparing the
community for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1994</DATE>, the timetable is looking tight. The showdown on
this issue is due at the next European summit in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> in <DATE>December</DATE>.
But there are other big problems. The contours of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s future monetary
policy are still unclear, including the amount of responsibility to be left
to national central banks under the principle of subsidiarity, which calls
for decisions to be taken at the lowest possible level of government.
These questions at least are being considered by experts reporting to the
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s committee of central bank governors. The governors have also asked a
committee to start considering the potentially emotive issue of the design
of future EC-wide bank notes.
Other matters concerning the Ecu seem to be in limbo. EC states will have to
agree on names for the 10th or 100th parts of the Ecu, a matter ignored in
the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.
Computers and accounting systems will need to be adapted to <LOCATION>Ecu</LOCATION>.
Each <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> country will need a full legislative framework defining the Ecu and
making it legal tender.
A recent report from the Association for the <ORGANIZATION>Monetary Union of Europe</ORGANIZATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Barclays Bank</ORGANIZATION> gives an idea of what the change to the Ecu could entail for
companies. 'Thinking and planning for the single currency needs to start
now,' it said.
No wonder. The report urged each company to set up an internal working group
to address the change. Such groups, reporting to the main board, should
include people involved in 'purchasing, marketing, pricing and sales;
borrowing, investing, lending, treasury management, accounting; contracts
and legal affairs and information systems'. Banks would have to review the
impact of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> on matters ranging from foreign exchange, capital markets to
automatic cash dispensers. Retailers would have to examine stock management
and point of sales systems.
While the treaty envisages <DATE>1997</DATE> as the earliest deadline for monetary union,
<DATE>1999</DATE> appears a more likely date. But <DATE>1999</DATE> is not so far away in view of the
complex problems to be solved. British decimalisation, a relatively easy
affair, took five years' planning. Some officials believe it could take 10
years to complete the technical work to implement <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>. Even then, there
would be no guarantee that abandonment of national currencies such as the
D-Mark or sterling in favour of the Ecu would be politically acceptable to
the peoples of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
These factors are prompting some monetary officials to question the present
plans for stage three of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, which envisage irrevocably locking parities
and then moving as quickly as possible to the Ecu as the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s single
currency. Instead, they believe that the community should not rush to leave
stage '3A' in which a European system of central banks would operate a
single monetary policy but retain national currencies at permanently fixed
exchange rates.
One obvious loss from not moving to a single currency would be the continued
need for travellers to change bank notes at national frontiers. But truely
fixed parities would reduce transaction costs to a minimum. Most travellers
would pay costs abroad with credit or cash cards. Big businesses could
behave as if the Ecu were already the European currency.
The big advantage of an extended stage 3A would be political. EC countries
could wait for companies to adapt and popular support to grow in favour of
the Ecu and so avoid the tensions and backlashes - possibly amounting to the
rejection of governments by their electorates  - that imposing a strange,
unfamiliar money might produce if the D-Mark, sterling or French franc were
to be removed overnight.
For <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON> such an approach would have the attraction of taking on
some of the spirit of the UK government's earlier evolutionary approach to
<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> which he espoused when chancellor.
But an extended stage 3A would have to be negotiated. The <ORGANIZATION>EC Commission</ORGANIZATION> and
the 'Club Med' nations led by <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> could be expected to oppose
the idea.
A useful start for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> would be to recognise that the battle to base the
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> is lost and that the bank will go to <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> just as
soon as the German government decides to drop its formal support for
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
If <PERSON>Mr Major</PERSON> is really serious about placing <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> at the 'heart of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'
he could then start pressing for an extended stage 3A in an economic and
monetary union that would stand a better chance of gaining support in the
<ORGANIZATION>Tory Party</ORGANIZATION> and parliament.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (30): Chrysalis of a Bank of Europe -
Peter Norman explains the significance of Frankfurt's European Monetary
Institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s pivotal role in the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> and Chancellor
<PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>'s passion for greater European integration, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is poorly
endowed with <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> institutions.
The move of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> to its new <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>
headquarters this month goes some way to redressing the balance.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> has been set up to prepare the planned European System of <ORGANIZATION>Central
Banks</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>ESCB</ORGANIZATION>) which will be established if and when the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> fulfils the
promises of the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> and moves to the third and final stage of
economic and monetary union, with a single currency and single monetary
policy.
Meanwhile, the institute exists to strengthen the co-ordination of monetary
policy among the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s 12 central banks and promote economic convergence
among member States so they can meet the tough criteria which the treaty has
prescribed for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> membership.
<PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president, and about 75 staff have
installed themselves in an imposing city centre tower block that was
formerly the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank</ORGANIZATION> fur Gemeinwirtschaft. Last week's
meeting in the rechristened 'Eurotower' of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s governing council,
which comprises the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> central bank governors and <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>, was a
signal that the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s newest institution had begun work in earnest after 10
months of preparation in borrowed office space provided by the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for
International Settlements</ORGANIZATION> (BIS) in <LOCATION>Basle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>, who moved from being general manager of the <ORGANIZATION>BIS</ORGANIZATION> to take over
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> presidency at the start of this year, has described the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s first
task as constructing a 'turnkey' central bank for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that is capable of
operating effectively once the political decisions to go ahead with <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> have
been taken.
After much haggling, European leaders bowed to German wishes and agreed just
over a year ago to site the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
They also endorsed the 65 year old Belgian banker, academic and monetary
policy expert as its head. At that time, there were many who wondered
whether <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> and the institute were being launched on a futile
endeavour.
The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> was still suffering the aftershocks of 18 months of monetary
turbulence. These had seen the departure of the British pound and the
Italian lira from the exchange rate mechanism of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
System</ORGANIZATION>, numerous parity changes among surviving <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> currencies and a
speculative run on the French franc in <DATE>July</DATE> and <DATE>August 1993</DATE> that had
culminated in the widening of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>'s fluctuation margins to 15 per cent
either side of its members' central rates.
Since then, calm has returned to the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>. The exchange rates of the
surviving member currencies have stabilised at levels close to those that
existed before <DATE>August 1993</DATE>.
Interest rates in continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> have fallen and the region appears to
be enjoying a broad based, non-inflationary economic recovery. According to
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>, 'things are not as negative as they looked a year ago'. The
way is clear for intensive work towards <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, if not yet for the political
decisions to take monetary union further.
The institutional framework and operating principles of the planned European
central bank system have been defined in the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>. It has been
left to the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to design its organisation in detail and specify the
relations between the future <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> (ECB) and the national
central banks that will also be members of the <ORGANIZATION>ESCB</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> has to work out how the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s future single monetary policy should be
managed.
It must also tackle such issues as the preparation of banknotes to be used
after the introduction of the Ecu as a single European currency and how
national payments systems should be linked.
These may sound like dry technical matters. But as <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> has
observed: 'The veil of technicalities obscures important matters of interest
to individual countries and market participants alike.'
The nature of future monetary policy throws up several big issues involving
differences of central bank practice that could result in tensions between
such heavy-weight institutions as the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will have to consider whether <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s monetary policy should be
guided by a money supply measure as in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> or an inflation target as in
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. If a monetary aggregate is chosen, which one should it be? Should
commercial banks, as part of the management of policy, be obliged to deposit
compulsory minimum reserves with the <ORGANIZATION>ESCB</ORGANIZATION>? If so, should these be interest
bearing or not?
Fostering central bank co-operation is the other part of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s mandate.
This task, which <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> considers as important as preparing the
central bank, will involve building up the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s economic research capacity.
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> economics and finance ministers were given a foretaste of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s
ambitions in this area at an informal meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s 'Ecofin council'
at <LOCATION>Lindau</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Lake Constance</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> presented the
findings of a penetrating <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> analysis that demonstrated how different
levels of budget deficit, variations in currency volatility, and member
states' widely varying inflation records explained why they had been
impacted to varying degrees by this year's bond market turbulence.
His presentation also served as a reminder to the ministers that <PERSON>Mr
Lamfalussy</PERSON> is a believer in monetary union. He says its implementation is
essential to protect what has been achieved in creating the European single
market. However, he doubts whether <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> can be achieved by <DATE>1997</DATE> - the
earliest date in the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>. Emu and establishment of the <ORGANIZATION>ECB</ORGANIZATION>
could take 'five, six or 10 years'.
If so, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, which is due to be closed down as soon as the <ORGANIZATION>ESCB</ORGANIZATION> starts
operating, will turn out to be a more durable part of the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>
financial scene than its designers envisaged. With a staff drawn from all <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>
countries (including <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, one of the applicant countries), it should
help bolster <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>'s credentials as an international financial centre
and offset some of the shock generated by <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Bank</ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision to
strengthen its investment banking presence in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
But the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s role will be judged ultimately by the performance of the
central banking system that is due to supplant the institute, if and when
<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> occurs.
There is much to do before the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> achieves <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> along the lines envisaged in
the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.
The excessively high budget deficits and indebtedness of most <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> member
state must be reduced to credible and manageable proportions. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s
politicians must generate the political will to move to stage three.
Then there is the vexed question of achieving greater political union in the
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>, which many economists, politicians and officials (notably in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>)
consider essential if <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is to prove a lasting success.
Speaking in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> recently, <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> acknowledged that much was beyond
his capacity to deliver. 'Even if done well', he said, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s
preparations for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> would 'not necessarily tip the scale of the political
decision in favour of moving rapidly towards monetary union.'
But he made clear that he and the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> mean business. 'I shall do everything
in my power to give no excuses to those who, on the pretext that preparation
for the organisation of the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> is inadequate, wish to
postpone the date of the political decision,' he said.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Kiss of life fof Ecu bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<LOCATION>DENMARK</LOCATION>'S ratification of the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> last week provided a welcome
kiss of life for the Ecu bond market.
And with the Danish referendum out of the way, the <ORGANIZATION>Ecu Committee</ORGANIZATION> of the
<ORGANIZATION>European Bond Commission</ORGANIZATION> - an industry organisation - was quick to announce
clarifications over the role of the Ecu as the single European currency for
the benefit of market participants.
<PERSON>Mr Bob Tyley</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Ecu Committee</ORGANIZATION> and an economist at <ORGANIZATION>Paribas
Capital Markets Group</ORGANIZATION>, said the committee had received clarifications from
the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>European Council</ORGANIZATION> on the role of the <LOCATION>Ecu</LOCATION>.
'We found that certain aspects of the Ecu were not very well understood,' he
said, but added that the clarifications provide market operators with a
'concise and reliable reference for the development of the Ecu' which can be
seen as an appendix to the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.
'With regard to the current basket Ecu prior to the commencement of <ORGANIZATION>European
Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION>, its currency composition will be frozen once the treaty has
been ratified,' <PERSON>Mr Tyley</PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which will
be set up on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>, will facilitate the use of the Ecu and oversee
its development.
The <ORGANIZATION>Ecu</ORGANIZATION> will lose its current basket nature and become a currency in its own
right on the first day of monetary union, and rapid introduction of the Ecu
as the single currency will ensue. On the first day of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>, the exchange
rates between participating national currencies and the <ORGANIZATION>Ecu</ORGANIZATION> will be fixed
irrevocably, and the <ORGANIZATION>Ecu</ORGANIZATION> will rapidly replace those currencies.
<ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> will start on <DATE>January 1 1999</DATE> unless another date has been decided
beforehand. <PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>, stressed in a letter to
the <ORGANIZATION>Ecu Committee</ORGANIZATION> that this could take place well ahead of <DATE>1999</DATE>.
'Sufficient conditions for this to be the case are that a majority of
countries qualify for membership (on the basis of the convergence criteria)
and that the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> has completed its work of
preparation of Stage 3 (which it will start to do after its creation on
<DATE>January 1 1994</DATE> and must finish by <DATE>December 31 1996</DATE> at the latest).'

<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> remains adamant. Despite siren calls from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and
other Euro-sceptical quarters, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials insist there will no fundamental
shift in strategy in response to the de facto suspension of the exchange
rate mechanism.
<PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON> made clear during last <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s special meeting of the
<ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> must 'tough out' the latest crisis - mainly
by using the tools offered by the Maastricht treaty for reinforcing economic
and monetary co-operation within the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> president is also reported to be pinning some hope on a
Franco-German political initiative before the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> in
<DATE>December</DATE>. This would serve to show the rest of the Community that the
Franco-German alliance remains in good working order, but it would also
demonstrate that European monetary union remains on track.
Recent comment in the British and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> press about a permanent rift between
the French and Germans in the run-up to the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis is dismissed inside
the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> as 'wishful thinking'. The official view is that
Franco-German differences were not so serious as to overwhelm the European
monetary system. 'The structures remain, even if (some of) the rules have
changed,' said one official.
<PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON> recognises, however, that the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis has created a vacuum in
monetary co-operation. This explains the importance which he attaches to two
separate reports which the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> will publish before next <DATE>January 1</DATE>,
starting-point for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>'s second stage.
The first report will focus on the progress which the 12 member states have
made on economic and monetary convergence; the second will set out the main
political and economic guidelines for the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>, to be adopted by a
qualified majority vote of the Twelve.
According to <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> monetary officials, both these reports should be used to
define the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s future route to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> as set out in <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION>. The British
proposal to revive the 'hard Ecu' is likely to get short shrift in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>.
One option to convince the financial markets that the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> is serious
about monetary union would be to narrow the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>'s newly widened fluctuation
bands. These were fixed at <MONEY>15 per cent</MONEY> nine days ago to halt speculation
against the franc and weaker <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> currencies; but <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials note with
satisfaction that <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> are all seeking to return
to their 'narrow bands' rather than rushing towards lower interest rates.
Another favoured option is to strike a deal on the location of the <ORGANIZATION>European
Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the precursor of the European central bank, which would
supervise a putative single <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> currency. Such a bargain would also include a
'big name' to run the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, most likely a current <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> central bank governor,
but possibly an outsider.
The policy is characteristic of <PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON>, a man who believes that a little
pain is often necessary for true salvation. It is also reminiscent of a
certain former British prime minister who declared, with similar conviction,
that 'there is no alternative'.

<FP=106> [Commentary by <PERSON>Klaus-Peter Schmid</PERSON>: "Divided and Yet </F>
United--<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION>: With the New Year the <ORGANIZATION>Second 
Phase Begins</ORGANIZATION>, but Many Points of Contention Are Still 
Unresolved"] 
  [Text] The beginning of the new year is a great hour for 
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, because beginning 1 <DATE>January 1994</DATE> a new institution 
for which many countries exerted themselves will have its 
headquarters in the financial metropolis on the Main: the 
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI). It is the preliminary stage 
for a future <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>, the heart and brain of the 
European currency planned for the turn of the century at the 
latest. It is clear that the money gurus in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> are 
counting on a substantial lift for their business from the 
presence of the European institution. 
  Initially, however, it is a matter of anything but 
transactions in finance or currency markets. Members of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> 
are the central banks of the 12 countries of the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> 
[<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>]. So the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is above all an agency whose top objective will 
be "to strengthen cooperation between the national central 
banks" and "to strengthen the coordination of the monetary 
policies of the member states with the goal of maintaining price 
stability." So states the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>, which sets forth 
the stages for the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION> [EMU] and thus for a 
common European currency. 
  What appears to be pure bureaucratic work is actually 
political dynamite. How, for example, can one coordinate the 
monetary policies of 12 countries if one can only give 
recommendations rather than instructions? The answer is clear 
for the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>: the competence of the national banks of 
issue remains untouched and consequently the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> can at best 
serve to "strengthen the process of coordinating monetary policy 
between the issuing banks of the member states." 
  That is not enough for other countries. They are already 
calling for development of the position of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in such a way 
that no one can get around its decisions. More than before, the 
ulterior motive is to limit the dominant role of the mark in 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s currency markets. Precisely in accordance with the 
experience of the <DATE>last two years</DATE>, in which the partners 
complained about the "dictates of the mark," they would like to 
restrict the freedom of movement of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>. But the 
German central bank stresses: "The responsibility for monetary 
policy in the transition phase remains at the national level." 
  Many countries are also lured by the fact that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is 
permitted to accept gold and currency reserves from the national 
central banks and to manage them. It is above all the have-nots 
who are already casting longing glances at the treasures of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> and would prefer to see the largest possible share of 
the national reserves combined even now. The joint fund could be 
used, for example, to prop up weak currencies. It is no wonder 
that this idea is also disliked by the guardians of the currency 
in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. 
  A third function of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> should give no reason for 
bickering: the practical preparation of the common currency. 
This ranges from the harmonizing of the clearing systems and 
statistics to the question of how a future <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> 
can function and what its political instruments ought to look 
like. Two themes about which the specialists of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will 
have to rack their brains may well be especially interesting: 
What are the common banknotes to look like and how are they to 
be exchanged most appropriately for the national currencies 
valid until that time? 
  Even if every member state will initially retain its central 
bank, the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> prescribes a decisive change for the 
second phase of the monetary union: all national monetary 
institutes are to be given their independence and hence may no 
longer take instructions from the government. That has long been 
the case in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>. Other countries such as 
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> took this step in the past year. In this way, 
politicians can no longer directly influence monetary policy and 
above all interest rates. 
  Some governments are therefore tempted to delay this step, 
for it obstructs an unlimited source of financing. Thus, it has 
heretofore been customary in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> for the state to 
finance its large budget deficits through the central bank and 
hence the printing press. But this inflationary abuse was 
expressly forbidden in <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION>. The rules are so strict that 
henceforth the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> was not even allowed to give cash 
credits to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Government</ORGANIZATION> and laender, although the 
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> Law expressly provided for this possibility. 
  A curious thing about the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is that its end is already 
planned but it remains uncertain when its hour will come. As 
soon as the third phase of the monetary union begins, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> 
will become the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>. At that time, the 
autonomy of the central banks will end in those countries that 
are giving up their national currency and bringing them into the 
uniform European currency. That will happen on 1 <DATE>January 1997</DATE> at 
the earliest and two years after this date at the latest. 
  At least in principle. For no one knows what the Maastricht 
agreement is really worth. Scarcely any country in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 
presently fulfills the criteria, without which there can be no 
participation in the common currency. The disorder in the 
currency markets is still too great to permit a responsible 
final fixing of the exchange rates. And the crisis is still such 
a burden on the European economy that for years to come it will 
probably not be possible to fulfill the starting conditions. 
  But anyone who believes that there is no longer any interest 
in the monetary union must think again. Just a few days before 
the start of the second phase, a dispute arose that is hard to 
understand. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> do not want the four 
countries that are presently negotiating on joining the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> to be 
allowed to participate in the decision on the beginning of the 
third phase. The candidates <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> 
bring with them relatively stable currencies and are therefore 
serious candidates for the European currency. Obviously the 
"Club Med countries" see their hopes disappearing that the 
strict criteria for joining could be relaxed at the decisive 
moment, allowing them to come into the circle of the chosen 
through the back door. 
  In any case, this week the 64-year-old Belgian banker 
<PERSON>Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> will begin his job as first president of 
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. Heretofore he was chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for International 
Settlements</ORGANIZATION> (BIZ) in <LOCATION>Basel</LOCATION> and his appointment was applauded 
everywhere. There is only one thing to mar his start in the new 
post: the <ORGANIZATION>EMI Secretariat</ORGANIZATION> has not yet been able to find a 
suitable house in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. They are still looking into this on 
the Main. 
  So for the time being <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s currency popes will continue 
to meet in the futuristic tower of the BIZ at the bend of the 
Rhine in <LOCATION>Basel</LOCATION>. Of course they will be coming to the metropolis 
on the Main for the first meeting on 11 <DATE>January</DATE>, where in the 
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> town hall they will elect one of the 12 central bank 
chiefs as vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. After that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> team 
will once again withdraw to <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION>. They will not move 
until the <DATE>fall</DATE>.

FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Paving the way towards Emu - FT writers report on
the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders yesterday prepared the way for much closer
co-operation on macro-economic performance in the run-up to full economic
and monetary union.
They agreed the principle of legally binding macro-economic guidelines,
including a general call for lower interest rates, wage restraint, lower
budget deficits and government debt. But French objections to the details
delayed formal adoption of the proposals.
<PERSON>Mr Henning Christophersen</PERSON>, European economics commissioner, said the
guidelines - required under the Maastricht treaty - would probably be
adopted by <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
The guidelines are a diluted version of the original proposal but <PERSON>Mr
Christophersen</PERSON> said they would still be used 'as a basis for the examination
of the (economic) performance of member states'.
The French difficulties concern the wording on wage restraint - <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and
others believe they should be tougher - and binding commitments to the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>
budget limits agreed at last year's <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> summit.
Finance ministers also discussed yesterday the practical work of the
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of a European central bank,
which will supervise the second phase of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, beginning on <DATE>January 1</DATE>.
Officials said that <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> leaders were likely formally to endorse
<PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, a Hungarian-born Belgian, as first president of the
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> before the summit ends tomorrow.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> made clear he expected to be heavily involved in the
discussion of <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> economic affairs, even though the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s statutory role is
mainly supervisory.
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> have resisted suggestions by the Belgian presidency and
<PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> president, that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s role should be
beefed up.
But <PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON> is still likely to work closely with the finance
ministers, Belgian officials said yesterday. He will attend their meetings
when the preparations for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> are discussed.
The first <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> board meeting is likely to take place on <DATE>January 3</DATE>, although
it will take a few months for a working secretariat to be established in
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will be based.
<PERSON>Mr Theo Waigel</PERSON>, German finance minister, said the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> would restrict
itself to providing technical help to establish the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. He added that
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> would not be among those countries which would allow the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> to
manage their monetary reserves during the second phase of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Christophersen</PERSON> played down German opposition to a strong <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. 'I think
they (the Germans) have been so keen to get it to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> .. because they
want it to be a real institution, with some influence,' he told journalists.
'Why in heaven have it in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> unless it has real powers?'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Bonn denies European bank site picked: Monetary Institute is
main prize in the elaborate division of Euro-spoils

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday firmly denied a report that <ORGANIZATION>European
Community</ORGANIZATION> leaders have reached a secret agreement to base the new <ORGANIZATION>European
Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the core of the future European central bank, in
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
'This report is too good to be true,' said a German government spokesman.
'There has been no such agreement yet. We do not yet have the agreement of
all our partners.'
German officials made it clear they believe that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> remains the only <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
member state opposed to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, but they also recognise the political
difficulty for <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON>, the British prime minister, should the bank be
sited there.
There was considerable embarrassment in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> yesterday over the report,
confidently published by <LOCATION>Handelsblatt</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s business newspaper, that
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> had won the battle for the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. They fear that, by reviving the
question just as the British parliamentary debate on Maastricht is coming to
its climax, British capitulation will be less likely.
The decision of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> heads of government on the location of the <ORGANIZATION>Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, which is supposed to be in operation by next <DATE>January 1</DATE>, merely
requires a country to be chosen. It will then be up to the government of
that country to choose the precise site - taking into account the views of
all member states.
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> has strongly resisted <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s equally firm determination to
promote <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, on the grounds that it could undermine the city of
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s position as <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s main financial centre. The <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> government
believes that only by siting the bank in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, home of the German
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, will sceptics - especially Germans  - be reassured that the new
institution will be as independent and stability-conscious as the German
central bank.
In any case, it is clear that negotiations have reached an end-game.
The negotiations are part of an elaborate division of the Euro-spoils which
involves more than a dozen new agencies and institutions. Each brings the
promise of jobs, prestige and a hole in taxpayers' wallets.
The European central bank is the most valuable prize. Other agencies include
<ORGANIZATION>Europol</ORGANIZATION>, a mini-European <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> which would replace <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION>, a European
environmental office, a European trade-mark office, a European drugs agency
and a European plant and vegetable office.
After the recent upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism, and amid popular
doubts in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> about giving up the D-Mark, the <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> government's claims
have grown stronger.
Uncertainty over <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION> ratification has damaged market confidence in
European monetary union. The Belgian presidency of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is therefore
pressing for a deal on the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, possibly at a special summit in the <DATE>autumn</DATE>.
This would allow stage two of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> to start on schedule on <DATE>January 1 1994</DATE>.
Another factor appears to be the race to succeed <PERSON>Mr Jacques Attali</PERSON> as
president of the <ORGANIZATION>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</ORGANIZATION>.
Under an earlier deal, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> won the <ORGANIZATION>EBRD</ORGANIZATION> presidency and the UK won
agreement to put the bank in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. The question now is whether <PERSON>Mr Attali</PERSON>'s
high-rolling habits have made it impossible for a Frenchman to keep the
post.
<PERSON>Mr Henning Christopherson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> commissioner for economics and a strong
candidate for the <ORGANIZATION>EBRD</ORGANIZATION> job, has let it be known there should be 'no more <ORGANIZATION>Sun
Kings</ORGANIZATION>'.
If the Danish-born <PERSON>Mr Christopherson</PERSON> wins the <ORGANIZATION>EBRD</ORGANIZATION> job, what will become of
<PERSON>Mr Jacques de Larosiere</PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of France</ORGANIZATION> and a rumoured
front-runner for the post? The French are not saying; but some believe the
de Larosiere candidacy is actually an elaborate bluff to increase leverage
in negotiations on who should be the president of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
BELGIUM opened its <ORGANIZATION>EC Presidency</ORGANIZATION> yesterday with a pledge to 'play by the
rules' of the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> and a warning that the difficulty of enlargement
negotiations had been underestimated.
The two statements by <PERSON>Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s prime minister,
underlined a shift in priorities after two nationalist-minded presidencies
under <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>, both of which pushed for speedy enlargement with
<LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>.
<PERSON>Mr Dehaene</PERSON>, who shares a passion for federalism and football, listed
<LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s priorities as giving life to the Maastricht treaty and
strengthening <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> institutions, particularly the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>.
He also said he was favourable to holding an early <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <DATE>October</DATE>,
assuming ratification was wrapped up in the UK and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. But a summit
required concrete decisions such as an agreement on the location of new <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>
institutions, notably the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is the precursor of the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> which will supervise
the putative single <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> currency. The <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> is blocking a deal under which the
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> would go to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and some ministers are arguing that <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s status
as an international financial centre should give it control of some of its
operations.
<PERSON>Mr Dehaene</PERSON> warned that failure to reach a deal on the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> could jeopardise
the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION>, due to begin on <DATE>January 1,
1994</DATE>. A delay could lead to a repeat of the monetary instability of the past
nine months which 'should be avoided at all costs,' he said.
<PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>European Commission President</ORGANIZATION>, said he was enthusiastic
about working with the <ORGANIZATION>Belgian Presidency</ORGANIZATION>. It was time to dispel the
Euro-gloom and recreate the successes of the mid-1980s, a period of dynamic
growth and job creation.
<PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON> recalled that an acquaintance from <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> had recently
published an article suggesting that <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was dead. But Americans had
written off <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, and had been proved wrong. The
<ORGANIZATION>Commission President</ORGANIZATION>, still hobbling from sciatica, said he intended to
finish his study on European competitiveness by the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> summit in
<DATE>December</DATE>.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Pohl breaks silence about Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<PERSON>MR Karl Otto Pohl</PERSON>, who resigned after 11 years as president of the <ORGANIZATION>German
Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>two years ago</DATE>, has broken his silence and has spoken out about
'defects' in the Maastricht treaty on European union.
In two lectures this week at the <ORGANIZATION>London School of Economics</ORGANIZATION>, the man who was
once <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s best known central banker and is now part-time chairman of the
well capitalised Cologne-based <PERSON>Sal Oppenheim</PERSON> private bank,
left a 500-strong audience in no doubt of his scepticism about the likely
impact of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is being set up in
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> next year to supervise the next stage of the planned move to
European economic and monetary union (<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>).
He risked inflaming old wounds with Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, with whom
relations have soured because of <PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON>'s criticism in <DATE>1990-91</DATE> of the
financing of German reunification.
<PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> said mistakes over introducing the D-Mark into eastern <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> were
partly to blame for German budgetary imbalances which have caused the
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> to maintain tight money. This had worsened the European
recession, and made <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> prospects 'much less favourable'.
<PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> referred defiantly to his celebrated remarks in <DATE>March 1991</DATE> that the
aftermath of German monetary union had been 'a disaster'. The controversy
stirred by these comments helped lead to his resignation, and rankles still
with <PERSON>Mr Kohl</PERSON>. 'The Chancellor did not like the remark. But it was not
wrong,' <PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> said.
Although he took care not to criticise directly <PERSON>Mr Kohl</PERSON> or the present
<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> leadership, <PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> took issue with the central bank's reliance
on monetary targets to guide interest rate policy. 'Money supply figures
should be used with caution,' he said.
On the next stage of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> damped some European politicians' hopes
that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> would have a role in monetary decision-making. 'You must always
be aware that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will have no decision-making powers. This is something
the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> will always insist on. The <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> is not ready to share
responsibility with this new institution.' Trying to sound diplomatic, he
added: 'The creation of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> might appear a rather academic
event without much practical relevance. I wouldn't say that. It could be
useful in some respects to continue the work of the European committee of
central bank governors to develop tools for a common monetary policy. But
this could also be carried out by the governors' committee.'
<PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> said the main issue facing <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was combating unemployment and
opening the west to the former eastern bloc. 'We can't solve these problems
by establishing a monetary institution in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.'
Because of 'hidden unemployment', he said the true figure for unemployment
in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> was between 5m and 6m compared with the official total of 3.5m.
'It's the same problem in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.'
<PERSON>Mr Pohl</PERSON> said the Maastricht treaty dealt more with the past than the future.
'I'm not sure whether a treaty which seeks to establish monetary and
political union in the west is the right answer to those countries (in
central and eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>) who say they are also part of the European
community and European culture.'

<FP=106> [Unattributed article: "Lamfalussy: `<ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank Will Not </F>
Influence European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>;'" as released by <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] As briefly announced in yesterday's EUROPE (page 6), 
the Council of the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI), met on 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> [11 <DATE>January</DATE>] -- for the first time since the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> came 
into existence on 1 <DATE>January</DATE> -- with <PERSON>Mr. Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> 
chairing the proceedings held in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> municipal buildings. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON>Maurice F. Doyle</PERSON>, Governor of <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>'s 
central bank, as vice-president and adopted various provisions 
related to the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> organizational framework and functioning. In 
contrast, no decision was taken on the building that will house 
the Institute (and later the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>) on a 
permanent basis. At the conclusion of the meeting, <PERSON>Mr. 
Lamfalussy</PERSON> reviewed a number of aspects concerning the work of 
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Union</ORGANIZATION> [EMU] in general, as follows: 
  - election of <PERSON>Mr. Doyle</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. Lamfalussy</PERSON> said he was happy to 
announce this appointment because <PERSON>Mr. Doyle</PERSON> is a "heavyweight" 
who enjoys a far-reaching reputation among professionals. The 
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president underscored <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>'s remarkable macro-economic 
results in recent years, "due in large measure to monetary 
management of the country," before going on to stress the 
"absolutely substantial" role played by <PERSON>Mr. Doyle</PERSON> in this 
context. As <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> remains a relatively poor country, it also 
is particularly sensitive in various areas; 
  - <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> offices. The two buildings mentioned most often 
(namely, Posseidon-Haus and Messeturm) "are not the only ones" 
in the running. "I am still receiving and reviewing other 
proposals and I do not think a final decision can be taken 
before the next <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> meeting." <PERSON>Mr. Lamfalussy</PERSON> will try to 
submit a proposal at this next meeting. This delay is related 
to the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s very specific needs as it is a "foreign 
institution" with extremely frequent meetings. The final choice 
will also have to take account of concerns to limit the costs of 
the operation as much as possible. This first meeting was held 
in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> for purely symbolic reasons, "to show the entire 
world that we respect the choice of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Mr. 
Lamfalussy</PERSON>. He then said this location close to the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> 
would in no way change the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s relations with German 
monetary authorities. "I will not accept a greater <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> 
influence on our work due to the fact that I will be in 
<LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> than I would if I were on a mountaintop elsewhere," he 
commented; 
  - transitional period. A period of "probably six months" was 
agreed, during which the work of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee of Governors of 
central</ORGANIZATION> banks will continue as in the past (this committee 
ceased to exist with the start of the second stage of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>) 
pending the recruitment of appropriate personnel. Recruitment 
is expected to be concluded next <DATE>summer</DATE> and should coincide with 
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s move into its definitive location in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>. Until 
then, the main staff members the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> inherited from the former 
<ORGANIZATION>Committee of Governors</ORGANIZATION> will continue working under <PERSON>Mr. 
Lamfalussy</PERSON>'s command in <LOCATION>Basel</LOCATION>, where meetings of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI Council</ORGANIZATION> 
will also take place during the transitional period. 
"Obviously, once the decision on the building has been taken, 
we will transfer more staff members to <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> with a view to 
preparing the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s move," he added; 
  - decisions of an organizational nature. These concern 
fixing the pay of six <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> "key officials" (who will have a grade 
equivalent to director at the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>), making it 
possible to hire the appropriate individuals for these key 
posts. These include the director general (a post for which <PERSON>Mr. 
Lamfalussy</PERSON> intends to propose a candidate at the next <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 
meeting), and five heads of departments for the following 
sectors: economic and statistics unit, secretariat general, 
administrative service, information systems and financial unit 
(essentially responsible for managing the monetary reserves of 
the national banks wishing to deposit them with the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>). At 
the end of <DATE>1994</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> is expected to have around 140 
employees, a number that could rise to 250 once it is fully 
operational. Answering questions, <PERSON>Mr. Lamfalussy</PERSON> added the 
following information: 
  - the single currency from <DATE>1997</DATE> "seems an unrealistic 
perspective for the moment" (he declined to make any projections 
about achieving this objective in <DATE>1999</DATE>). Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> 
president can nevertheless imagine other sorts of arrangements 
between member states, such as those concluded in <DATE>August 1993</DATE> 
between <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> to maintain a stable link 
between the <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche</ORGANIZATION> mark and the guilder; 
  - asked about <PERSON>Mr. Delors</PERSON>' recent statement that the first 
stage of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> was a failure and that study should begin on how to 
boost the second stage, possibly by giving the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> greater 
responsibilities, <PERSON>Mr. Lamfalussy</PERSON> voiced some reluctance 
regarding an expansion of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s powers even before he has 
begun to work on the basis of existing prerogatives. Moreover, 
he added, unquestionable progress (though still "too slow") has 
been made in the last five years in several areas aiming at 
improving convergence between the member states (to curb 
inflation, in particular) and several currencies have moved 
closer in recent months to the initial fluctuation bands of the 
<ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>, which proves that an attitude of "common interest" is 
developing and is promising for the future; 
  - despite the difficulties currently facing the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>, the 
single currency objective will one day become a reality because 
"with the extremely high degree of economic integration in 
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, I cannot imagine that it could eventually function 
correctly without a single currency." For now, it is still 
premature to say what states will take this step, when and under 
what circumstances, "but I am absolutely convinced that the 
process will lead to this specific objective;" 
  - outside of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, which during the negotiation of 
Maastricht raised the possibility of depositing currency 
reserves with the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> (as provided in the protocol of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> 
statutes, annexed to the <ORGANIZATION>Treaty of Maastricht</ORGANIZATION>), up to now no 
central bank has requested the Institute to manage its monetary 
reserves, said <PERSON>Mr. Lamfalussy</PERSON>. This is due to "practical 
reasons," in his view, because it is a highly specialized task 
that must be carried out with great caution and which 
necessitates a "major technological investment." The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will 
be prepared to set in place such capacity "as soon as we have 
the impression there is a real demand along these lines".

FT  06 DEC 94 / Door to 1997 single currency left open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers yesterday left open the door for a move to a single
European currency in <DATE>1997</DATE> with a carefully-couched endorsement of the
current wide fluctuation bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The <DATE>1997</DATE> date for the creation of a monetary union in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> is still viewed
as a remote possibility only, but the decision in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> yesterday
underlined political commitment to the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> project.
The 15 per cent fluctuation bands were introduced as a temporary measure
after the currency crisis in <DATE>1992-93</DATE> which forced several devaluations and
the departure of sterling and the lira from the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>. The wider bands have so
far helped to deter similar speculative assaults.
In a joint statement yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> finance ministers studiously avoided
declaring that the present arrangements were 'normal'. One of the key
provisions of the Maastricht treaty is that a currency seeking to join <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>
must have been inside its so-called normal bands for at least two years.
Instead, ministers agreed to endorse an opinion on the wide bands drawn up
by the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the precursor of the future European
central bank which is supposed to supervise the single currency.
The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> noted that the wider bands had prevented big exchange rate
depreciations and excessive exchange rate intervention with their
potentially inflationary consequences. 'In the light of this experience and
in the current circumstances, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> council considers it advisable to
maintain the present arrangements.'
<PERSON>Mr Waigel</PERSON> resolutely refused to say whether the 15 per cent bands would
continue right up to the point of a decision on whether to move to a single
currency, or whether ministers would support a progressive narrowing of the
bands.
Instead, he reaffirmed the need for price stability and sound public
finances which would avoid exchange rate stability. The <DATE>August 1993</DATE> decision
to suspend intervention obligations and introduce 15 per cent fluctuation
bands had succeeded, he said.
The other important criteria for moving to a single currency are that
government budget deficits fall to 3 per cent or less of gross domestic
product, and that government debt falls consistently towards a target of 60
per cent of GDP.
Though <DATE>1997</DATE> remains a highly ambitious target, many observers are
reassessing the possibility of a move by a privileged few currencies led by
the D-Mark to monetary union in <DATE>1999</DATE>. However, public opinion in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and the UK among the main European economies remains divided.
The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> pressed for a statement on the wide bands to keep
hopes alive that the <DATE>1997</DATE> date for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> could be met, arguing that it was
important not weaken the provisions of the Maastricht treaty.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary 
Institute</ORGANIZATION> held its first meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> [11 <DATE>January</DATE>] 
in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> on what is expected to be a rocky journey to 
creation of a European central bank, with an initial team of 30 
banking pioneers. 
  At a news conference after the meeting, institute president 
<PERSON>Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> emphasizerd the breadth of the 
task awaiting his small team. And he said that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> status, 
resulting from the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>, does 
not facilitate the new agency's task, as it is too "ambiguous." 
  The main difficulty lies in the fact that control of 
monetary 
policies remains in the national central banks' hands, he 
commented. But over time, the institute is to work out the 
technical procedures for putting the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>'s 
planned single currency into effect and prepare for installation 
of the future <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>, he noted. 
  One of the key tasks given to the institute under the 
Maastricht treaty for European economic and monetary union (EMU) 
is preparation of banknotes denominated in ECUs [European 
Currency Unit]. 
  The institute also has authority to make recommendations, 
but 
not give instructions, to members of the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> on 
monetary policy, exchange policy and associated matters. 
  The institute is expected to tighten cooperation among <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> 
central banks and coordinate monetary policies. But it has no 
monetary powers, and in <DATE>December</DATE>, German secretary of state for 
finance <PERSON>Gerd Haller</PERSON> said that the German Government would not 
tolerate any action which exceeded the institute's powers. 
  Responsibility for monetary policy remains in the member 
states' hands during the second phase of <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>, as <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> 
chief <PERSON>Hans Tietmeyer</PERSON> has emphasized many times, and he has also 
said that "entering the third phase is unlikely at the end of 
<DATE>1996</DATE>." 
  Last week the <ORGANIZATION>French Government</ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of France</ORGANIZATION> 
independence in setting monetary policy but stressed that the 
government remained responsible for exchange rate policy and the 
franc's exchange rate, and that the central bank had to take 
account of overall economic policy. 
  The forced exit of sterling and the lira from the <ORGANIZATION>European 
Monetary System</ORGANIZATION> (EMS) in <DATE>September 1992</DATE> and the European 
monetary crisis of <DATE>last July</DATE>, leading to a vast widening of the 
<ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> currency fluctuation margins, were a serious blow to the 
credibility of the Maastricht monetary programme. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of a fully-independent European 
central bank, is part of a complex framework of measures to 
force national economies within the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> to 
converge to enable the community to adopt a common currency by 
<DATE>2000</DATE>. 
  Actually, no <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> member now meets the criteria laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third phase of 
<ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>. 
  A big institute asset is <LOCATION>Lamfalussy</LOCATION>, previously managing 
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Bank for International Settlements</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Basel</LOCATION>. He 
is universally praised for his serious approach, knowledge of 
monetary questions, and feeling for diplomacy. 
  Thanks to his "neutral" position, he might act as arbitrator 
in conflicts sure to arise in installing the single currency, or 
before a possible devaluation of an <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> currency, banking 
sources say.

FT  03 AUG 93 / ERM crisis vindicates UK monetary policy, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAASTRICHT timetable for European monetary union is now 'totally
unrealistic', <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON> said yesterday, as he claimed that the emergency
steps taken to salvage the exchange rate mechanism vindicated his decision
to suspend sterling's membership last <DATE>September</DATE>.
As government loyalists and Euro-sceptics alike sought to draw comfort from
the day's events, which also saw <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> become the eleventh <ORGANIZATION>European
Community</ORGANIZATION> state to ratify Maastricht, the prime minister said he hoped the
decision to allow wider fluctuation of currencies within the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> would
promote economic recovery in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
In the timetable, if a commencement date for stage three of monetary union
has not been set by the end of <DATE>1997</DATE>, then <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> must in any case go ahead by
<DATE>January 1999</DATE>.
In a remark later played down by Downing Street, <PERSON>Mr Major</PERSON> appeared to hold
out the prospect that the changes could herald lower domestic interest
rates.
There remained 'no prospect' of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> returning to the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> 'in the near
future', he said. The government would continue to set monetary policy by
'what's right for the <ORGANIZATION>United Kingdom</ORGANIZATION>'.
But as senior ministers trumpeted the message that recent developments
justified the government's European policy, their thunder was partly stolen
by <PERSON>Mr Norman Lamont</PERSON>, the former chancellor, who predicted there would be no
single European currency and described Maastricht as 'a bit of a fossil'.
Tory Euro-sceptics, meanwhile, pointed to the 'supreme irony' of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
ratifying Maastricht on the day the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> collapsed.
Downing Street emphasised that 'relative currency stability' remained a
desirable objective and looked ahead to a process of examining why the old
system did not work and how existing fault-lines could be eradicated.
It pinned the blame for the system's difficulties squarely on the strains
resulting from German reunification. It indicated that an autumn summit of
member states to discuss possible solutions was likely.
In his forthright reaction to the decision to create a 15 per cent
fluctuation band for all <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> currencies except the D-Mark and the guilder,
<PERSON>Mr Lamont</PERSON> said: 'This does mean the end of a single currency, the end of
monetary union in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. This makes the Maastricht treaty redundant.'
It was 'extraordinary that we have spent so much time constructing this
artificial creation and, frankly, it has gone out of the window', he said.

<TEXT>
<LOCATION>BRITAIN</LOCATION> appears ready to drop its claim to base the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the core of the future European central bank, in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.
The pending shift would clear the way for a deal at the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION>
summit on <DATE>October 29</DATE> to locate the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> which has recently stepped
up its campaign in favour of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>.
Officials in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> said the UK government's readiness to soften its
position reflects a tactical calculation that it is no longer worth fighting
a losing cause against German claims which are supported by the rest of the
<ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>.
The same officials said the UK government also appeared to have been
influenced by the faltering momentum behind the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>'s goal of economic and
monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty - a view summed up by <PERSON>Mr
John Major</PERSON>'s recent comment that plans for <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> had 'all the quaintness of a
rain dance and about the same potency'.
The British prime minister's statement caused irritation in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, where
the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> is trying hard to build up the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> as an embryonic
European central bank ready to start business on <DATE>January 1, 1994</DATE>, under the
so-called stage two of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>.
EC finance ministers, who are holding informal talks in <LOCATION>Genval</LOCATION>, near
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, will today hear details of legislation regarding the operation of
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON>Mr Henning Christophersen</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> economics commissioner.
The legislation bans governments from borrowing indirectly from central
banks; bars privileged access by governments to financial institutions;
encourages governments to rein in excessive budget deficits and debt, and
sets out the various contributions of central banks towards financing the
institute.
It must be given a favourable opinion by the European parliament by the end
of the year to go into effect by <DATE>January 1, 1994</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Christophersen</PERSON> is said to be determined that the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will not be 'a
shell'. He believes that it could serve to draw member states and central
banks into a more formal system of monetary and macroeconomic co-operation.
Last night, <PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, gave a
presentation to finance ministers on the economic outlook in the Community
as well as his thoughts on jobs, growth and competitiveness. These are to be
combined in a White Paper to be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> in
<DATE>December</DATE>.
At the Genval meeting, ministers will also have a broad discussion on the
lessons of the <DATE>August 2</DATE> currency crisis which led to the virtual collapse of
the exchange rate mechanism. However, diplomats cautioned that it was 'too
early' to expect any conclusions or decisions.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Monetary union 'still on course': Bundesbank says new ERM
margins need not disrupt integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>BUNDESBANK</ORGANIZATION> said yesterday that the new wide margins of fluctuation
within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System need not
disrupt the process of monetary integration in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
The German central bank said the second stage of European monetary union
would still come into force by next <DATE>January 1</DATE>, in line with the Maastricht
treaty.
It left uncertain, however, the future timetable towards a single currency,
saying 'the further steps on the road to economic and monetary union will .
. . hinge crucially on whether, and how soon, the economic and political
prerequisites for a common currency can be fulfilled'.
In a staunch defence of its own actions, published in its latest monthly
bulletin, the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> said its credibility had been 'hardened' by its
proven independence, and its absolute priority for an anti-inflationary
monetary policy, in recent weeks.
The article gave no hint of remorse for the stern monetary policy which
precipitated the latest <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis.
It said the system had become vulnerable to massive speculation because the
limits to exchange rate stabilisation had become clear.
The <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> partner currencies equivalent to almost DM60bn
(Dollars 34.80bn) in <DATE>July</DATE> - mostly French francs. Purchases on <DATE>July 30</DATE>, when
the Danish krone also fell to its lower intervention point, totalled almost
DM30bn.
While it agreed that the new broad currency bands in the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> would offer
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> partners greater latitude for a monetary policy independent of
its own, the bank warned they must 'exploit this monetary policy scope with
circum-spection'.
From an all-European point of view, the temporary widening of the margins of
fluctuation in the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION> is not to be regarded as a relapse into less orderly
monetary conditions.
'As long as member states' monetary policy makers abide by the medium-term
objectives for price stability, and neither succumb to the temptation of
economic policy hyperactivity, nor aim at gaining short-term competitive
advantages, the preconditions for exchange rate stability remain in place.
'By the latest monetary policy measures, the authorities have succeeded in
preserving in principle the rules of the <ORGANIZATION>EMS</ORGANIZATION>. Owing to the greater
flexibility in the operation of these rules, potential tensions have been
lessened at the same time, and thus a major contribution has been made to
containing intervention volumes.'
The analysis of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis puts the long-term blame on the premature
effort to operate a system of unchanged parities.

FT  17 MAY 93 / EC predicts year of no growth: Commission to issue
downgraded forecast after Maastricht referendum in Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> has sharply downgraded its economic forecast for this year, according
to internal estimates which the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> plans not to release
until after tomorrow's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The revised forecast of zero to 'slightly negative' growth compares with
earlier official predictions of 0.75 per cent growth. The slowdown threatens
to push <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> unemployment beyond its present level of 17.4m, renewing doubts
about member states' willingness to follow Maastricht's tough 'convergence'
criteria for European monetary union.
It also threatens to prompt a crisis in the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> budget, where falling
revenues have already forced the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> to leave 1,000 posts unfilled.
<PERSON>Mr Jacques Delors</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> president, paid a discreet visit to
<LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> for talks with Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> to discuss the
deteriorating outlook for the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> economy and how to co-ordinate the position
after the Danish referendum.
Yesterday, <PERSON>Mr Philippe Maystadt</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>'s finance minister, came out in
favour of amending the convergence criteria.
EC finance ministers and the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> have generally avoided
suggesting that the <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> criteria covering inflation, budget deficits and
ratios of government debt to <ORGANIZATION>GDP</ORGANIZATION> should be changed. They fear undermining
budget discipline and upsetting the <ORGANIZATION>German Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled out
short cuts to a single European currency.
<PERSON>Mr Maystadt</PERSON>'s comments reflect concern in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> about the short-term
deflationary impact of the convergence criteria on growth. They are likely
to arouse attention because <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> takes over the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> presidency from
<LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 1</DATE> and is often seen as a candidate for an inner-core
monetary union.
The latest <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> forecasts support the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary
Fund</ORGANIZATION>'s prediction in <DATE>April</DATE> that growth in the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> would be flat this year.
They confirm the impact of the German recession on the European economy, but
are believed to support the UK government's view that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is likely to
grow faster than its main European competitors this year.
<PERSON>Mr Henning Christophersen</PERSON>, the Danish Commissioner responsible for
economics, has delayed amending his 0.75 per cent forecast until the last
minute.
Like many of his fellow commissioners, <PERSON>Mr Christophersen</PERSON> has argued that a
Danish Yes vote would speed ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION>,
spurring an improvement in business confidence.
<PERSON>Mr Delors</PERSON> is expected to use the new, gloomy forecasts to press <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> member
states to beef up the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION>'s 'growth package' in the run-up to the
<LOCATION>Copenhagen</LOCATION> summit.
The plan mixes national measures such as a shift from current to capital
spending on infrastructure and housing, with modest new <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> lending to small
and medium-sized businesses.
The <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> budget is already overstretched.
The freeze on personnel results largely from a rapid rise in pension costs
for retiring <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> officials who joined the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> at its inception in <DATE>1958</DATE>.
Officials also point to the wave of recent currency devaluations in the
exchange rate mechanism.
These have reduced the value of the <ORGANIZATION>Ecu</ORGANIZATION>, the unit in which all <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> spending
is calculated, by about 5 per cent.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (21): Vacuum at the
heart of the EC - European Monetary Union / The Brussels compromise
transformed the ERM from a semi-fixed exchange rate system into a 'dirty
floating' operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Black <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, then <ORGANIZATION>Lundi Noir</ORGANIZATION>. The de facto suspension of the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>
agreed on <DATE>Monday, August 2</DATE>, marks a turning point in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s plans for
monetary union.
Few dare to predict the outcome. But it is clear that <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders have begun
to reassess the approach to <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> as set down in the Maastricht treaty.
The two core assumptions in <LOCATION>Maastricht</LOCATION> were that the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> could evolve
smoothly into a monetary union before the <DATE>end of the decade</DATE>, and that the
Franco-German alliance could drive the rest of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> forward into a full
political union. Both these assumptions now look dubious.
The strains between the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> governments are evident, even if
there is no suggestion of a breach. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> resented French pressure to
lower its interest rates in the run-up to the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis.
Tensions increased when <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> pushed hard for the D-Mark to leave the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION>
temporarily, against the advice of Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>.
The <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> compromise transformed the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> from a semi-fixed exchange rate
system into a 'dirty floating' operation, with currencies allowed to
fluctuate up to 15 per cent before central banks are obliged to intervene.
The result is a vacuum at the heart of European monetary co-operation.
The Community appears to be dividing into several camps, with no obvious
consensus on procedure.
The first camp contains the 'purists'. Led by the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, this
group argues that it is vital to stick to the <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> game-plan set out in the
Maastricht treaty.
The purists include <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> and, broadly speaking, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. Each puts a premium on <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> solidarity; each would like Stage Two of
<ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> to begin on <DATE>January 1, 1994</DATE>, along with a deal on a location of the
<ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION>, the precursor the <ORGANIZATION>European Central Bank</ORGANIZATION>.
The purists believe the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary System</ORGANIZATION>'s structures remain intact,
thus allowing a reconfiguration of the narrow fluctuation bands once
economic conditions become more favourable.
The second group contains the 'sceptics', of which <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> is the
self-appointed leader. <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON> declared last month that the <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>
timetable was 'totally unrealistic' - words which might have carried more
weight had the UK prime minister not chosen to utter them on the day <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
formally ratified the Maastricht treaty.
<PERSON>Mr Major</PERSON> and his Cabinet colleagues are convinced that history is on their
side. They believe they are winning all the arguments in favour of a more
flexible approach to European integration.
The third group constitutes the 'radicals', of which <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> is the most
obvious leader. Having suffered three successive devaluations of the peseta
(one in the middle of a general election campaign), <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> was so frustrated
during the <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> crisis talks in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> that it called for a full suspension
of the system.
There are now fears in some European capitals that the Spanish may in future
propose some form of capital controls as the best method of defending
currencies and punishing the speculators, no matter the damage to the single
European market.
The fourth group, which is probably the largest, contains the 'pragmatists'.
Led by <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the group includes the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Luxembourg</LOCATION>;
it may also extend part-time membership to the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
The pragmatists believe that there needs to be much more realism about <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>.
If there is slippage in the <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> timetable, so be it.
Chancellor Kohl specifically raised the prospect of a delay of up to two
years during a post-crisis television interview, and other officials are now
wondering privately if the <DATE>1999</DATE> target date for automatically locking
exchange rates is viable. At the same time, the pragmatists, particularly
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, insists that the 'convergence criteria' for <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> on inflation,
budget deficits and government debt must be adhered to.
Already some <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders have absorbed the lessons of the crisis. In the
<DATE>early hours of August 2</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr Wim Kok</PERSON>, Dutch finance minister, spoke
eloquently about the risks involved in exporting the discipline of price
stability to the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION>. Some countries had obviously concluded that
the resulting high unemployment was too high a price to pay, he said.
<PERSON>Mr Kok</PERSON> was too diplomatic to mention names, but he was clearly referring to
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, whose government was forced to abandon its preferred franc fort
policy because it could not bear to raise interest rates higher to defend
the currency. The same lesson applied to the UK <DATE>last September</DATE>, and it
continues to be valid for the poorer 'Club Med' countries grouped around
<LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.
The tension between what might loosely be called the German and Latin
economic models is as old as the <ORGANIZATION>European Community</ORGANIZATION> itself. But it becomes
sharper during a recession, or when the <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> embarks upon an enterprise
as ambitious as monetary union.
In the coming months, it is safe to predict that the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> will enter a
vigorous debate about <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>. The starting-point will probably be the 'White
Paper' on employment and competitiveness being prepared by <PERSON>Mr Jacques
Delors</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, likely to appear under the
grand title of 'Entering the <ORGANIZATION>Twenty-First Century</ORGANIZATION>'.
The original impetus for the paper was growing evidence that <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was
failing to create jobs at the same rate as the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, leading to an
inexorable rise in unemployment.
The <ORGANIZATION>ERM</ORGANIZATION> debacle makes the White Paper even more relevant. It will allow the
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> to focus minds on the 'real economy' and its relationship to <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION>, says
one <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> official involved.
The implication is that <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> leaders need to focus on today's problems rather
than tomorrow's aspirations. No doubt the intellectual case for a single
European currency operating in a single European market is as powerful as
ever; but from now on, <ORGANIZATION>EMU</ORGANIZATION> will have to win the political argument, too.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- In the run-up to 
establishing the <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary Institute</ORGANIZATION> (EMI) in 
Frankfurt/Main on 11 <DATE>January</DATE>, <PERSON>Gerd Haller</PERSON>, state secretary at 
the <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, underscored the political framework for 
the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s activity. Haller stressed today on <ORGANIZATION>Hesse Radio</ORGANIZATION> that 
"from a German viewpoint there is absolutely no question" that 
the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>'s monetary policy "will be influenced in some 
way" via the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>. The state secretary said that one essential 
function of the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> will be to coordinate monetary policy 
between the member states in keeping with a policy of stability, 
without detriment to the autonomy of the member states. He 
stressed that the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> remains "entirely free" with regard 
to its monetary policy. Another function is the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION>'s 
preparation of a common European currency for the third phase of 
monetary union, which will be realized in a few years' time. 
  Haller pointed out that the functions and competences of the 
<ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> have been finally laid down in the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION>. "It 
goes without saying that we, and I believe the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION> too, 
will not allow the Institute to go beyond the competences 
clearly outlined there," he stressed. 
  The state secretary expressed his lack of understanding for 
the stance otaken by <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> in wanting to 
exclude <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> -- the prospective 
newcomers to the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> -- from the development of 
monetary union. "We cannot accept this demand from the German 
point of view." 
  It is important for <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> that monetary union is achieved. 
Open markets without monetary borders bring many advantages, 
said <PERSON>Haller</PERSON>, pointing out that many German jobs are dependent on 
exports.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: Debate on Emu timing hots up - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European issues continue to fascinate and alarm. But while attention in the
<ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> has been focused on today's Commons debate over contributions to the
<LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> budget and the British cabinet's 'suicide pact' to fend off
the threat of a backbench Tory revolt, discussion elsewhere in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has
shifted back to economic and monetary union.
Half-forgotten pledges in the <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> have gained a new lease of
life. The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>, in the person of <PERSON>Mr Giovanni Ravasio</PERSON>, its
director general of economic and financial clauses, set the ball rolling
about ten days ago when he declared that <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> was a 'feasible option' for
<DATE>1997</DATE>, the first target date in the treaty.
Since then, some formidable figures have waded into the debate on the side
of caution. <PERSON>Mr Hans Tietmeyer</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>, has stated his
conviction that 'monetary policy integration in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> can only be the
outcome of a lengthy process.' He later criticised the Maastricht
convergence criteria for low inflation and manageable budgetary positions as
'unambitious'.
Interviewed by a French newspaper, <PERSON>Mr Kenneth Clarke</PERSON>, the chancellor,
pronounced the Maastricht timetable 'completely dead', while making clear
that he was sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> as a general objective.
Last week in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Antonio Martino</PERSON>, the Italian foreign minister,
challenged the whole idea of the Maastricht approach of gradual convergence
towards <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> as 'economically fallacious and politically dangerous.'
Convergence was 'neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for monetary
unification,' <PERSON>Mr Martino</PERSON> said.
Complaining that the 'convergence paradigm' might result in the division of
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> into a club of supposedly virtuous countries that met the criteria
and others deemed unfit for such an exclusive club, <PERSON>Mr Martino</PERSON> called
instead for a 'monetary constitution' for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 'Those of us who believe
that monetary unification is desirable should concentrate on identifying the
rules most suited to that end.'
In less than a fortnight, four significant personalities have pronounced on
a subject that <PERSON>Mr John Major</PERSON> in <DATE>September 1993</DATE> said would have 'all the
quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency.' True the voices are
discordant. But they show that the debate in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> about <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> is hotting up.
The accompanying chart shows why. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s economy is recovering strongly
from recession. A healthy <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> economy has usually stimulated greater economic
and monetary integration.
The latest commission forecasts suggest that <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> economic growth will
accelerate to an average of 2.6 per cent this year, from 0.4 per cent in
<DATE>1993</DATE>. It has projected growth of 2.9 per cent next year, followed by 3.2 per
cent in <DATE>1996</DATE>.
Government deficits should drop: to 3.9 per cent of <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> gross domestic
product by <DATE>1996</DATE>. True, this forecast is above the Maastricht criterion of 3
per cent. But it is based on unchanged policies. <PERSON>Mr Ravasio</PERSON> has predicted
that a majority of member states could meet the excessive deficit criterion
before the end of <DATE>1996</DATE> 'if consolidation efforts are undertaken.'
But there is more to making <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> work than meeting Maastricht criteria. <PERSON>Mr
Malcolm Levitt</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> adviser of <ORGANIZATION>Barclays Bank</ORGANIZATION>, has pointed out that the
'boring bits' of <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION>, such as the introduction of Ecu notes and coinage,
adaption of payments and accounting systems, conversion of electronic card
facilities in shops and restaurants and the resolution of legal
uncertainties, could take five years.
<PERSON>Mr Levitt</PERSON>'s argument is that is already too late to contemplate <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> starting
in <DATE>1997</DATE>. For <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> to start in <DATE>1999</DATE>, the second date envisaged in the treaty,
preparations would have to begin now.
This is not yet the case in the private sector. <PERSON>Mr Levitt</PERSON> reports that
companies are largely unaware of what needs to be done. The few banks and
companies that have studied the issue are uncertain about the precise
timetable and scenario and are therefore not making the investments
necessary for introduction of a single currency.
Things are more advanced in the public policy area. The <ORGANIZATION>European Monetary
Institute</ORGANIZATION> this month secured the approval of central bank governors for a
'master-plan' aimed at completing the technical arrangements for the
proposed European System of Central Banks by the end of <DATE>1996</DATE>.
<PERSON>Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>EMI</ORGANIZATION> president, has also produced a suggestion
for moving to <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> by the end of the century. He says the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> should consider
irrevocably fixing the exchange rates of its currencies, but delay before
introducing the Ecu, the single European currency.
<PERSON>Mr Lamfalussy</PERSON>'s idea for a phased introduction of stage three of the
<ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> would hand over responsibility for monetary policy to a
European central bank with the fixing of currencies. It would allow time for
dealing with technical problems, such as common banknotes or compatible
payments systems.
The <ORGANIZATION>Maastricht Treaty</ORGANIZATION> says that <ORGANIZATION>Emu</ORGANIZATION> should go ahead in <DATE>1999</DATE>, even if only a
minority of <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> members meet the treaty criteria. The <PERSON>Lamfalussy</PERSON> suggestion
could make this a feasible option. But for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, it raises the prospect
of even greater political ructions than at present.
