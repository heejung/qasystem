Holtville senior <PERSON>Teresa Ibarra</PERSON> just wanted one more basketball championship 
patch to sew on her letterman jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a third patch to fill up my sleeve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She got it <DATE>Friday</DATE> when <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> defeated <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, 57-31, in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
Section Division IV girls' basketball final at Golden <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> went into the game as two-time Division IV defending champion, having 
defeated Coronado by 24 and 13 points in previous finals. But <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s game was 
expected to be closer. In the second game of the season, <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> (18-9) 
defeated Coronado (14-11) by just five after <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> had built a 10-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a two- or three-point ball game either way," <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> 
Coach <PERSON>Mike Pacheco</PERSON> said. "It was great to have a game like this. It makes my 
job easier." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado trailed by 18, 41-23, at the <DATE>end of the third quarter</DATE> and did not 
score again until three minutes remained. The Islanders were outscored, 16-8, 
in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. Their leading scorer, <PERSON>Kris Skaalan</PERSON>, managed just eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"He (<ORGANIZATION>Coronado Coach Ernie Dickerson</ORGANIZATION>) has seen our press," <PERSON>Pacheco</PERSON> said. "We 
pressed them the last time, and that's how we won. They didn't look as ready or 
prepared for the press as I thought they would be. Maybe he was prepared, and 
it just didn't work. We tried to throw them with a two-three zone and never 
went to a man-to-man." 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> took a 12-6 <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> lead and then broke the game open, making 
it 31-11 by halftime. Senior <PERSON>Denise Gaddis</PERSON> scored nine of her 11 points in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra, a 5-1 guard, worked hard for her patch. She scored 21 points, including 
two three-pointers in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE> and two more, on consecutive shots, in 
the fourth. Ibarra said she doesn't concentrate on shooting from that range. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I have an open shot I shoot," she said. "He (Pacheco) always tells me 
I never shoot enough and to shoot more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pacheco: "Teresa delivered like a senior should. It didn't surprise me 
that she led the team today. Too bad she's not 6-1."

When <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> meet at noon for the girls' Division IV 
championship, they will be much different teams than those that met in 
<DATE>November</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game of the season in the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Tournament</ORGANIZATION>, Coronado (14-10) 
held as much as a 10-point lead before losing by five. 
</P>
<P>
"I start three different kids than I did then, and he starts two," Coronado 
Coach <PERSON>Ernie Dickerson</PERSON> said. "Looking back on that game, it doesn't mean a whole 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
The teams played for the Division IV championship in each of the past two 
years, with <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> (17-9) winning both. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Mike Pacheco</PERSON> said the change to <ORGANIZATION>Golden Hall</ORGANIZATION> from the Sports 
Arena -- where his team has played in section finals the past four years -- 
could be a "key factor" for <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids are so young that if we were playing in the Sports Arena, it could 
make a difference," <PERSON>Pacheco</PERSON> said. "Nobody's been at <LOCATION>Golden Hall</LOCATION>, so there's no 
home-court advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The two only varsity returners for <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> are <PERSON>Mary Strasser</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kelly Kaye</PERSON>. 
Strasser, a left-handed shooter who started as a freshman last year, has a 
15.5-point average but has averaged 18 the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> is led by <PERSON>Teresa Ibarra</PERSON>, a 5-1 senior point guard who is averaging 12 
points a game. LAURA <LOCATION>PALMER</LOCATION>

ON THE BRIDGE TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE>, you carried a commentary written by the mayor of <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mary 
Herron</PERSON>, which dealt with the problems of the <LOCATION>San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge</LOCATION>. I 
want you to know that the message by <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> does not speak for all the 
residents of Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor talks of reducing the traffic in Coronado by the use of any mode of 
transportation except the single-occupancy auto. She also speaks of the tourist 
industry preference for discounting the present toll. What was not said was 
that, for several months, there has been a "car pool" lane on the bridge that 
allows cars with two or more persons, buses and motorcycles to cross the bridge 
without paying any toll. Therefore, most tourist traffic can use this benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Coronado residents must still make their way to the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> side 
in order to make their daily wage. In many cases, this involves the use of 
single-occupancy cars because car-pooling is difficult, if not impossible, to 
arrange. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that these residents are for the most part traveling in the 
opposite direction of the heaviest traffic. Yet we must pay the toll each and 
every day. It seems that the mayor is most interested in ensuring that the toll 
continue to provide bridge maintenance and for the ever-illusive alternative 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
I submit that the car-pool lane is an excellent means of moving the vast number 
of cars through the toll plaza, but is a poor way to reduce the number of cars 
on <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s streets. Therefore, I would propose that the car-pool lane be 
limited to the high-traffic periods (for the most part, early morning) and all 
vehicles pay a reduced toll at other times. In this manner, the monies 
necessary for bridge maintenance could be generated by all travelers, not just 
the people who cannot find another person to transport. 
</P>
<P>
I would also hope that some of the revenue generated would provide some measure 
of control of the traffic along the few streets that carry such a high 
percentage of the commuter traffic. During much of the day, it is difficult and 
dangerous to cross such streets as 3rd and 4th. I would also hope that the 
mayor would instruct the <ORGANIZATION>Police Department</ORGANIZATION> to enforce the speed limit on all 
vehicles. This would include buses and trucks. Mayor <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> observe the speed 
that some of these vehicles use on these streets. It is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
The headline, "Coronado Is Still Willing to Pay the Toll" is misleading. It 
leaves the impression that <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> wants the toll the way it is. The toll 
needs to be rethought and the residents of Coronado allowed to fully express 
themselves on the way it is applied, or, I should say, misapplied.

For some, it's the thrill of a lifetime. For others, it's a steppingstone to 
the next stop, the Southern Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Eight teams -- five making return engagements, three celebrating their coming 
of age -- vie for <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Section Division IV and V girls' and boys' 
basketball titles today and tonight at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for us," Christian Coach <PERSON>Randy Wright</PERSON> said. "Not 
too many kids have the opportunity to play in the Sports Arena." Wright's 
Patriots (13-11) will take a measure of experience -- they defeated <ORGANIZATION>Mountain 
Empire</ORGANIZATION> for the Division IV title last year -- into their 8:30 game against 
Coronado (11-13), first-time visitors to the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Christian also has the distinction of coming from the <ORGANIZATION>City Central</ORGANIZATION> 
league, joining Lincoln (Division III) and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> (Division I) also in the 
Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through the war with a lot of these teams," <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado, picked to finished last in the 10-team 3-A Metro Conference, finished 
a surprising fourth. 
</P>
<P>
But Coronado Coach <PERSON>Bob Stanton</PERSON> knows what kind of competition his team will 
face. "Christian is going to be tough," <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON> said. "We have to get on 
(<PERSON>David</PERSON>) <PERSON>Jeremiah</PERSON> and work to break their press." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah is averaging 23 points and <PERSON>Darrell White</PERSON> 18. <PERSON>Tim Barkett</PERSON> has come on 
late in the season and has averaged 18 points in the last eight games. Coronado 
will rely on co-captains <PERSON>Jesse MacNeill</PERSON> (18-point average) and <PERSON>Derek Wastila</PERSON> 
(14). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wright</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Christian</ORGANIZATION>'s success will depend on "executing our offense and 
playing with poise and intensity on defense." 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>4:30</TIME>, <ORGANIZATION>Desert League</ORGANIZATION> rivals <LOCATION>Calipatria</LOCATION> (16-7) -- the defending Division V 
champion -- and Imperial (13-9) -- the <LOCATION>Desert League</LOCATION> champion -- meet for the 
sixth time this season, with <LOCATION>Calipatria</LOCATION> winning four out of the five played. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mike Moss</PERSON> is <LOCATION>Calipatria</LOCATION>'s only returning starter, but <PERSON>Javier Vega</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vince 
Coleman</PERSON>, who came off the bench last year, add experience. Fourth-seeded 
<LOCATION>Calipatria</LOCATION> knocked off top-ranked Bishop's to advance to the championship 
round. 
</P>
<P>
For Imperial, <PERSON>Brian Williams</PERSON> is the player to stop, but the Tigers are hurt by 
the absence of <PERSON>Fabian Diaz</PERSON>, out with a badly sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' Division IV final, defending champion and top-ranked <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> 
will play third-seeded Coronado at <TIME>6:30</TIME>, a rematch of last's year's 
championship, which <LOCATION>Holtville</LOCATION> won. 
</P>
<P>
In the <ORGANIZATION>Division V</ORGANIZATION> game at <TIME>2:30</TIME>, top-seeded <PERSON>Calvin Christian</PERSON> (23-1) will try to 
defeat second-seeded La Jolla Country Day (16-5) -- the defending Division V 
champion -- for the third time this season.

TOLL TO REMAIN FOR CORONADO BRIDGE UNTIL '95; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: STATE DECISION IS A VICTORY FOR CORONADO, WHICH WANTS TOLL FEES 
TO HELP PAY FOR SOLUTIONS TO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The <MONEY>$1</MONEY> toll on the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge will remain in place until at 
least mid-1995, the <ORGANIZATION>California Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION> decided <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, 
ending months of speculation about the future of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in <LOCATION>San Luis Obispo</LOCATION>, the commission voted 5-0 to retain the toll 
until <DATE>June, 1995</DATE>, and use the funds for improvements on the bridge and along 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s congested roadways, said <PERSON>Mariana Mejia</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The 
commission sets state transportation policy. 
</P>
<P>
The toll question will be reviewed again in <DATE>January, 1995</DATE>, <PERSON>Mejia</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
The toll already has provided sufficient funds to cover the construction costs 
of the 21-year-old bridge, one of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s most recognizable landmarks, 
which stretches from near downtown across <LOCATION>San Diego Bay</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics had wanted the toll scrapped, contending that it was too 
burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
But Coronado city officials and others feared that rescinding the toll would 
prompt more people to use the bridge, thus worsening the city's already 
substantial traffic problem. Pro-toll advocates backed retaining the fee and 
using the proceeds for road and bridge improvements -- the precise option 
chosen <DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the state commission. 
</P>
<P>
The tolls are expected to generate <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in gross revenues between now 
and <DATE>1995</DATE>, <PERSON>Mejia</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly we hope it (the toll) will help with some of the traffic issues," said 
<PERSON>Jacqueline Wilson</PERSON>, deputy Coronado city clerk. "Traffic seems to be Coronado's 
biggest problem. What are we going to do with all those cars on the roads?" 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>, the low-income <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> community most impacted by the 
bridge, many favor using toll funds for improvements in their inner-city 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman <PERSON>Bob Filner</PERSON>, whose district includes <PERSON>Barrio Logan</PERSON>, said he planned to 
approach state officials about directing toll monies toward community projects. 
Among the possible options: Use the funds to help alleviate bridge-related 
neighborhood traffic congestion or for the upkeep and expansion of the 
acclaimed murals painted on the bridge columns in <LOCATION>Chicano Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to keep the toll, we should pay what's due to a community 
that has has suffered from it," <PERSON>Filner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, construction of the bridge is remembered bitterly by many in 
<LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>, who say that the structure split one of southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s 
oldest Chicano communities, displacing many families. Chicano Park was born 
amid that controversy, symbolizing to many the determination of area residents 
to fight back after the devastation inflicted by the bridge construction. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is a victory for <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado City 
Council</ORGANIZATION>, who have gone on record in support of a continued toll. Mayor <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> 
testified <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in favor of retaining the fee, as did councilman <PERSON>Michel 
Napolitano</PERSON>, according to <PERSON>Mejia</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The elegant, 2.23-mile long, 246-feet high bridge, which was was officially 
opened on <DATE>Aug. 2, 1969</DATE>, was financed through the sale of almost <MONEY>$48 million</MONEY> in 
construction bonds. The accumulated tolls paid off the bond bill by <DATE>1986</DATE>, some 
17 years ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$1</MONEY> bridge toll is charged only to westbound vehicles. (The toll had been 
<MONEY>$1.20</MONEY> until it was reduced in <DATE>1988</DATE>.) Car-pool vehicles are exempt. Commuters 
may purchase books of 20 tickets for <MONEY>$12</MONEY>, or <MONEY>60 cents</MONEY> per round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge traffic has been increasing by <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> per year, according to <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>. 
The numbers of vehicles using the bridge in both directions rose from almost 
50,000 during the 1984-85 fiscal year to 62,000 during the 1988-89 fiscal year, 
the most recent year for which data are available, <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> said.

CORONADO GANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to an article titled "Coronado Question: Does It Have 
a Gang Problem?" (<DATE>Oct. 19</DATE>) I find the so-called Coronado White Boys a revolting 
and ill-humored joke. Any form of respect (or humor, for that matter) cannot be 
dug up for these kids who make a feeble attempt at imitating those serious 
gangs on the mainland. Just calling themselves a "gang" already has invited a 
lot of dispute. Inevitably, so will it invite the serious gangs of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Such easy prey as a group of <ORGANIZATION>Coronado White Boys</ORGANIZATION> would be a pleasure for those 
gangs that dispute violently over colors and territory. Besides, any gang could 
just hop in a car with two or more members, and drive over the bay for free. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Bay Bridge</ORGANIZATION> begins in the <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, a prime 
hangout for local gangs. It would only be a five- to 10-minute commute over to 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that these white boys be exposed to what gangs really are all about. 
I suggest that they be taken away from their secure and untouched homes in 
<LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> and placed in the middle of a gang-infested neighborhood. I'd like to 
see their shocked faces as an innocent 10-year-old boy gets hit by gang 
cross-fire at a public park. I'd like them to attend a high school where they 
couldn't wear a certain color for fear of being terrorized by a gang. Would 
these teens still mock and imitate a gang with humorous intent after seeing the 
corruption and evil of a typical <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> gang? Would they still have the 
nerve to form a gang in their community after seeing the fear gangs create in 
communities? 
</P>
<P>
And the answer to the Coronado question? Yes, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> has a gang problem. If 
these teens succeeded in forming a gang, with innocent intentions or not, then 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> should be shuddering with fear of the possibility that it too can be 
infected with the widespread disease of gangs.

route to a 65-45 victory over <LOCATION>Bonita Vista</LOCATION> (21-6). The key to <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION>'s victory,

CORONADO COOL TO PROPOSAL THAT IT TAKE OVER TROUBLED IMPERIAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
BROKE: MAYOR OF NEARLY BANKRUPT CITY GETS LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT IN VISIT TO 
RICHER NEIGHBOR. 
</P>

<P>
Coronado Mayor <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> reacted coolly <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to an idea by Imperial Beach 
Mayor <PERSON>Henry Smith</PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> take over nearly bankrupt <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to seriously investigate our future options. One of the 
options is the city of Coronado," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said in a letter he read to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado City Council</ORGANIZATION>. "All that I would like to do today is to begin the 
process of our staff looking at the city of Coronado and assessing whether it 
is a viable option to consider our consolidation with your city." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach officials have warned that the city will not be able to pay its 
bills in <DATE>January</DATE>, unless new revenue sources are found. To that end, a measure 
to raise <MONEY>$450,000</MONEY> annually with a <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> tax on each utility bill was put to 
voters, but was defeated, <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But even that wouldn't have guaranteed financial viability for the ailing beach 
town, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said, and officials would still seek to merge with <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
If Imperial Beach goes bankrupt, it might be forced to disincorporate, thereby 
coming under county control. <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> have also discussed 
consolidating with <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> made it clear that Coronado officials are not enthusiastic 
about annexing <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"We would feel very cautious," <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> said. "Coronado has worked long and hard 
to be where we are. It may be more of an undertaking than we can envision." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, a city of about 25,000 residents, is the only beach city in the 
county that has not developed its beachfront. Many of its residents are 
apartment dwellers, and it has a limited tax base. For almost a decade, the 
city was forced to dip into its reserves to continue providing services, and 
the reserve is now exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, with its upper-middle-class community, has long 
cherished its exclusiveness and is well-known for the many <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> admirals who 
have retired there. The average cost of a home is <MONEY>$406,000</MONEY> in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>, which 
has a population of about 20,000; the average cost of a home is <MONEY>$174,000</MONEY> in 
<LOCATION>Imperial Beach</LOCATION>. The two cities are joined by the Silver Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Herron expressed concern that <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s resources would be strained if it were 
required to provide services such as police and fire protection to <LOCATION>Imperial 
Beach</LOCATION>, which is served by the sheriff and has a tiny fire department. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the outcome will be. But no mayor will want to be faced with 
the condition you find yourself in," <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> said to <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> requested that <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> allow <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s city manager to meet with 
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>'s city manager to discuss the proposed merger, <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> did not 
make a commitment to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to jump into this, are they? All I ask for is exactly what 
the letter said," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said after his brief appearance before the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado 
City Council</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last month, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado City</ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON>Homer Bludau</PERSON> 
said there is no incentive for <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> to consolidate with <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego City</LOCATION> Manager <PERSON>John Lockwood</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> city officials would 
be willing to discuss consolidation with Imperial Beach, but he added that 
there were no immediate plans by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to annex <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON>Brian Bilbray</PERSON> has argued that the best alternative 
available to <LOCATION>Imperial Beach</LOCATION> is to consolidate with the county. <PERSON>Bilbray</PERSON>, a 
former <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION> mayor, said the county would become <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>'s 
trustee for three years, then voters would have an opportunity to vote on 
incorporation again. 
</P>
<P>
However, <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and the majority of the <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach City Council</ORGANIZATION> favor 
consolidating with either Coronado or <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>.

CITY URGED TO USE CORONADO BRIDGE TOLLS FOR BARRIO LOGAN PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> city officials were asked <DATE>Friday</DATE> to examine ways to use tolls from 
the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Bridge</ORGANIZATION> to improve <PERSON>Barrio Logan</PERSON>, the historic Chicano neighborhood 
that was devastated by bridge and highway construction two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the <ORGANIZATION>California Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION> decided to retain the <MONEY>$1</MONEY> 
round-trip toll until at least mid-1995, but authorities earmarked the 
estimated <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> in tolls until mid-1995 for bridge upkeep and for traffic 
projects along bridge approaches in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>. The tolls have already paid for 
bridge construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
By statute, the toll funds -- which are state, not city revenues -- can now 
only be used for maintenance, rehabilitation and traffic improvements on the 
bridge and its approaches, said <PERSON>Mariana Mejia</PERSON>, a spokeswoman in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> with 
the <ORGANIZATION>California Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that requirement can be met and the funds directed toward 
bridge-related projects in <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION> remains an open question. "They (<LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> officials) will have to work around it creatively," said <PERSON>Mejia</PERSON>, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Councilman Bob Filner</PERSON> formally requested that City Manager <PERSON>John 
Lockwood</PERSON> investigate the use of tolls for a variety of Barrio Logan projects, 
including traffic improvements on city streets leading to the bridge and the 
upkeep and expansion of <LOCATION>Chicano Park</LOCATION>. The park, which is situated in the shadow 
of the bridge's eastern terminus, features widely acclaimed murals depicting 
Chicano, indigenous American and other themes emblazoned on the bridge's 
concrete support pillars. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the construction of the bridge and the ongoing operations have had a 
really negative impact on the community of <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>, and there ought to be 
some recognition of that impact," said <PERSON>Filner</PERSON>, whose district includes the 
barrio, a low-income area. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>, where the bridge remains a sore point and where bridge traffic 
contributes to traffic bottlenecks, a still-nascent movement has emerged 
seeking to redirect some of the toll funds to community needs, particularly the 
care of <ORGANIZATION>Chicano Park</ORGANIZATION> and its much-lauded murals. Some of the murals are 
deteriorating and badly in need of care, activists say. There have also been 
few additions in recent years, although the mural project is considered ongoing 
and open to expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should get our fair share," said <PERSON>Salvador Roberto Torres</PERSON>, a 
neighborhood resident, artist and assistant professor at <ORGANIZATION>San Diego State 
University</ORGANIZATION> who has long been active in promoting the park murals. 
"Traditionally, we have been the stepchild in this whole drama of events that 
has unfolded and impacted our community." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge opened in <DATE>August, 1969</DATE>. Its erection, along with the somewhat 
earlier construction of the Interstate 5 freeway, displaced thousands of 
residents of <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s oldest Chicano communities. 
Neighborhood outrage over the displacements and a perceived city neglect of the 
area sparked a series of events and confrontations that led directly to the 
founding of <LOCATION>Chicano Park</LOCATION> and the painting of the murals. 
</P>
<P>
In <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, Mayor <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that she expects no objection from 
her constituents if bridge toll revenues are redirected to improvements in 
<LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>. However, she noted that the city could face difficulty in 
complying with the state guidelines restricting the use of toll money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there would be a pretty stiff legal battle," Mayor <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Whittier Christian High School</ORGANIZATION>, after winning the Southern Section 2-AA 
basketball championship <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, enters the <ORGANIZATION>Southern California Regionals</ORGANIZATION> 
today as the third-seeded team in Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (22-6) will play <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Coronado (11-14) at <ORGANIZATION>La Habra High 
School</ORGANIZATION> in a first-round game tonight at <TIME>7:30</TIME>. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian, led by 6-foot-7 center <PERSON>Scott Ferguson</PERSON> (19 points and 11 
rebounds a game) and 6-4 forward <PERSON>Paul McKinley</PERSON> (21 points, 9 rebounds), may not 
have too great a challenge in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>, the only team in the division playoffs 
with a losing record. <PERSON>Derek Wastila</PERSON>, a 6-5 junior center, leads Coronado with 
14 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Wastila is supported by 5-6 guard <PERSON>Tim DeWitt</PERSON>, 6-3 forward <PERSON>Jesse MacNeill</PERSON> and 
6-2 guard <PERSON>Tom Mitchell</PERSON>, who was the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Section player of the year in 
water polo last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're facing these unknown teams, you are always a little hesitant in 
what to say to the kids," Whittier Christian Coach <PERSON>Bob Brown</PERSON> said. "But I feel 
good. I feel we got a real good seeding for the first round." 
</P>
<P>
In other Division IV play: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (23-4) vs. El Cajon Christian (14-11) at Granite Hills High: 
Orange Lutheran, which defeated <ORGANIZATION>Whittier Christian</ORGANIZATION> twice en route to the 
Olympic League title this season, qualified for the regionals as an at-large 
entry after losing, 78-54, to 2-A champion <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran, coming off its worse performance of the season <DATE>Saturday</DATE> when 
it shot just <PERCENT>32%</PERCENT> from the field after averaging <PERCENT>55%</PERCENT> all season, will meet a 
good shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
 <ORGANIZATION>El Cajon Christian</ORGANIZATION>, which defeated <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, 70-60, <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for the section 
Division IV title, is especially capable at the free throw line. Saturday it 
converted 21 of 22 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Its top player, 6-1 guard <PERSON>David Jeremiah</PERSON>, is a three-year starter who averages 
21.6 points. In one game this season, he made 10 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Darrell White</PERSON>, a 6-5 senior forward, averages 20 points for <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>. Other 
starters are 6-3 forward <PERSON>Tim Barkett</PERSON>, 6-foot junior guard <PERSON>Brad Fox</PERSON> and 6-10, 
215-pound center <PERSON>Dan Tate</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Tate, though intimidating in size, rarely scores in double figures. He scored 
just two points in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s victory.

KEITH EDGES WALKER TO WIN CORONADO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<PERSON>Susan Keith</PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION>, appeared to have 
won a narrow victory <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> over three other candidates in a race for a 
vacant <ORGANIZATION>Coronado City Council</ORGANIZATION> seat, according to unofficial results released by 
the <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
With <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> of the votes counted, <PERSON>Keith</PERSON> led <PERSON>Greg Walker</PERSON>, a jewelry store owner, 
by 29 votes, or 2,217 to 2,188. However, an official at the registrar's office 
said 27 absentee and 14 provisional ballots remained to be counted. A 
provisional ballot is one that needs to be validated by making sure that a 
voter is properly registered. 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates, <PERSON>Donald Zub</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> SEAL and construction worker, 
and <LOCATION>Louis</LOCATION> de Beer, an engineer and computer consultant, trailed badly with 172 
and 153 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Keith is expected to fill the seat left vacant when Councilwoman <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> 
was elected mayor in <DATE>November</DATE>. Herron defeated incumbent <PERSON>R.H. Dorman</PERSON>. Keith 
will serve for the remaining two years of <ORGANIZATION>Herron</ORGANIZATION>'s council term. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar's spokesman said <PERCENT>42.8%</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s 11,190 registered voters 
turned out in the special election.

<P>
Hey, all you water polo and tennis players, listen up. The Coronado boys' 
basketball team won the Division IV <LOCATION>San Diego Section</LOCATION> championship <DATE>Friday</DATE> with 
a 63-53 victory over Imperial at <LOCATION>Golden Hall</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Nyah-nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stereotyped as a tennis and water polo school," said 6-foot-3 center 
<PERSON>Derek Wastila</PERSON>, who scored 19 points. "Little do they know we have some talent 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
Enough, in fact, to win the school's first section basketball championship. 
This team also won <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s first league championship since <DATE>1963</DATE>, finishing 
atop the newly formed <ORGANIZATION>City Harbor League</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"All they hear is tennis and water polo," <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Coach</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Bob Stanton</PERSON> said. "But 
we've beaten some pretty good teams this year. This wasn't a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Still, people have been telling guard <PERSON>Paul Carter</PERSON> for years that he should 
transfer to a real basketball school. He didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck it out for four years," he said. "And I'm pretty satisfied with my 
career here." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Carter</PERSON> ended it with an exclamation point, scoring nine points and assisting 
his teammates on a rather amazing accomplishment in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, when 
Coronado (19-8) outscored Imperial 18-2. Imperial, which used a balanced 
offense to build a 33-29 halftime lead, managed only a pair of free throws in 
the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. Forward <PERSON>Brian Williams</PERSON>' half-court prayer at the conclusion 
of the period, which bounced around the rim and out, was the closest thing 
Imperial had to a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their size and strength wore us down a little," Imperial Coach <PERSON>Kerry 
Legarra</PERSON> said. "We just quit moving and maybe that was because of fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
If Imperial (16-8) was tired, it wasn't extinct. Trailing, 47-35, at the end of 
the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Tigers</ORGANIZATION> trimmed <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s lead to eight with less than 
three minutes remaining. Then, when Imperial forward <PERSON>Erik Mellas</PERSON> drove for a 
layup, Wastila swatted <PERSON>Mellas</PERSON>' shot halfway to <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> wound 
up with a layup on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
"I do tend to feast on the smaller teams," <PERSON>Wastila</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
A basket and three free throws down the stretch by forward <PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON>, who 
scored 19 points to share game-high honors with <LOCATION>Wastila</LOCATION>, helped preserve the 
victory, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s second over Imperial this season. 
</P>
<P>
One key to this victory was <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON>'s decision to change the defense in the 
<DATE>third quarter</DATE> from a box-and-one, designed to shut down forward/center <PERSON>Brian 
Williams</PERSON>, to a two-three zone. Williams managed just nine points, and the 
defensive switch threw Imperial's offense out of kilter. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of their shots came easy," <PERSON>Legarra</PERSON> said. "And a lot of ours came very, 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Legarra</PERSON> wasn't completely dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"How many teams," he asked, "score two points in one quarter and are still in 
the ball game?"

CORONADO'S BID TO BAR TOUR BUSES GETS STRANDED ON THE BEACH 
</P>

CORONADO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If diesel smoke was all that tour buses spewed, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> residents might 
consider backing down. It's the annoying patter that they say they're sick to 
death of -- the running commentary, blared over the buses' public address 
systems, lecturing paying passengers about one of <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>'s most 
exclusive communities. 
</P>
<P>
"They slow down and they say, 'Now look. This is where all the rich folks live. 
Well, now this is where the Duchess of <LOCATION>Windsor</LOCATION> lived. Now you see in the 
driveway the Jaguars or the Mercedeses or the BMWs,' " said <PERSON>Doris Pray</PERSON>, a 
grandmother whose 27 years in Coronado have made her an expert on tour bus 
prattle. 
</P>
<P>
Such gawking is harassment, Pray and other Coronadans say. And these days -- at 
least since <DATE>September</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado City Council</ORGANIZATION> passed an ordinance to 
bar tour buses from most streets except state highways -- it is against the 
law. At least, technically. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities, like <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, for example, have laws limiting tour bus 
routes. But <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s attempt has a peculiar wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
The state <ORGANIZATION>Coastal Commission</ORGANIZATION> is concerned that in limiting tour bus routes the 
city also has inadvertently limited coastal access in violation of the state 
Coastal Act. Until a ruling is obtained on that question, the <ORGANIZATION>Coastal 
Commission</ORGANIZATION> has stopped Coronado from enforcing its law. 
</P>
<P>
But Coastal Commissioner <PERSON>David Malcolm</PERSON> says he already has made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a basically white community saying, Stay out!" said <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON>, who has 
earned the enmity of some Coronadans by opposing several proposals he finds 
"exclusionary." Malcolm, who is also a councilman in the largely Latino city of 
<LOCATION>Chula Vista</LOCATION>, says the Coronado sensibility goes something like this: "God 
forbid someone from out of town and from a minority race would come into our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado's civic leaders deny that racism has tainted their policy-making. But 
they admit that ever since the tiny 6-square-mile island city seceded from <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> in <DATE>1891</DATE>, it has struggled to keep its distance from its larger mainland 
neighbor. Especially since <DATE>1969</DATE>, when the elegant 2.23-mile San Diego-Coronado 
Bay Bridge linked the two cities for the first time, residents have chafed at 
the resulting surge in traffic -- and, some say, crime -- on their orderly, 
tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> says, city leaders seem to be working harder than 
ever to keep out-of-towners at bay. 
</P>
<P>
This <DATE>fall</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>California Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION> considered scrapping 
the <MONEY>$1</MONEY> toll on the <LOCATION>San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> 
successfully lobbied to extend the toll until <DATE>1995</DATE>. While it had more than met 
its original goal -- paying back nearly <MONEY>$48 million</MONEY> in construction bonds -- 
the toll had other merits, <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> argued. By discouraging sightseers, she said, 
it kept <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s traffic in check. 
</P>
<P>
Then the city came up with a plan to create residents-only decal parking zones 
on a section of shoreline near the <LOCATION>North Island Naval Air Station</LOCATION>. The city 
said it needed the zones because <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> employees' vehicles often block residents 
from parking near their homes. But <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Coastal Commission</ORGANIZATION> Chairman 
<PERSON>Thomas W. Gwyn</PERSON> cried foul and are appealing the ordinance on the basis that it 
limits beach access. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the tour bus ordinance, which would keep most commercial buses from 
traveling the city's most scenic coastal routes. In addition, the ordinance 
would force buses that drop passengers at the area's biggest tourist 
attraction, the historic Hotel del Coronado, to travel five extra miles down 
the Silver Strand peninsula simply to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado is not the first <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> city to try to regulate tour bus traffic. 
In <DATE>1976</DATE>, sick of being overrun by star-gazers, <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> banned commercial 
sightseeing vehicles weighing three tons or more from traveling on most 
residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which withstood challenges in the <ORGANIZATION>state Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>, sought to 
eliminate what it called "all nature of nuisances . . . such as trespassing, 
knocking on doors, littering, trampling on shrubbery and flower beds, using the 
shrubbery for toilet purposes, making loud and raucous noises, removing items 
as souvenirs and generally disturbing the peace and privacy of the residents, 
most of whom are not celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Malcolm</PERSON> heard that <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> was going to follow suit, he says he could 
only wonder what would come next. "A wall around the city? A drawbridge?" 
</P>
<P>
"What gives Coronado the right to say people can't go up and down the 
waterfront?" he asked, rejecting as absurd the charge, leveled by some 
Coronadans, that he is a shill for the tour bus industry. 
</P>
<P>
Pray, who has made the anti-bus fight a personal crusade, says it is a matter 
of human decency. Given the buses' long history of wrongdoing, she said, 
something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing last week, tour bus operators said the ordinance will 
create an economic hardship, adding 15 minutes to their routes and forcing 
passengers to endure repetitive views. But when <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s mayor suggested to 
her constituents that they increase their chances of winning <ORGANIZATION>Coastal Commission</ORGANIZATION> 
approval by considering alternatives to the ordinance, 11 residents rose, one 
by one, to say no. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the buses continue to roll unrestricted through town, gushing 
well-rehearsed flackery as they go. Among the highlights: a church with <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany</ORGANIZATION> 
windows, the house where <PERSON>Wallace Simpson</PERSON> lived before she married the duke, and 
the spot where <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jack Lemmon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tony Curtis</PERSON> filmed "Some Like It 
Hot" at the grand <ORGANIZATION>Hotel Del</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the inspiration for the <LOCATION>Emerald City</LOCATION> in the Wizard of Oz," said Old 
Town Trolley tour bus driver <PERSON>Midge Crockett</PERSON> as she turned off the highway, 
hurtled down a quiet residential street and parked at a shorefront bus stop 
that the ordinance would abolish. 
</P>
<P>
"And this," she said, "is the most beautiful beach in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>."

'CORONADO COMPANY' FIGURE ARRESTED IN NEW DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another member of a former drug-smuggling ring known as the "Coronado Company" 
has been arrested on new drug charges, authorities said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Edward Wade</PERSON>, 47, of <ORGANIZATION>Del Mar</ORGANIZATION> was arrested <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> 
town of <LOCATION>Leggett</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego County Integrated Narcotic Task Force</ORGANIZATION> announced. 
He is the third former "Coronado Company" member to be arrested in the task 
force investigations since <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Wade was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to import marijuana. He was 
described by authorities as an "alleged partner and financier" in a plan to 
smuggle 10 tons of marijuana into the country by boat. Agents seized about 
<MONEY>$55,000</MONEY> when <PERSON>Wade</PERSON> was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nine other people arrested in connection with the smuggling plot was 
<PERSON>Edward R. Otero</PERSON>, 34, of <ORGANIZATION>Del Mar</ORGANIZATION>, another member of the "Coronado Company," a 
drug-trafficking ring that so named because it had its start among classmates 
at <ORGANIZATION>Coronado High School</ORGANIZATION> in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Otero was taken into custody <DATE>Monday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Rockport</LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> 
coast. Authorities said <PERSON>Otero</PERSON> was the leader of a group that had gone to 
<LOCATION>Rockport</LOCATION> to rendezvous with a boat off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
A third <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Company</ORGANIZATION> member, <PERSON>Robert Kent Lahodny</PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, was 
arrested <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents in connection with an alleged plot

CORONADO BEATS ST. AUGUSTINE, CLOSES ON FIRST

<TEXT>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine High</ORGANIZATION> is still in the driver's seat, but <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> just forced the 
driver to take a closer look in the rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>City Harbor League</ORGANIZATION> teams were already familiar with one another before 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, having met twice in league and once in the Lion's Tournament, with <ORGANIZATION>St. 
Augustine</ORGANIZATION> winning twice. But Coronado evened the series, scoring three runs in 
the seventh inning to break a 3-3 tie and give the Islanders a clutch, 6-3 
victory that kept them in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado jumped to a 3-0 lead in the top of the first, then watched <LOCATION>St. 
Augustine</LOCATION>'s creep back into the game with single runs in the second, third and 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them before the game that three (runs) wouldn't win it," <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Coach 
Ron Smock</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> (14-7-1, 6-3) bought some time in its attempt to catch <LOCATION>St. 
Augustine</LOCATION> (13-0, 7-2). There are three games left. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us some momentum," <PERSON>Smock</PERSON> said. "This was a big win for us. We could 
have folded, but we hung in there." 
</P>
<P>
No one hung tighter than <ORGANIZATION>Smock</ORGANIZATION>'s son, <PERSON>Kyle</PERSON>, a freshman who had struck out twice 
and popped to second in his first three at-bats. With one out in the seventh, 
<ORGANIZATION>Smock</ORGANIZATION>, the first batter to face reliever <PERSON>George Inzunza</PERSON>, hit a ball hard to 
left field, and it took a Coronado drop for a double. <PERSON>Jason Fledderjohn</PERSON> was 
intentionally walked, and <PERSON>Joel Franklin</PERSON> hit a triple to right, scoring Smock 
and <ORGANIZATION>Fledderjohn</ORGANIZATION>. Franklin scored the final run on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"When the little guy can come in and get a double like that, that tells the 
other guys something," said <PERSON>Ron Smock</PERSON>, whose son is 5-feet-4. 
</P>
<P>
Mike (Buck) <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> pitched 6 1/3 innings for the Saints and gave up three runs 
on five hits before <PERSON>Inzunza</PERSON>, who shut out <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, 2-0, the last time they 
played, came in. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some clutch hitting. We didn't let up," said <PERSON>Fledderjohn</PERSON>, who pitched 
an eight-hitter, singled twice, walked twice and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado's other league losses were to <PERSON>Marian Catholic</PERSON> and Clairemont, both 
teams they must meet again. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't panic," said <PERSON>Mike Stephenson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> coach. "We just need to 
execute a little better." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION> still has the enviable league-leading record, something 
<PERSON>Stephenson</PERSON> finds relief in. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be in our position than theirs," he said. "We don't have to depend 
on anyone but ourselves, and they need help from someone else. We don't have to 
worry about that." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a game matching equal talent, between two teams that were 
favorites to battle for the <ORGANIZATION>Harbor League</ORGANIZATION> boys' basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
But <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s game between Coronado and <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> was instead a mismatch, 
and <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION> won, 74-61. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the best team in the league," <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Coach</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Bob Stanton</PERSON> said. "Our 
kids underestimated them, and they beat us up out there." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a loss to Christian last week, <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> (1-1, 11-6) needed the 
victory to stay in the running for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a must-win situation for us," Coach <PERSON>Jeff Armstrong</PERSON> said. "You can't 
go down 0-2 in league and expect to win it. We talked about it all week. Now 
we're back in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the victory was assured with a 10-point lead and a minute 
remaining, <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Bryan Cantwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Mossuto</PERSON> kept shooting and 
scoring until the final buzzer. Cantwell finished with season-high 31 points, 
14 in the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>. Mossuto scored 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to stay intense all the time," <PERSON>Cantwell</PERSON> said. "We had three intense 
practices this week. We came in thinking we were the underdog, and <PERSON>Wastila</PERSON> was 
the man." 
</P>
<P>
The Saint' defense held <PERSON>Derek Wastila</PERSON>, who has been averaging 18.7 points a 
game, to seven. 
</P>
<P>
After a sluggish first five minutes, <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> trailed, 12-10. But the 
Saints then turned it into a running game and five minutes later had a 27-16 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create an up tempo and run against <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>," <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said. "We 
went up by 10, then wanted to play a deliberate game with high-percentage 
scoring." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado (0-1, 10-7) trailed, 38-33, at halftime and never got closer than that 
in the <DATE>second half</DATE>. The Islanders had a number of opportunities, but missed 
shots from long range prevented them from challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't their press that hurt us," <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON> said. "Our kids were trying too 
many outside shots. When we came down the middle of court and got inside, we 
were scoring, but the kids just weren't doing it enough." 
</P>
<P>
James Stark led Coronado with 19 points, <PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON> scored 17 and <PERSON>Paul Carter</PERSON> 
scored 11.

The Coronado water polo team wasn't quite sure if its coach, <PERSON>Randy Burgess</PERSON>, 
would make it in time to see the Islanders play <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> for the 3-A Section title 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado (28-4) claimed its fourth consecutive Section title by defeating 
<LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION>, 14-9, at the <ORGANIZATION>Jewish Community Center</ORGANIZATION>. And <PERSON>Burgess</PERSON>, who did arrive 30 
minutes before the game, praised his team's play even though the Islanders had 
to play catchup a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"They played us tough, but I felt our kids weren't really focused on the game," 
<PERSON>Burgess</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 3-3 <DATE>first-quarter</DATE> tie, <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> forced Coronado to play catchup in the 
<DATE>second quarter</DATE>. At halftime, the score was again tied, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> (23-1) took an 8-6 lead. But with three minutes 
remaining in the quarter, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> went on a scoring spree and led, 10-8, 
entering the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"After it was 8-6 I thought we were in control of the game," <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Greg 
Ormsby</PERSON> said. "They just went on a rampage. They're a very balanced field and 
(they have) the best qoalie in the county (<PERSON>Jack Bowen</PERSON>)." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, <LOCATION>Valhalla</LOCATION> defeated USDHS, 17-10, to win the 2-A 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A game, USDHS tried, but couldn't stop <PERSON>Mike Nalu</PERSON>, who scored nine 
goals for <LOCATION>Valhalla</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Eric Nielsen</PERSON> added four for the Norsemen. USDHS was led by 
<PERSON>Doug Munz</PERSON>, who scored six goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to try to have two people on <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> when he gets the ball," USDHS 
Coach <PERSON>Dan Crane</PERSON> said. "He's so quick that he turns and make things happen."

CORONADO AWAKENS -- MAYBE -- TO A NEW THREAT;

CORONADO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The police chief of <LOCATION>Coronado Island</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jerry Boyd</PERSON>, has no doubt that there are 
dangerous forces at work on his orderly, tree-lined streets across the bay from 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. They are the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado White Boys</ORGANIZATION>, the island's first gang, he says, 
and their message is "Crips, get out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado parents aren't so sure. Yes, some have begun hearing about a new club, 
the CWBs. And yes, it's been hard to ignore the new teen-age fashion trend: 
white baseball caps worn askew. But, don't kids always dress funny? 
</P>
<P>
Self-proclaimed CWBs, a bunch of skateboard-riding adolescents with a penchant 
for video games, say they are the victims of gang hysteria. They have no 
intention, they say, of doing harm to anyone, especially street gangs. They say 
they're being harassed by the law, and recently they have won support from the 
island newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Police Chief <PERSON>Jerry Boyd</PERSON> has taken what may have been a student's private joke 
and made it into something terrifying," an editorial proclaimed two weeks ago 
in the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Journal</ORGANIZATION>. "Minors need to be protected from themselves and 
outside influences. Let us hope they do not need to be protected from the 
police." 
</P>
<P>
Local residents, many of whom settled on the six square miles of manicured 
lawns to escape big-city problems, say the furor surrounding the White Boys is 
just not Coronado's style. The exclusive community enjoys the lowest crime rate 
in <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>. Its phone book is littered with retired admirals and 
colonels, and more of its high school students try out for water polo than for 
football. When school lets out on a sunny day, the fresh faces of local 
teen-agers look capable of nothing more ominous than under-tipping. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> says that, although most CWBs are law-abiding boys and girls looking 
for the social prestige of an in crowd, about eight members are out to protect 
their beach from outsiders -- and to use force if necessary. Lately, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON>, a 
tough-talking veteran of the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> police force, has been warning parents 
that inner-city gangs may retaliate if they feel threatened by the CWBs. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll go looking for the ones who did them. If they can't find them, they'll 
go after anyone in a white baseball cap. Or worse yet, at noon, at lunchtime, 
when there's 150 kids out in the park, they'll open fire," <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> told 45 parents 
at a meeting last week. "People say that's sensationalism, but it happens 2 1/2 
miles from here every night of the week. It's just a matter of geography." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>CWB</ORGANIZATION> members who agreed to talk last week said <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> is grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a group of friends, not a gang," said <PERSON>Jamie Johnson</PERSON>, an articulate 
17-year-old who helped found the CWBs. "The first we heard of trying to reclaim 
the beach was what we read in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a negative influence, he said, the group has helped some of its 
members get off drugs. The <ORGANIZATION>CWB</ORGANIZATION> name, he said, was a joke, coined as an 
alternative to what other students called them: Grits, or cigarette smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"White is a neutral color, and we were trying to be neutral," said <PERSON>Aaron 
Renshaw</PERSON>, a 15-year-old sophomore with a skateboard under his arm, who said the 
name was never intended to provoke minority gangs. "We have black kids and 
Mexicans in the group, too." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began about a month ago, when <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> says he first heard from his 
officers that the CWBs were mixing with the 16 out-of-town gangs -- "bona fide, 
righteous gangs" -- that frequent the sparkling waters of <LOCATION>North Beach</LOCATION>. Then, a 
few <DATE>Saturdays ago</DATE>, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> said, there was a "push-and-shove confrontation" 
between the CWBs and the <LOCATION>Crips</LOCATION>, a black street gang -- a confrontation CWBs 
deny. On several nights afterward, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> claims, police identified cars of Crips 
cruising the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd ask, 'Hey, there's no party tonight. Why are you over here?' They said, 
'We're here looking for the white boys,' " <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
So <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> wrote a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Journal</ORGANIZATION> cautioning residents to keep an 
eye out for gang activity. The <ORGANIZATION>Coronado School District</ORGANIZATION> responded with both 
barrels: a gang expert was brought in to address a joint faculty meeting of the 
middle and high schools; parents of "known" CWBs received phone calls from 
school administrators; the superintendent of schools sent a letter to parents 
warning that <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> gang activity was in the "formative" stage. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the weekly newspaper's edition two weeks ago, which suggested that 
<PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> was blowing things out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the editor, <PERSON>Suzanne K. Larsen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Aaron Renshaw</PERSON>'s mother, urged her 
neighbors to "dispel the myth" surrounding the CWBs. Writing on behalf of 12 
CWBs, she made what many CWBs say is their first actual challenge: They invited 
the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Police Department</ORGANIZATION> to a friendly game of flag football. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says that about 15 of his officers have agreed to play in early <DATE>November</DATE>. 
Around the same time, however, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> is scheduling a gang symposium for parents 
and students. In addition to photos of <LOCATION>Crips</LOCATION>, Bloods, B-Down Boys and other 
gangs, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> plans to exhibit a collection of weapons confiscated in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> 
and to invite a special guest -- "a real gang member." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to open some eyes. We'll have weapons on display. And I promise 
you, we didn't go across the bridge, seize them and bring them back over here," 
<PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says there are 50 CWBs, while the teen-agers put the number at less than 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by attendance at last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> parents' meeting, the public debate has 
only made some parents more curious -- and frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have spray paint on my garage in a symbol, should I be worried?" one 
woman asked <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> after hearing about the placas, or graffiti symbols, that 
gangs often leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
A concerned father wondered if it would help to publish identifying information 
about the CWBs in community watch newsletters. "Like when you go to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, 
(there are signs) that say, 'This is an alligator. Don't pet it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And another parent asked if the free car-pool lane on the <LOCATION>San Diego-Coronado 
Bay Toll Bridge</LOCATION> is to blame for increased gang activity. "I'd go back to paying 
if it means keeping people like that out of here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CWBs have responded to the outcry by taking off their white 
hats, and they are considering dropping their name. 
</P>
<P>
"If we break the mold, it's because they're trying to mold us into trendy 
little people who wear slacks and play tennis," said <PERSON>Brian Wentz</PERSON>, 16. "But we 
aren't naive. We know gangs have guns."

CORONADO'S SOMETIMES-CRITICIZED POLICE CHIEF RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a decade ago, <PERSON>Jerry Boyd</PERSON> rode into Coronado a flamboyant figure, a 
lawman who nabbed suspects in high-speed chases, responded to late-night police 
calls and made many of his own arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty unusual for the chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
His aggressiveness brought criticism, especially from the police union that was 
battling management in the mid-1980s. But <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> continued to pull on the uniform 
and steer a patrol car through town when he felt like it. 
</P>
<P>
Come <DATE>Jan. 11</DATE>, he will cross the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge and leave for a 
new job as chief of police in the <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> town of <ORGANIZATION>Martinez</ORGANIZATION>, in 
<LOCATION>Contra Costa County</LOCATION>. The two cities share similarities: population, department 
size and a low crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, 44, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> he believed he had accomplished just about all he could 
in upscale <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>, where, in the chief's 10-year tenure, two people have been 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing order of the day is getting a new police station for the 
force of 43 uniformed officers and 17 civilian officers and staff members. 
Plans have been approved, and construction is scheduled to begin next <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
When <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> got to town in <DATE>1981</DATE>, he already had spent eight years as a <LOCATION>Los 
Angeles County</LOCATION> sheriff's deputy and sergeant and six years as a lieutenant and 
captain for the <ORGANIZATION>Irvine Police Department</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
While captain, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> said, he got into a run-in with <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>'s police chief, who 
had tried to destroy a police report on an <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION> city councilwoman, which led 
to <ORGANIZATION>Boyd</ORGANIZATION> being assigned a 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift with no command 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
In <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> was branded a frustrated cop by police critics when, in his 
first year, he went undercover and helped rescue a 3-year-old girl from a 
kidnaper after negotiating for nearly an hour. The incident brought <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> 
fleeting fame in the national media. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers believed <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> would have better served the department sitting 
behind a desk, instead of leading the troops into battle, making his own 
arrests and even using physical force, by his own count, on at least a half a 
dozen occasions. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Nearly four years ago</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Police Officers Assn.</ORGANIZATION> asked for either the 
<LOCATION>San Diego County Sheriff</LOCATION>'s Department or the state attorney general to 
investigate allegations that <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> used excessive force and profanity during a 
<DATE>1987</DATE> arrest of a robbery suspect and that he improperly used police video 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. <PERSON>Edwin Miller</PERSON> reviewed the matter, called the allegations 
"frivolous" and said no investigation was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
A television videotape of the suspect's arrest showed <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> holding a revolver 
and twice shouting, "Shut your . . . mouth" while police held the suspect. <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> 
said he was justified in using profanity at the time because he was dealing 
with "an ex-con." Boyd also defended punching the suspect in the stomach 
because the suspect was about to kick an officer. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Boyd</PERSON> described the criticism in the mid-<DATE>'80s</DATE> as the 
low point of his career in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> and said it was raised only because of 
labor disputes with the city's police union. Despite the second-guessing, he 
said he wouldn't change his tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to put on a uniform and go out and ride in <LOCATION>Martinez</LOCATION>," he said. 
"I contend that the chief should have firsthand knowledge of what his people 
are doing. I need to know that city and I won't get to know it sitting behind a 
desk." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> has a population of 30,332, and 45 sworn officers, compared to 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s 23,681 population and 43 sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
According to <DATE>1989</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> statistics, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> had no murders, eight rapes, 12 
robberies, 26 aggravated assaults, 166 burglaries, 551 thefts and 151 auto 
thefts. During the same time frame, <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> had one murder, six rapes, 24 
robberies, 36 aggravated assaults, 336 burglaries, 912 thefts and 146 auto 
thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Detective <PERSON>Keith James</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Police Officers Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, said 
<PERSON>Boyd</PERSON>'s years in the city were positive. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, we're losing a good chief," <PERSON>James</PERSON> said. "On the other hand, we're 
excited by the change. But the chief's going to be missed. He's done a lot. 
He's just up for a different challenge now."

<DESCRIPT>  PROBE; ORGANIZED-CRIME; PRISON; SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  When a member of a rival prison gang slipped up behind Gabriel Coronado two
years ago in the Santa Clara County Jail and slit his throat, the stoic gang
leader survived but refused to talk to prosecutors. No one was charged in the
attack.;    But after virtually the same thing happened on May 23, at the
hands of a different assailant, Coronado decided he'd had enough and told his
story to a grand jury.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GANGS CITED AS INMATE INDICTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Last week, the courts unsealed an indictment charging attempted murder and
related weapons violations against <PERSON>Leonel Jose Cano</PERSON>, 30, the reputed prison
gang member accused of attacking Coronado with a homemade weapon fashioned
from a toothbrush and the blades of jail-issued razors.;    "With this
indictment, the <LOCATION>D.A.</LOCATION>'s office wants to send a message to gang members that if
they commit a crime in <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>, it will be taken seriously. It will
be prosecuted," said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON>Jim Shore</PERSON>, who is handling
the case.;    <PERSON>Both Cano</PERSON>, who is reputed to be a member of the prison gang
<ORGANIZATION>Nuestra Familia</ORGANIZATION>, and Coronado -- an admitted leader of the Fresno-based prison
gang F-14 -- are in protective custody in the main county jail and could not
be reached for comment.;    But episodes such as the hit on Coronado were
predicted last <DATE>October</DATE> in a controversial memo from a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> parole
officer to officials of the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County Department of Correction</ORGANIZATION>. The
memo warned that members of state prison gangs being held in the local jail
were recruiting county inmates, who are being taught to make weapons and run
errands for gang members.;    Capt. <PERSON>Roy Froom</PERSON>, who wrote the memo after
consulting with state parole gang officer <PERSON>E.J. Allen</PERSON>, said the situation in
<LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION> was not an emergency but would "certainly become violent"
if gang activity was not controlled.;    Froom blamed the problem on a county
policy that allows minimum-security state prisoners to be kept at the local
jail in exchange for money. County jail officials have said repeatedly there
is no serious problem with prison gangs in the jails.;    <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>, 30, was
first attacked in the <LOCATION>Santa Clara County Jail</LOCATION> in <DATE>February 1989.</DATE>;    He now
says a soldier of the rival gang, <ORGANIZATION>Nuestra Familia</ORGANIZATION>, carried out the assault.;  
 The two gangs have clashed since <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> and several others broke from
<ORGANIZATION>Nuestra Familia</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and formed F-14, Shore said.;    He said the most
recent attack occurred about <TIME>7:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>May 23</DATE>, soon after <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> received
word that he would be moved to a different part of the jail to join a drug
abuse program he had hoped to enter.;    Shore said <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> indicated to
<ORGANIZATION>Cano</ORGANIZATION>, who had befriended him in the jail, that he might be moved soon. Minutes
later, after talking to his wife on the telephone, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> walked to the
lower tier of his jail dorm.;    When Coronado reached the bottom step, Shore
said, Cano allegedly grabbed him around the mouth and chin. The F-14 leader
felt a long slash across the right side of his neck. Cano then allegedly
walked casually to the telephone and placed a call, the prosecutor said.;   
The makeshift weapon was later recovered from the scene.;    Coronado
initially told correction officers he injured himself falling against a hinge
of his cell door.;    But somewhere between <ORGANIZATION>Valley Medical Center</ORGANIZATION>, where
doctors closed his wound with 14 stitches, and his return to the <TIME>jail later
that night</TIME>, <PERSON>Gabriel Coronado</PERSON> decided he'd had enough. He told the authorities
he had something he wanted to say.;    Last week, <PERSON>Leonel Cano</PERSON> discovered what
it was.  </TEXT>

CHRISTIAN CELEBRATES CLARK MARK;

HIGH SCHOOLS: THE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE FUZZY, BUT IF BILL WALTON'S SEASON 
SCORING RECORD ISN'T OFFICIALLY GONE YET, IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BE FRIDAY.

With 10 seconds remaining in the Christian High boys' basketball game at 
<LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, Christian's <PERSON>Tony Clark</PERSON> was taken out of the game, 
given a standing ovation and congratulated for breaking <PERSON>Bill Walton</PERSON>'s 
20-year-old section season scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> had made two free throws with 24 seconds left to bring his game total to 
36 points, which by most accounts had taken him past <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s 960 for a season. 
</P>
<P>
Following Christian's 66-50 victory, which tied Coronado for first place (at 
5-2) in the <ORGANIZATION>Harbor League</ORGANIZATION> with a game to play, the celebration of <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s 
accomplishment continued. 
</P>
<P>
Kids were asking him to sign their tennis shoes, pictures were being taken, and 
people were chanting "Tony, Tony." 
</P>
<P>
There's a slight catch, but one <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> should take care of easily in his final 
regular-season game against Clairemont <DATE>Friday</DATE>. In the statistics kept by 
Christian, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> had 925 entering the game, needing 36 to break <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s 
record. Statistics kept by <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION> had him needing just 35 to break. But one 
other statistical source had him needing 37, saying that Christian had wrongly 
credited him with a basket not included in the home scorebook for a game at 
<LOCATION>Santana</LOCATION> way back on <DATE>Dec. 13</DATE>; the home book is official for record purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever. Christian (12-10 overall) decided to celebrate <PERSON>Clark</PERSON>'s accomplishment 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and the first few minutes of <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s game will almost certainly 
eliminate any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON>, who is averaging 44.1 points a game, had only scored 22 points in the 
first three quarters but added 14 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Coronado had to give up something," Christian Coach <PERSON>Randy Wright</PERSON> said. "When 
the score got spread out eight to 10 points, they had to play more straight up. 
When people play straight up, the worst he's done is 49 points." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado used a box-and-one defense, but when <PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON> collected his fourth 
foul in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> was able to take avantage of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids did a good job on defense but then kept thowing the ball away," 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado Coach</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Bob Stanton</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said his main concern was winning the game, not <PERSON>Walton</PERSON>'s record. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any idea how many points I had," <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> said. "If I did it, I did 
it. It didn't make any difference. I was more interested in the 'W' " 
</P>
<P>
Christian took a <DATE>20-14</DATE> lead after a quarter and never trailed. Coronado fell to 
15-8, 5-2 in the league.

Coronado High water polo coach <PERSON>Randy Burgess</PERSON> said he'd been waiting for his 
junior goalie, <PERSON>Jack Bowen</PERSON>, to have a game of the spectacular variety for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Burgess</PERSON>' wait ended <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> as <PERSON>Bowen</PERSON> put on a rejection show <PERSON>Mark Eaton</PERSON> 
would have proud of in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>'s 13-8 victory over <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>San Diego 
Section</LOCATION> title game at the <ORGANIZATION>Jewish Community Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen personally turned back any hopes <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> had of dethroning the two-time 
champs by holding the Titans scoreless with four <DATE>fourth-quarter</DATE> saves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just an incredible player," said <PERSON>Bowen</PERSON>'s teammate <PERSON>Pat Mitchell</PERSON>, who 
scored three third-period goals. "What you saw in the second half was the <PERSON>Jack 
Bowen</PERSON> show." 
</P>
<P>
The show's highlight came with three minutes remaining in the game and Coronado 
ahead, 12-8. With <PERSON>Bowen</PERSON> one-one with <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> junior <PERSON>Chad Aronen</PERSON> at point-blank 
range, <PERSON>Bowen</PERSON> leaped up out of the water and swatted away <ORGANIZATION>Aronen</ORGANIZATION>'s rifle shot. 
</P>
<P>
"That was leg strength," <PERSON>Bowen</PERSON> said. "That's what lifting in the <DATE>summer</DATE> is all 
about. I visualized those kind of blocks in my room <TIME>last night</TIME> when I was 
listening to music." 
</P>
<P>
The music stopped for <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> (22-3) after they grabbed a 7-5 lead early in the 
third period. After the Titans led, they continually self-destructed with 
turnovers and missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
And while <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> was self-destructing, <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> (23-3) was taking advantage of 
nearly every scoring opportunity it had. After trailing 7-5, <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> scored four 
consecutive goals, including long-range bullets from <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chris Cote</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not concerned when we fell behind," <PERSON>Burgess</PERSON> said. "Everybody was in good 
condition and we stayed with our game plan."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CORONADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado police are seeking a man in connection with a series of sexual attacks 
against several women in their homes over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In one assault, the intruder entered the home through an unlocked door. In the 
other, he entered through a second-story window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man tried to rape the women in each attack, but was fought off and fled, 
police said. He has struck at random spots in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>, police said. 
</P>
<P>
All the attacks have occurred either late at night or early in the morning in 
homes where a woman lives without a husband or male companion. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant is described as being in his 20s, 6 feet tall and weighing 200 
pounds. Witnesses told police that the man wears military work clothing, 
including a light blue denim shirt, blue pants and work gloves.

You see it from a distance, and it's like the most beautiful thing you've ever 
seen. It's like this gorgeous woman -- mysterious, alluring, powerful. It gives 
me such a great feeling when I see it on the way back from visiting my mom near 
<LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. It makes me feel at home, like I'm part of something special. 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>Phillip Needham</PERSON>, tow truck driver, San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, it was a symbol of devastation. A lot of people feel it 
ruined <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION>. When it first opened, it had a terrible, terrific impact. 
But now it's a piece of living art. It has a melodic effect on my life, my 
vision. It's a strange thing to say, but I love the bridge. -- <PERSON>Salvador Torres</PERSON>, 
artist in <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
I think it stinks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- <PERSON>Donald P. Murphy</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> resident 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Twenty years ago</DATE>, in the same <DATE>summer</DATE> as <LOCATION>Woodstock</LOCATION> and man's walk on the moon, a 
bridge was opened, linking the sleepy peninsula of Coronado with one of the 
country's fastest-growing cities. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would change the nature of two neighborhoods forever. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would alter political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would serve as an avenue of suicide for the nearly 150 people who 
leaped to their deaths from its tallest point, and as a way to sustain life for 
an endangered species, the peregrine falcon. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would inspire envy, resentment, awe and avarice. This bridge would 
serve as an easel for a new form of urban art. This bridge would end one method 
of transportation and give rise to another. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would, in the <DATE>summer</DATE> of peace and love, inspire anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago today, on <DATE>Aug. 2, 1969</DATE>, when the <LOCATION>San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge</LOCATION> 
was officially opened, <PERSON>Robert L. Wynn</PERSON>, then city manager of <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, remembers 
riding across the majestic span in a <DATE>1918</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Duesenberg</ORGANIZATION>, thinking, "I don't 
believe it -- it's happened!" 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>1971</DATE>, <PERSON>Wynn</PERSON> has been city manager of <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>. He has no problem 
recalling the conflict that preceded and followed the building of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was voted on three times in advisory elections and defeated every time," 
<PERSON>Wynn</PERSON> said. "Truth is, the people of Coronado never wanted the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
But Gov. <PERSON>Edmund G.</PERSON> (Pat) <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> did. <PERSON>Wynn</PERSON> said it was the partnership of <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>John Alessio</PERSON>, then owner of the Hotel del Coronado and <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s wealthiest 
backer, that eventually linked <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> by a method other than 
ferry. 
</P>
<P>
No special ceremony will mark today's anniversary. As <PERSON>Mary Kay Forsyth</PERSON>, 
executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>, put it: "A lot of 
factions here still deeply resent the bridge. Some drive to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> by way of 
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>, just to avoid taking it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admirals Were <PERSON>Reassured 
</P>
<P>
Forsyth</PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> for 40 years, said opposition to the bridge 
crumbled when the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> gave in. 
</P>
<P>
"For years the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> was afraid of war, afraid that a bridge would bottle up the 
entire fleet in the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION>," she said. "When the admirals were finally 
assured that a bridge could be built high enough to prevent that from 
happening, they said OK." 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the state considered a two-lane truss bridge in the early 
part of the century, an idea the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> scuttled. In <DATE>1929</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco 
Bridge &amp; Tunnel Co.</ORGANIZATION> launched a proposal to build a bridge and commissioned 
a feasibility study -- but the stock market crash killed that idea. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1935</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado City Council</ORGANIZATION> proposed building a four-lane bridge with 
6-foot walkways on either side. Again, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> reared its head, saying, in the 
words of one official, "Collapsed bridges sink ships." More measures came and 
went before pro-bridge forces proved unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> dubbed the bridge "my baby," a catch phrase he said he invoked "to 
anger the editors of the <LOCATION>San Diego Union</LOCATION>. They were always so mean to me. And 
they never wanted the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said the bridge got built only because he and the three other members of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Toll Bridge Authority</ORGANIZATION> decided they would build it. Once bonds were sold, it 
was, in <PERSON>Brown</PERSON>'s words, "a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
Now a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Bridge</ORGANIZATION> "one of the great 
accomplishments of my tenure as governor. I realized I could facilitate 
thousands of people reaching the peninsula of <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, one of the loveliest 
bodies of land in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was and is," he said, "a provincial place. A lot of retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> people 
didn't want (the bridge) then and will tell you they don't want it now. The 
growth of the area superseded their wishes. That's the reason I wanted it built 
-- I could foresee the growth of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and particularly of <LOCATION>San Diego 
County</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said his alliance with <PERSON>Alessio</PERSON> had "nothing to do with the bridge being 
built. He was and is a friend of mine. I wanted the bridge because it had to be 
built. Can you imagine <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> now without the bridge? It's absurd to even 
try." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is 2.23 miles long. The design incorporating its 27 girders -- once 
likened to flamingo legs joined by a strand -- is orthotropic, meaning the 
structural support units also form the road surface, keeping weight and costs 
down. Because the configuration provides support in different directions, the 
bridge is able to support staggering loads -- and to withstand ships striking 
the girders. 
</P>
<P>
That's happened once, said <PERSON>Tom Nipper</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>California 
Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
A commercial shipping boat "knocked some of the timbers off but did no damage 
to the concrete pilings," he said. "There's never been substantial damage to 
the bridge. The bridge was built at a height (246 feet) where even the tallest 
aircraft carriers can pass underneath it. There's no way anything can strike 
the top." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge was built without lights. The designers felt those would be 
aesthetically unappealing. A series of head-on traffic accidents changed their 
minds about that, and now many credit lights as the reason for its nickname, 
"the Jewel." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge cost <MONEY>$48 million</MONEY> and was financed through the sale of construction 
bonds. Work began in <DATE>February, 1967</DATE>, and the bridge opened 2 1/2 years later. 
The bill was paid off in <DATE>1986</DATE>, 17 years ahead of schedule. The west-bound only 
toll was <MONEY>$1.20</MONEY> until last year, when it was reduced to <MONEY>$1</MONEY>. Officials for 
<ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates the bridge, say they don't know when, or if, 
the toll will be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lingering controversies surrounding the bridge is its lack of a 
thoroughfare for bicyclists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge is a state highway," <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 75, <PERSON>Nipper</PERSON> noted. "It's too 
dangerous for bicyclists and pedestrians." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said his only regret about the bridge is that it ignores bicyclists and 
walkers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a mistake," he said. "One of the sweetest sights in the world is the 
hundreds of walkers and bicyclists who use the Golden Gate Bridge. I wish 
something could be done. . . . That would make the bridge just about perfect." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Donald P. Murphy</PERSON>, 63, who was born in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> and moved back in <DATE>1968</DATE> after 25 
years in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, said scores of retirees resent the bridge, and thought they 
had given up conflict when the wars were over. Now, he says, they're locked in 
another battle -- developers versus residents, cars versus people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a prisoner in my own home," said <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>, who lives three blocks from 
the bridge at 4th and C streets, which, depending on the time, can become 
gridlocked. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> said traffic in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> is almost intolerable. In a few years, he said, 
the town will be reduced to "total chaos, and then the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> will have to do 
something, because none of its personnel will be able to reach <LOCATION>North Island</LOCATION> due 
to the volume of traffic coming off the bridge. Until that happens, we'll all 
have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jim Larson</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said 50,000 cars a day cross the bridge and 
half that many enter through Imperial Beach the Silver Strand. The city of 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> claims a population of 23,603. Officials at <LOCATION>North Island</LOCATION> say they 
employ between 8,000 and 9,000 civilians and 4,200 <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> personnel. Tourism is a 
no-holds-barred industry. The bridge recorded a <PERCENT>6.3%</PERCENT> increase in traffic last 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Toll bridge Lt. <PERSON>R. D. Thomas</PERSON> said the bridge averaged 15,000 cars a day when it 
opened. The total number of vehicles crossing the bridge in all of <DATE>1970</DATE> was 7.8 
million, he said, but the annual number now is close to 25 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Every Year 
</P>
<P>
He said the bridge is likely to record a peak of 72,000 cars a day this <DATE>summer</DATE> 
(it saw 69,000 on <DATE>Monday</DATE> alone), and about 55,000 a day on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Toll bridge Capt. <PERSON>Dennis Poirier</PERSON> said the bridge has averaged a <PERCENT>6%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> 
increase in traffic every year since it opened. Part of the revenue collected 
at the toll booth is used to commission studies on <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s traffic, he said, 
and the rest is allocated for maintenance and road repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's a bad problem," <PERSON>Poirier</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor <PERSON>R. H. Dorman</PERSON> favored a tunnel that would transport cars from the 
toll plaza to a gateway near the naval base. It was defeated, and <PERSON>Dorman</PERSON>'s 
fortunes sank with it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON>, who ousted <PERSON>Dorman</PERSON> in last year's election, said the tunnel 
would have cost more than <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>; a road around the perimeter of 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, which some favor, would cost three times that amount. She has 
proposed what she calls "the <MONEY>$28-million</MONEY> solution" to the traffic imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Herron</PERSON>'s plan is being evaluated by the <ORGANIZATION>California Transportation Commission</ORGANIZATION>, 
which hopes to reach a decision on it by next month. Herron predicts that a 
sophisticated system of new bus lines and signal lights will alleviate the 
crunch, but some people are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"The buses we have now operate at less than <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> capacity," said resident 
<PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>. "I'd say the best idea is to move." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is not without grisly traffic accidents or suicides. <PERSON>Mary Ann 
Tamburello</PERSON>, clerical supervisor for the <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> coroner, said 145 
people have killed themselves by leaping from the bridge. Most were men in 
their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Three signs in each direction now offer would-be victims the phone number of a 
suicide hot line. Two signs are near the center of the bridge, where the span 
reaches its greatest height from the water. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Phillip Needham</PERSON>, 51, works as a tow truck driver for <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION>. He said he has 
tried to stop 48 people from jumping and credits himself, like a proud relief 
pitcher, with 25 "saves." 
</P>
<P>
"They're up there, they're confused, somebody doesn't love 'em or they've just 
given up," he said. "What do I say? Each one is different. Sometimes I'm nice. 
Sometimes I'm firm. I try to snap them out of their mood, whatever that is. And 
when I don't succeed . . . it's just a horrible thing to witness." 
</P>
<P>
Four peregrine falcons have, at various times, nested under the bridge, above 
<PERSON>Salvador Torres</PERSON>' murals in <LOCATION>Chicano Park</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Jim Larson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Caltrans</ORGANIZATION> believes the 
birds picked the bridge because it's isolated, and they can feed on the pigeons 
beneath its arches. 
</P>
<P>
Peregrine falcons are an endangered species. For a long time after the bridge 
was built, <PERSON>Torres</PERSON> said the neighborhood nearby was endangered, too. Like the 
falcons, it learned to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
The communities most affected by the bridge -- Coronado and <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION> -- are 
alarmingly different, a graphic illustration of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> as a land of haves and 
have-nots. The burden each shares is having been irrevocably altered by the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
A cluster of chichi shops greets visitors off the new passenger ferry, which 
first docked in Coronado in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Peohe's, the restaurant nearest the landing, 
offers lobster for <MONEY>$34.95</MONEY>. Just a few miles away in the barrio, <ORGANIZATION>Cuatro Milpas</ORGANIZATION> 
sells five rolled tacos for <MONEY>$2.25</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the streets in the barrio are dark and mean, and a few people have 
spent years trying to undo the damage inflicted by the bridge and Interstate 5, 
which cut a swath through the neighborhood a few years before. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rachael Ortiz</PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Barrio Station</ORGANIZATION>, a social-service agency, 
said the worst aspect of the bridge was the neighborhood being converted to 
"mixed use and seedy light industry," not to mention the havoc wreaked on homes 
and families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Split the Community 
</P>
<P>
After the bridge was built, "dozens of these creepy businesses moved in," she 
said. "There were shipbuilding shops, welders, sandblasters. . . . The 
employees, and there were hundreds of 'em, parked wherever they could, even if 
it meant your front yard. Children were crossing streets in front of giant 
trucks, and right over our heads was this great big bridge, casting its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, it split the community, and we were enraged. The area was 
raped by anyone wanting to make money. Overnight, we became their whores -- the 
junkyard empire of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. But now, slowly, it's changing. We've targeted 23 
junkyards, and, except for one, all have adopted enclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody cared about building a bridge over us -- in the beginning, we didn't 
matter -- but we made them care. The lesson is, one person's treasure can be 
another's demise." 
</P>
<P>
Community activist <PERSON>Al Ducheny</PERSON> said the opening of the freeway severed the 
barrio from <LOCATION>Logan Heights</LOCATION>, and the bridge bisected the barrio, "completing the 
devastation." The neighborhood's takeover of what became <ORGANIZATION>Chicano Park</ORGANIZATION> and the 
murals that followed "turned a bad thing into a good thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the survivors in <LOCATION>Barrio Logan</LOCATION> speak of their concrete ceiling in tones far 
more loving than those muttered in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>. Torres, the artist, is one of 
those who views the bridge with a feeling approaching reverence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look into the depth of the columns, as the arches flow toward the 
waterfront, I hear a sound, a mystical sound, like that of a living creature," 
he said. "To me, the bridge is life -- reassurance, reaffirmation . . . love. I 
know what the birds must feel when they fly over. They feel pride, in a 
fortress of beauty and strength."

SERVICE SET FOR VETERAN OF ELITE NAVY UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services will be held <DATE>today</DATE> for retired Chief Petty Officer <PERSON>Frank 
Joseph Foss</PERSON>, 66, a longtime member of the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s elite Underwater Demolition 
Teams, who died of cancer in his home <DATE>Oct. 23</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Foss joined the elite unit, forerunner of today's <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> SEAL teams, just before 
the Korean War and remained a member until his retirement in <DATE>1965</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Foss was born in <LOCATION>Pawtucket</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I</LOCATION>. He enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> when he was 17 and, 
during World War II, served in <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>, where he assisted French 
Legionnaires. He left the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> after the war but reenlisted a short time later, 
volunteering for the Underwater Demolition Team. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1966</DATE>, he joined the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Agency for International Development</ORGANIZATION> and served as 
a logistics adviser in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> for eight years. He received several citations 
for bravery during the <DATE>1968</DATE> Tet offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Foss was a 40-year resident of <ORGANIZATION>Coronado and Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>, and helped found 
the first <ORGANIZATION>Fleet Reserve</ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
After his return from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Foss</PERSON> settled in <LOCATION>Imperial Beach</LOCATION>, where he devoted

<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine High School</ORGANIZATION> boys' basketball team must forfeit 12 games, 
including two in the <LOCATION>City Harbor League</LOCATION>, for using an ineligible player, school 
officials announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> had been tied for first in the league with <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> and Christian 
(3-1), but the forfeits -- including league losses to <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Marian 
Catholic</PERSON> -- leave the Saints at 2-19 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado is first alone at 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an oversight that has since been cleared up," said <PERSON>Marty Martin</PERSON>, <LOCATION>St. 
Augustine</LOCATION> athletic director. "The public-to-private transfer waiver form was 
never signed by the player." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said the oversight was discovered after an athlete from another sport 
had a routine interview with Principal <PERSON>John Sanders</PERSON>. It was discovered that the 
athlete hadn't signed the waiver form, leading <PERSON>Sanders</PERSON> to ask <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> about the 
basketball player. When the mistake was discovered, <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> immediately 
notified the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Section office, and the form was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The player missed <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION>'s 79-76 victory over <LOCATION>Clairemont</LOCATION> but was back 
for the Saints' <DATE>92-88</DATE> overtime victory over <ORGANIZATION>University City</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE>. LAURA

In another Division II game: 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION> 51, <ORGANIZATION>University City 45</ORGANIZATION> -- Only five players scored for host <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION>, 
but three of them reached double figures. <PERSON>Adam Jacobsen</PERSON> had 18 points, 
including three three-pointers, and <PERSON>J.J. Olaughlin</PERSON> had 15 for second-seeded 
<LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION> (27-5). <PERSON>Ray Hooper</PERSON> had 12 points and and <PERSON>Jerome Price</PERSON> added 10 for 
<ORGANIZATION>University City</ORGANIZATION> (24-5), the seventh seed. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora led, 28-21, at halftime. <ORGANIZATION>University City</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Section 
Division II runner-up, rallied to outscore <LOCATION>Glendora</LOCATION>, 13-8 in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> 
and pull within, 36-34. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
Corona del <DATE>Mar 67</DATE>, Lincoln 65 -- A desperation shot by <PERSON>Andre Toussaint</PERSON> that 
traveled three-quarters the length of the court, banked off the backboard and 
then bounced off the back of the rim as time expired and <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> scored 
an upset over the No. 2 seed. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kenny Garner</PERSON> scored 23 for Lincoln (22-9), but <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION> del Mar's one-man show 
was more potent. <PERSON>John Paulsen</PERSON> scored 30 for the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> (20-10), including 
his team's first 14 points in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped a 13-game winning streak for the Hornets, who also got 14 from 
<PERSON>Darryl McMillan</PERSON> and 12 from <PERSON>Andre Toussaint</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has lost eight of nine games this year in which it failed to score at 
least 70 points and Coach <PERSON>Ron Loneski</PERSON> lamented after this one that the Hornets 
couldn't entice <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> to run with them. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION IV 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Laguna Beach 71</LOCATION>, Coronado 37 -- <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> scored 21 consecutive points in 
the <DATE>third quarter</DATE> on the way to the rout and <LOCATION>Mission Bay High</LOCATION>. Coronado (19-9) 
stayed close and was tied, 23-23, at halftime behind six blocks by center <PERSON>Derek 
Wastila</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
But Wastila picked up his third and fourth fouls midway through the <DATE>third 
quarter</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> lost its momentum. The teams were tied, 25-25, before 
<LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> (23-6) scored the 21 points in a row. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>John Trevino</PERSON> had 19 points for <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION>.

<P>
Christian 74, <LOCATION>St. Margaret</LOCATION>'s 52 -- <PERSON>Tony Clark</PERSON> equaled <ORGANIZATION>St. Margaret</ORGANIZATION>'s total

</P>
<P>
Canoga Park Faith Baptist 67, <LOCATION>Calipatria</LOCATION> 52 -- Faith Baptist made 23 of 31 free

STROKE OF BAD LUCK FOR CORONADO: CLERK DOESN'T TYPE OR COMPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado has a problem: <PERSON>Ed Wienecke</PERSON> can't type a lick or work a computer, and 
he has no intention of learning how. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> is the new city clerk, and in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> the city 
clerk is responsible for recording the votes and preparing the minutes of the 
<ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to be a typist. I didn't run to be a typist," says <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON>, 
an affable 69-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> military judge and contracting officer 
who was elected to the clerk's job in <DATE>November</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wants the city to hire him a permanent deputy, sort of a glorified 
secretary who would handle the typing, a task as traditionally bound to the 
clerk's job as hammering is to carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Excedrin Headache No. 800' 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the council is months behind in its minutes, a situation 
that has some council members in a tizzy. Mayor <PERSON>Mary Herron</PERSON> said of the entire 
matter, "It's Excedrin headache No. 800." 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as the local weekly newspaper, contend that the problem is of the 
council's own making. After the previous city clerk, <PERSON>Tom Patricola</PERSON>, who was on 
the job for more than 20 years, retired in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the council decided it was 
time to redefine the post. 
</P>
<P>
With many of the clerk's former duties, such as preparing agendas and other 
clerical work taken over in recent years by two city employees, the council 
sought to make the city clerk both a part-timer and a council appointee, rather 
than an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado voters, however, prevented that <DATE>last June</DATE>, when they turned down the 
council and decided to keep electing the clerk. So the council was left with a 
part-time clerk whom it couldn't choose or control. 
</P>
<P>
Into the political void entered <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON>, a former lieutenant colonel and 
two-year resident of Coronado who beat two other contenders last <DATE>fall</DATE> and was 
elected to a four-year term. The stripped-down job, which the council continued 
tinkering with into <DATE>September</DATE>, was left with only a few responsibilities, 
including the state-mandated task of keeping a book of local ordinances, 
maintaining the city seal, running elections and, not least of all, keeping 
council minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke just assumed he would have a helper, someone to handle the tedious 
chore of preparing council minutes, while he devoted himself to more weighty 
matters such as "records management." 
</P>
<P>
"But I found out I didn't have one," he said ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
At his first council meeting, <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> found out what being Coronado city clerk 
was all about. The meeting droned on for 6 1/2 hours, he said, the politicians 
making their speeches and lodging their votes. But he was slipping, and fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It was chaos, but no one knew that but me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the meeting took me 60 to 70 hours to complete," said <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON>, who 
is paid <MONEY>$75</MONEY> a week. "I didn't have any idea what to expect. I didn't have (a 
previous) incumbent to tell me. I went in cold." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON>, the council meeting is routinely taped for broadcast on 
the local cable company's public access channel, and is also taped separately 
for sound. Using his VCR, <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> has been able to slowly piece together the 
meetings. (<ORGANIZATION>Wienecke</ORGANIZATION>, incidentally, has also contended that attending council 
meetings isn't part of his duties.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bureaucratic Sing-Song 
</P>
<P>
The result is a bureaucratic sing-song: If the minutes aren't late, then they 
are wrong and unacceptable to the council. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of <DATE>last month</DATE>, it was clear to <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> and the council, which 
also works part time and whose members also receive <MONEY>$75</MONEY> a week, that something 
had to be done to end the lack of a legal historical record, which was 
threatening to snuff out democracy in the placid bayside city of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke asked the council for <MONEY>$500</MONEY> a month until <DATE>June</DATE> to hire a helper who 
would compile the minutes. City Manager <PERSON>Homer Bludau</PERSON> didn't like the idea. He 
asked <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> to take typing lessons, but <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> declined. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term solution is that he learn to type or find a way to do the job," 
<PERSON>Bludau</PERSON> said. "He doesn't feel he ran for city clerk to do this kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
The council in mid-February approved the allocation, and <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> has hired a 
woman in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> prepare the minutes. She relies on the broadcast tapes that 
<PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> provides her. <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> says he is almost caught up now, although the 
council has yet to approve any minutes for this year. 
</P>
<P>
What happens after the money runs out in <DATE>June</DATE>, no one knows. Wienecke just this 
week put in a budget request for about <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> to hire a deputy city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should hire one. I want a full-time deputy," he said. "I want to 
get involved in ordinance indexes and resolutions . . . records-management type 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON>, a former commissioner of beaches in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, says he has visited 
almost all of the other city clerks in the county and that none have to work 
under his conditions. There's an election in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to fill a 
vacant seat on the council, and <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> says that, as the town clerk, he is in 
charge of organizing it, though the bulk of the work will be done by the county 
registrar of voters. He's had to communicate with the registrar's office by 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one here to type a memo to the registrar for me. I can't type a 
memo," he said. "This really is a <PERSON>Mickey Mouse</PERSON> operation." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that's true or not, Mayor <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> said much of the clerk's burden has 
fallen on other city workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It falls on the shoulders of our city staff. What we have is a clerk in the 
city attorney's office who gets them (minutes) in draft form," she said. "A lot 
of people are picking up the work." 
</P>
<P>
"The job is different than what he thought," she said. "He expected to be part 
of the political debate and interface with other agencies. But it's not like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Some council members, such as <PERSON>Herron</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lois Ewen</PERSON>, are reluctant to spend 
money to hire a full-time helper for <ORGANIZATION>Wienecke</ORGANIZATION>. "When we made the changes (to 
the clerk's post), we felt a skilled technician was needed," <PERSON>Ewen</PERSON> said, adding 
that <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> "has other skills, but none of those happen to be typing." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that is taking a lot of our time and taking us away from 
more pressing issues, such as traffic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing: <PERSON>Wienecke</PERSON> recently asked the council to pay his way to <LOCATION>Nova 
Scotia</LOCATION> to attend an international convention of municipal clerks. The council 
said no, explaining that it had approved a policy last <DATE>May</DATE> not to pay for trips 
outside the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Wienecke thinks maybe the council is trying to tell 
him something.

LEAGUE'S FIRST FAVORITE? ST. AUGUSTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fret not, little <ORGANIZATION>Harbor League</ORGANIZATION>. The sun is shining in your small corner of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
So many things are happening so quickly for you. Just think, you are about to 
celebrate your first birthday, you are playing football for the very first 
time, and dear but departed <PERSON>Tony Clark</PERSON> is an entire time zone away. 
</P>
<P>
Due to circumstances beyond its control, the <ORGANIZATION>Harbor League</ORGANIZATION> was so closely 
linked to <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> last year -- he is now splitting his time playing basketball at 
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> and baseball in the <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> Tiger organization -- that it suffered a 
bit of an identity crisis. With <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> leading Christian High to second in the 
state in Division IV basketball and becoming the second player taken in the 
baseball draft, the Harbor was little more than a showcase for his talents. 
</P>
<P>
But he never played a down of football, and the line of opportunity forms here 
as schools attempt to make a name other than "Clark" for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine would like to be the first to do so, and barring an extraordinary 
turn of events, the Saints will hang the Harbor's first football championship 
banner in its gym. There are few measuring sticks on which to base this 
prediction other than an overwhelming thumbs-up endorsement by the leagues' 
five coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the front-runner, no doubt," said <PERSON>Bud Mayfield</PERSON>, second-year coach at 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Said <PERSON>Dale Peterson</PERSON>, in his first year at Christian: "You would think Saints is 
the favorite. Marty placed a lot of kids in college last year." 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine finished the <DATE>1989</DATE> season tied for third in a strong <ORGANIZATION>Central 
League</ORGANIZATION>, won by <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON> -- which it defeated in regular season -- and <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>. 
And in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Section 2-A playoffs, the Saints defeated <LOCATION>Kearny</LOCATION> in the 
quarterfinals before losing to <LOCATION>San Pasqual</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"People are judging us on our ability to beat <LOCATION>Kearny</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Marty 
Martin</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION> coach of three years. "That's why they're picking us. 
Based on that, it's justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
Martin is known for having a keen football mind and finding a way to win. He 
has 17 returning players, six of them starters, and his team has as many 
victories (seven) last year as the rest of the league's teams combined. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can stay healthy, we should be there," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. "We want to set 
realistic goals, but this is the year we should be able to win a league 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
After <PERSON>St. Augustine</PERSON>, the pecking order is a tossup. There are lots of question 
marks and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"Saints is the one to beat," <PERSON>Marian Coach John Pappas</PERSON> said. "I don't know how 
it lines up after that. Since the league is newly formed, it's hard to speak 
about the rest of the teams. No one really knows much about anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Mainly because they come from a variety of compass points. 
</P>
<P>
Christian and <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> are the only schools to play in the same league 
(City Central) last year. Coronado, after shuffling between the Metro and <LOCATION>South 
Bay</LOCATION> leagues for several years, was independent for the <DATE>1988</DATE> and <DATE>1989</DATE> seasons. 
<PERSON>Marian</PERSON>, also forced to play in the Metro and <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> leagues, was a guppy in 
a pool of sharks before bailing out for two years and joining the <ORGANIZATION>Desert 
Coastal League</ORGANIZATION>, in which it won the 1-A title in <DATE>1988</DATE>. After years of success 
in the <ORGANIZATION>City Western League</ORGANIZATION>, falling enrollment made Clairemont a misfit, and 
the Chieftains went <DATE>13-35 from 1985-89</DATE> before changing alliances. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said that some may look down their noses at the competition level of the 
Harbor League but that it's not a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Some look down on the league, but we've been respectable," he said. "We can be 
as competitive as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
What the new league does, he said, is open the door for competitive schools 
that otherwise would be floundering in leagues with larger enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
"The league has created the situation that the best teams should be able to win 
a championship," <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. "We'd still be in the hunt in the City 
(Central)." 
</P>
<P>
While it's a start, there is still disparity. Marian's enrollment last year was 
325, <ORGANIZATION>Clairemont</ORGANIZATION>'s 1,063. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy to be in the 2-A," said <PERSON>Pappas</PERSON>, who has only 40 players out 
for both varsity and junior varsity teams. "A restricted 2-A yes, but not this. 
We're not comparable to the other schools." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HARBOR LEAGUE FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion: None. The league is dipping its big toe into football for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Who should win: <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION> (7-5 in <DATE>1989</DATE>, 3-2 in <ORGANIZATION>City Central League</ORGANIZATION>). 
</P>
<P>
Who could win: Christian (3-7, 1-4 in City Central), <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> (1-7 as an 
independent). 
</P>
<P>
Who should look toward <DATE>1991</DATE>: Clairemont (1-8, 0-5 in <ORGANIZATION>City Western League</ORGANIZATION>), 
<PERSON>Marian</PERSON> (2-8, 2-3 in <ORGANIZATION>Desert Coastal League</ORGANIZATION>). 
</P>
<P>
The Game: <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine vs. Christian</ORGANIZATION>, <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE>. This may be the only game that 
could blemish an otherwise perfect league record for <ORGANIZATION>St. Augustine</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Impact players: <PERSON>Antione Henry</PERSON>, Clairemont running back, 5-11, 190; his 
week-by-week performance is synonymous with <ORGANIZATION>Clairemont</ORGANIZATION>'s success. <PERSON>Justin 
Williams</PERSON>, <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> defensive back/wide receiver, 5-11, 190; a double 
threat who intercepts footballs as well as he catching them. <PERSON>Chad Tomosaski</PERSON>, 
<LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> cornerback/wide receiver, 5-11, 165; was a big reason Saints 
allowed 9.8 points a game and upset the team that allowed just 5.3 -- <PERSON>Crawford</PERSON>; 
<PERSON>Tony Acosta</PERSON>, <PERSON>Marian</PERSON> defensive back, 5-11, 165; 1-A defensive player of the year 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
New faces: <PERSON>Adam Smith</PERSON>, Coronado quarterback, 6-2, 205; broken collarbone in 
first game last season made <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s bad situation -- very little experience 
-- worse. <PERSON>Chad De Grenier</PERSON>, Christian quarterback, 6-2, 190; led <LOCATION>Scottsdale</LOCATION> 
(<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>) Christian to Division I state title last year. <PERSON>Jack De Grenier</PERSON>, 
Christian offensive coordinator; <PERSON>Chad</PERSON>'s father is former NFL (<LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>) and 
USFL (<LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>) player. 
</P>
<P>
Last word: These teams desperately need each other. Their combined record last 
year, often against schools with twice or three times their enrollments, was 
14-35, and <LOCATION>St. Augustine</LOCATION> accounted for half of those victories.

<HEAD>Scholars Searching for Clues to Mark Coronado's Trail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scholars are having trouble putting
<ORGANIZATION>Francisco Vasquez de Coronado</ORGANIZATION> on the map.
   They want to add the <DATE>16th century Spaniard</DATE>'s route through the
<LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>National Trails System</ORGANIZATION>, but they aren't getting
much help from the explorer and his party.
   ``Coronado and his men had no idea where they had gone. They
were marching off the end of the known world,'' said <PERSON>Don Blakeslee</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Wichita State University</ORGANIZATION> anthropology department chairman.
   <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Betty Romero</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Rice County
Coronado-Quivira Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lyons</LOCATION>, are coordinating the project for
the <ORGANIZATION>Coronado Trail Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   They've been combing historical documents - including letters
Coronado wrote the king of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and accounts by participants - in
hopes of determining which of 30 proposed routes is the right one.
   ``There are plenty of people who have a pet idea where he
went,'' <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said. ``Every little town anywhere near where he
might have gone would like to be able to claim Coronado.''
   In <DATE>1540</DATE>, <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> and his entourage - 300 soldiers and some
1,500 Indian guides and camp followers - set out from <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> to
search for the legendary gold-rich Seven Cities of <LOCATION>Cibola</LOCATION>.
   For two years, together and in separate groups, they explored
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>. Though they found
no gold, they helped open the region to colonization.
   Romero says she wants her museum to become an interpretative
center for the trail. In <DATE>April</DATE>, the museum will sponsor a symposium
for scholars to view exhibits of armor and weapons used by the
conquistadors and debate where <PERSON>Coronado</PERSON> and his men traveled.
   ``We're going to try to throw out as many wrong ideas as we can
in a short period of time,'' <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said. ``But we haven't yet
gotten all of the people together who need to be in one room
arguing with one another. And we haven't done all of the field
work, which is absolutely critical.''
   <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said the field work could quickly eliminate some
routes.
   One proposed path the anthropology professor checked out was
obviously wrong. He said he crossed the <LOCATION>Cimarron River</LOCATION> where the
route's proponent said Coronado crossed. But the canyon the
explorers described was not there.
   Coronado's letters and the other texts offer clues, but few
definite directions.
   ``These records really weren't written to tell anybody how to
get to the places mentioned,'' <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said.
   Ambiguities in the texts also have frustrated scholars,
<PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said.
   In one passage, the explorers wrote about eating nuts growing in
the area they were traveling through, but did not say what kind of
nuts. One person assumed the nuts were pecans and based a proposed
route on that assumption, <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said.
   ``You can't base your arguments on assumptions,'' he said. ``You
have to base them on something in the texts. Then you can make an
assumption, if there is any way to test it.''
   Romero and <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> are hoping new information on Indian trails
may play a big role in assembling the jigsaw puzzle that previously
had critical pieces missing.
   Coronado had Indian guides who apparently knew the country
because they were able to lead the hundreds of soldiers to good
water every night of their travels in <DATE>August</DATE> in southwestern
<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said.
   By using historical accounts, old maps, letters and other
documents, <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> has established locations for many Indian
trails in the <LOCATION>Great Plains</LOCATION>.
   Just about everything important in the early history of the
Plains happened along established trails, he said.
   Most of the eight trails already in the system, including the
<ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Trail</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, were established along precisely known
routes, <PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said. Some trails are still marked by wagon ruts
or other physical features.
   But delineating <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>'s trail hasn't been so simple. The
<ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> was unprepared for the task when ordered by
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to study the feasibility of establishing a Coronado trail,
<PERSON>Blakeslee</PERSON> said.
   ``It takes a lot more effort, more manpower and entirely
different techniques,'' he said.

<P>
Sleepy-eyed <PERSON>Jerry Marsh</PERSON> wasn't really thinking about winning his second 
<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> half-marathon at <TIME>6:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. He thought staying close to the 
leaders might be difficult enough to accomplish in weather he described as "too 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
But after surveying the field, <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON> realized early that he might have to 
re-evaluate his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a stellar field," said <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>, comparing the competition to other 
years when the half-marathon has been used as training for the Olympic Trials.

<PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>, a former <LOCATION>San Diegan</LOCATION> who now lives in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, set his own pace and 
cruised to a 10-second victory over runner-up <PERSON>Marshall Varano</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> in 
the 16th Coronado half-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody went out and took me out early and when I saw the field, it helped my 
confidence," said <PERSON>Marsh</PERSON>, 25, who has been running the <DATE>July 4</DATE> half-marathon 
since he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Cash of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> won the women's race in <DATE>1 hour 24 minutes 12 seconds</DATE> and 
<PERSON>Dan Larson</PERSON> was first among wheelchair participants in 1:10:52. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's time of 1:10:50 was more than three minutes slower than the winning 
time last year and six seconds slower than the 1:04 he ran in <DATE>1987</DATE> when he won 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do a 1:04 today," he said. "What I did was what I was worth. I 
think the heat had a lot to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
The distance may have played a part too. Marsh and four other runners ran an 
extra 200 to 400 meters because they were misdirected while running on the 
naval base. 
</P>
<P>
Varano, whose previous best was an 11th-place finish in <DATE>'87</DATE>, also said he had 
no designs on winning the race, but suddenly found himself close to the 
front-runners because of a slower-than-usual pace. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, I couldn't have been anywhere close to up there," said 
<PERSON>Varano</PERSON>, 25. "This time I went out easy and stayed within range. You get down 
when you don't see anybody in front of you. But that didn't happen today." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Steve Flynn</PERSON> finished nine seconds behind <PERSON>Varano</PERSON> in third place. 
</P>
<P>
And while the blazing sun and humidity may have bothered many of the runners, 
Cash seemed to be unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt like I was working very hard," said Cash, a veteran of hilly 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> half-marathons and 10Ks. "If you come down from the altitude, it makes 
it a lot easier." Cash said her victory was special for a couple of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here for a reunion and I didn't know what to expect from the competition 
down here," she said. "It was nice because I turn 40 in two weeks and winning a 
race on the <DATE>4th of July</DATE> is kind of special." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 competed in the half-marathon.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NO AIRHEAD ON AVIATION FACTS, EVEN WRONG ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of the nation's premier repositories of aviation history and artifacts, 
the <ORGANIZATION>Aerospace Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION> gets calls every day from scholars, 
journalists and flight buffs. 
</P>
<P>
The queries can be general -- "Tell me something about the development of jets" 
-- or quite specific -- "What were the names of the crew members in the fourth 
plane that took off in <PERSON>Jimmy Doolittle</PERSON>'s raid?" Archivist <PERSON>Ray Wagner</PERSON> handles 
them all with aplomb, using the museum's 50 file cabinets of documents, 
histories and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Even by those standards, a dozen or so letters and long-distance calls asking 
the same question recently were unique. Many were in French. And all were 
asking about something that never happened. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> newspaper Le Figaro was running a contest with 
multiple-choice questions, including one asking which of three aviators was the 
pilot on a historic <DATE>1936</DATE> flight from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. Unbeknown to <PERSON>Le 
Figaro</PERSON>, the second-largest paper in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, there was no such flight. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a historic <DATE>1936</DATE> flight from <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, and the 
pilot, <PERSON>Sigsmund Levaneski</PERSON> (a.k.a. "the Soviet Lindbergh"), was among the three 
choices provided by Le Figaro. He flew a 27 <ORGANIZATION>Downey Vultee</ORGANIZATION>, from the 
Downey-based Vultee aircraft works, which later merged with <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s 
Consolidated, giving rise to Convair. 
</P>
<P>
Providing the information about <PERSON>Levaneski</PERSON> (including the fact that he 
disappeared over the <LOCATION>North Pole</LOCATION> on a return flight) was no problem for <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON>, 
64, a retired history teacher and author of several books on aviation. Asking 
about a 27 <ORGANIZATION>Downey Vultee</ORGANIZATION> is like asking him what he had for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part was struggling with my college French," <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> said. "The 
first caller spoke no English and apparently thought that, if there was anyone 
of any intelligence here, they would, of course, speak French. Somehow we 
managed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is That Clear? 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Public Utilities Commission</ORGANIZATION> will meet <DATE>today</DATE> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to discuss rules 
for the upcoming hearing on the proposed merger of <ORGANIZATION>SDG&amp;E</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Southern 
California Edison</ORGANIZATION>. But don't figure on the controversy being less complex once 
the hearing is held. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>PUC</ORGANIZATION> this week issued a new guide to the hearing process -- not the issues, 
just the process. It's 103 pages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
America's Pub Race 
</P>
<P>
Move over <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Cup Race. Make room for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Pub Race, the latest 
entry in seafaring competition. It began when <PERSON>U. S.</PERSON> and <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> journalists 
began arguing at <ORGANIZATION>Bula's Pub &amp; Eatery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> over which country 
produces the best sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a challenge was set. Sail in one-man, 14-foot Lasers from <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> to 
the <LOCATION>Embarcadero</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, hoist a few at <ORGANIZATION>Anthony</ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant, sail to the 
Charthouse restaurant near the <LOCATION>San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge</LOCATION>, hoist a few more, 
then sail into <LOCATION>Glorietta Bay</LOCATION>, land in <LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> and play your respective 
national anthem on the musical instrument of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
For the latter part of the contest, the two Kiwis, brothers <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hugo 
Manson</PERSON>, chose bagpipes and a kazoo. The Americans, <PERSON>Joseph Ditler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry 
Edwards</PERSON>, chose a fiddle and a Jew's harp. 
</P>
<P>
America's Cup loser <PERSON>Michael Fay</PERSON> learned of the grudge match and sent his <LOCATION>New 
Zealand</LOCATION> countrymen a telegram wishing them "favorable winds and a strong 
drinking arm." 
</P>
<P>
They proved to have both, placing first and third and winning on cumulative 
time. A 3-inch trophy in their honor now rests above the bar at <ORGANIZATION>Bula's</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure the whole thing cost <MONEY>$42.50</MONEY>, which is <MONEY>$59,999,957.50</MONEY> less than the 
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Cup," <PERSON>Bill Manson</PERSON> said. "We only had one rule: Nobody resorts to 
lawyers to overturn the decision."

<PERSON>Frank Chambliss</PERSON> coached <ORGANIZATION>Torrey Pines High School</ORGANIZATION>'s baseball team to the 2-A 
championship in the Lions Tournament this season. But his team also finished 
last in the eight-team <ORGANIZATION>Palomar League</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 tonight at <ORGANIZATION>San Diego State</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Chambliss</PERSON> will be loaded with talent. He and

by the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego County Baseball Coaches Association</ORGANIZATION>, which selected the 
players and the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
With all the talented seniors on the field, <PERSON>Chambliss</PERSON> could have a tough time 
making decisions. When he makes a pitching change, should he bring in <LOCATION>Orange 
Glen</LOCATION> left-hander <PERSON>Scott Coleman</PERSON>, who set a section record with 16 consecutive 
no-hit innings earlier this season, or Mt. <LOCATION>Carmel</LOCATION> left-hander <PERSON>Doug Hill</PERSON>, who 
compiled a two-year record of 18-2? 
</P>
<P>
And there's always <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Danny Miller</PERSON>, who was 12-1 with a 1.22 earned-run 
average and 123 strikeouts in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of decisions facing <PERSON>Chambliss</PERSON> and the coach in the other 
dugout, <PERSON>Santana</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Jim Saska</PERSON>, who will get advice from assistants <PERSON>Ron Smock</PERSON> of 
<LOCATION>Coronado</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Ron Lopez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the high-profile stars, the game affords the public the 
opportunity to see players they normally wouldn't, such as <PERSON>Julian</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Travis 
Denmark</PERSON>, who hit 13 home runs, drove in 42 runs and pitched his team to the 1-A 
championship, and Christian's <PERSON>Tony Clark</PERSON>, who hit 11 home runs for the <ORGANIZATION>Harbor 
League</ORGANIZATION>'s last-place Patriots and is expected to be among the first players 
taken in <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s free agent draft. They will compete for the 2-A. 
</P>
<P>

CORONADO'S POSH LA MERIDIEN BEING SOLD TO TOKYO COMPANY

<TEXT>
<P>
In yet another transaction involving the sale of a <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> resort 
property to Japanese investors, the 300-room Le Meridien <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> at Coronado 
luxury hotel is to be purchased by <ORGANIZATION>Chiyoda Finance</ORGANIZATION>, the hotel's seller said 
<DATE>Monday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The sale price was not disclosed. <PERSON>Derek Thomas</PERSON>, director of real estate 
consulting at <ORGANIZATION>Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> said, however, that the 
deal may be comparable to the <MONEY>$280,000</MONEY> per room price that Japanese investors 
paid for the <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point Resort</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July</DATE>. At that price, Le Meridien would be 
worth about <MONEY>$84 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is Park at <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION>, a San Diego-based limited partnership whose 
general partners include <PERSON>George Codling</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alan Greenway</PERSON>, <PERSON>Malin Burnham</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Thomas James</PERSON>. The partnership owns the hotel structure but leases its 16-acre 
bayfront site under a 50-year agreement with the <LOCATION>San Diego Port District</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Open since <DATE>June, 1988</DATE>, the hotel fronting <LOCATION>San Diego Bay</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Coronado Island</LOCATION> is 
managed under a 20-year contract by the French-owned Le Meridien chain, <ORGANIZATION>Codling</ORGANIZATION> 
said. No changes in management are planned by the prospective owners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Le <ORGANIZATION>Meridien</ORGANIZATION> is the third major resort project in <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> to attract 
Japanese investors in recent years. Sport Shinko of <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> bought the La Costa 
Resort Hotel in <LOCATION>Carlsbad</LOCATION> for <MONEY>$250 million</MONEY> in <DATE>1987</DATE>. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION>TSA 
International</ORGANIZATION>, a Honolulu-based firm controlled by a Japanese businessman, 
acquired a major ownership stake in the <MONEY>$100-million</MONEY> Four Seasons Aviara resort 
soon to start construction in <LOCATION>Carlsbad</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>July</DATE>, the 350-room <ORGANIZATION>Dana Point Resort</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> was sold to <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo 
Masuiwaya California Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, the investment arm of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s leading kimono 
manufacturer, for a reported <MONEY>$104 million</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are starting to realize that the trophy and primary properties in 
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> have already been bought out," said <PERSON>Kenneth Leventhal</PERSON>'s Thomas. 
"The word we get is (Japanese investors) are focusing on prime properties 
outside of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> up and down the coast. So, in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> we can expect 
several more acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
The stock in <ORGANIZATION>Chiyoda Finance</ORGANIZATION> is held by six private Japanese corporations and 
six publicly owned corporations, including <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Credit Bank</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Nippon Steel</ORGANIZATION>, 
<ORGANIZATION>Daiwa Bank</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ohbayashi Construction</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Codling</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Chiyoda</ORGANIZATION> also recently acquired the 478-room <ORGANIZATION>Marriott Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Torrance</LOCATION> and a 
30,000-square-foot office building in <LOCATION>Palo Alto</LOCATION>. Escrow for the Le Meridien 
sale is scheduled to close by late next month and is subject to approval by the 
port district at a meeting scheduled for <DATE>Oct. 10</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The Le Meridien hotel property includes three pools, six tennis courts, meeting 
space and two restaurants, <PERSON>Marius</PERSON> and L'Escale. Most of the rooms go for <MONEY>$145</MONEY> 
to <MONEY>$205</MONEY> a night, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Codling said the hotel owners did not intend to sell the property until it set 
out recently to secure permanent financing to replace a <MONEY>$44-million</MONEY> 
construction loan. In the course of pursuing the longer-term loan, the owners 
came into contact with the Japanese group that was "persistent" in its desire 
to acquire the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs became a price that we felt was an economically viable proposal for us 
to consider," Codling said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenway at first secured rights to develop the choice Coronado hotel site in 
the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> by winning a design competition conducted by the port district. 
He later joined forces with <PERSON>Burnham</PERSON>, Codling and <PERSON>James</PERSON> in order to finance and 
develop the site. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is chairman of <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank of San Diego</ORGANIZATION>. Burnham, Codling and 
<PERSON>James</PERSON> are partners in ADI Properties, a <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> real estate development firm 
that has built more than 1.75 million square feet of industrial and office 
space since its founding in <DATE>1977</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Although <ORGANIZATION>ADI</ORGANIZATION> has no hotel projects on the drawing board, <ORGANIZATION>Codling</ORGANIZATION> said the firm 
plans a 400-acre business park in <LOCATION>Poway</LOCATION> south of <LOCATION>Poway Road</LOCATION> and 3 miles east of 
Interstate 15.

Sweetwater High, with four returning starters from a 25-3 team, is the 
unanimous pick of Metro Conference coaches to win the boys' basketball 
conference again as the <DATE>1989-90</DATE> season gets under way <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"They look really polished," <ORGANIZATION>Chula Vista</ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON>Mike Collins</PERSON> said. "Down the

</P>
<P>
The Red Devils with returning starters <PERSON>Joe McDowell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carlos Campbell</PERSON>, <PERSON>John 
Gilbert</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Melvin Rushing</ORGANIZATION> are loaded with quickness and leapers, conducive to 
their full-court pressing style of play.

After <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>, Metro coaches place <ORGANIZATION>Chula Vista</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Bonita Vista</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> and 
Hilltop in a group most likely disrupt the favorite.

the 3-A/2-A class structure playoffs, no Metro team has advanced past the 
quarterfinal round. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>, among others, hopes to change that in <DATE>1989-90</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contender: <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION> (25-3 in <DATE>1988-89</DATE>). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Chula Vista (13-15), <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> (21-8), <LOCATION>Bonita Vista</LOCATION> (5-18), 
Hilltop (11-16). 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: Castle Park (8-16), <LOCATION>Mar Vista</LOCATION> (6-19), <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> 
(0-20). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Chula Vista</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 12</DATE>. Second to last game of 
the season for both teams could determine the championship, if <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION> 
hasn't already clinched. The game was to have been played <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> but was 
rescheduled because <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>, the county's only year-round high school, is on 
a three-week break. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The men: <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>David Ybarra</PERSON> had a brief scare last week when his 
star guards, <PERSON>Joe McDowell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carlos Campbell</PERSON>, both suffered injuries in the 
<DATE>first quarter</DATE> against <LOCATION>Mira Mesa</LOCATION>. Both injuries -- <PERSON>McDowell</PERSON> hurt his shooting 
(right) wrist and <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> fell on and strained his lower back -- proved to be 
minor, and they both returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>McDowell</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> are -- by nearly every coaches assessment -- the men to 
watch in the conference. <PERSON>McDowell</PERSON>, a 6-2 senior, is a four-year starter for the 
<ORGANIZATION>Red Devils</ORGANIZATION>. After five games this year, he is averaging 18.2 points. <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>, 
a 6-4 senior, is a three-year starter averaging 11.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
This past <DATE>summer</DATE> both played in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' prestigious Slam 'n' Jam <DATE>summer</DATE> 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill <ORGANIZATION>Will Tate</ORGANIZATION>'s shoes? Will <ORGANIZATION>Tate</ORGANIZATION>, now a defensive back for <ORGANIZATION>San Diego 
State</ORGANIZATION>'s football team, was a Times All-County first-team selection. In leading 
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> to a 21-8 mark, <ORGANIZATION>Tate</ORGANIZATION> averaged 17.4 points, six assists and five 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
And now that he's gone? "We can't find anybody to fill his shoes," <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> 
Coach <PERSON>Steve Selland</PERSON> said. "I've tried several guys, but it's going to take 
awhile." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Selland</PERSON> said in the long run one of three sophomores will fill <ORGANIZATION>Tate</ORGANIZATION>'s point 
guard position. They are <PERSON>Darren Davis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rod Lerma</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe Cruz</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Guard <PERSON>John Gilbert</PERSON>, averaging 12.8 points, adds a 
third ingredient to a potent <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION> attack. Chula Vista's <PERSON>Shane Howell</PERSON> 
(12.8-point average) and <PERSON>Derek Chapman</PERSON> (10), <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON>'s <PERSON>George Scott</PERSON> (20), 
<LOCATION>Mar Vista</LOCATION>'s Tim Page (13.5) and <PERSON>Tim O'Neal</PERSON> (13) are off to good starts. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Allen McNamee</PERSON> (18), <PERSON>Mike Barnett</PERSON> (17) and Rope <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> (17) give <LOCATION>Bonita Vista</LOCATION> a 
formidable scoring trio. <PERSON>Aldaberto Silva</PERSON>, if eligible, is a four-year starter 
for <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> and one of the county's best players. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Less is more: For the fifth consecutive year, there is a change in the makeup 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Metro Conference</ORGANIZATION>. Last year, the conference fielded 10 teams that played 
an unbalanced 14-game season. This year, <ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Marian</PERSON> decided to join 
the new Harbor League making the Metro an eight-team league with a 14-game 
symmetrical season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good for (<ORGANIZATION>Coronado</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Marian</PERSON>), and it's good for us," Castle 
Park Coach <PERSON>Dan Winters</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Said <ORGANIZATION>Hilltop Coach Chip Holmes</ORGANIZATION>, "I never liked playing Coronado in that gym 
anyway. That was one team I'm glad to see go." 
</P>
<P>
Less is more, Part II: Former Kentucky Coach <PERSON>Adolph Rupp</PERSON>'s 1965-66 team 
finished second in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament losing to <LOCATION>Texas Western</LOCATION> despite its 
tallest starter being 6-5. The team became known as "Rupp's Runts". 
</P>
<P>
Despite its tallest player being 6-4 and the next closest being 6-2, 
<LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>'s "Diminutive Devils" should challenge for the section's Division I 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've been here, we haven't been big," <PERSON>McDowell</PERSON> said. "We just have 
to play good defense, get the ball out and run." 
</P>
<P>
Less is unfortunate : Led by <PERSON>Silva</PERSON>, there are a number of talented players who 
will not be playing when league-play begins. Silva, after a long dispute with 
the section over his desire to transfer to <LOCATION>Sweetwater</LOCATION>, returned to <ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> 
but was declared academically ineligible <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Southwest</ORGANIZATION> also lost <PERSON>Laurence Estes</PERSON>, who moved out of the state. Kansas 
transfers <PERSON>Jermayne Montgomery</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Mathews</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery</ORGANIZATION> are awaiting word 
on their eligibility from <PERSON>Kendall Webb</PERSON>, the section's commissioner. Under CIF 
rules an out-of-state transfer living with guardians -- as the two are -- must 
be declared hardships or sit out a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista sophomore <PERSON>Porgie Yokley</PERSON>, a talented <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> transfer, has decided 
not to play this season. Chula Vista's <PERSON>Louie Zumstein</PERSON>, a Times second-team 
football selection at offensive tackle expected to be recruited by Division I 
schools, has decided to concentrate on working out for football. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Casey June</PERSON>, who would have been a three-year starter at <LOCATION>Bonita Vista</LOCATION>, is 
playing soccer this year for the defending 3-A champion Barons. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park's <PERSON>Benji Gil</PERSON>, is eligible, but may or may not play this season to 
concentrate on his studies and baseball.
