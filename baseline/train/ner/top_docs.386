<HEAD>Congress Hears Appeals For Restrictions On Diet Pills</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple whose daughter died after years of
diet pill abuse asked a congressional panel <DATE>Monday</DATE> to push for
restrictions on non-prescription weight loss drugs.
   ``She might have had a chance had these products been denied her
as a child,'' said <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON> and <PERSON>Diana Smith</PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION>State Center</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Noelle Smith</PERSON>, 20, died a year ago of cardiac arrest after
struggling since she was 14 with the eating disorder anorexia
nervosa, which is an avoidance of food, and bulimia, which involves
binging and purging.
   ``She was constantly sneaking diet products into the house,''
said <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>. ``Every time we found and took from <LOCATION>Noelle</LOCATION> a box of
diet pills, laxatives or diuretics, she would go to the corner
store and buy a new supply.''
   <PERSON>Jessica McDonald</PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, said she suffered
from the same eating disorders as a teen-ager and regularly
consumed whole boxes of non-prescription diet pills at a time.
   ``Even though I went to the drug store practically every day to
buy pills or some other product to help me lose weight, no one ever
tried to stop me or asked what I wanted the pills for,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION>.
   She said that ``at the very least there should be an age
restriction to prevent young people from buying these drugs.''
   <PERSON>Vivian Hanson Meehan</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of
Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders</ORGANIZATION>, said at least one of 10
adolescents engage in dangerous eating disorders as they try to
diet.
   ``The adolescent whoreduces food amounts to starvation levels
is playing havoc with his or her body's viability,'' said <PERSON>Meehan</PERSON>.
``Children who begin dieting at an early age may delay or prevent
menstruation because females need 18 to <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of body fat for
this purpose.''
   Meehan also decried the availability of diet pills.
   ``Diet pills containing the drug phenylpropanolamine, or <ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION>,
pose an additional and very serious health risk to adolescents,''
she said.
   The drug is in most of the numerous, popular non-prescription
diet products used by about 10 million consumers a year. Many
medical authorities say it can cause high blood pressure, kidney
disease, heart muscle damage, heart rhythm abnormalities and
seizures.
   The Smiths, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Meehan</PERSON> were among witnesses testifying
before the <ORGANIZATION>House Small Business</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, which has been
investigating the weight loss industry.
   A report from the subcommittee staff noted a <ORGANIZATION>University of San
Francisco</ORGANIZATION> study of 500 girls which showed almost half the
9-year-olds and <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of those age 10 and 11 were dieting,
even though just <PERCENT>17 percent</PERCENT> of the group was overweight.
   ``Our investigation found that juveniles are dieting more
obsessively than ever, and that many are suffering adverse health
effects and even death,'' said the staff report.
   Chairman <PERSON>Ron Wyden</PERSON>, D-Oregon, has been after the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Trade
Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> to crack down on
shady diet practices.
   He said the <ORGANIZATION>FTC</ORGANIZATION> has 14 investigations under way of diet
companies and diet programs.
   But he criticized the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> for being lax on enforcement.
   ``For almost a decade, the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has dawdled over regulations that
would make it illegal to sell diet products containing about 100
ineffective ingredients,'' said <PERSON>Wyden</PERSON>.

<TEXT>
   Despite a new focus on being healthy rather than
merely thin, anorexia and bulimia continue to haunt young women,
and the number of men who suffer from eating disorders appears to
be growing.
   The last decade was full of images of the dangers of eating
disorders, on television and in movies and women's magazines.
   An anorexic teen-ager was a character in the movie ``Down and
Out in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>.'' <PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON> told the world she had suffered
from bulimia. <PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON> lost her life to an eating disorder.
Even a ``<DATE>Saturday</DATE> Night Live'' skit included an anorexic cookbook.
   The diseases have not gone away, though experts say estimates at
the time that <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of college women suffered from them were
exaggerated. And new pressures have come to bear on those who are
susceptible.
   ``It's not good enough just to be thin, but one has to have
muscles in the right places, for a man or a woman. You get into the
fat content of your body, how much muscle tone,'' said <PERSON>Leonard S.
Levitz</PERSON>, clincal director of the <ORGANIZATION>Renfrew Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>,
which in <DATE>1985</DATE> became the first residential facility for treatment
of eating disorders.
   So now there is ``exercise bulimia,'' in which sufferers turn to
extraordinary amounts of exercise rather than, or in addition to,
laxatives or vomiting.
   Anorexia is estimated to be two to four times as common <DATE>today</DATE> as
30 years ago. Bulimia also appears to be more common. The best
estimates seem to be that <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of college women
are afflicted, <PERSON>Levitz</PERSON> said.
   Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starvation, an intense
fear of becoming fat and a feeling that one is fat, despite being
emaciated. Bulimia involves a pattern of binge eating followed by
purging by vomiting or with diruetics.
   Although anorexia was identified in <DATE>1873</DATE> by a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> physician,
there is a centuries-long history of women controlling their
appetites, <PERSON>Joan Jacobs Brumberg</PERSON> wrote in her book ``Fasting
Girls.''
   In the <DATE>1300s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>St. Catherine of Siena</ORGANIZATION> was said to eat only a
handful of herbs a day. In the midieval period, fasting was central
to female holiness.
   Bulimia, however, is newer, becoming epidemic only in <DATE>1973</DATE> or
<DATE>1974</DATE>, when ``a lot of trends came together in terms of broad
societal issues, concern over body weight, role of women, people
being under tremendous pressure to be perfect, the breakdown of
family life,'' <PERSON>Levitz</PERSON> said.
   A victim ``feels powerless in the world, no sense of control of
her life, and a real fear that if her eating, like her emotions,
got out of control, who knows what would happen,'' <PERSON>Levitz</PERSON> said.
   Treatment generally is an intensive combination of therapy,
education and behavior modification.
   These generally are diseases of intelligent women, found in the
middle and upper classes of developed countries. The incidence
appears to be increasing in <LOCATION>Scandinavia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.
   New research is showing that many of those who suffer from
eating disorders dieted as preteen-agers, were sexually abused, or
abuse drugs or alcohol, <PERSON>Levitz</PERSON> said. Also linked to the disease are
such issues as fear of growth into womanhood.
   At adolescence, girls come to think of the normal changes
occurring in their bodies as fatness and enter a war of wills to
control them. Boys, however, take pride in their growth.
   The overwhelming majority of people with eating disorders are
women, but experts say more and more men are afflicted,
particularly those involved in weight-conscious pursuits like
wrestling, dancing or modeling.
   Is there a way out?
   Said Levitz: ``Yes, I think there's a way. And I used to be more
hopeful about it happening. The main thing we have to do is change
people's perceptions of how you deal with different body weights.
How you look is a part of how you are as a person. And there are
many, many other things that are equally or more important.''

<TEXT>
   More than 500 people nationwide called a
toll-free number for information about anorexia nervosa after
watching a television movie about singer <PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON>, who died
as a result of the eating disorder.
   When ``The <PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON> Story'' was broadcast by <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME>, many affiliate stations displayed the toll-free telephone
number of a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> center devoted to treating eating disorders.
   Since the number, 800-334-8415, appeared, the <ORGANIZATION>Renfrew Center</ORGANIZATION> has
received more than 500 calls asking for information, <PERSON>Judy Goldstein</PERSON>,
the center's director of admissions, said <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``We expected the explosion of interest,'' <PERSON>Ms. Goldstein</PERSON> said.
``We put in extra telephone lines to handle the calls.''
   The center is sending callers a brochure with basic information
about the disorder and a list of self-help centers throughout the
country, said <PERSON>Sam Menaged</PERSON>, a co-founder.
   ``We were at the phones until <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME>'' <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Menaged</PERSON> said.
``The calls started trickling in from the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION>, then as the
night went on, I noticed we were talking to (people in) <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Carpenter</PERSON> and her brother, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>, recorded 20 top 10 hit
songs during the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, singing such tunes as ``Close to You,''
``Top of the World,'' ``We've Only Just Begun,'' and their No. 1
remake of ``Please <PERSON>Mr. Postman</PERSON>.''
   She died in <DATE>1983</DATE> of heart failure due to anorexia nervosa, an
eating disorder characterized by an obsession with weight loss and
an aversion to food.
   Although the disorder primarily affects women _ especially young
women _ no pattern to the calls existed, <PERSON>Ms. Goldstein</PERSON> said.
   A number of callers also asked about bulimia, an eating disorder
characterized by binging then purging the body of food.
   ``In the movie, <PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON> had recovered but died several
months later,'' <PERSON>Ms. Goldstein</PERSON> said. ``She had done so much damage to
her body. ... She wasn't able to make it.''
   Recovered anorexics should continue to receive therapy or
support, <PERSON>Ms. Goldstein</PERSON> said, so they will be aware of their
continued needs.
   She said the center normally gets about 100 calls per week from
people seeking information about the disorder.

<TEXT>
   A children's hospital says anorexia nervosa is up
among diet-crazed girls as young as 8 years old who are worried
about their weight because of social pressure.
   ``It's part of the general culture that we live in where
fitness, slimness, health is very much promoted and some of that
rubs off on young children,'' said <PERSON>Rachel Waugh</PERSON>, a specialist in
childhood eating disorders at the <ORGANIZATION>Great Ormond Street Hospital</ORGANIZATION> for
Sick Children.
   <PERSON>Ms. Waugh</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that most people with anorexia nervosa
are in their teens or early twenties, but that the hospital has
seen an increase in referrals of younger girls. She gave no figures
or percentages.
   Parents should be alert to large weight losses in their children
or extremely selective eating habits, she said in a radio interview
with the <ORGANIZATION>British Broadcasting Corp</ORGANIZATION>.

Question: I never realized how really dangerous an eating disorder could be 
until I read about anorexia in your column. Do these dangers apply to women of 
all ages? For example, if a teen-ager has an eating problem, isn't there a 
chance that she'll outgrow it? I would imagine that anorexia in a teen-ager 
would not be as serious a condition as it would be in an older woman. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The results of a study conducted by researchers from the <ORGANIZATION>University of 
Rochester</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>) Medical Center tend to support your view. They report that 
most adolescent girls who develop anorexia nervosa respond to treatment with a 
return to their normal weight; fewer than <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of those studied had a 
continuing problem related to their eating disorder. Moreover, neither their 
educational nor employment accomplishments were affected by the disorder.

   A cheerleader for the Little Cyclones, a swimmer and
gymnast, Noelle Smith was popular at Ames High School in
Ames, Iowa. And she seemed well-adjusted. But she thought she
was fat.
   To get ready for a Christmas dance during her junior year,
Noelle lost five pounds. After a mediocre report card a few
weeks later, the youngster, weighing 120 pounds and standing
5-foot-3, told her parents she was going on a diet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At first, she refused to eat anything but half a piece of
toast a day. Later, she began devouring over-the-counter diet
pills, as well as laxatives and diuretics. Eventually, she
was taking as many as 10 boxes of appetite suppressants a
week. Although <PERSON>Noelle</PERSON> tried to hide her habit, her parents
occasionally would find empty boxes of diet pills such as
Dexatrim and Acutrim in her pockets.
   In <DATE>July 1989</DATE>, <PERSON>Noelle</PERSON> died of heart failure. She was 20
years old.
   For the eight million Americans said to suffer from eating
disorders, the lure of readily available, over-the-counter
diet drugs often seems irresistible. The pills hold the
promise of quick, low-cost, painless weight loss, without the
need of a prescription. Doctors say that the majority of
patients they treat for anorexia or bulimia, mainly young
women, routinely misuse diet pills, diuretics, laxatives and
drugs such as ipecac that induce vomiting.
   The problem isn't confined to those with textbook eating
disorders. Many outwardly healthy teen-agers think of these
drugs as a standard way to diet. An astonishing <PERCENT>49%</PERCENT> of
teen-age girls responding to a recent survey by Sassy
magazine reported using diet pills, while <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> of the
magazine's young readers have tried laxatives or diuretics
for weight loss.
   In the grip of compulsive dieting, many youngsters come to
depend on large doses of drugs, often with serious
consequences to their health. Taken in excess, common diet
pills can cause anxiety, high blood pressure and even
cerebral hemorrhages. Big doses of laxatives and diuretics
can deplete body levels of electrolytes such as potassium and
sodium. This can lead to cardiac failure.
   Young people have no trouble buying diet pills, which are
available throughout the country without any age
restrictions. If they choose, drugstores can exert some
control over their sale, such as keeping the products behind
the counter. But most don't. "There was nothing we could do
to shut off the supply," says <PERSON>Noelle</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>Anthony Smith</PERSON>.
"No one ever asked why a 16-year-old-girl was constantly
buying diet pills, laxatives and diuretics."
   A congressional inquiry earlier this year focused
attention on the problem. "The role {diet pills} play in
eating disorders has been documented," says Rep. <PERSON>Ron Wyden</PERSON>
(D., <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>), whose subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION>Small Business
Committee</ORGANIZATION> conducted the inquiry. "These products should be
kept out of the hands of kids."
   But after nearly a decade of reviewing the pills, the <ORGANIZATION>Food
and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> has done little but mull the problem.
Although it recently proposed banning 111 ingredients used
historically in nonprescription diet drugs (110 to be banned
as ineffective, and one, guar gum, as dangerous), most of
these aren't used anymore.
   The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has indicated it will continue to approve
phenylpropanolamine (PPA). This is the active ingredient in
the most common nonprescription diet pills, including
Dexatrim (made by <ORGANIZATION>Thompson Medical Co.</ORGANIZATION>) and Acutrim
(<ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy Corp.</ORGANIZATION>), which together dominate the <MONEY>$220 million</MONEY>
market. <ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION> is also the ingredient critics say causes the
trouble. A mild stimulant chemically similar to adrenalin,
<ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION> is also found in such cold remedies as Contac and
Alka-Seltzer Plus -- products that aren't abused by dieters
and in which <ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION> isn't considered a problem.
   Marketers of the over-the-counter diet medications insist
their products are safe and effective. Industry-sponsored
studies recently submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> prove it, says <PERSON>Bill
Soller</PERSON>, director of science and technology for the
<ORGANIZATION>Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   The industry also points to a <DATE>1988</DATE> study by the <ORGANIZATION>National
Institute of Drug Abuse</ORGANIZATION> that says abuse of over-the-counter
diet pills has in fact declined over the past few years
because fewer kids use them. Twenty-two percent of
high-school seniors, boys and girls, currently use them,
according to the study.
   Critics of PPA-based diet pills contend such drugs
actually contribute to the development of eating disorders in
teenagers. At the same time, they say, there is no proof the
pills promote significant or permanent weight loss -- while
for some allergic or hypersensitive individuals and people
with certain health problems, the drugs are dangerous even
when taken according to directions.
   Labels warn of risk to diabetics and people with high
blood pressure and other conditions. But critics' indictment
of the drugs is much more sweeping: "They are neither
effective nor safe," asserts <PERSON>Thaddeus Prout</PERSON>, a physician who
chaired an <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> committee in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> that reviewed
prescription diet drugs.
   Aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies has also
come under attack. Between them, <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Thompson
Medical</ORGANIZATION> spend <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY> a year advertising the products,
often holding out the promise of effortless weight loss.
Though the industry itself claims the drugs will help dieters
lose less than a pound a week, Dexatrim's packaging invites
buyers to "lose weight fast."
   Just about any drug can be dangerous when used improperly,
but some researchers say <ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION> is riskier than other commonly
available medications, in part simply because it is abused by
desperate people. In a recent report, <PERSON>Paul Raford</PERSON>, a
physician specializing in public health who advises Rep.
<PERSON>Wyden</PERSON>'s subcommittee, concluded that <ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION> is far more
dangerous than ingredients in the sort of over-the-counter
drugs that people aren't tempted to take in huge quantities.
   Some marketers deny there is any abuse of the drugs. "I
don't have any data that show people under the age of 18 are
using our products," asserts <PERSON>Alison Mann</PERSON>, brand manager for
<ORGANIZATION>Thompson Medical</ORGANIZATION>'s Dexatrim.
   Amphetamines, drugs once prescribed for dieters and
frequently abused, lost favor among doctors in the mid-1970s.
Now most doctors shun the potentially addictive drugs in
favor of behavior modification and nutrition training
programs.
   However, doctors estimate that <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> of patients with eating
disorders take laxatives, as purgatives. And many routinely
consume diuretics to achieve a temporary loss of fluids.
Anything for a quick weight loss. "They don't think about the
consequences; kids feel as if they are immortal," says <PERSON>Vivian
Meehan</PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Anorexia
Nervosa and Associated Disorders</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Highland Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION> "The
drugs help kids to eat chaotically."
   Consider <PERSON>Kelli Kirkpatrick</PERSON>, now 26. At 16, she would drink
mouthwash after meals to help make herself vomit, then take a
handful of laxative pills. "I'd be in a lot of pain after I
took them, but it didn't matter much to me," she says. "I
would feel my hip bone, and if the bone stuck out from my
stomach, I'd feel successful."
   <PERSON>Meredith Lee</PERSON>, a 16-year-old junior in suburban <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>,
says diets and drugs often go together in her school. She
began dieting with a friend when she was in the eighth grade,
at first eating only carrots and rice cakes for lunch. Soon,
the two stopped eating altogether. Then <PERSON>Ms. Lee</PERSON> began using
nonprescription diuretics "to flush the extra water out of
me." She began taking two pills in the <TIME>morning</TIME> and two at
night. But once, after downing more than 20 pills, she awoke
to feel her room spinning. She was violently ill for days and
had to take medication to stop vomiting.
   Despite the quantities of drugs some young women consume,
many are initially successful at concealing their behavior.
<PERSON>Ms. Lee</PERSON> convinced her mother that her diuretics overdose was
a bout of flu. Doctors note that people with eating disorders
are often ashamed and very secretive.
   Even though <PERSON>Noelle Smith</PERSON>'s parents were aware of her
illness and had her hospitalized several times, they couldn't
stop her drug use. Every time they confiscated a box of diet
pills or laxatives, she would buy more. She told friends she
would resort to shoplifting when she couldn't borrow the
money for them.
   Access was never a problem for <PERSON>Jessica McDonald</PERSON>, now a
20-year-old college junior in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C</LOCATION>. She started
buying diet pills at 12, taking a cue from a friend at ballet
school. Two years later, she added diuretics and laxatives as
drugs of abuse. Though she shopped at the same drugstore
nearly every day, "No one ever said anything to me," she
says.
   Because these drugs are available without a prescription,
they are widely thought to be innocuous. Their very
availability bestows an aura of safety.
   Neither Ex-Lax nor Correctol brands of chemical laxatives,
which doctors say are popular with obsessive dieters because
they quickly produce temporary weight loss, have label
warnings about misuse by dieters, though they do caution
against prolonged use. "We are aware the abuse of these
products exists, but we haven't done anything to encourage
it," says a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Schering-Plough Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, maker of
Correctol. A <ORGANIZATION>Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp.</ORGANIZATION> spokesman says he
is unaware of any abuse of the company's Ex-Lax.
   The label on a box of Acutrim warns only that the pills
aren't for children under 12. It doesn't warn against taking
too much. Boxes of Dexatrim urge somewhat more caution. They
warn users not to exceed the recommended dosage and they tell
youngsters between 12 and 18 to consult a doctor before
taking the pills.
   A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Ciba-Geigy</ORGANIZATION> says that he doesn't believe
Acutrim is heavily abused, but that the company plans to
alter labeling in the next few months anyway. Boxes will say
Acutrim isn't intended for those under 18. "There's been a
lot of publicity about this issue," he says, "and we feel a
responsibility to do something."
   Rep. <PERSON>Wyden</PERSON> advocates making directions on diet pills more
specific or including warnings about misuse. The <ORGANIZATION>National
Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders</ORGANIZATION> has
proposed some limitations on selling diet pills, laxatives
and diuretics to customers under 18, like keeping the
products behind the counter where they have to be asked for.
   But retailers and manufacturers point out that the drugs
have been approved by the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION>, and say the agency is
virtually certain to bless the continued use of <ORGANIZATION>PPA</ORGANIZATION> in
nonprescription diet drugs even if it recommends new
labeling. "Limiting the access of minors would be very
difficult," says <PERSON>Mr. Soller</PERSON> of the manufacturers'
association. "Teen-agers found a way to buy alcohol.
Restricting access simply camouflages the problem."
   For now, that problem remains right there in the open on
drugstore shelves. <PERSON>Mr. Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Noelle</PERSON>'s father, spreads on his
dining-room table snapshots he took of a display of diet
pills and diuretics at a local drugstore. "We weren't perfect
parents," he says. "We made mistakes, but they were loving
mistakes. We just didn't know over-the-counter drugs could
cause such a problem."

An addiction to opiates produced by the brain while dieting may be the cause of 
anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder in which patients starve themselves, 
sometimes to death, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> researchers said last week. The scientists say 
their research, presented at the 40th annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>American Society</ORGANIZATION> 
for Pharmacology and <ORGANIZATION>Experimental Therapeutics</ORGANIZATION>, suggested anorexics may have 
"abnormal biological responses" to diet-triggered opiates. 
</P>
<P>
Typically these opiates, called endorphins, produce a "high" and an increased 
appetite. But in anorexia patients, those effects may be out of balance, so 
hunger is overridden by the euphoria, said <ORGANIZATION>Wayne State University</ORGANIZATION> 
pharmacologist <PERSON>Mary Ann Marrazzi</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In their study, the researchers discovered that some mice demonstrated 
decreased appetite and increased activity when given morphine, an opiate. If a 
person responded similarly to their own opiates, released during dieting, it 
would mimic the behavior of anorexia nervosa patients, she said.

   Fat doesn't have to be part of the fun during the holidays, says
Weight Watchers magazine.
   There are ways to resist temptations to over-indulge, the
magazine says, and offers this advice:
   _ Plan ahead. Have a snack before going to a get-together so you
won't be ``starving'' when you get there.
   _ Practice moderation. Make room in your day's menu for a
reasonable helping of your favorite foods, but don't abandon your
diet guidelines completely.
   _ Just say no, thanks. Think about ways to turn down food
without sounding hostile, sanctimonious or rude.
   _ Avoid high-risk situations. Stay away from the all-you-can eat
buffet. Let your guests take home the leftovers.
   _ Don't drink too much. Alcohol has a high-calorie content _ and
can destroy your resolve to resist other temptations.
   The holidays are often most difficult for people with eating
disorders and their families, says <PERSON>Dr. Charles A. Murkofsy</PERSON>,
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Eating Disorders Program</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Gracie Square Hospital</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.
   ``A person with an eating disorder will often bully the family
into having turkey without all the trimmings, or refuse to
participate in the holiday meal at all,'' he says.
   Families, he suggests, should give recognition to the eating
disorder instead of denying its existence, and make mutually
agreeable compromises on food choices.
   He says the most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, a
self-induced starvation, and bulimia, a cycle of binging and
purging.

   For Thanksgiving dinner, <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> used to fix
herself a small salad while the rest of her family sat down to
turkey and dressing.
   Lisa skipped dinner altogether one year and instead took an
overdose of pills.
   What should have been a holiday was a nightmare for the two women
because they suffered from anorexia. The thought of a bountiful
feast spread out before them repulsed them.
   But this year, both <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> will sit down to a
traditional Thanksgiving meal with several hundred others who suffer
from eating disorders. The dinner is a part of the annual <ORGANIZATION>National
Eating Disorders Week</ORGANIZATION> originated by their doctor, <PERSON>Felix Larocca</PERSON>, a
child psychiatrist who specializes in treating disorders like
anorexia and bulimia.
   ``It's kind of like a homecoming,'' said <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>, who asked that
her last name be withheld. ``You feel a little more comfortable
sitting with people who you know have the same problem. It's a
little easier to eat.''
   The dinner will be a traditional one, with all the trimmings:
roast turkey, dressing, wild rice, broccoli, glazed carrots, mixed
fruit, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie and carrot cake.
   Victims of anorexia refuse to eat because they believe themselves
fat even when they're dangerously underweight, while bulimia
sufferers binge and purge, eating sometimes enormous amounts of food
and then throwing up.
   Most of those who suffer from these eating disorders are young,
white women, bt more and more cases are being diagnosed among men,
blacks, Asians and children.
   Larocca is the founder of <ORGANIZATION>BASH Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which stands for Bulimia
Anorexia Self-Help. Based in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, it is an internationally
known program for people with eating disorders.
   The annual dinner began five years ago to help <PERSON>Larocca</PERSON>'s patients
shift the focus of the Thanksgiving holiday away from food. ``The
idea is to socialize, to get reacquainted,'' he said. ``The dinner
is played down.''
   The first dinner was held after <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> tried to commit suicide with
the overdose she took while home from college for Thanksgiving.
   ``She said she couldn't handle it, she hated the holiday,''
<PERSON>Larocca</PERSON> said. ``People talked about food and insisted everybody take
seconds.''
   ``It was a miracle she survived, but she made it and lived.''
   Last year, about 300 past and present patients of <PERSON>Larocca</PERSON>'s,
their families and friends attended the meal. In conjunction with
the meal, seminars and workshops on eating and mood disorders are
offered.
   BASH is the outpatient program for the <ORGANIZATION>BASH Treatment and
Research Center</ORGANIZATION>, based at <ORGANIZATION>Deaconess Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>. The
program, which <PERSON>Larocca</PERSON> founded in <DATE>1981</DATE>, seeks to restore proper
eating habits to patients through behavior modification, individual
and group therapy and nutritional guidance.
   Both anorexia and bulimia can be fatal. Besides malnutrition,
victims of eating disorders can suffer electrolyte imbalances, which
can cause abnormal heart rhythms, and amenorrhea, the loss of
menstruation. Frequent vomiting by bulimics can lead to tooth decay.
One victim was pop singer <PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1983</DATE> at the
age of 33 of complications of anorexia.
   Sufferers also can become addicted to diet pills and laxatives,
which can lower the body's potassium content, making heart failure a
risk.
   <PERSON>Larocca</PERSON> said compulsive exercising is now being recognized as yet
another tool for people who suffer eating disorders. ``Exercise
addicts start quite innocently,'' he said. ``But once they get
caught in the treadmill of exercise, they suffer anxiety when they
can't get their fix.''
   Larocca's self-help program began with a suggestion from several
of his anorexic and bulimic patients, who met in a group with him
once a month, that a meeting that included relatives of people with
eating disorders would be beneficial.
   BASH now reaches some 6,000 people in the <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> area, and
with the distribution of its newsletter, more than 15,000 people
around the world, <PERSON>Larocca</PERSON> said. It also operates a 24-hour toll-free
crisis hotline.
   Both <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> have recovered, although they still find
the meetings helpful for dealing with self-image problems.
   ``Now I don't feel I have to go so much for myself, but to help
other people,'' said <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON>, who spent one Thanksgiving in the
hospital being fed through tubes. ``It's just amazing that knowing
that other people have been through the same things helps a lot.''

   A study suggests the nutritional needs of
women with eating disorders differ from those of normal women.
   A study by <ORGANIZATION>Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic</ORGANIZATION> found that
women recovering from bulimia needed only <PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> of the normal
intake of calories. Conversely, women recovering from anorexia
needed two-thirds more calories than normal.
   Bulimia is the disorder of gorging and purging. Anorexia is an
avoidance of food.
   The study of 23 recovering bulimic women who were trying to
maintain normal weight found that the women required only 10
calories per pound of body weight, or <PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> of the 13.8 daily
calories per pound that healthy women need.
   Separate studies involving 31 recovering anorexic women found
they needed 22.3 calories per pound of body weight to maintain
their normal weight.
   ``These findings have led to new treatment methods in our
program ... and they help us to understand the physiological
factors that complicate the psychological issues of eating
disorders,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Walter Kaye</PERSON>, director of the institute's

<HEAD>Study: Elementary School Pupils Watch Their Waistlines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Children, like adults, may be keenly conscious
of their waistlines and many have tried dieting, a hospital survey
suggests.
   Nearly half of 318 elementary school children surveyed worried
they were overweight, and more than a third said they had attempted
diets, according to a study released <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``This study tells us that it's not just the 15-, 20- or
40-year-olds who feel they're overweight _ 9- and 10-year-olds feel
the same way,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Michael J. Maloney</PERSON>, director of psychiatry
and psychology at <ORGANIZATION>Children's Hospital Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION>.
   The study, ``A Survey of Dieting Behavior and Eating Attitudes
in Children,'' will be published in <DATE>September</DATE>'s issue of
Pediatrics, a monthly professional journal.
   Researchers at the hospital surveyed girls and boys in the third
through sixth grades at two randomly hosen schools in middle-income
Cincinnati-area neighborhoods.
   Of those surveyed, the researchers said <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> indicated
they were uncomfortable with their bodies and wanted to be thinner.
Thirty-seven percent said they had already tried to lose weight,
<PERSON>Maloney</PERSON> said.
   ``Girls in grades five and six reported significantly more
discomfort about their bodies than girls in grades three and four
or boys in all grades,'' he said.
   A total of <PERCENT>6.9 percent</PERCENT> gave responses similar to those obtained
in studies of teen-agers and young adult females who suffer from
anorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by severe and prolonged
inability or refusal to eat, he said.
   ``Previous research has determined that <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of
17-year-old girls think they're overweight, but only 20 to <PERCENT>30
percent</PERCENT> really are,'' he said.
   The researchers plan a six-year followup study in hopes of
learning more about the possible causes of eating disorders and
ways to treat them.
   Maloney planned to present his findings <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>American

<DATELINE> BOSTON (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some binge eaters produce unusually small amounts of a hormone that ordinarily signals people that they are full, according to a study. 

   The report suggests that a defect in production of this natural chemical may be an underlying cause of bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder in which people stuff themselves with food and then make themselves vomit. 

   Other studies have shown that anti-depression medicine is an effective way to curb binge eating, and the latest research shows that the drugs also seem to increase levels of the appetite hormone after a meal. 

   However, the researchers say further study will be necessary to see if correcting the apparent hormonal abnormality is important in controlling bulimia. 

   The study was conducted by Drs. 
<PERSON>Thomas D. Geracioti Jr.</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Mental Health</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Rodger A. Liddle</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
It was published in <DATE>Thursday</DATE>'s New England Journal of Medicine. 

   The study compared 14 women with bulimia with 10 healthy volunteers. 
It found that after a meal, the binge eaters produced unusually low levels of cholecystokinin, a hormone released from the intestines that produces satiety. 

   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. 
<PERSON>David B. Herzog</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul M. Copeland</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts General Hospital</ORGANIZATION> cautioned that "it is premature to conclude" that low hormone levels make people susceptible to binge eating. 

   But they added, "Investigating bulimia nervosa from the perspective of defective satiety offers a promising avenue of research." 

   They noted that <PERCENT>1%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>4%</PERCENT> of young adult American women and a much smaller number of men are believed to have the disorder.

   Your story about Carol Lopacich's disinheritance from the
Baxter International Inc. fortune ("She Might Have Inherited
Millions, But for Her Mother," page one, Nov. 25) because of
her parent's disapproval of her size is a shocking and
dramatic example of the high price women often pay because of
how they look.
   I suffered from bulimia from ages 15 to 22, partly because
my swim coaches never missed an opportunity to comment on how
important it was to be "lean and mean." Now as the president
of a foundation that assists others with the same problem, I
get thousands of letters from women who say it took just one
disparaging comment from a parent, coach or other authority
figure for them to start binging, starving, vomiting,
compulsively exercising and abusing laxatives. Some say their
parents even have scales set up next to the refrigerator to
determine whether they "deserve" to eat or not.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The most common precursor to developing an eating disorder
is "going on a little diet," and bulimia and anorexia
together have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric
illness. So that ought to be food for thought for anyone who
is tempted to comment on another person's weight.

FIRM TO HALT FALSE CLAIMS FOR DIET PILLS

<P>
A <LOCATION>Tustin</LOCATION> company that advertised its weight-loss pill as "the diet miracle of 
the '90s" has agreed to stop making false claims about the product, which was 
the subject of an eight-month investigation by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Postal Inspection 
Service</ORGANIZATION>, federal authorities said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed against <ORGANIZATION>Jordon Whitney Inc.</ORGANIZATION> or its 
officers, <LOCATION>John</LOCATION>. J. and <PERSON>Clare W. Kogler</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Ana</LOCATION>, said Postal Inspector 
<PERSON>Donald Obritsch</PERSON>. Such charges could be filed if the Koglers break their consent 
agreement with the postal service. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, which was signed on <DATE>July 24</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Koglers</ORGANIZATION> also must 
refund all money spent on Anorex <DATE>2000</DATE> to customers who request it, <PERSON>Obritsch</PERSON> 
said. The Koglers could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fat-Burning Machine' 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Obritsch</PERSON> said that the <PERSON>Koglers</PERSON> have agreed to stop "falsely representing that 
Anorex <DATE>2000</DATE> will aid in weight loss or fat reduction." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jordon Whitney</PERSON> advertised Anorex <DATE>2000</DATE> in about 100 newspapers nationwide 
between <DATE>January</DATE> and <DATE>April</DATE>. The ads bragged that the product would turn the body 
into a "fat-burning machine," <PERSON>Obritsch</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Anorex <DATE>2000</DATE> was touted as "an all-natural, bioactive diet pill," <PERSON>Obritsch</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertisement said, 'Researchers warn that Anorex <DATE>2000</DATE> is an extremely 
powerful anorectic agent and should not be taken lightly,' " he recounted. " 
'If weight drops too fast, Anorex <DATE>2000</DATE> should not be taken for several days.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vitamins and Fiber 
</P>
<P>
But during the postal service investigation, the pills were examined by a 
professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION>, who concluded that the product "is useless, 
fraudulent, and intended to deceive a gullible buyer," according to an 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
While the pills are not harmful, <PERSON>Dr. E.J. Drenick</PERSON> surmised that they contain 
only vitamins and fiber. A 30-day supply cost dieters <MONEY>$36.95</MONEY>, plus <MONEY>$3</MONEY> for 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Although postal inspectors have no idea how many diet pills were sold or how 
much the company took in with its fraudulent ads, <PERSON>Obritsch</PERSON> said, the firm 
received about 200 letters a day.

<HEAD>Binge Eaters May Have Defect in Hormone Controlling Appetite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abnormally low amounts of a hormone that controls
appetite may play a role in bulimia, the cycles of binge eating and
purging suffered by some young women, a study published today
concludes.
   The preliminary report found that some people with the disorder
make unusually small amounts of cholecystokinin, a hormone produced
by the intestines that makes people feel full, or sated, after a
meal.
   ``We conclude that patients with bulimia do not have normal
satiety and have impaired secretion of cholecystokinin in response
to a meal,'' the researchers wrote in the <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> Journal of
Medicine.
   Between <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> of young adult American women
and a much smaller number of men are believed to have the disorder.
Victims tend to eat large quantities of food, then purposely purge
themselves with vomiting or laxatives.
   Other studies have shown that anti-depression medicine is an
effective way to curb binge eating, and the latest research found
that the drugs also seem to increase levels of the appetite hormone
after a meal.
   However, the researchers cautioned that further study will be
necessary to see if correcting the apparent hormonal abnormality is
important in controlling bulimia.
   The study by Drs. <PERSON>Thomas D. Geracioti Jr.</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National

   With any joss _ that means ``luck'' in Chinese _
there'll be something to do next week rather than spend eight hours
on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s mind-numbing miniseries, the ignoble ``<ORGANIZATION>Noble House</ORGANIZATION>,''
based on <PERSON>James Clavell</PERSON>'s best-selling novel of the same title.
   The plot is preposterous, the acting spotty, the music overdone,
the love scenes embarrassing, the special effects fakey. And after
investing <TIME>eight hours _ two hours a night</TIME>, <DATE>Sunday</DATE> through
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> _ everything is tied up neatly at the end, not
through any clever plot twist, but because of an act of God. Thanks
a lot.
   <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON>, late of ``<PERSON>Remington Steele</PERSON>,'' is a fine actor,
but he's too pretty for <PERSON>Ian Dunross</PERSON>, a tough, middle-aged corporate
kingpin descended from Scottish pirates. Then this suave, exotic
fellow is given as a love interest gawky <PERSON>Deborah Raffin</PERSON> as
gosh-darn American <PERSON>Casey Tcholok</PERSON>, a perky corporate raider.
   Casey is a tip-o'-the-hat to feminism. The rest of the women in
the cast are the typical array of hookers, mistresses, or, at best,
secretaries.
   <ORGANIZATION>Ben Masters</ORGANIZATION> manages a believable performance as deceptively
affable <PERSON>Linc Barlett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Casey</PERSON>'s boss and honcho of a huge <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>
conglomerate. But it's the villains who get the best of the
miniseries _ <PERSON>John Rhys-Davies</PERSON> as jealous <PERSON>Quillan Gornt</PERSON>, longtime
<ORGANIZATION>Noble House</ORGANIZATION> rival, and <PERSON>Khigh Diegh</PERSON>, the most fun of all as Four
Finger Wu, a wily bandit who operates from a junk in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>
harbor, cuffing his honest son into helping toss hapless henchman
overboard.
   The miniseries was shot in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and on location in exotic <LOCATION>Hong
Kong</LOCATION>.
   As the miniseries opens, Dunross is becoming the new tai-pan, or
boss, of <ORGANIZATION>Noble House</ORGANIZATION>, a huge Hong Kong-based trading company. He
has inherited a financial mess from his predecessor (<ORGANIZATION>Denholm
Elliott</ORGANIZATION>) and must struggle to keep the company from going under.
   To that end, he entertains a merger offer by a Linc's company,
<ORGANIZATION>Par-Con Industries</ORGANIZATION>.
   Enter Linc, accompanied by <PERSON>Casey</PERSON>, come to <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> to cut a
deal. Talk about your ugly Americans _ during their brief stay,
banks fail, stock markets plunge, fires rage, buildings collapse,
and murders are most foul. Anybody with a lick of sense would
skedaddle back to the States and chalk it up to poor junket
planning. And a people who place so much emphasis on joss _ as the
Chinese must, since the word turns up several times a night _ would
surely notice that these two haven't exactly brought a ray of
sunshine to their happy port city.
   Shortly after Linc and <PERSON>Casey</PERSON> arrive, Linc secretly meets with
<PERSON>Gornt</PERSON>, who entices Linc with a possible joint raid on the <ORGANIZATION>Noble
House</ORGANIZATION>. Casey, in the meantime, is linking up with <PERSON>Ian</PERSON>. Everyone
remains irritatingly pleasant in between natural disasters.
   Also in the meantime, bandits play keep-away with a stolen,
broken half-coin that figures in an inscrutable ancient tradition
entitling the bearer to a lucrative ``favor'' from the <ORGANIZATION>Noble House</ORGANIZATION>.
   Though the plot is supposed to take place over a few days, it
seems like years. Time passage is such a problem that at one point,
the characters have to explain in dialogue what has happened when
and remark how it all seems so long ago.
   For viewers, it will all seem so long ago, too. ``Noble House''
isn't good enough to be good, or even bad enough to be good. As a
four-hour junk-TV snack, maybe. But for anyone willing to invest
eight hours _ good joss.

SCHOOL CLINIC ISSUE DESERVES RECHECKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN BROWN, Maureen Brown is a former teacher who lives in La Jolla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From what I have observed thus far, the <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> computer game system comes 
with a more comprehensive set of instructions and programs than parents and 
educators acquire with children. In <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION>, guidelines are tidy and clearly 
mapped out, and the player needs only to comply with the instructions to 
perform skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, were it only so with parenting and education. With innumerable variables 
such as personality, behavior, intelligent quotient and economic factors, 
decisions affecting children become so much more onerous. Every decree must be 
weighed carefully and eventually re-evaluated when the timing is suitable. When 
the issues immersed in the judgment are emotional and controversial, time bears 
an important role in determining when best to approach the topic again. 
</P>
<P>
"Time crumbles things; everything grows under the power of time and is 
forgotten through the lapse of time," Aristotle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Almost three years have elapsed since the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Unified School District</ORGANIZATION> 
considered establishing health-care clinics at some high schools. Funded by a 
private foundation, the centers would have been staffed by professionals who, 
depending on the program adopted by the district, would provide physical 
examinations, immunizations, counseling and birth control information. 
</P>
<P>
The district appointed a committee of 30 people from business, educational, 
health and religious sectors to listen to the public's opinion, examine the 
needs of the community, study similar programs in other school districts and 
make a recommendation to the school board. The committee made a favorable 
recommendation to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The board considered the recommendation of the committee, listened to more 
community debate and assessed that the public was unwilling to accept the role 
of the school district in this form of health care. 
</P>
<P>
But after three years, and two new board members, it's time to reconsider 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
It is fitting to bury the anger and emotional drama that accompanied the idea 
of school-based health clinics and approach the topic again in a caring milieu. 
Sufficient time may have passed to allow the various interest groups to 
approach the issue with facts, and without the distraction of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
The school district will now have more data to present to the community. 
Educators can interpret the effectiveness of similar programs in parallel 
communities. Does there still appear to be a need for the clinics in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
Three years will have allowed religious factions to show how the alternative 
programs they suggested have been implemented and whether they have met the 
needs of adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Three years will have given the medical community and affiliated groups an 
opportunity to relate how their programs have dealt with the issue of 
adolescent medicine. 
</P>
<P>
And, in three years, the legions of adolescents and parents will have grown, 
affording another group an opportunity to study and discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for the parents who supported the clinic to determine if their 
reasoning was accurate. Do they have specific examples where health care on 
campus might have helped a teen-ager? Moreover, it is an occasion for the 
parents who opposed the program to render their opinions. May we hear again 
from the mother of the ninth-grader who saw no need for such support. How have 
the subsequent years influenced her conviction? 
</P>
<P>
And this mother of four, who now has two high school students? How have the 
three years affected my views? <PERSON>Bobby McFerrin</PERSON>, the Grammy nominee, sings to me, 
"Don't worry, be happy," my dear friend tells me to pray more, but I am not 
calmed by what I read, hear or see. 
</P>
<P>
Am I alone in my belief that, although we counsel our children, preach to them, 
monitor their activities and love them, we still need and benefit from the 
assistance of other professionals? 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, like other parents, I am chanting "say 'no' " to drugs and 
alcohol, capitalizing on the merits of abstinence with regard to teen-age sex, 
stressing good nutrition and asking that wet towels not be left on the bedroom 
floors. Yet, I am still finding wet towels on the bedroom floors. 
</P>
<P>
I have sat with the anxious friend whose daughter had anorexia nervosa and 
wondered about other young people. I have heard of the football player who 
works at gaining weight or the wrestler who attempts to lose weight to wrestle 
in a different weight class. While discussing vitamins, nutritional supplements 
and diuretics, I observe adolescents consuming mass quantities of nachos and 
diet soda.

KarenandRichard. 
</P>
<P>
Those names were linked so often in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, when the Carpenters were the 
hottest duo in pop music, that many pop fans came to think of the pair as one. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine early in the decade when the <PERSON>Downey</PERSON> brother-and-sister team was 
turning out instant standards such as "We've Only Just Begun" and "Close to 
You," but it started to bother <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE> when the duo's fortunes 
declined sharply. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to establish an independent identity at last, <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> moved to <LOCATION>New 
York</LOCATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> to record a solo album with Grammy-winning producer <PERSON>Phil Ramone</PERSON>, 
whose credits include hits by <PERSON>Billy Joel</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Simon</PERSON> and Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
But the album was never released. Instead, <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> reteamed to record 
a traditional Carpenters album, which failed to reverse their downward career 
momentum. And in <DATE>1983</DATE> -- after a brief, failed marriage -- <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> died at 32 of 
complications from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder which had plagued her 
since the mid '70s. 
</P>
<P>
With her death, the "lost <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> tapes" became even more of a source of mystery 
among fans. But they remained unavailable -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Four songs from that shelved <DATE>1979</DATE> album are featured -- along with eight 
previously unreleased Carpenters recordings -- on a just-released Carpenters 
album, "Love-lines." 
</P>
<P>
The recordings -- released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the 
Carpenters' signing with <ORGANIZATION>A&amp;M Records</ORGANIZATION> -- suggest that <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> could work 
effectively outside the Carpenters' mellow pop sound and could have gone on to 
a thriving solo career. 
</P>
<P>
The big question: Why was the solo album put in limbo? 
</P>
<P>
The bigger question: If the album had been released and been successful, would 
things have turned out differently for <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>? 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion in some music industry quarters has been that <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> shelved the 
solo album out of loyalty to <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>, who was anxious to get back to work in 
<DATE>1979</DATE> after recovering from a Quaalude dependency. (<ORGANIZATION>Richard</ORGANIZATION>'s dependency was 
revealed in CBS-TV's "The <PERSON>Karen Carpenter Story</PERSON>," the highest-rated TV movie of 
the 1988-89 season.) 
</P>
<P>
In an interview tied to the release of the new album, <PERSON>Richard Carpenter</PERSON>, 43, 
was candid about the conflicts within the Carpenters in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Karen</PERSON> would mention every now and again that it would be nice to receive some 
accolades as a solo singer," he said in an A&amp;M office in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. "Of 
course, that made me feel badly, because we were a duo. Lord knows, she was the 
star of the duo, but that's not quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Richard</PERSON> said that he had a less-than-supportive reaction to <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>'s 
announcement -- just after he had begun a six-week drug rehabilitation program 
-- that she was planning to record an album without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably said something like, 'You're just abandoning ship, just taking off 
and doing what you want to do.' I was feeling sorry for myself," he said. "It 
was a combination of feeling I was being abandoned -- which was anything but 
the case looking back on it -- and thinking this was a perfect time for her to 
get some treatment for her disorder. So I was not happy, and I told her as 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Richard, who produced and arranged the <ORGANIZATION>Carpenters</ORGANIZATION>' long string of hits, also 
acknowledged that he felt threatened by <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>'s teaming up with another 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm human and it did cross my mind that something could come out of this and 
just explode at which time I would be going through a number of emotions. I'd 
be happy for <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> because I always felt that she should have been in the Top 
5. On the other hand, being sensitive and feeling I'd done a good job for the 
Carpenters I would have been a little bit upset." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview from his <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> office, producer <PERSON>Phil Ramone</PERSON> 
discussed his and <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>'s objective on the album. "We were thinking two things: 
How do we make a record that doesn't sound like the Carpenters, and what could 
we say lyrically in these songs that has a more mature attitude?" 
</P>
<P>
The solo album included a spare, intimate reading of the sexually direct "Make 
Believe It's Your First Time" and a bluesy version of <PERSON>Paul Simon</PERSON>'s "Still Crazy 
After All These Years" -- though <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>, mindful of her prim image -- had <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> 
change the line, "4 in the morning / crapped out / yawning" to the more demure 
"crashed out." 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Karen</PERSON> was frustrated by the Goody Two-Shoes image, but she was torn," <PERSON>Ramone</PERSON> 
said. "She wanted to do try new things, but then she'd turn around and say, 
'We're going to do another Carpenters Christmas special.' I kept saying, 'The 
(Andy) <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> family even got past that one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ramone still remembers the day in early <DATE>1980</DATE> when he and <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> played the album 
for <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>A&amp;M</ORGANIZATION> founders <PERSON>Herb Alpert</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Moss</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"The silence was deafening," he said. "<PERSON>Richard</PERSON> didn't say much and still 
hasn't. He's accepted these songs kind of like stepchildren. <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> was always 
the sweetheart of A&amp;M, and <PERSON>Herb</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> reacted almost like it was their 
teen-age daughter I was messing with." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Alpert</PERSON>, who wrote the liner notes to the Carpenters' debut album and found the 
team's breakthrough hit, "Close to You," declined to be interviewed for this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Richard Carpenter</PERSON> remembers giving <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> a mixed, but essentially lukewarm, 
review of the solo project. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably said it was very nice," he said. "It certainly is well-produced and 
well-assembled. But some of it was disco, and I'm not a disco fan, and I 
thought she was singing a little bit too high on some of the songs." 
</P>
<P>
And <PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON> applied some not-so-subtle pressure on <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> by telling her how 
eager he was to begin work on the next Carpenters album. "I was much better by 
then and was kicking myself for what I had done to my life," he said. "So I 
mentioned that whenever she was ready, I was ready. I had all the tunes set to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
The deciding factor came when A&amp;M executives asked <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ramone</PERSON> to go 
back into the studio to record a few more songs for the solo project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was up to <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> to decide if she wanted to spend more time on it or not," 
<PERSON>Richard</PERSON> said. "She didn't and that was that. I've gotten a lot of letters 
through the years since <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> passed on kind of accusing me of not releasing 
the solo album. It's not my doing at all. It's <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>'s wishes I'm honoring." 
</P>
<P>
In a <DATE>1981</DATE> interview, <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s desire to get back to work took 
precedence over completing the solo project. But <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> added that she valued 
the solo experience. "It was fun cutting it and seeing that I could do all that 
-- sing a different type of tune and work with different people. I was scared 
to death beforehand. I basically knew one producer, one arranger, one studio, 
one record company and that was it. . . . I'm used to being part of a duo. 
Richard's like a third arm to me." 
</P>
<P>
Stung by the cool reception at the playback session, <PERSON>Ramone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> went to 
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> for a vacation. "I watched this girl disintegrate in front of me," 
<PERSON>Ramone</PERSON> said. "It was hard for her to express anger, but sometimes she'd be 
sitting there and she'd say, 'Why is this happening? What did I do wrong? 
Should we listen to the tape? Is it the mix?' " 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Ramone</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> was ultimately proud of the album: "It was the first 
step to her standing on her own and also the last chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that if she had made it through this she could have gone on to 
have a long career," <PERSON>Ramone</PERSON> said. "A lot of the pop songs and movie songs and 
duets of the '80s would have been hers. 
</P>
<P>
"A voice like <PERSON>Karen</PERSON>'s -- rich, womanly -- comes along once every 20 years. 
Voices like that should have a chance to do a variety of things."

<HEADLINE>  THE PRICE OF BEAUTY
FIXATION ON LOOKS MEANS LOSS OF POWER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Books
Faludi, a Wall Street Journal reporter based in San Francisco, recently won
the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism. She is the author of "Backlash:
The Undeclared War Against American Women," which will be published in October.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  By <PERSON>Naomi Wolf; Morrow</PERSON>, 291 pp., <MONEY>$21.95</MONEY>;  WHY, in an era when women are
supposedly freer than ever before, do so many middle-class women chain
themselves to private beauty torture chambers, starving and purging their
bellies, scalding their faces with Retin-A "treatments" and acid peels, or
slicing their body parts with plastic surgery (now the fastest growing medical
specialty in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>)?;    Pop psychologists, so-called women's
health experts and, of course, women's magazine writers have tackled this
question in recent years, most with less-than-; illuminating insights.
Typically, these authorities wind up pointing an accusing finger at women's
liberation itself. Women have applied the feminist tenets of control and
mastery to their own bodies, they charge, and with devastating results. An
anorexic, they say, is an autonomous woman gone haywire.;    The more
psychoanalytically inclined look to the family for answers. They blame that
whipping girl of long-standing: Mom. It must be the pressures to please a
never-satisfied maternal figure that have turned the overachieving daughter
against her own flesh.;    Still others charge that the baby boom ethic is
behind the epidemic in eating disorders and the mania for liposuction and
breast implants. The Me Generation woman wants it all, they sniff, thin hips
and big breasts. She is greedy and so she binges and purges, literally having
her cake and eating it, too.;     In "The Beauty Myth," <PERSON>Naomi Wolf</PERSON> rejects
these explanations, and their tendency to assign responsibility to the
individual woman in isolation, and opts for a refreshingly political and
social analysis. Women are increasingly obsessed with perfecting their bodies,
she argues, not because they are overly feminist or self-indulgent but because
they have been subjected to a feminist-fearing and anything-but-indulgent
culture that has raised the stakes in the beauty market to an unbearable high.
American culture demands that women attain an aesthetic standard that is
virtually inhuman, and it offers, as a means of reaching its impossible goal,
tools that are increasingly painful, destructive and even deadly.;     The new
ideal, or "beauty myth," <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> says, has arisen as a way of keeping the newly
independent woman down. "For every feminist action there is an equal and
opposite beauty myth reaction," <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> writes. "The fixation on 'beauty' of the
<DATE>1980s</DATE> was a direct consequence of, and a one-to-one check and balance upon,
the entry of women into powerful positions." It advises women, as she aptly
recasts the old saw: "You are now too rich. Therefore, you cannot be too
thin.";    <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> puts forward a set of disturbing, some by now
all-too-familiar, statistics on the ravages of this modern beauty fixation:
the reports that as many as one in five college women are anorexic or bulimic;
the studies that show breast implants have blocked the detection of cancer and
so facilitated its spread; the findings that liquid fast diets have led to 60
deaths and that liposuction operations have caused at least 14. As <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>
rightly points out, even more appalling than the toll of the beauty myth is
society's -- and journalism's -- willingness to turn a blind eye to it, to
trivialize its origins as "vanity" and to promote its ends as "liberation."
The press, in particular, so often seems more interested in pimping for the
beauty industry than exposing its unattractive effects.;     The analysis that
Wolf offers, presented properly, might have provided much-needed fodder in
women's battle for equal status and self-respect. But <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>, in her zeal to
make her case, grossly overstates it. She equates anorexics with AIDS victims
and Holocaust survivors. She claims that women's preoccupation with beauty has
"functionally supplanted" religion and become "a new fundamentalism
transforming the secular West, repressive and doctrinaire as any <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION>
counterpart." She asserts -- with little evidence -- that a "professional
beauty qualification" (or "the PBQ," as she irritatingly calls it) has been
"widely institutionalized as a condition for women's hiring and promotion" and
even "surgical alteration has become a requirement for women's employment and
promotion.";    She asserts baldly: "Since <DATE>1971</DATE>, the law has recognized that a
standard of perfection against which a woman's body is to be judged may exist
in the workplace, and that if she falls short of it she may be fired." To
document this last claim, she plucks a few court rulings from the record and
conveniently ignores the many legal decisions that went the other way. She
invokes <ORGANIZATION>Hopkins vs. Price Waterhouse</ORGANIZATION>, in which a female accountant denied
partnership was told she should have worn daintier dresses and more makeup.
But <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> fails to mention that the ruling against <PERSON>Hopkins</PERSON> was overturned on
appeal.;    <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> graduate who is now earning a doctorate as a <ORGANIZATION>Rhodes
Scholar</ORGANIZATION>, charges that "male-dominated institutions" (or, even more vaguely,
"the powerful") have consciously hatched the beauty-myth plot just to check
feminist advances. It seems more likely that the beauty industry's captains
are driven, first and foremost, by the desire to make money off women; the
wish to halt women's independence is a secondary, and largely subconscious,
aspect of that capitalist intent.;    Her analysis would have been both more
penetrating and persuasive if she had dropped the conspiratorial accusations
and explored instead the ways in which beauty marketers act out of a complex
set of motives, rooted in economic ambition, cultural anxieties, fears and
fantasies about women that beauty's architects barely understand themselves.; 
  <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>'s identification of the beauty myth as the "only" remaining social
battering ram against liberated women is less than convincing, too. What of
the anti-abortion movement, or the corporate invention of "fetal protection
policies" that keep women out of the workforce, or <PERSON>Madison Avenue</PERSON>'s promotion
of "the mommy track" and the "New Traditional Woman," or the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>'s
devastating rollbacks in anti-discrimination legal protections? Surely, more
than a mirror stands between women and authentic equality today.  </TEXT>

INCONVENIENTLY PRETTY NAOMI WOLF IS NOW A FREQUENT
MASS MEDIA SPOKESMOUTH AGAINST SOCIETY'S PERVERSE
IMAGES OF FEMALE BEAUTY
LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING, SAYS NAOMI WOLF. THEY'RE
JUST THE STRONGEST WEAPONS SOCIETY HAS TO KEEP
WOMEN OUT OF POWER AND IN THEIR PLACE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's the kind of neighborly note, from a fellow West Sider -- signed "<PERSON>Yoko
Ono</PERSON>" -- that balances the nasty letter-plus-pornography Wolf just received in
the mail.;   Above the tank in <LOCATION>Wolf</LOCATION>'s cramped <LOCATION>West Side</LOCATION> bathroom are such
common aids to good grooming as <ORGANIZATION>Nexus Polymeric Styling Gel</ORGANIZATION>, Lubriderm lotion
and <ORGANIZATION>Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque</ORGANIZATION>. Modest obstacles to <ORGANIZATION>Nature</ORGANIZATION>'s completely
having its way with her body.;   They're the kind of toiletries that balance
the media insinuation that Wolf -- who does occasionally wear makeup -- is an
anti-beauty fanatic.;   And let's not forget above the thighs. Just above the
thighs on <ORGANIZATION>Wolf</ORGANIZATION>'s decidedly uncramped figure hang a pair of flimsy see-through
orange harem pants, scarcely obscuring black panties, signaling the
interviewer (he steadfastly believes) that if he shows the slightest sign of
noticing, he's dead sexist meat.;   They're the kind of pants, on a sweltering
<LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> <DATE>summer</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, guaranteed to set one thinking about hidebound
assumptions.;   So how to describe Wolf? "Beautician" doesn't quite capture
her, even if she does like to go into the beauty parlance at a moment's
notice. "Aesthetician" doesn't catch her either, though, like <PERSON>Byron</PERSON>'s lovely,
she walks in beauty (not to mention those pants) and likes a fight.;   No,
this inconveniently pretty 28-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Rhodes Scholar</ORGANIZATION> and Yale-educated
populist, suddenly a frequent mass media spokesmouth ("20/20," "The Oprah
Winfrey Show") against society's perverse images of female beauty, has created
her own category.;   Call her the Beauty Marx.;   "I didn't write this book so
you can sit there having a 'good read,' " she says with a laugh -- or was that
a sneer? -- hunched on a couch in her functional digs near <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Center</ORGANIZATION>. "I
wrote it to enact social change.";   Of course. And if <PERSON>Karl Marx</PERSON> were still
functioning, he'd agree that the first step toward changing the world these
days is to alter the best-seller list by getting on it. Wolf pulled that some
few months after her stint of indefatigable publicity and promotion began:
"The Beauty Myth" grabbed the bottom rung of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> non-fiction
best-seller list.;   And scores of media encounters and debates with originals
from <PERSON>Betty Friedan</PERSON> to Screw publisher <PERSON>Al Goldstein</PERSON> haven't changed this Oxford
doctoral candidate's mind.;   "Yes, there's been a change in my thinking,"
<PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> says about her tour for the book, her mischievous smile suggesting a
surprise is coming. "The change is that what I had hypothesized I now believe
more strongly than ever. I'm more certain that I'm right.";   Her book's basic
idea, expressed in the opening chapter, is that "we are in the midst of a
violent backlash against feminism that uses images of female beauty as a
political weapon against women's advancement.";   In <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>'s view, the beauty
myth is a "social reflex" necessary to control women who, released by feminism
from earlier mystiques of "motherhood, domesticity, chastity and passivity,"
threaten the values of the dominant culture. Sometimes consciously, but more
often not, male-dominated culture has bombarded us with innumerable images by
which the "gaunt youthful model" can supplant the "happy housewife as the
arbiter of successful womanhood.";   In doing so, it sentences contemporary
women, and not just those in "display" occupations such as models, to a "third
shift." On top of paid work and housework, the modern woman must take on
"beauty maintenance" in a probably unattainable quest to reach an unnatural
standard of beauty.;   The beauty trap;   As <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> describes them, "the <MONEY>$33
billion-a-year</MONEY> diet industry, the <MONEY>$20 billion</MONEY> cosmetics industry, the <MONEY>$300
million</MONEY> cosmetic-surgery industry and the <MONEY>$7 billion</MONEY> pornography industry,"
play a powerful role in creating this "collective reactionary hallucination."
So do mass media, with advertising-dominated women's magazines the worst
offenders.;   One result is the enormous rise Wolf reports in anorexia and
bulimia. Wolf was anorexic as a 13-year-old in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, though she says
her catalyst for writing the book was "being an adult and having to struggle
to be taken seriously because I had long hair.";   In arguing for her thesis,
<PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> supplies plenty of bite-size facts, often rapidly strung together, but
usually supported by footnotes. Some "33,000 American women told researchers
that they would rather lose 10 to 15 pounds than achieve any other goal." The
average weight of fashion models recently "plummeted to <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> below that
of ordinary women." Every year, 150,000 American women die of anorexia.;  
Along the way, she bluntly describes the ugly mutilations endured for the
beauty myth -- stomach-stapling, breast implants, jaw-wiring. She draws sharp
analogies between traditional religion and the diet and cosmetic gospels, and
urges women to permit one another greater freedom to reject the myth's
pressures.;   <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>'s mix of fact and argument, called a "cultural hand
grenade" in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, has won kudos from many feminists. <PERSON>Germaine Greer</PERSON>
cheekily called "The Beauty Myth" "the most important feminist publication
since 'The Female Eunuch' " -- her own career-making study. Wolf, true to her
principles, grew so outraged after British reviewers "fetishized" her jacket
photo -- paying it excessive attention under what she terms the old "bimbo or
hag" criterion applied to feminists -- that she refused to OK a photo on the
American edition from <LOCATION>William Morrow.</LOCATION>;   On the other hand, no less than <PERSON>Betty
Friedan</PERSON>, author of "The Feminine Mystique," called the book an "obsolete
rehash," disparaging <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> for portraying women as overly passive. Critics have
faulted <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> for contending that dominant male institutions "intentionally
conspire" to oppress women with ideals of beauty. They've said she exaggerated
too much, extrapolated too much from her own experience, drew a tasteless link
between Holocaust victims and the anorexic, and allowed big sociological
explanations to blind her to the importance of individual choice and
responsibility.;   Dueling words;   <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>, already planning a book on female
sexuality, welcomes the chance to rebut criticisms. After three years of
studying women's history at <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION>, and another three in <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wolf</LOCATION>
plainly relishes philosophical argument as much as any Oxbridge debater. She
responds smartly and cannily to questions about the book.;   <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> points out
that anyone who accuses her of "conspiracy theory" is a sloppy reader, because
she states in the book that the Beauty Myth is "not a conspiracy theory" and
needn't be. She simply believes in systemic, sociological "invisible hand"
analyses, and repeatedly sidesteps the opportunity to blame anyone in
particular for the Beauty Myth, whether it be a <ORGANIZATION>Revlon</ORGANIZATION> executive, <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> model
or actress.;   "<PERSON>Jane Fonda</PERSON>," she cracks, "is not the issue.";   Similarly, she
points out that her analogy to Holocaust victims is narrowly drawn, a physical
rather than experiential comparison. To the charge of exaggeration, she
replies that she often earns the right, through sustained argument, to a claim
such as, "To be anorexic or bulimic is to be a political prisoner.";   Perhaps
most important, she pooh-poohs the idea that for <PERSON>Naomi Wolf</PERSON>, a thing of beauty
is a pain forever. She stresses that "seeing beautiful women isn't the
problem. It's seeing beautiful women in the absence of any other kind of
representation.";   "If Time magazine couldn't show <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> because
Minoxidil was a major advertiser," she cheerily remarks, "if your only role
models were fashion models, you would be very vulnerable to conforming to what
the Nautilus man looks like.";   Ah, men. The sudden introduction of the
species leads one to ask whether her boyfriend, an editor at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
newspaper, can get away with telling her that he hates what she's wearing.
Wolf laughs, but notes, "Going out with me is a challenge. . . . I'm always
trying to be aware of gender patterns in the relationship.";   No, she doesn't
lack a sense of humor. But neither does she think she's required to have one
on the subject of her book. "Yes, I'm very angry," she says, "because I almost
died of the Beauty Myth." She finds it "astonishing" that people aren't more
angry that "their daughters are at risk from the same thing.";   "Women are
dying of understatement," she says. "I know an eating disorder is crippling.
Listen to the word we use, 'disorder.' It's such a tiny thing -- just
something slightly out of order.";   There's unquestionably a graduate-student
cockiness to <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>'s take on the world. Every piece of data thrown up to her
somehow "confirms," or "proves," or "corroborates" her thesis.;   In the case
of tough-on-feminism scholar <PERSON>Camille Paglia</PERSON> ("A terrible moral cowardice") and
<PERSON>Madonna</PERSON>'s supposed power over her career ("A placebo for real power"), <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON>'s
tolerance proves only skin deep.;   "There's two things <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> can't do,"
<PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> says coolly. "She can't age. And she can't take off her makeup."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Changed Miss America Pageant Aims at Renewed Vigor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new director of the <ORGANIZATION>Miss America
Pageant</ORGANIZATION> says there will be so many changes in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s production
that he fears raised eyebrows among fans of the 67-year-old
tradition.
   But before anyone gasps, <PERSON>Leonard Horn</PERSON> is quick to point out that
the swimsuit competition is still in place _ even though he
believes there may be other means of proving a young woman's
fitness.
   The winner still will take her stroll down the runway, a much
longer runway this time, to the tune of ``There She Is.''
   And the show still will feature an elaborate stage production,
but new musical director <PERSON>Donald Pippin</PERSON> has created a livelier tempo
that's not quite rock 'n' roll but just as spirited.
   Horn is more concerned about the long-time supporters of the
pageant who bought seats even in the lean years when it was
weathering attacks from feminists. Some of those supporters have
unhappily learned they've been bumped from their box seats to make
room for bigwigs representing the eight corporate sponsors and even
some high-rollers from <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> casinos.
   Horn also knocked out a production number and replaced it with
video segments showing the finalists being interviewed by the
judges. He eliminated a prepared speech each inalist gave in the
evening gown competition in favor of asking the women unrehearsed
questions.
   ``It won't be a cutesy question,'' he said. ``It will be
sufficiently provocative to elicit an intelligent response which
might give us further insight into her ability to articulate under
pressure.''
   The changes were necessary to keep the pageant up to date and
attract the younger, female audience that had stopped watching the
show in recent years, <PERSON>Horn</PERSON> said.
   ``Some people believe the pageant has gotten stale,'' said <PERSON>Horn</PERSON>,
who took over when <PERSON>Albert Marks</PERSON> retired <DATE>last year after 37 years</DATE>.
   ``All we're trying to do is give it the vigor it once had ...
and reconfirm that it's a positive program that deserves people's
respect.''
   For the 51 contestants, from the states and the <ORGANIZATION>District of
Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, a week of pageantry and preliminary competitions lead to
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>'s nationally televised finale.
   Reaching <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> has been a rocky trip for some
contestants.
   In th <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, the entire pageant was restaged
after national pageant officials found problems with the judging.
The original winner, <PERSON>Edwina Richard</PERSON>, became first runner-up and has
said, ``I feel like I became a victim.''
   In <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, the winner, <PERSON>Frances Frazier</PERSON>, has denied accusations
she was promised the crown when she was a runner-up the year
before. Earlier this year, a former <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> pageant board member
wrote to national officials saying she had firsthand knowledge that
blacks were not being given a fair shot at the crown.
   Miss <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> not only had to watch in dismay as a defeated
contestant loudly denounced the pageant but also had to respond to
rumors she suffers from anorexia nervosa, the eating disorder.
   In the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> state pageant, some contestants grumbled that
one of the judges was acquainted with the winner.
   About 80,000 young women enter local contests that lead to the
<ORGANIZATION>Miss America Pageant</ORGANIZATION>. More than <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> in cash and tuition
scholarships is available this year. Miss <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> receives at least
a <MONEY>$30,000</MONEY> scholarship and the income from a year of personal
appearances.
   <PERSON>Gary Collins</PERSON> will serve as host of the two-hour special for the
seventh year. His wife, <DATE>1959</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Miss America Mary Ann Mobley</ORGANIZATION>, will be
co-host. The show airs live on NBC-TV at <TIME>10 p.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   Performances in the talent category this year will be mainly
singing, dancing and playing musical instruments. But there will
also be belly dancing, an Irish dance and a gymnastics act.
   This year's <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Kaye Lani Rae Rafko</PERSON>, won her title in
part by performing a Hawaiian-Tahitian dance in a hot-pink costume
with a bare midriff.
   Following preliminary competitions and interviews with the
judges, the top 10 finishers will compete for the title before a TV
audience estimated at 70 million viewers.
   Judging the finalists will be <PERSON>Richard Dysart</PERSON> and <PERSON>Blair Underwood</PERSON>
of television's ``<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Law''; <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON>Deborah
Norville</PERSON>; <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION> <DATE>1971</DATE> and broadcaster <PERSON>Phyllis George</PERSON>; actor
<PERSON>George Peppard</PERSON>; actress <PERSON>Eva Gabor</PERSON>; columnist <PERSON>Dr. Joyce Brothers</PERSON>;
Olympic ice skating gold medalist <PERSON>Brian Boitano</PERSON>; movie producer
<PERSON>Lili Fini Zanuck</PERSON>; model agency founder <PERSON>Eileen Ford</PERSON>; Parade magazine
publisher <PERSON>Walter Anderson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>William Farley</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Farley
Industries</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Slain Beatle Portrayed as Reclusive, Anorexic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> spent much of a three-year span
tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position
with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to
a biography of the slain Beatle.
   An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON>'' by
journalist and biographer <PERSON>Albert Goldman</PERSON>, appearing in the <DATE>Aug. 15</DATE>
issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering
portrait of both <PERSON>Lennon</PERSON> and his second wife, <PERSON>Yoko Ono</PERSON>.
   The book is scheduled to be published later this month by
<ORGANIZATION>William Morrow &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>. Inc.
   Between <DATE>1976</DATE> and <DATE>1979</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> writes, <PERSON>Lennon</PERSON> ``could not be
more remote.''
   Apart from a few hours in the <TIME>morning and evening</TIME>, including
time spent with his son, <PERSON>Sean</PERSON>, ``<PERSON>Lennon</PERSON> is back here in his room,
alone and silent.''
   The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life
as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as
perfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to <DATE>1965</DATE>,
<ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat
Beatle.' ''
   ``That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the
wound has never healed.''
   Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless
slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
   The 719-page biography also details <PERSON>Yoko Ono</PERSON>'s <MONEY>$5,000-a-week</MONEY>
heroin habit in <DATE>1979</DATE>. She reportedly snorted the drug.
   According to the book, <PERSON>Lennon</PERSON> also took heroin and consumed a
great deal of LSD.
   ``I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes <PERSON>Lennon</PERSON>
as saying. ``I just ate it all the time like candy.''
   Goldman spent more than six years researching the book,
interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of <PERSON>Lennon</PERSON>, who
was murdered eight years ago in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.

   Every time she lifted her legs to step over a curb, <PERSON>Lois Deville</PERSON> grimaced with the pain of her shinsplints. 

   The Miamian, in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> on business, was frantic over missing her daily aerobics classes. 
To compensate, she paced the streets for hours, even though the pain was so excruciating she couldn't put a sheet on her legs at night. 

   Back home, a month later, a stress fracture abruptly halted <PERSON>Ms. Deville</PERSON>'s working, walking, running and aerobics classes. 
One night, she sat outside the aerobics studio near her home, crying as she watched others dance. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Deville</PERSON> was an exercise addict, unable to stop running and doing aerobics even when it hurt. 
Now in therapy for her problem and holding her aerobics classes to three times a week, she ruefully recalls the recent past: "What kept me going was the panic of weight gain and facing what {else} I would do with my day." 

   A feeling of worthlessness, loneliness and a history of family problems drove <PERSON>Ms. Deville</PERSON> to her abuse of exercise, she says. 
She was far from alone. 
A national love affair with fitness -- combined with the same psychological problems that cause the eating disorders of anorexia and bulimia -- has spawned a growing health problem: obsessive, addictive exercise. 

   Doctors and psychotherapists aren't concerned with the millions of healthy Americans who insist on going to aerobics classes or the running track a few times a week. 
They are worried about the growing number of exercisers who are taking anti-inflammatory drugs to mask serious injuries and who are sacrificing their family lives and their jobs to the pursuit of impossible physical goals. 

   These concerned doctors know that the stress fractures or shinsplints or tendinitis commonly incurred by obsessed joggers and aerobic dancers can persist for a lifetime. 
For women, additionally, the loss of body fat induced by too much exercise can lead to amenorrhea, or the loss of monthly menstrual periods. 
The long-term consequences of amenorrhea on female organs and general health isn't known, doctors say. 

   Exercise compulsion is a burgeoning problem among upper- and middle-class professionals, who abuse socially acceptable exercise as others abuse drugs, food or alcohol. 
Many are seeking the "high" that prolonged exercise can produce, and many report the same kind of withdrawal symptoms when they don't exercise as alcoholics and drug addicts do when they stop drinking and taking drugs: depression, nervousness and insomnia. 

   But many of these obsessed exercisers don't see the parallels with addictions to mood-altering substances. 
"These are people who wouldn't think of getting loaded in bars or copping drugs on the street," says <PERSON>Doris Denmark Zachary</PERSON>, a clinical psychotherapist and a director at the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Counseling Services</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Plantation</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. 
"Exercise is the way they cope with conflicts inside themselves." 

   How many exercise addicts there are isn't known. 
Medical experts, however, report that between <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of serious exercisers are potentially problem exercisers. 
"If you run more than three miles a day four times a week, you do it for something other than fitness," says aerobics guru <PERSON>Kenneth Cooper</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Aerobics Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. 
And medical doctors have found that men who run more than 45 miles a week show abnormally high levels of stress hormones as well as increased orthopedic injuries. 

   Doctors have recognized addiction in joggers for some time. 
One medical writer once suggested in jest that jogging shoes carry a warning label much the way cigarettes do. 
But doctors and psychotherapists report the problem is growing -- especially among women. 
Women today "want to feel stronger and more independent and competitive," says <PERSON>Robert Goldman</PERSON>, director of sports research at the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine</ORGANIZATION> and an adviser of many world-class women body-builders. 
That's fine, he says, but some women are just taking it too far. (On the plus side, counselors report that women exercise addicts are more likely to seek treatment than their male counterparts.) 

   The near-universal belief in the benefits of exercise makes exercise addiction tough to stop and to detect. 
The addict can rationalize that "the neighbor next door runs, and the woman across the street goes to aerobics, too," says <PERSON>Kathy Bowen-Woodward</PERSON>, clinical director at the <ORGANIZATION>Renfrew Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, a treatment facility for eating disorders and addiction to exercise. 
"It's not easy to recognize when you're into it." 

   Furthermore, many corporations may be unwittingly contributing to their employees' addiction by providing benefits such as health-club fee reimbursments and in-house fitness centers. 
But some have begun to recognize the potential for problems. 

   "We have people who are in here three times a day," says <PERSON>Max Morton</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>Adolph Coors Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Wellness Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
He tells <ORGANIZATION>Coors</ORGANIZATION> employees who exercise more than an hour and a half a day that they need to examine why they are doing it. 
"We're certainly trying to steer them to a more moderate approach," he says. 

   Experts make a distinction between obsessive exercisers and those who are training for real athletic goals, such as professional athletes and those preparing for an occasional marathon. 
The obsessive exerciser often has no concrete athletic goals, says <PERSON>John Durkin</PERSON>, manager of the fitness center for <ORGANIZATION>Mesa Limited Partnership</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Amarillo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. 
"There's just something they're trying to destroy or run away from," he says. 

   Consider <PERSON>Eric Bolton</PERSON>. 
Now a 30-year-old senior manager at a <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> real-estate firm, <PERSON>Mr. Bolton</PERSON> says that a few years ago he was "absolutely obsessed" with running, logging as much as 100 miles a week. 
He cut out evening activities and got up at <TIME>4:30 a.m.</TIME> to run, often wrapping elastic bandages around his knees to reduce the pain in his aching joints. 
He was sleepy by two or three o'clock in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>. 
An auditor at the time, he says his reviews took longer and were less thorough as his running took over his life. 
"I wouldn't let anything interfere with my running," he says. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Bolton</PERSON> ran because of frustration with a bad marriage, he concludes now. 
But he didn't realize he was obsessed, he says, until he moved away from his wife, got a new job and suddenly, "I found that running wasn't that important anymore." 
Hearing about other obsessive exercisers made him recognize his own symptoms, he says. 

   Betty, a 44-year-old housewife, also became obsessed with exercise for family reasons. 
From childhood, she says, she was expected to settle family arguments, please her parents and quietly handle her own problems. 
Now she also tries to make a perfect home for her own family. 
"I am the pleaser, the good little girl," she says. 

   Once anorexic -- dropping to 74 pounds at one time -- she turned to exercise a couple of years ago, running as much as 100 miles a week. 
"My husband was frantic -- I was gone two hours a day," she says. 
In the past year, with the support of her husband, she started both individual and group therapy. 
She has cut down on her running, but her compulsion is still evident; now she often finds herself frantically dancing to music while ironing, vacuuming and mopping. 

   Another self-described good little girl is <PERSON>Alexandra Gordon</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> stockbroker. 
Struggling to be perfect, she says, she exercised constantly to control her weight. 
But eventually she wouldn't even enjoy a day on the beach with her fiance because she would miss her aerobics and weightlifting sessions. 
Finally, he broke their engagement, took her ring back and demanded that she get help if she wanted to repair the relationship. 
She is now in counseling with <PERSON>Ms. Zachary</PERSON>. 

   Counselors say that one factor in exercise addiction is control. 
"When they can't control what else is going on in their lives, they can control what they eat" and how much they exercise, says <PERSON>Shelly Wartman</PERSON>, who counsels young women with eating and exercise disorders at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Center for Counseling Services</ORGANIZATION>. 

   But, often, says her colleague <PERSON>Susan Cossack</PERSON>, exercise begins to run their lives. 
"Then they lose control and have no options whatsoever." 

   Frequently, what frantic exercisers need is better relationships with people, says <PERSON>Dr. Bowen-Woodward</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Renfrew Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
Single professionals come home to an empty house, and they can't wait to hit the streets or dive in the pool. 
Emily, 38, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> real-estate saleswoman whose divorced parents sent her to boarding school when she was seven, swims at least twice a day and walks for hours. 
Emily has never had a boyfriend and has few friends. 
"Walking keeps me from getting lonely," she says. 

   <PERSON>William Glasser</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> psychiatrist, thinks that exercise gives some "a way to avoid the social ramble" and the potential failure of finding friends. 
If the exercise addicts are exercising all their free hours away, the doctor says, "it eliminates the chance to satisfy the need for love and affection." 

   Doctors generally agree that a sure sign that a person is addicted to exercise is when he does it in spite of injuries. 
But not all doctors are inclined to confront exercise addicts with their problem. 
Betty, the housewife, says that when she was told by her doctor that her back and leg injuries were too severe to keep running, "I found a doctor who said he would keep me on the road." 
And <PERSON>Ms. Gordon</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> stockbroker, found a doctor who would prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs to keep down the pains in her ankles and knees so nothing would stop her exercise routine. 

   Some doctors and sports professionals maintain that the line between healthy and obsessive exercise is too fine to separate addicts from average exercisers. 
<PERSON>William P. Morgan</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION> sports psychologist, says he quit studying exercise addiction because it involved too many value judgments. 
And even those exercisers who know the problem firsthand aren't inclined to intervene in the lives of others with apparently obsessive behavior. 

   Shannon, an exercise addict and a nurse at a <LOCATION>South Florida</LOCATION> hospital, says she sees people at her health club who she thinks are addicted to exercise, but she then looks the other way. 
"You can't approach them," she says. 
"They just think you're jealous."

<TEXT>
<P>
Weil's life was, by her own choice, brief. On its outlines, <PERSON>Gabriella Fiori</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>David McLellan</PERSON> agree. She was born in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1909</DATE> to nonpracticing Jews, a 
"gentle, self-effacing" doctor, in <PERSON>McLellan</PERSON>'s words, and his "assertive," 
"indefatigable" yet "articulate, persuasive and charming" wife, whose father 
had prevented her from studying medicine. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Selma Weil</PERSON>, preferring her son, <PERSON>Andre</PERSON>, encouraged her daughter to be manly and 
forthright even at the risk of appearing rude. Both biographers reveal the 
young <PERSON>Weil</PERSON> as sickly, obstinate, disgusted by physical touch, devoted to but 
competitive with her older brother. 
</P>
<P>
Like Andre, she was highly educated, receiving a degree in philosophy from the 
<ORGANIZATION>Ecole Normale Superieure</ORGANIZATION>. In spite of devastating migraine headaches and 
generally poor health, she then taught for several years. She also became 
involved with trade unions, wrote articles for syndicalist publications and 
held menial jobs in several factories, the better to understand workers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
Her activist inclinations led her to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> during the Civil War, but within 
days of joining the anarchist militia there -- with an ineptitude that 
characterized her physical life in general -- she stepped into a pot of boiling 
oil and burned herself so badly that her parents (who dogged her wanderings and 
rescued her from more than one disaster) took her back to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Upon the occupation of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in <DATE>1940</DATE>, the three went to <LOCATION>Marseilles</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Weil</PERSON> 
continued her writing, found agricultural work and deepened the spiritual quest 
that had gradually superseded her political activism. After a short, unhappy 
stay in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE>, she left her parents behind to join the Free 
French in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusioned and chagrined that no one had found her "any useful work that 
involved a high degree of hardship and danger," she stepped up the 
self-starvation she had practiced to some degree all her life, and by the end 
of <DATE>August, 1943</DATE>, she was dead -- still unbaptized -- despite her profession of 
faith "in God, in the <LOCATION>Trinity</LOCATION>, in the incarnation, in the redemption, in the 
<LOCATION>Eucharist</LOCATION>, in the teachings of the Gospel" -- because of her resistance to the 
institutional church. 
</P>
<P>
Into this biographical framework, both <PERSON>McLellan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fiori</PERSON> weave summaries of 
<ORGANIZATION>Weil</ORGANIZATION>'s rigorously intellectual reflections in the form of letters, articles and 
books, many of which were not published until well after her death. McLellan is 
the more successful at this task. His presentation, although plodding, is lucid 
and substantial, as his synopsis of <PERSON>Weil</PERSON>'s favorite themes reflects: "her 
biting criticism of the view of history as progress; her antipathy to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>; her admiration for the Greeks; the mistaken dominance given to science 
in contemporary society; her strong connection of art and literature with moral 
values; the centrality accorded to physical labour; her unwillingness to 
consider political institutions, however democratic, as the main legitimizers 
of the distribution of power; her awareness of the danger of all collective 
activity; her insistence that genuine liberty and equality could only be 
founded by reference to other worldly values." 
</P>
<P>
Fiori's approach, less conventionally academic, promises to be lively and 
inventive: Basing her work solely "on evidence provided by people who knew her 
and upon her works," she intends "a biography . . . designed as a mosaic 
reconstruction or, even better, an organism of living cells." Unfortunately, 
thanks to shifts in tense and point of view, overblown rhetoric and 
typographical oddities, the result is more of a mishmash, for which author, 
translator and editor all must bear responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a simple statement that <PERSON>Weil</PERSON> rejected the idea of marriage, for 
instance, <PERSON>Fiori</PERSON> is translated as saying, "As far as the idea of love codified 
in marriage, associated somehow with feminine attraction, dates, clothes, the 
signals and messages of use and wont, she perhaps never paused there at all." 
If a clear sense of <PERSON>Weil</PERSON>'s being fails to emerge through <PERSON>McLellan</PERSON>'s dutiful but 
dull prose, it fares no better in <LOCATION>Fiori</LOCATION>'s meandering verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
And for some reason, the life that lies at the heart of any biography, even an 
"intellectual" one, never does quite animate either book. Perhaps the 
difficulty is that neither confronts <PERSON>Weil</PERSON>'s anomalous existence as a creature, 
and specifically a female creature, struggling against incarnation. As the 
subtitle and structure of <PERSON>McLellan</PERSON>'s book suggest, he views "thought" as 
separable from, and even preferable to, "life"; and, except to report her 
always disheveled appearance and her crippling headaches, he ignores her bodily 
experience almost entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, at the very end, he notes that "hunger and nourishment are the 
dominant metaphors in her writings," only in order to deny that she was 
anorexic. In view of her death, her anorexia is incontestable, however, 
although it appears to have been not the anorexia nervosa prevalent today but 
rather perhaps the anorexia mirabilis of certain medieval female mystics. By 
inexplicably passing over the dominant metaphors in her writings, <PERSON>McLellan</PERSON> has 
failed to connect the bodies of the woman and the work. 
</P>
<P>
Fiori shows herself more sensitive to such connections, affirming that, "In 
reality, there was no split between the substance and the appearance of this 
young woman" and dubbing her, with infelicity but good will, "a genius-woman." 
Her essentialist understanding of "woman" is revealed, however, when she refers 
to <PERSON>Weil</PERSON>'s "feminine sensibility which more easily grasped the concrete detail 
apt to overthrow the useless abstraction." "I am not a feminist," <PERSON>Fiori</PERSON> quotes 
<PERSON>Weil</PERSON>, and apparently she perceives this statement as excusing her from a 
feminist reading, which might have provided the focus her project lacks and 
enlivened her exploration of <ORGANIZATION>Weil</ORGANIZATION>'s genuinely mysterious life. 
</P>
<P>
The reader who wants a coherent, workmanlike introduction to that life would do 
well to choose "Utopian Pessimist" over "<PERSON>Simone Weil</PERSON>." Better yet, however, now 
that much of <PERSON>Simone Weil</PERSON>'s own work has been translated, read some of that: 
"The Need for Roots," perhaps, or "Waiting for God." It will be worth the 
struggle.

<HEAD>Scientist: Pigs That `Pig Out' Produce Leaner Meat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An experimental drug that erodes a pig's
natural defense against ``pigging out'' may be the key to producing
leaner pork, a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> scientist says.
   ``Ordinarily, pigs know when they are full and don't really pig
out,'' said <PERSON>Jerome C. Pekas</PERSON>, an animal physiologist at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Meat Animal Research Center</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Clay Center</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pigs' aversion to stuffing their snouts is due to a naturally
produced hormone that tells them when to lay off the feed, he said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION>, where he
was attending the 72nd annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American
Societies for Experimental Biology</ORGANIZATION>.
   An initial study found pigs ate more but put on leaner tissue
when injected with a compound that immunizes them against the
hormone cholecystokinin, or <ORGANIZATION>CCK</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The pigs `thought' they were hungry so they ate more,'' <PERSON>Pekas</PERSON>
said.
   A pig's immune system treats the compound _ a harmless decoy _
as a foreign invader by developing antibodies to it, he said.
   Pekas conducted the study in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> with animal physiologists
<PERSON>Bruce D. Schanbacher</PERSON> and <PERSON>William E. Trout</PERSON>. Pekas said he has
researched appetite regulation and feeding of swine since <DATE>1981</DATE>. The
latest study began in the <DATE>fall of 1986</DATE>.
   ``This is pretty brand-spanking new stuff we are talking about
here. This is the first public disclosure,'' <PERSON>Pekas</PERSON> said.
   The 12 leaner pigs in the test group consumed an average of 22.5
pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more during the 82-day
treatment period compared to the 12 control pigs, he said.
   The scientists injected the pigs first at 11 weeks and later
gave three booster shots, but Pekas believes only one booster may
eventually be used.
   ``Pigs that got the special injection continue to use feed
efficiently, digest extra feed and go to the feed trough more often
than pigs in the control group,'' he said.
   Pekas said researchers were somewhat surprised and don't really
understand why the meat on pigs receiving the compound was leaner.
He added that more research was needed to determine if the drug was
the cause.
   ``I was impressed myself that the meat grows leaner. I'd be
almost inclined to say that was unexpected. I would have been
content to have observed that the animals were eating more feed and
gaining more weight,'' he said.
   Physiologists first recognized CCK as a hormone that causes the
gall bladder in humans and animals to contract, <PERSON>Pekas</PERSON> said. Its
possible effect on appetite regulation became known within the <DATE>last
10 years</DATE>. He said technology for using the new compound could be
available within a year, but the <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> would have to clear its use.
   Pekas said he envisions the hormone being further studied in
human medicine to treat problems caused by low appetite such as
anorexia nervosa or insatiable appetite such as obesity.
   <PERSON>Charles Harness</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>National Pork Producers
Council</ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, said he was not familiar with
the study but confirmed much research is being conducted to produce
leaner products.
   <PERSON>Mike Sondag</PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Pork
Producers Association</ORGANIZATION>, also said he was aware of efforts to make
pork leaner, but was not familiar with the latest study.
   ``Several years ago that was our campaign theme, `<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> you're
leaning on pork,''' <PERSON>Sondag</PERSON> said.
   ``You look at today's hog versus the one back in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> or
<DATE>1960s</DATE> and there is a tremendous difference in the composition and
actual appearance of the pigs. There is significantly less fat than
there used to be. We say pork is <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> leaner than it was 25
years ago.''

Question: When it comes to eating disorders, I don't see why the patients are 
almost always women and seldom men. What can there possibly be about food that 
would make women more likely to have a problem with it than men? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A number of men may undergo strenuous dieting for sports-related 
reasons, but this unusual concern does not bring them to the attention of a 
physician in the same fashion that women would be if they also were extremely 
concerned about their weight. For example, young men who participate in 
wrestling often show a yo-yo pattern of dieting, alternating weight loss with 
weight gain. This can have harmful effects, but the individual involved does 
not seek medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the apparent disparity in the incidence of eating disorders 
between men and women is that symptoms that may identify women as having an 
eating disorder do not apply to men. For example, cessation of menstruation, 
which helps diagnose an eating disorder in women, cannot be used to diagnose an 
eating disorder in men.

<TEXT>
   Scientists at <ORGANIZATION>Merck &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> are developing a group of drugs that hold promise for treating eating disorders and obesity. 

   The drugs, being tested in laboratory animals, are years away from commercial use. 
They interact with a natural protein in the brain that regulates the body's sense of hunger. 
The protein, called cholecystokinin, or CCK, was discovered in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
Its release by the brain shuts off nerve signals that initiate the desire to eat. 
Only recently have Merck chemists discovered drugs that can manipulate CCK. 

   A number of drug makers around the world are racing to develop medicines that affect hunger by interacting with several neurotransmitters, brain proteins that carry signals through the nervous system. 
<ORGANIZATION>Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> is testing its anti-depressant drug Prozac against obesity because of its involvement with one neurotransmitter called serotonin. 
Merck is the first company to develop drugs affecting CCK. 

   In a study released in today's Science magazine, <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> researchers at the company's laboratories in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> report that two Merck drugs stimulated the eating desire of laboratory rats. 
The drugs are so-called CCK antagonists in that they block CCK from interacting with other nerve signals. 

   In the study, researchers fed rats until they were no longer hungry. 
An hour later one group of rats was given a placebo, or dummy drug, while another group was given the Merck drugs. 
The ones given the Merck drugs began eating anew. 
Merck tested one compound first developed about five years ago and its affect in triggering the eating was modest. 
A second <ORGANIZATION>Merck</ORGANIZATION> drug developed earlier this year was "100 times more potent" in stimulating hunger, the researchers said. 

   Merck researchers said the drugs might be useful in treating anorexia, an eating disorder in which people lose their hunger. 
But <PERSON>Merck</PERSON> and other drug makers are searching for a compound that promotes activity of CCK, the protein which suppresses hunger. 
Such a drug is expected to be useful against obesity. 

   Interfering with brain neurotransmitters is one of the most competitive fields in drug research. 
Scientists believe drugs that work on the brain proteins will be effective in treating mental problems such as schizophrenia, depression, headaches, and drug and alcohol addiction. 
Other companies thought to be working on CCK-related drugs are <ORGANIZATION>Warner-Lambert Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Upjohn Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Abbott Laboratories Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> unit of the Swiss drug maker <ORGANIZATION>F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co</ORGANIZATION>.

   Most people don't really know what the role of the school nurse
is, says a nursing educator, who believes finding out can be
helpful to students, parents and teachers alike.
   ``I think a lot of people don't have any idea what the role of
the school nurse is,'' says <PERSON>Ruth Young Seideman</PERSON>, a former school
nurse who now is an associated professor of nursing at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION>.
``It's not as obvious as that of a teacher.''
   School nurses, she says, don't spend their time waiting for a
chance to hand out a Band-Aid, but on health monitoring, counseling
and disseminating information.
   ``We do not distribute drugs except in rare cases with a
doctor's order,'' she says. ``So while we will do CPR
(cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) or distribute aspirin, actually
treating patients is the exception rather than the rule.''
   A major part of the job, she says, is to serve as a referral
source, ``a resource person, to put the parents and teachers in
touch with health care providers.''
   The problems of a school nurse vary with the ages of the
students and the environment of the school district, she says.
   In elementary schools, the most common duties are identifying
communicable diseases, screen for health problems and coping with
playground accidents.
   In the high school setting, there are more delicate situations
of pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases and birth control, says
<PERSON>Seideman</PERSON>.
   Dental problems are there in all ages, she says.
   A constant project is teaching good nutrition and many school
nurses go into the classroom to provide information that they hope
will be passed along to parents. ``Connected with that,'' says
<PERSON>Seideman</PERSON>, ``the older girls often get preoccupied with their
weight, and then you need to be alert to symptoms of eating
disorders like anorexia and bulimia.''
   Not everything is a ``crisis,'' however. ``There are always a
few math-generated headaches,'' she says, ``when they come down
with the daily headache just in time for fourth-period math.''

<TEXT>  of dyslexia; An <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> study of more than 500 males revealed that those born
in the <DATE>summer</DATE> -- particularly in <DATE>June</DATE> -- have a higher incidence of dyslexia
than those born in other months.;   The higher risk may be linked to women
contracting winter viruses during the middle of their pregnancies, according
to <PERSON>Richard Livingston</PERSON>, head of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION>. Mid-pregnancy is an important time for fetal brain
development, so maternal illness at that time may lead to disorders such as
dyslexia.;   Dyslexia is a learning disability characterized by problems with
reading.;   <PERSON>Livingston</PERSON> says that of 585 males who attended the university's
<ORGANIZATION>Child Studies Center</ORGANIZATION>, 173 had dyslexia. Those born in <DATE>June</DATE> were 2.7 times as
likely to have it as males born in other months. Those born in <DATE>May</DATE> and <DATE>July</DATE>
were approximately twice as likely to be dyslexic than those born in other
months.;   <PERSON>Livingston</PERSON> says the study is important because "it suggests you
could decrease the incidence of dyslexia by reducing maternal exposure to the
flu." That could be accomplished with vaccines now recommended for the elderly
and those with immune deficiencies.;   In addition, earlier diagnosis and
intervention could be established for children at risk. Parents who think
their child might be at risk should watch for difficulties in language
development and such skills as the ability to draw shapes or put things in
sequential order. Such children should be evaluated by learning-disorder
experts.;   <PERSON>Livingston</PERSON> says females were not included in the study because
there were too few dyslexic females in the study population.;   The capable;
single parent; Single parents should view themselves as competent and resist
falling victim to prejudices and stereotypes against them, urges <PERSON>Pirooz
Sholevar</PERSON>, professor and director of the <ORGANIZATION>Division of Child</ORGANIZATION>, Adolescent and
Family Psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Medical College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia.</LOCATION>;   In that
way, single parents can help change society's view that a two-parent family
automatically is "functioning" and a one-parent family must be viewed as
"broken.";   But to function best, <PERSON>Sholevar</PERSON> adds, single parents need to
surround themselves with a support group that helps members solve problems
rather than simply commiserate. "The point is to recognize (that) there are
single-parent families that are operating well," <PERSON>Sholevar</PERSON> says. "Our view is
that the single-parent family is as likely to be functioning as not.";  
<PERSON>Sholevar</PERSON> says society has a negative opinion of single parenthood because of
the stigma of divorce and of unwed pregnancy. But he points to studies of
single-parent black families -- largely headed by women -- that for
generations have raised children successfully. He says the successful single
mothers are those who share some of their child-rearing burden with a support
network of their own mothers, sisters, ministers, friends or partners.;   But,
<PERSON>Sholevar</PERSON> adds, society must abandon negative stereotypes about single-parent
families in order to help them thrive.;   The great; weight debate; <PERSON>Ann
Childress</PERSON>, a fellow in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION>Medical
University of South Carolina</ORGANIZATION>, added results of another study to those that
shows an alarming number of children as young as 9 years old -- particularly
girls -- are extremely concerned about appearance and have tried to lose
weight.;   In a recent study of 3,000 <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> students in grades 5
through 8, more than <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> say they are fat and need to lose weight.
Almost one-third say they have dieted -- and the youngest participants were
only 9 years old.;   <PERSON>Childress</PERSON> says <PERCENT>4.8 percent</PERCENT> of the youngsters admit they
have induced themselves to vomit to lose weight; <PERCENT>2.5 percent</PERCENT> say they have
used diet pills; and <PERCENT>1.5 percent</PERCENT> say they have used diuretics or laxatives to
lose weight.;   The children often pick up dieting behavior from their
parents, the study shows.;   The long-term solution, <PERSON>Childress</PERSON> says, is to
foster a society in which people can be comfortable with themselves regardless
of appearance. In the short-run, she advocates educating youngsters about the
dangers of extreme methods for weight loss.;   "Children can die from
vomiting," <PERSON>Childress</PERSON> says. "Children need to be educated about eating
disorders.";   <ORGANIZATION>Childress</ORGANIZATION> urges parents who suspect their child has an eating
disorder to contact school or local health organizations for information or
referrals.  </TEXT>

   Between 12 and <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s children
_ as many as 14 million of those under age 18 _ are suffering from
some type of mental disorder, but only about a third are receiving
any treatment, a study released today reported.
   A committee of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> said in the study that
though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated, the
situation has improved in the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE> and there is
``demonstrable progress'' toward understanding, preventing and
correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters.
   ``There is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major
childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment,'' the
committee said.
   But in far too many cases, no treatment at all is being offered
to troubled youngsters, the committee said.
   At a news conference <DATE>today</DATE>, committee chairman <PERSON>James F. Leckman</PERSON>
of <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> said that of the mentally ill children ``a third
or less are treated,'' often because their problems go undetected or
because resources for care are not available.
   ``We have a long way to go,'' said <PERSON>Leckman</PERSON>. ``This group has been
underserved (by society). There is a stigma associated with mental
illness. That is a clear and persistent problem in our society.''
   Americans respond to physical disorders much more readily than to
mental health problems, said <PERSON>Dr. Fredric Solomon</PERSON>, director of the
mental health division of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``<PERCENT>Eighty percent</PERCENT> of the phyically disabled children are served,''
he said. ``For mental disorders, less than <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the
children are served, even if they are noticed.''
   Solomon said that studies have shown that even medical
professionals, such as pediatricians, generally recognize only about
about quarter of their patients who are suffering from mental
disorders. He said often the children who receive attention by
society are only those with disruptive behavior.
   Members of the committee said it is difficult to obtain reliable
data to precisely define how many of the childhood population are
suffering from mental problems, but <PERSON>Leckman</PERSON> said there are
indications that ``the likelihood is that the rate is increasing.''
   Dr. <PERSON>Glen R. Elliott</PERSON>, vice chairman of the committee and a
professor of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION>, said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood
suicides and in eating disorders.
   Though conservative estimates place the number of American
children with mental disorders at about 7.5 million, or <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT>,
the committee said the number could be much higher.
   ``Recent studies have suggested that the ange may be as high as
17 to <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>, or 11 to 14 million children and adolescents,''
the report said.
   Problems identified in the report included mood disorders such as
depression, behavior disorders such as hyperactivity, developmental
disorders such as autism, as well as chronic drug use, sexual
problems and eating disorders including anorexia.
   ``Approximately 2.5 million children in this country received
treatment in <DATE>1985</DATE> for a mental disorder,'' the committee reported.
``This means that at least another 5 million other children needed
some type of intervention, but did not receive any treatment.''
   Poverty and ghetto life contribute heavily to the nation's
troubled youth, the study said.
   Youngsters with mental and behavioral problems ``may exceed <PERCENT>20
percent</PERCENT> in some populations, such as inner-city children, who are
exposed to severe psychological adversity,'' the study said.
   The total cost to the nation has not been measured, but the
committee said the figure would probably run into the <MONEY>billions of
dollars</MONEY> a year.
   In addition to the costs of treatment, the committee said there
are substantial indirect costs from the need for social services,
criminal justice and special education.
   ``Each year in this nation about 49,000 children and youth are
held in various public youth facilities, and many thousands more are
in adult prisons,'' the study said. ``Millions of children are
involved with child welfare, foster care and residential treatment.
Many of these children have a diagnosable mental disorder, but
receive neither diagnosis nor treatment.''
   The study also said that about <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of all mentally
retarded children also have behavioral and emotional difficulties.
These compound problems often result in such children being confined
for life to institutions.
   A national plan of coordinated research and training that would
attract more professionals to the mental health field, and lead to a
better understanding of how to prevent, evaluate and treat mental
illness in children was proposed by the committee. The report called
for a national investment of up to <MONEY>$198 million</MONEY> annually by the
fifth year.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of
Sciences</ORGANIZATION>, a private organization chartered by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as an adviser
to the federal government in scientific and technical matters.

<TEXT>
JAPAN Tobacco, the Japanese tobacco monopoly, has made its first
international acquisition with the purchase of <ORGANIZATION>The Manchester Tobacco
Company</ORGANIZATION>, a small British cigarette maker whose Kings and Regatta brands
account for about 1 per cent of the UK market.
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Tobacco is about 135 times bigger than <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, with <DATE>1990</DATE> sales of
Y2,701.8bn (Dollars 20.27bn) against about Pounds 89m (Dollars 153m) for the
British company last year.
It is putting Pounds 5m into the acquisition, including the purchase of
equity and a commitment to buy new equipment to improve the quality of the
operation. <PERSON>Mr Fursa Hogan</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Manchester Tobacco</ORGANIZATION> chairman, will stay on as
managing director.
Although <ORGANIZATION>Japan Tobacco</ORGANIZATION> says its long-term strategy is to expand
internationally, this initial acquisition appears more like a test of the
waters rather than the opening gambit of a big expansion strategy. About 3.5
per cent of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Tobacco's production is exported.
The company said yesterday it had no plans to expand the Manchester
business, to increase exports, or to use the company to channel imports of
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Tobacco's best-selling Mild Seven brand.
The Japanese government plans a public offering of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Tobacco shares
later this year, although nothing concrete has been announced.
The structure of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> Tobacco was changed from a government bureau to a
joint stock company in <DATE>1985</DATE>, after which its financial performance has
improved considerably. The company reported profits of Y93.2bn, up 88 per
cent since the change in structure. Inventories of tobacco leaves have also
fallen sharply following a programme to reduce acreage.
The Japanese cigarette market has expanded in recent years after earlier
declines. In the six months to last <DATE>September</DATE> sales grew by 2.5 per cent,
compared with a year earlier, to 167bn cigarettes.
Imported cigarette sales have grown more quickly than domestic brands, and
now account for about 16 per cent of the market.
The company has diversified into a wide range of fields and has an extensive
research programme. Its research scientists recently discovered a chemical
substance that stimulates the portion of the brain that causes the sensation
of hunger.
The company has suggested that the substance may be used to treat anorexia
nervosa, and is already being used to fatten up geese to obtain livers used
to make pate de foie gras.

   Made-for-TV movies ``based on a true story'' are

   Liberace died only last year, but <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> are ready to air
made-for-TV movies based on his life in early <DATE>October</DATE>.
   Last <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>Jessica McClure</PERSON> dropped down a well in <LOCATION>Midland</LOCATION>,

biographical movie. Another true-life <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> movie concerns a doctor
who was the first to detect AIDS in children.
   CBS' ``<PERSON>Jack</PERSON> the Ripper'' is based on a true story that became
the stuff of much fancy and legend. Another fact-based historical
movie is ``Day One,'' about the <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> Project and the race to
build an atomic bomb.
   In the area of fiction, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> has <PERSON>Larry McMurtry</PERSON>'s novel
``Lonesome Dove,'' which will be an eight-hour miniseries, one of
the longer ones these days.
   This season may mark the end of the era of super-long, big-event
miniseries _ which actually seemed to end with ``Amerika,'' but <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION>
has had a long-term commitment to <PERSON>Herman Wouk</PERSON>'s ``War and
Remembrance,'' the 30-hour sequel to ``The Winds of War.'' Eighteen
hours of the miniseries will air in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   ABC's ``Roots: <PERSON>Kunta Kinte</PERSON>'s Gift'' reunites <PERSON>LeVar Burton</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Kunta
Kinte</ORGANIZATION>) and <PERSON>Louis Gossett Jr.</PERSON> (Fiddler) in a question for freedom
that will air around <LOCATION>Christmas</LOCATION>.
   NBC, which has a strong regular series lineup and no new ideas
other than ripping off already successful ventures, offers, not
surprisingly, little of excitement in movies and miniseries _
although they do provide off-season projects for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> series stars.
   <PERSON>Pierce Brosnan</PERSON> (``Remington Steele'') stars in a six-hour remake
of ``Around the World in 80 Days.'' <PERSON>Harry Hamlin</PERSON> (``<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Law'')
stars in ``Favorite Son,'' a political drama.
   <PERSON>Christopher Reeve</PERSON> (no <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> credit), <PERSON>Judd Hirsch</PERSON> (``Dear John''),
<PERSON>Anthony Denison</PERSON> (``Crime Story'') and <PERSON>Charles Haid</PERSON> (``Hill Street
Blues'') star in ``The Great Escape: The Final Chapter.''
   To its credit, though, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> does have in development _ with no
air date set _ ``And the Band Played On,'' <PERSON>Randy Shilts</PERSON>' highly
praised, non-fiction account of the political, medical and social
ramifications of AIDS. Another worthy <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> project is ``<LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lord</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>,'' from the producers of ``The Cosby Show,'' a fact-based
drama about the civil rights movement in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> as seen through
the eyes of two young girls.

JOHNSON WINS TOUGHEST FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For <PERSON>Amy Johnson</PERSON>, the opposition on the field has always been the smallest 
obstacle she has had to face in her career with the <LOCATION>Cal Poly Pomona</LOCATION> women's 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the team as a freshman, the 20-year-old forward has consistently 
been among the top players for the Broncos. Last season, as a sophomore, she 
was <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION>'s leading scorer and was chosen to the second team of the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn.</ORGANIZATION>'s Division II All-American squad. She is already 
among the school's all-time leaders in goals, points and assists. 
</P>
<P>
But for the 5-foot-5 <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, the toughest fight hasn't been with the 
competition, but with herself. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered from bulimia, an eating disorder found primarily in younger women 
who see themselves as overweight, or likely to become overweight. Those so 
afflicted commonly ingest large quantities of food, then make themselves vomit 
in order to remain thin. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said her problems stemmed from the perception she had of herself while 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to be <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION> at one time but she was too short," said <LOCATION>Pomona</LOCATION> 
Coach <PERSON>Brian Wiesner</PERSON>, who wrote the thesis for his master's degree on eating 
disorders in female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
For as long as she could remember, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said, she had been concerned about 
her weight, although it was not until after graduating from Corona High School 
that signs of the disorder first surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably between my senior year in high school and my freshman year in 
college, but I wouldn't really call it bulimia," she said. "At this time, it 
was more like excessive dieting. In my fall semester and freshman season, I 
didn't really start throwing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the soccer season was when it got really bad. I always thought I 
was real heavy, so I started dieting a lot." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said, staying thin had become a dangerous obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just try to please my friends by eating a meal and then I would go to 
the nearest bathroom and purge it all after I ate," she said. Although <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 
often purged before games, <PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> said he didn't detect a problem during her 
freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't lose a thing in the way she played on the field," he said. "Her 
performance for us has been super all along. So it was something that was 
really more noticeable when she wasn't playing." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said it wasn't until the <DATE>spring quarter</DATE> of her freshman year that he 
noticed a change in <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s appearance and weight. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to tell that <PERSON>Amy</PERSON> wasn't up to par, but I didn't know why," <PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> 
said. "Then her friends (from the team) started calling me up and telling me 
what she was doing. I didn't know what to do. . . . I had to work with our 
training staff on it because we didn't know how to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
After he became aware of the problem, <PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> said, he assigned players to 
monitor <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s eating habits, only to be met with resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had people watching her every day, and she'd come up to me and say, 'I don't 
want people spying on me,' " <PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
It was toward the end of the <DATE>spring quarter</DATE> that <PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> and school trainers 
finally confronted <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> with the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> agreed to meet with <PERSON>Gayle Ashabraner</PERSON>, then a 
nutritional counselor at the school's health center, who put <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> on a diet. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s typical playing weight is about 123 pounds and she had 
lost 20 pounds by the time she met with Ashabraner. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was also constantly 
out of breath and had puffy cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I told <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> that I'd (meet Ashabraner) but I didn't want to gain any weight," 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said. "She asked me what my ideal weight was, and I said about 105 
pounds. She said, 'If you trust me, I'll guarantee that you weigh that.' " 
</P>
<P>
The counselor persuaded <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> to keep a list of her eating habits. At first, 
she continued her old ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a chart and I'd have to write it down with an asterisk if I 
purged," she said. "There were some days when I did two or three or four times 
and some days when I didn't do it at all." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said she finally learned to control her eating habits during the <DATE>summer</DATE> 
before her sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
But although <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> no longer has bulimia, <PERSON>Wiesner</PERSON> said she must always 
monitor her eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not a recovered bulimic, she's a recovering bulimic and she'll always 
have to be concerned about it," he said. "She can always be susceptible to it 
again if the conditions are right." 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  A QUESTION TO SLEEP ON: DO NAPS SPUR PRODUCTIVITY?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But employee services director <PERSON>Jim Connolly</PERSON> gravely observes that <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta
Gas Light Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s rate payers might take a dim view of the utility's employees
curling up for 40 winks after lunch.;    That's right, we're talking about
naps.;    Over the last few years, medical journals and the popular press have
suggested that people innately long for 40 winks in the middle of the day.;   
Former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> vascular surgeon <PERSON>Irv Dardick</PERSON> recently gave up a traditional
practice to track his notion that the human body seeks harmony. Its health
results from rhythmic cycles of exertion and rest.;    "Most people have
sedentary jobs and sit for long hours in unchanging indoor environments," <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> magazine noted in a recent article about <PERSON>Dardick</PERSON> and his theory on the
marriage of work, rest and health.;    "Naps are not possible, despite the
body's natural inclination to rest at midday. People tend to eat too much, too
often, particularly high-fat foods, which are not easily digested -- and which
reinforce a flat pattern of energy recovery without much expenditure," the
article said.;    <PERSON>Dardick</PERSON> puts his patients, who are or have been chronically
ill with grave muscular diseases and illnesses such as anorexia nervosa,
through designed agendas of running, hopping, skipping and rest.;    He
theorizes that chronic disease is linked to behavior -- starting even as
children are seated in a classroom until <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> and afterward, before a TV
screen -- and that is consistent with views about human history.;    Humans
have been office dwellers for less than a century, so isn't that kind of work
schedule unnatural for most people?;    "Certainly," says <PERSON>Peter J. Brown</PERSON>,
chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Emory University</ORGANIZATION>'s anthropology department. "There's no reason we
should expect work patterns to go eight hours unlimited.;    "I can't say
there's something in our evolutionary heritage that (dictates) we should take
naps, but in our hunter-gatherer history," we spent a good deal of time
resting.;    Work was then, and perhaps should be now, intermittent.;   
"Huh?" snorts <PERSON>Irwin Lowenstein</PERSON>. The live-wire president of <ORGANIZATION>Rhodes Furniture
Co.</ORGANIZATION> barely knows the meaning of the word "rest." And however he esteems his
employees, he's got no intention of providing a darkened room with partitions
and cots where folks could go to nod off for 20 or 30 minutes after lunch.;   
"I have no urge to nap at <TIME>2 this afternoon</TIME>," <PERSON>Lowenstein</PERSON> announces,
emphatically. "It'd take me an hour to get back on track. I've been up since
<TIME>5:30 this morning</TIME>, and I'm on a roll.";    It's staying on that endless,
merciless "roll" that makes closing one's eyes for even a few minutes seem
wimpy -- especially to today's upwardly mobile professionals, whether they're
young or not.;    It's better to give people a little relief from
stress-producing situations, Grant says. He asks: "If offices have gyms, why
not quiet rooms? For some people, (midday) exercise might be the most
stress-reducing. For others, it might be the quiet room.";    What are the
chances that companies -- many of which now provide employees with ways to
exercise -- might also provide a place to rest?;    "I think there'd be a lot
of resistance," says <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>, "because of the Calvinistic ethic, the idea that
we're 'good by our works.' Especially in the company mind, when you're on the
job you're supposed to be producing. That 'time away' might ultimately make
people more productive would be a hard sell.";    <PERSON>Lowenstein</PERSON> offers this: "I
think it's like smoking was 30 years ago. It took a while to convince us that
smoking was bad for everybody, but now we have smoke-free offices, and it's
not socially or professionally acceptable to smoke.";    If over time enough
information came down about naps, he admitted, he might change his mind. But
for now? Alas. There's no way he's going to give folks an hour off for a nap.;
   <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Gas Light's <PERSON>Connolly</PERSON>, who said he did give the matter considerable
thought, could not see napping as part of the corporate culture, either.  </TEXT>

FROZEN MICROWAVABLE SNACKS: FOODS FOR MOOD RATHER THAN NUTRITION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AMERICANS ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE ON THESE TYPES OF FOODS -- FROM 
LEAN POCKET SANDWICHES AND PIZZAS TO BROWNIES AND MILK SHAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BLANGGER, THE ALLENTOWN MORNING CALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A joke floating around comedy clubs a few years ago concerned a then-overweight 
(but since slimmed-down) actress who stood in front of her microwave shouting, 
"Hurry, hurry." 
</P>
<P>
For the actress, and for most of the rest of us, speed is essential. Less 
significant to the actress, but more important to the rest of us, are the ways 
the pressures of a two-income family have shortened the amount of time most 
people spend cooking. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures have an impact in other areas as well, but nowhere do the 
hurry-up tendencies of daily life mesh with the possibilities of the microwave 
as well as they do in the area of frozen, microwavable snack foods. Although 
there are other choices when it comes to microwavable snacks, from popcorn to 
individual-serving soups, the frozen foods case is where folks in a hurry will 
find the greatest variety of quick snacks. 
</P>
<P>
There are no specific statistics on frozen, microwavable snacks -- the kind 
that, typically, come prepackaged in individual servings and can be prepared 
within minutes and eaten quickly and informally, using hands rather than the 
generally accepted polite utensils. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans have been spending more and more on frozen foods in general, and 
that would include microwavable snacks. Manufacturers are turning out 
everything from Lean Pocket sandwiches and pizzas to brownies and milk shakes. 
Most of these choices are goodies picked to suit a mood rather than a specific 
nutrition plan. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION>American Frozen Food Institute</ORGANIZATION> show that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
shoppers spent <MONEY>$9 billion</MONEY> more and ate 113 million pounds more frozen foods in 
<DATE>1988</DATE> than they did during the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,510 new frozen-food products were introduced during <DATE>1988</DATE>, and an equal 
number of new products were introduced during the past year, according to 
<PERSON>Steven Anderson</PERSON>, chief executive officer for the <ORGANIZATION>American Frozen Food 
Institute</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In our health-conscious times, a legitimate concern with microwavable snacks is 
their nutritional value, especially when compared with ready-made snacks or 
snacks prepared from mixes. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, most of the microwave products are, in my opinion, high in fat 
and in sodium in particular," says <PERSON>Tina Amato</PERSON>, a registered dietitian with the 
<LOCATION>Allentown</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Health Bureau</ORGANIZATION>. "There are some better selections you can choose 
within each of the categories." Frozen soft pretzels or individual-serving 
vegetable packs rather than a Danish or sausage biscuits are examples. 
</P>
<P>
Amato suggested people avoid microwavable snacks that have no nutritional 
labels on them. Typically, only foods that make some type of health claim are 
required to display a label, which would provide information on the amount of 
fat, sodium and other health-related information. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers should also look at the amount of fat, measured in grams, and sodium, 
measured in milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Any product with a single serving that registers more than 5 grams of fat or 
240 milligrams of sodium should be avoided, <PERSON>Amato</PERSON> says. Avoid palm oil (As a 
rule of thumb, palm oil is the least expensive of most commonly used oils, so 
if several oils, including palm oil, are listed, bet on the palm oil). 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Jayne Hurley</PERSON>, a registered dietitian with the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Science and Public 
Policy</ORGANIZATION>, said that tests were done comparing a microwavable cake mix to a boxed 
cake mix that someone would prepare at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Both are very fatty," says <PERSON>Hurley</PERSON>. "I don't know if you can make a case for 
them (microwavable snacks) being worse than prepackaged. They are certainly as 
fatty as those other products. There is no net positive or negative." 
</P>
<P>
Microwavable foods are "no worse than and no better than the ones you are 
whipping up at home. At home, you have more control over the ingredients. You 
can substitute skim milk instead of whole milk. You can cut fat and sugar. You 
have more control whenever you are making the food yourself," <PERSON>Hurley</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
Will the sheer convenience of the microwavable food snacks pose problems for 
some? 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hurley</PERSON> said they might. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are dieting, we recommend they only have foods in the house that 
need to be prepared," <PERSON>Hurley</PERSON> said. "So, if you want to binge on cookies and 
cake, you have to get eggs and milk out and make them. Chances are, you are not 
going to do that. The convenience of (microwavable foods) might lead to an 
increase in consumption for these kind of products." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Judith Newman</PERSON>, a specialist on eating disorders at <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania State 
University</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Ogontz Campus</ORGANIZATION>, says that the convenience of the foods will not 
matter much to the anorexic, who suffers from appetite loss. For the bulimic, 
or the binge eater, the quickness of the foods' preparation may in fact feed 
the food addiction. 
</P>
<P>
However, with extreme cases of binge eaters, <PERSON>Newman</PERSON> said, it is not uncommon 
for them to "eat frozen pastries or dough before it is cooked. They eat raw 
things. Once that drive comes over them to binge, the taste of the food or the 
texture of the food is really unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
Snacking has gotten a bad name, <PERSON>Hurley</PERSON> says, mostly because of the kinds of 
snacks people choose. Eating several smaller meals a day is no better or worse 
than eating the traditional three square meals, <PERSON>Hurley</PERSON> says. It is what is 
chosen that is important. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned to eat my way through the frozen-snack category and critique the 
choices, I found some winners as well as some losers. 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Vegetable Pizza-For-One: High in fat (26 grams) and high in sodium 
(1,260), the pizza would not get rave reviews from the dietitians but still got 
excellent remarks from an ad hoc committee of tasters. Vegetables were good and 
a crisping disk included in the package to help keep the crust crisp worked as 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
Acme Breakfast Sandwich: This version included sausage, egg and cheese on a 
biscuit. The biscuit was too floury for my tastes. But overall, it was equal to 
the kind of sandwich one might get out of a vending machine. Another category 
with alarming statistics. This brand contained 1,450 milligrams sodium and 29 
grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
Lean Pockets Chicken Supreme: Of the non-sweet foods tested, this was tops for 
taste and nutrition. It was very low in fat (4 grams), but didn't offer any 
data on sodium content. The crust was crisp and the chicken stuffing was tasty. 
</P>
<P>
Oh Boy Stuffed Potatoes: Because these came two to a box, there was enough to 
put it before the tasting committee. One tester thought the potato was bland 
but passable. Another felt somewhat deceived by the box, which listed real 
bacon was included in the potatoes. She found only tiny bacon bits and also 
thought the potato was peppery, but not to a degree that would make the potato 
inedible. Each stuffed potato takes about four minutes to cook -- enough time 
to make one wonder if it wouldn't be far smarter to microwave a real potato and 
season to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Hormel New Traditions Cheeseburger: As might be expected, the fat content here 
is high (19 grams) and the sodium fairly high as well (550 milligrams). This 
brand requires only that the hamburger be defrosted for about 4 minutes, so 
folks with a microwave that doesn't have a defrost mode may have to guess as to 
cooking times -- a critical point when it comes to final quality. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sara Lee</PERSON> Classic Cheesecakes: At 200 calories, 14 grams fat and 150 milligrams 
sodium, these tasty treats (four individual snacks) exact a steep nutritional 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperidge Farm's <ORGANIZATION>Newport Hot Fudge Brownie</ORGANIZATION>: This is part of Pepperidge Farm's 
American Collection, and while the individual-serving brownie is kind to the 
taste buds, it is rather pricey. I paid <MONEY>$1.39</MONEY> for it at a convenience store, 
but the item is discounted slightly at supermarkets. No nutritional data is 
provided; probably because a snacker is probably better off not knowing the 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel's Double Chocolate Brownies: <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON>, bless her, is most likely on the 
Weight Watchers hit list. The 1-pound tray of frozen <PERSON>Rachel</PERSON>'s (with walnuts) is 
too good to be sold without a license or a prescription. Worst of all, you can 
eat the brownies when still frozen (<PERSON>Rachel</PERSON> suggests it on the back of the box) 
for a different taste treat. There are no health claims on this box, and, 
therefore, a snacker has no idea just how good or how bad these things are for 
him or her, which might be a small blessing. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sara Lee</PERSON> Chocolate Fudge Cakes: These relatively dry cakes (six individually 
wrapped snacks) are better with coffee or tea than alone. They are of medium 
caloric content (190) and high in fat content (10 grams per). The sodium level 
was at a reasonable level (125 milligrams). 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Farms Carrot Cake: A fairly tasty, fairly moist carrot cake (cream 
cheese frosting with walnuts). Again, no nutritional information. For the 
calorie-conscientious among us, you can slice one or two pieces of the frozen 
cake and place the rest safely back in the freezer. The slices can be 
microwaved to thaw. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Sara Lee</PERSON> Corn and Oat Bran Muffins: Both muffins come in packaging that allows 
the user to microwave one, or several. The corn muffins are tastier than the 
oat bran muffins, which are bland tasting. The oat bran muffins are also on the 
dry side. Of the two, the corn muffins had more fat per serving -- 13 grams, 
compared to the oat bran muffin's 8 grams. Also, they both were fairly high in 
sodium -- 330 milligrams for the corn, 320 milligrams for the oat.

   ``Diet and Health with a Key to the Calories,'' published in
<DATE>1918</DATE> and written by a physician, was the first best-selling diet
book in this country, according to <PERSON>Joan Jacobs Brumberg</PERSON>'s history
of anorexia.
   It's full of good humor, but makes it cleaeal
had already taken hold. The author, <PERSON>Lulu Hunt Peters</PERSON>, uses names
like ``<PERSON>Mrs. Sheesasite</PERSON>, whose husband bought her freight scales,''
<PERSON>Mrs. Tiny Weyaton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mrs. Ima Gobbler</PERSON>.
   Some excerpts:
   - To her readers whor that a thin id want to gain weight, she says:
``I am not
particularly interested in you, anyway, for I cannot get your point
of view. How anyone can want to be anything but thin is beyond my
intelligence.''
   - ``Now fat individuals have always been considered a joke, but
you are a joke no longer. Instead of being looked on with friendly
toleranace and amusement, you are now viewed with distrust,
suspicion and even aversion! How dare you hoard fat when our nation
needs it?''
   - ``Yes, you eat too much, no matter how little it is, even if
it be only one bird seed daily, if you store it away as fat. . . .
(And between you and me, <PERSON>Mrs. Weyaton</PERSON>, just confidential like -
don't tell it - we know that the small appetite story is a Medicine.
   That's obviously good news for people who want to reduce fat
intake, and it also may pay off for weight-watchers, she said.
   The federally financed study focused on six men who spent 24
hours a day for 13 days in a laboratory, where researchers could
precisely measure what they ate. The men did not know the purpose
of the study, and they were kept busy with a variety of tasks.
   Each man ate a high-fat, 844-calorie lunch during one three-day
period, and a low-fat, 431-calorie lunch in another period. Both
lunches consisted of submarine sandwiches and salad. The men could
not distinguish between the two versions.
   Beginning one hour after lunch, the men could choose from a
variety of foods to eat. Analysis showed that if they had eaten the
low-calorie lunch, they later made up the difference in calories,
mostly at dinnertime.
   But no such compensation occurred for fat, Rolls said. That
suggests fat substitutes ``certainly are going to be an aid to help
people to try to reduce fats in foods,'' she said.
   Hopkins researcher <PERSON>Richard Foltin</PERSON>, lead author of the study,
cautioned that the men were not free to eat whatever they wanted
for lunch. So the evidence is only suggestive that in everyday
life, low-fat food would reduce total fat intake, he said.
   <PERSON>Adam Drewnowski</PERSON>, director of the human nutrition program at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan's School of Public Health</ORGANIZATION>, called the study
valuable.
   He also said nobody knows what happens to overall fat intake
when people know they are eating low-fat products.
   Rolls said she doubts those people make up for missing fat. ``I
don't think people think in terms of `I want to eat fat,' '' she
said.
   Although the study found no difference in calorie intake, the
reduction in calories from fat may still be good news for those
trying to lose weight.
   Recent research suggests calories from fat are more fattening
than those from carbohydrates. That is because the body uses less
energy to convert fat calories to body fat than it uses to convert
carbohydrate calories, Rolls said.
   In theory, then, cutting back on fat may help in losing weight
beyond just the effect on reducing calorie intake, she said.
   Fat substitutes hit the headlines in <DATE>February</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>Food and
Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> approved a substitute called Simplesse for use
in frozen desserts. Simplesse is made by <ORGANIZATION>Nutrasweet Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Kraft General Foods Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is also seeking <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approval for a fat
substitute to be used in frozen desserts.
   Another proposed substitute, olestra, could be used in cooking.
Olestra is not absorbed by the body, so it would not contribute any
fat or calories, says its developer, <ORGANIZATION>Procter &amp; Gamble Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   The company proposes that olestra replace some fat in oil and
shortening used in the home and in commercial frying.
   <ORGANIZATION>Frito-Lay Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is studying an experimental fat substitute,
dialkyl dihexadecymalonate, which it says cuts fat by <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT>
when blended with oil for frying tortilla and potato chips.

</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The <PERSON>Kitty O'Neil</PERSON> Story (Channel 9 <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME>) is an

</P>
<P>
If anything, <PERSON>Mel Brooks</PERSON>' <DATE>1968</DATE> debut film The Producers (Channel 5 <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>8 
p.m.</TIME>) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in which 
Zero Mostel and <PERSON>Gene Wilder</PERSON> come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from 
staging a terrible play. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) is the finest of <PERSON>Alfred 
Hitchcock</PERSON>'s last films, a thriller set in his native <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and dealing with a 
man (<PERSON>Jon Finch</PERSON>) wrongly accused of being a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
The <PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON> Story (CBS <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>) stars <PERSON>Cynthia Gibb</PERSON> in the

<P>
The <DATE>1984</DATE> Gremlins (<ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>) is <PERSON>Frank Capra</PERSON>'s "It's a Wonderful 
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour 
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of 
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>) is a 
so-so affair, with <PERSON>Roger Moore</PERSON> beginning to look a little weary as 007 (<PERSON>Timothy 
Dalton</PERSON> would replace him in the next Bond, the <DATE>1987</DATE> "Living Daylights"). This 
time the villain is <PERSON>Christopher Walken</PERSON>, intent on destroying <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Watching <PERSON>Terry Gilliam</PERSON>'s <DATE>1985</DATE> Brazil (Channel 5 <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>), an 
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching <PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON>'s head 
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker 
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny 
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Information</ORGANIZATION> 
where his shiningly innocent hero (<PERSON>Jonathan Pryce</PERSON>) toils in his cherished 
anonymity. <PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON>'s targets are the usual <PERSON>Monty Python</PERSON> concerns: modern 
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the

are.

Terror on Highway 91 (CBS <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>), a new TV movie, stars <PERSON>Ricky

in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (<PERSON>Bo Derek</PERSON>) all the 
way to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film 
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth, 
California-style. 
</P>
<P>
The Man in the <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> Suit (CBS <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME>) is a new TV movie updating 
<PERSON>Agatha Christie</PERSON>'s <DATE>1924</DATE> mystery novel about a young American woman (<PERSON>Stephanie

</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rob Reiner</PERSON>'s <DATE>1984</DATE> This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <TIME>11:30 p.m.</TIME>) is one 
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a 
rock documentary in which <ORGANIZATION>Reiner</ORGANIZATION> casts himself as a film maker trying to make a 
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality 
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin. 
</P>
<P>
The dreadful <DATE>1986</DATE> comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) plays 
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic splices 
from "<LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> Cop." <ORGANIZATION>John Candy</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Eugene Levy</PERSON> star as a pair of goofy 
misfits adrift in a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and

(ABC <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME>) moves the action from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> in the '20s to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s 
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle, it 
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. <PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON> has the title role as a

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Film:
   Bruce Willis as a Burglar; Madonna as Herself
   ----
   By Julie Salamon
</HL>
<DATE>
05/23/91
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   During the promotional blitz for "Hudson Hawk," his latest
movie, the actor Bruce Willis repeatedly complained bitterly
and often that journalists keep harping on the picture's
cost. He has said that this obsession with money (the
agreed-upon rumor puts "Hawk's" budget at $75 million) "is
180 degrees away from the entertainment value of the movie
itself."
   Mr. Willis is correct. If "Hudson Hawk" were a wonderful
picture, or even a modestly entertaining one, no one -- apart
from its investors -- would care how much it cost. But the
money issue is difficult to ignore in this case. An eccentric
comedy lies somewhere in "Hudson Hawk," but, like the fine
cheekbones of a 500-pound person, it is almost entirely
obscured by bloat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The movie is about a cat burglar (<PERSON>Mr. Willis</PERSON>), recently
released from jail and ready to start a new life -- without
crime. He and his partner and best friend (<PERSON>Danny Aiello</PERSON>) are
forced back into thievery by mobsters. These wiseguys are in
cahoots with Big Business and the <ORGANIZATION>Central Intelligence
Agency</ORGANIZATION>. In order not to miss a single movie cliche, the film
makers drag in the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> as well. The story moves from <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, as everyone chases after <PERSON>Leonardo da Vinci</PERSON>'s
long-lost tools for changing lead into gold.
   The picture bears all the trappings of an enterprise
conceived and executed with too many hands, too little
thinking (simply invoking the name of Leonardo isn't enough).
The director, <PERSON>Michael Lehmann</PERSON>, and one of the screenwriters,
<PERSON>Daniel Waters</PERSON>, made their mark with "Heathers," a subversive
little comedy about teen-age suicide. Their hands are most
evident in the movie's "wacky" segments -- especially the
histrionics of <PERSON>Darwin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Minerva Mayflower</PERSON>, the scheming
capitalist couple who amuse themselves with sadomasochistic
sex and planning their bear play in the gold market. These
caricatures, played by <PERSON>Sandra Bernhard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard E. Grant</PERSON>,
seem like outtakes from a <ORGANIZATION>Monty Python</ORGANIZATION> movie -- or a <PERSON>Michael
Lehmann</PERSON> movie.
   But the film makers apparently were trying to pay homage
to stylish capers such as "To Catch a Thief," or the more
recent "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," pictures in which witty
characters pull off their sleights of hand with great
panache. "Hudson Hawk" also wants to be an action picture,
and a dark comedy, and an international extravaganza. In
other words, it wants to be everything, and consequently it
isn't much of anything. Not one scene seems to lead logically
to the next, and the inconsistency of plot is matched by
inconsistency of tone. Even the music changes radically from
scene to scene.
   The only thing that never changes is <PERSON>Mr. Willis</PERSON>. He
maintains his earnest look of puzzlement no matter what seems
to be going on around him. It is an appealing look, and
worked well for him in the "Die Hard" pictures (which, like
"Hudson Hawk," were produced by <PERSON>Joel Silver</PERSON>). It might have
worked for him here if he were given better things to say and
do.
   But the film's jokes are lame, weak references to
existential factoids. They have no reason for being except
that they are. The mobsters are called the <ORGANIZATION>Mario Brothers</ORGANIZATION>;
presumably this refers to the <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> video game characters,
since someone mentions <ORGANIZATION>Nintendo</ORGANIZATION> -- once. There's a quip about
<PERSON>Karen Carpenter</PERSON>, the singer who died of anorexia nervosa.
There are many crotch jokes.
   The dialogue is never clever. Talking about the <PERSON>Willis</PERSON>
character's fondness for cappuccino, his friend says, "You've
still got a thing for these masculine European coffees." When
the woman he's attracted to asks him how long he's been in
prison, <PERSON>Mr. Willis</PERSON> says, "Let's say I never saw `E.T.'"
   Despite all its failures of wit, sense and pace, the film
does most effectively flaunt the millions spent on it. The
inane action takes place in splendiferous settings. <PERSON>Mr.
Willis</PERSON> may not want his audiences to think about how much
those settings cost, but I think he's making a mistake. The
picture's "entertainment value" can only be enhanced by the
realization that the movie's financiers are probably
suffering much more than the audience.
   ---
   "Truth or Dare," the "behind-the-scenes" (but entirely
authorized) documentary about <PERSON>Madonna</PERSON>, has quickly become the
most popular film ever distributed by <ORGANIZATION>Miramax Films</ORGANIZATION>, the
daring company that released "sex, lies, and videotape" and
"The Grifters."
   I don't have access to <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION>, so my familiarity with <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION>
has pretty much been limited to radio and the multitude of
articles I've read about her. Friends of mine have very
strong opinions about her. One identifies with her
completely, and thinks she's a model for women everywhere
(strong, self-sufficient). Another thinks <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> represents
the final decline of Western Civilization (sexual depravity,
money lust). After seeing "Truth or Dare," I think everything
everyone says about <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> is true. She's great, she's
disgusting, she's profane, she's entertaining. She is what
she is and she doesn't hide any of it from the camera she let
follow her around -- even when she thinks she's hiding some
of it. The film is calculating, vulgar and too long -- as a
movie about a megolomaniac should be. Like Madonna herself,
this documentary is a powerfully shrewd piece of packaging,
and entertaining. You won't wonder for a minute how much it
cost.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: After watching <ORGANIZATION>Madonna</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Bruce Willis</PERSON> I had
an urge to watch "A Face in the Crowd" again. <PERSON>Andy Griffith</PERSON>
stars in this biting <PERSON>Elia Kazan</PERSON> picture about a nobody picked
up by a television executive and turned into a superstar.

<HEAD>U-Haul Plan Would Cost Workers with Unhealthy Lifestyles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U-Haul International has a message for its
smokers and couch potatoes: Start leading a healthier lifestyle or
get lighter in the wallet.
   Starting <DATE>April 1</DATE>, the company will begin docking the pay of the
obese, the anorexic and the nicotine-needy by <MONEY>$5</MONEY> per paycheck _ up
to <MONEY>$130</MONEY> per year.
   Employees who quit smoking or get their weight under control
within two years will get refunds.
   The idea is not to harass employees who fall into those
categories but to save some of the company's <MONEY>$17 million-a-year</MONEY>
outlay for medical insurance and medical costs, executive vice
president <PERSON>Harry DeShong</PERSON> said.
   ``What we are trying to do is encourage people to maintain a
state of wellness. I suspect it's going to have a profound impact
on the organization,'' <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON> said.
   Two attorneys who specialize in labor relations said the idea
made them sick.
   ``It's ridiculous, grotesque,'' said <PERSON>Stanley Lubin</PERSON>. ``You don't
dock people for part of their pay that way. Pay is an agreed amount
of money given for an agreed amount of work. The company well may
be violating its employer-employee agreement if it docks people's
pay.''
   Lawyer <PERSON>Charles Santaguida</PERSON> said the policy was too simplistic.
   ``Many persons with weight problems, such as those linked to
diabetes, for example, are physically disabled,'' <PERSON>Santaguida</PERSON> said.
``And addiction to nicotine is considered to be a mental disability
under federal statutes, which prohibit discrimination on the basis
of either physical or mental disability.''
   Santaguida predicted the company would have to change the policy.
   <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON> said <PERSON>Santaguida</PERSON> was representing a client against U-Haul
in another labor matter.
   ``What's he going to do _ say something good about us?'' he said.
   <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON> said the plan was introduced company-wide through an
in-house newsletter last week and had met almost no opposition.
There is no organized effort to oppose implementation, he said.
   ``All of our employees are stockholders in the organization, and
the (medical) costs are such that we all suffer. Our
medical-benefits package affects 13,000 of us, and yet fewer than
150 employees comprise <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of what we spend in medical
claims,'' <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON> said.
   ``Those people, and all of us, need to be more
health-conscious,'' he said. ``We're not trying to decrease the
amount of coverage. We're trying to maintain the coverage we have.
   U-Haul Chairman <PERSON>Edward J.</PERSON> ``Joe'' <PERSON>Shoen</PERSON> was overweight and
recently lost 23 pounds to fall within the guidelines, and <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON>
said he was familiar with anorexia because of the struggle of a
member of his immediate family.
   U-Haul has no policy against hiring the obese, anorexic and
smokers, but <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON> said the company had been testing for drug use
by work applicants in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where it employes 2,300, for about a
year.
   About <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> of the applicants either fail the urinalysis or
don't show up for the test.
   Alcohol abusers aren't included in the policy because of the
difficulty in monitoring borderline cases, but the company does
recognize alcoholism as a health threat and has programs in place
to help its workers break the addiction, <PERSON>DeShong</PERSON> said.

<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- Two years ago, I found myself in the emergency room of a local
hospital. I had just swallowed a bottle of my mother's sleeping pills. I was
very much in love with a woman who repeatedly told me I was special -- one in
a million, etc. Unfortunately, she was married.;    I was a 20-year-old
college student when we met at work. She was a 27-year-old co-worker and
separated from her husband. We spent the summer together and it was very nice.
When she told me she and her husband were reconciling, I was hurt, but in the
back of my mind I had always known this would happen. What I didn't expect was
that she wouldn't want to break up. She really wanted both of us.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THERE'S NOTHING THERE IF SEX IS ALL YOU SHARE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     I didn't know what to think or what to feel and I didn't have the strength
to tell her no. Now that I look back, our relationship was quite strange. This
woman would come to my apartment, have sex with me and leave. I could almost
set my watch by her words, "Oh, look at the time! I must go!";    I told her
several times that what we were doing was wrong and that I wanted to get on
with my life. She'd agree, then call me a couple of days later and whisper, "I
miss you. I can't live without you." It sure was flattering. But the mixture
of guilt, dependence, frustration and confusion made me crazy. Death seemed
like the only thing that could stop the pain.;    How can I keep this from
happening again?;    -- <LOCATION>M.P.</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>;    DEAR <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> -- If you
haven't already gone for counseling, I recommend it. In the future, find a
woman with whom you can share something besides a mattress. And your chances
would be better if you selected someone closer to your own age, with no
estranged husband in the background. I think you get the picture. P.S.: No
woman is worth swallowing a bottle of pills over. Good luck.;    DEAR ANN -- I
am an anorexic, bulimic, compulsive overeater who has spent too many years
binging, purging, starving, dieting and over-exercising. I want to tell you
and your readers how I got out of that prison. It was Overeaters Anonymous.;  
 I have been eating moderate meals for over five years, maintaining a healthy
weight and learning to enjoy myself. Best of all, I have discovered that I am
a worthwhile person.;    My life didn't miraculously turn perfect. My car
still breaks down, I still have to change the cat's litter box, and I still
feel lonely and frightened at times. But I no longer feel worthless, stupid
and hopeless.;    I'll be looking for my letter in the paper. Don't let me
down.;    -- Your Friend in <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>;    DEAR <LOCATION>DURHAM</LOCATION> -- Here it is, and
it's a good one, too. I know of the great success many people have had with
Overeaters Anonymous and I recommend that group. Anyone who is interested
should send a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope to Overeaters Anonymous,

<HEAD>Beauty Pageant Contestant Hauled Off Stage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Marlise Ricardos</PERSON>, a drama major at the
<ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION>, was crowned <LOCATION>Miss California</LOCATION> in a
finale marred when another contestant pulled out a banner saying
``Pageants Hurt All People.''
   <PERSON>Michelle Anderson</PERSON>, 21, who represented <LOCATION>Santa Cruz County</LOCATION>, was
pulled from the stage by security guards <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> as she yelled
that the winner had bruises all over her body because she suffered
from a weight-loss illness, anorexia.
   The 26-year-old winner, who wore the banner of the city of
<LOCATION>Lomita</LOCATION>, had little to say about the incident.
   ``There's nothing I can really say at this moment that would be
in good taste so I'd rather not comment, but she and I don't see
eye to eye,'' said Miss Ricardos.
   The 65th <LOCATION>Miss California</LOCATION> pageant was the third at the <LOCATION>San Diego
Civic Center</LOCATION>, where it was moved from <LOCATION>Santa Cruz</LOCATION> after protests
with crowds up to 1,000 marred previous contests.
   Ten finalists chosen from a pool of 42 during preliminary
contests over the weekend participated in the finals televised
around the state. The judges rated the women on the basis of
swimsuit and talent competition and interviews.
   Miss <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, who wasn't one of the finalists, said she had
planned all year to stage the protest.
   ``The whole point is that pageants hurt all women,'' <PERSON>Miss
Anderson</PERSON> said outside the Civic Center. ``They hurt women who are
on the inside because they are bruised psychologically and
physically by what they must endure to become queens.
   ``Pageants hurt women on the outside because (the contestants)
are an icon that we must all look up to and that we're all supposed
to emulate, but that makes us unhealthy and promotes anorexia and
bulimia and cosmetic surgery.''
   Miss Ricardos will represent the state in the <LOCATION>Miss America
Pageant</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>. She also won <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> in
scholarships, wardrobe money and gifts.
   Miss Ricardos, first runner up the past two years, said she
would use the money to further her college education and career.
She sang ``I Dreamed a Dream'' during the talent competition.
   ``It's extremely exciting because I've been working on this for
six years,'' <PERSON>Miss Ricardos</PERSON> said of the pageant. ``It's a wonderful
way for women to pay for their education.''
   In previous years, pageant protesters have focused on racism and
sexism they say is promoted by the contest. But, with the contest
itself 65-years-old, protesters said they decided to focus on age
discrimination.
   ``We're here to celebrate women's diversity,'' said <PERSON>Ann
Simonton</PERSON>, a 35-year-old former model who led the protest by a <LOCATION>Santa</LOCATION>
Cruz-based group, <ORGANIZATION>MediaWatch</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Simonton</PERSON>, covergirl of the <DATE>1974</DATE> Sports Illustrated swimsuit
edition who has been arrested several times during previous
protests, wore a trash can with a banner that read, ``Mis-Erable.''
   ``I feel older women are ignored to a large degree in our
society and they're relegated to a trash can which is why I'm
emphasizing it by being dressed this way,'' <PERSON>Ms. Simonton</PERSON> said.
   Several dozen demonstrators wearing makeup, worn clothes and
wigs carried signs saying, ``Slaves to Stereotypes,'' ``There's
Life at 44, and ``Beauty Comes In All Types of Packages.''
   About a dozen police officers monitored the protests. There were
no arrests.
   Pageant organizers say the contest promotes the things for women
that protesters want, better education and equality in the work
place.

<HEAD>How Reagan Managed to Be President Without Aging in Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> donned white tie and
tails last week to attend a fancy dinner in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, he
confided to aides he'd had the elegantly styled suit made 40 years
ago, for the <DATE>1948</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's hard to believe, but it's true,'' said presidential
spokesman <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>, a man who is well-acquainted with the
battle of the bulge. ``I don't think he's even had it altered.''
   <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>, who leaves office <DATE>Friday</DATE>, bore the burdens of the
presidency for two terms and even weathered a harrowing
assassination attempt in <DATE>1981</DATE> not to mention a <DATE>1985</DATE> bout with colon
cancer and a few other surgeries.
   Yet, except for a few more wrinkles _ and some gray hair _ he's
retained a physique that defies the image of a 77-year-old
grandfather.
   Those close to him _ including first lady <PERSON>Nancy Reagan</PERSON> _ say it's
all due to a remarkable discipline, begun as a teen-age lifeguard
and honed as an actor, attentive to diet and physical fitness.
   ``He's in amazing health,'' said <PERSON>Dr. Larry Mohr</PERSON>, one of the
president's <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> physicians. ``It has to do with genes, but
also with his attitude. He's just always on an even keel.''
   <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has never been shy about the fact that he's religiously
followed a 9-to-5 office schedule, allowing plenty of time for rest
and relaxation. Over his eight-year presidency, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has spent
some 457 days in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, mostly on vacation at his ranch near
<LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> or in his old home town of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   Aides point out that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s sense of humor, and an ability to
avoid taking himself too seriously, may have helped keep him in
shape.
   Pictures of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, dubbed ``Rawhide'' by the <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION>,
adorn many <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> walls. One favorite shows the president in
jeans, workshirt and protective goggles, with chainsaw in hand and
biceps bulging, as he mows down wizened scrub oak trees on his
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ranch.
   The president chats often with his aides about his diet and how
he keeps healthy, <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said.
   He is so conscientious about using his body-building equipment on
a daily basis that he had it hauled to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> for the
three-day summit with Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>. ``He
worked out every night, after the meetings and before dinner,''
<PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said.
   ``I peel down and go into the gym,'' <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said in a recent
interview with <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>' ``60 Minutes,'' adding that he uses ``a
treadmill and various Nautilus weight equipment.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>, in the same interview, said she's had to temper
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s enthusiasm for the exercises _ suggested by his physicians
as a way to get back in shape after the <DATE>1981</DATE> shooting and chest
surgery _ because the president was adding so much muscle he was
threatening to outgrow his suits.
   ``I kept saying, `Stop. Don't increase any more. This is getting
too expensive!'' <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON> said with a laugh.
   Reagan keeps a constant watch on his weight _ hovering at 189 to
190 pounds with a 34-inch waistline _ by comparing himself weekly
with his personal physician, <PERSON>Dr. John Hutton</PERSON>, who also tries to hold
to the weight level.
   ``Every <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> we have a weigh-off,'' said <PERSON>Hutton</PERSON> recently. ``If
we're a pound or two over, we see who can get it off first.''
   <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>, who says she also tries to follow a daily exercise
routine, recalls that at one time in college she weighed 145 pounds,
but now weighs only 105 or 106 pounds.
   At a recent luncheon, the first lady pooh-poohed reports that she
was anorexic, contending that the worries over her husband's
shooting, as well as her parents' deaths, had caused her to drop
some pounds while in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>. With a big smile, <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>
eagerly scooped up a dessert of bread pudding.
   But the first lady made clear that the president's eating and
exercise habits are his alone. ``It's his own thing,'' <PERSON>Mrs. Reagan</PERSON>
said in the interview. ``I just think you have to have a
well-balanced, sensible diet. I'm not one for extremes.''
   Fitzwater, who has struggled with diets and poked fun at his own
stocky frame, shakes his head in wonderment at the president's
ability to be ``a very disciplined eater.''
   ``His whole life is very disciplined. ... He just doesn't let
himself go. He drinks a glass of wine at lunch for a state official
or a visiting dignitary. I don't think I've ever seen him take a
hard drink,'' <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said.
   The spokesman added that he's watched in wonder as <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> will
consume a green salad or Jell-O, even if others at the same table
are chowing down on a beef <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> _ which happens to be his
favorite.

WRESTLING: THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF PREPARING FOR A MATCH CAN GO BEYOND 
TECHNIQUE AND TRAINING.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
All week, you've sucked weight. 
</P>
<P>
You've practiced your guillotines, leg rides and banana splits. 
</P>
<P>
You're confident you'll be able to stick your man with a quick body lock, 
launch him with an E-ride and pin him with a ball-and-chain carry-over. 
</P>
<P>
You're no fish. You're no squid. 
</P>
<P>
You're a shark, a stallion . . . The best wrestler around. 
</P>
<P>
The language of wrestling is like no other in any high school sport. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's because when your face is being squashed into a sweaty mat, your 
body is being treated like a pretzel and your girlfriend is watching as you get 
pinned, there needs to be more than one way to say, "Ugh." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION>, which has some of the best high school wrestlers in the 
state, athletes who choose wrestling as their primary sport rarely do so 
without an understanding of the dedication -- or obsession, many would say -- 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I wrestled, I would think, 'What's so hard about that?' " said <PERSON>Ryan 
Holmes</PERSON>, a freshman at <LOCATION>El Modena</LOCATION>. "But oh man, I played football -- there's no 
comparison. People think Hell Week in football is bad, but wrestling practice 
is way harder. People have no idea how tough it is." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it be in their conditioning drills, dietary concerns or psychological 
war games, wrestlers, indeed, have it tough. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a look at the trials -- physically and emotionally -- a 
wrestler must go through to prepare for a match. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAME OF THE GAME: PAIN 
</P>
<P>
Imagine grabbing a door knob, squeezing it as hard as you can and holding that 
grip for six minutes. Your hand, wrist and forearm quickly begin to burn from 
the buildup of lactic acid, until even your shoulder and neck begin to ache. 
</P>
<P>
Now imagine this feeling taking over your entire body. 
</P>
<P>
That, former Loara Coach <PERSON>John Dahlem</PERSON> says, is only part of what wrestlers must 
deal with during the six minutes of their match. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe wrestling is the most demanding of all sports," said <LOCATION>Dahlem</LOCATION>, 
who led Loara to 10 consecutive league championships and two Southern Section 
titles in his 15 years as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to demean other sports, but wrestling is the only high school sport 
that you're in physical contact with one other person, going full bore all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
That is why, coaches say, wrestling practices must be so demanding. There is no 
better way to prepare an athlete for a match other than to simulate the highly 
competitive conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Although most practices begin with slow, easy warm-up drills, stretching and 
jogging -- all crucial for injury prevention -- the hardest part of the workout 
usually begins with several types of drills. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyon, there are stomach crunches, back and neck exercises and an endless 
variety of sit-ups, all done to strengthen different parts of the body. At <LOCATION>El 
Modena</LOCATION>, there are line drills -- <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> crawls, snake drills and Russian hops to 
name a few -- in which the athletes perform different wrestling moves in a 
continuous motion to build endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Then the athletes break into groups for round-robin style mini-matches. 
</P>
<P>
At <LOCATION>El Modena</LOCATION>, they call it the Ironman drill. Four of the athletes take turns 
wrestling each other for one-minute periods. When the whistle blows, the 
wrestlers change partners and start again. This routine continues for nearly a 
half-hour. Along with the encouraging yells from coaches, the room is filled 
with the grunts and groans usually heard during a fight scene in a bad western. 
</P>
<P>
When it's over, most of the athletes look as if they're ready to hit the 
showers. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck. They're only half way there. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything so fully consuming than using every body part, every 
muscle to full exhaustion," El Dorado Coach <PERSON>Frank Gonzales</PERSON> said. "But that's 
what these kids do every single day." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, more than once a day. During off-season camps, for instance, 
athletes are pushed harder than ever, as <LOCATION>El Modena</LOCATION>'s 105-pounder <PERSON>Danny Wells</PERSON> 
describes: 
</P>
<P>
"We had about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> of the kids quit during the two weeks I was there. It was 
really, really, really tough. They wake you up real early and you go on a long 
run. Then you buddy-carry (running with a guy over your shoulder) two miles 
into the back country and two miles out. Then you go on a Rambo run, going as 
far as you can with a guy on your back. 
</P>
<P>
"You come back and do technique work. Then you eat lunch. After that, you start 
the hard practice. That's the part most people can't handle. You just want to 
die. After that, you eat dinner, then you have a night session . . . Then you 
either run or lift weights before you go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
That camp lasted two weeks, said <PERSON>Wells</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Century League</ORGANIZATION> champion at 98 
pounds as a sophomore last year. 
</P>
<P>
"You see seniors there just break down in the corner crying," <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> said. 
"That's how freaked out people get. You never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MENTAL MOVES 
</P>
<P>
While a good deal of wrestling success comes from the physical training, an 
athlete's psychological state, namely his confidence, also is important. 
</P>
<P>
At the <ORGANIZATION>Five Counties Invitational</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last Saturday</DATE>, wrestlers from all over the 
state gathered for one of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s most highly contested tournaments. While 
some of the matches were going on, those waiting their turn stood along the gym 
wall, away from the fans and the action, rolling their necks, listening to 
personal stereos, trying to psyche-up. 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, one would clench his fist to his side and shout an 
encouragement to himself. Others would sit with their eyes closed, visualizing 
themselves winning their match. These pre-match moments, coaches say, are often 
crucial to a wrestler's success. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous fear factor involved with wrestling" that few people 
realize," said <LOCATION>Dahlem</LOCATION>. "It's a combat sport, really. So you really have to 
overcome a lack of courage, which is normal for most people. I had kids who 
were seniors come to me and say, 'Coach, I'm afraid.' Not everybody's so 
mentally tough. So there's a lot of mental preparation, a lot of psyching" that 
needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Most wrestlers say there is nothing worse than losing -- "I'd rather go through 
a 300-hour workout than lose," <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> said -- mostly because, unlike team 
sports, attention falls on only one person. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one-on-one out there and if you lose, there's no place to hide," <LOCATION>El 
Modena</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>Alan Clinton</PERSON> said. "(To keep going after losing) takes a lot of 
guts. Big egos can't survive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PASS THE CELERY STICKS 
</P>
<P>
While crash dieting has always been an inherent part of wrestling -- athletes, 
vying for one of 13 weight classes, often try to lose pounds to make a lower 
(and less competitive) weight class -- most coaches say they are, as a whole, 
better educated about nutritional needs. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyon, Coach <PERSON>Gary Bowden</PERSON> said losing weight is not encouraged and most of 
his athletes actually "wrestle up," into a higher class. Of course, other 
coaches might point out that Canyon, the county's top-ranked program with 
nearly 100 wrestlers, can afford to do so because it has more athletes from 
which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many quick weight-loss methods -- such as bingeing and purging, using 
diuretics and laxatives and exercising in rubber suits -- all have proven 
ill-effects and are still being used by wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Five Counties meet, one wrestler said he had thrown up twice that 
morning, a practice he admitted using frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the sad part of wrestling," <PERSON>Dahlem</PERSON> said. "I think it's a bad wrap that 
(bulimia and anorexia) are prevalent, but . . . yes, it is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note, there's the weighing in of wrestlers the morning before 
their match. 
</P>
<P>
Some wrestlers stand on one side of the scale, hoping to affect the weight. 
Some will cut their hair before they get on the scale. Others shave. "Even the 
14-year-olds with peach fuzz," <PERSON>Dahlem</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The funniest thing is the kids who will stand on their heads in the corner of 
the room before they weigh in," <LOCATION>Dahlem</LOCATION> said. "They'll stand on their heads and 
think that will make a difference. I even had one kid who weighed in standing 
on his hands." 
</P>
<P>
But despite all the hard work and pain, most wrestlers say one thing keeps them 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning," <PERSON>Wells</PERSON> said. "A win is . . . the ultimate. And when you stick a guy 
(pin an opponent), it's all yours."

<TEXT>     Health educator <ORGANIZATION>Carol Day of Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> adds, "The typical
college student skips breakfast, eats a light lunch and then crams a lot of
calories into one meal at the <TIME>end of the day</TIME>, as well as late-night
snacking.";   No wonder college administrators tell freshmen to expect to gain
15 pounds by the end of their first year. "And even that's gone up. It used to
be called the Freshman 10. Now it's the Freshman 15," says <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>,
dietitian <PERSON>Andrea Perkins.</PERSON>;   "The perception -- among college students
themselves as well as everyone else -- is that none of the students is eating
well," says Day, who is <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION>'s director of health education.;   Day
counsels about 160 students each semester about weight gain, eating problems
(anorexia and bulimia) and sports nutrition, as well as more basic problems
such as finding something decent to eat at the student cafeteria.;   But the
cafeteria isn't the biggest problem. "<PERCENT>Eighty percent</PERCENT> of the student body is
looking for something to eat that's fast, but not necessarily good for them,"
notes dietitian <PERSON>Judith Knapp</PERSON>, who teaches nutrition at <ORGANIZATION>Essex Community College</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Baltimore.</LOCATION>;   Unpopular vegetables;   <PERSON>Knapp</PERSON>'s own college-age son told her
he thought fast food must be good for him, because it was cheap and filling.; 
 "It's a good thing that Chinese and Mexican food is popular because they're
fast, but at least they use more vegetables and whole grains," she says.;  
Vegetables, in particular, are not a popular item among students. It's the one
item, <PERSON>Knapp</PERSON> says, that her students most consistently fail to eat. She urges
them to try the cooked vegetables at the cafeteria or, failing that, to have a
salad from the salad bar.;   "Any dark, leafy greens are good. Just forget the
iceberg lettuce -- it's all bulk and no vitamins.";   <PERSON>Allida Joyce of McLean</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, who has three children in college, believes that students are becoming
more aware of what they eat.;   <PERSON>Joyce</PERSON> says her son <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON>, a freshman at
<LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION>, eats low-calorie frozen entrees and makes homemade pizza with
vegetables, cheese and prepared Italian bread crust in his dorm microwave.;  
She says he skips breakfast and often ends up eating lunch at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME>, "but his
late-night snack is fruit, not junk food.";   Don't eat just one meal;  
Typical college eaters often skip breakfast, don't eat much lunch and save
most of their eating for dinner and late-night snacking -- exactly the routine
<PERSON>Knapp</PERSON> warns her students against.;   "You can't eat once a day -- that's the
blanket rule. You're just beating up on your own body if you do," <PERSON>Knapp</PERSON> says.
She likens it to forcing your car either to run on fumes or overloading it
with too much gasoline. "Most of the damage we do to our body comes when we
over-feed it.";   She advises students to carry fruit, nuts or granola bars
with them for snacking during the day. If they want to stop for a fast food
meal, she suggests Mexican fajitas or refried beans, or Chinese stir-fry with
vegetables because the higher fiber content will keep them feeling full
longer.;   Although fast food is not an ideally nutritious meal, most
dietitians realize it's a student favorite and needs to be part of a practical
eating plan.;   Ordering a midnight pizza or going out for a burger and fries
is done as much for the socializing as for hunger, <PERSON>Knapp</PERSON> says. "I tell them
that if they eat more veggies and lower-fat meals during the day, then they'll
have more flexibility to do their social eating of pizza and burgers at night."  </TEXT>

   Slashes in Mental-Health Benefits Start
   To Hurt Patients, Medical Officials Say

   A backlash against the soaring cost of psychiatric care
may be backfiring.
   In the never-ending search for ways to slow the growth of
medical bills, many companies in the past two years have
seized upon mental-health benefits. Staggered by annual cost
increases of as much as 50% and frustrated by illnesses, like
depression, in which "cures" can be elusive, many employers
have taken a cleaver to coverage for psychotherapy,
substance-abuse programs and similar services.

<TEXT>
   But the cutbacks, according to the medical community, are
beginning to hurt patients and their families. In the
extreme, say some psychiatrists, individuals who are suicidal
are being pushed out of hospitals long before such tendencies
can be reversed. More commonly, people who need counseling
for stress are finding that reimbursements for office visits
have been curtailed. Often the victims of the cuts are
children. Even those with chronic disorders are sometimes
booted from one treatment program to the next -- or bounced
from the medical system entirely.
   And the worst may lie ahead. Health professionals warn
that mental-health disorders that go untreated may develop
into medical problems, like ulcers or heart disease, and come
back to haunt corporate budget cutters in the form of even
larger bills.
   "It's a disaster," says <PERSON>Jonathan Slavin</PERSON>, director of the
counseling center at <ORGANIZATION>Tufts University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, who
notes that some students with severe depression or eating
disorders now find little help in their parents' insurance
plans. Sue <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Parents Support
Network</ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group that helps families with
emotionally disturbed children, says 30 days of lifetime
hospital care is all that many employers now pay for.
"Sometimes, you can't even get a good assessment in 30 days,"
she says.
   Medical providers, of course, aren't entirely selfless in
their concerns. Reduced benefits have meant reduced income
for many of them. Employers, meanwhile, argue that overly
aggressive physicians and hospitals have taken advantage of
mental-health plans, making some restrictions essential. Some
private psychiatric hospitals, for instance, coax individuals
into <MONEY>$600-a-day</MONEY> beds by quietly waiving <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> co-payments from
patients, says <PERSON>Richard B. Spitznass</PERSON>, vice president for
compensation and benefits at <ORGANIZATION>Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>.
   Once the patient is ensconced, "There's no financial
incentive {for the doctor or hospital} to move him into
lower-cost outpatient care," <PERSON>Mr. Spitznass</PERSON> says. "It's an
insidious problem."
   Still, interviews with state health officials, educators
and patients indicate that some employers have had a
knee-jerk reaction to such abuse, slashing benefits across
the board. As a result, they say, patients whose insurance
dollars are quickly exhausted are either being dumped into
state mental-health programs, which are often understaffed
and underfunded, or are simply going without care.
   In <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, for instance, only 18,000 of some 90,000
children who are severely emotionally disturbed will receive
help this year from community programs, says <PERSON>Ruth Coody</PERSON>,
director of child and adolescent services in the state's
<ORGANIZATION>Department of Human Resources</ORGANIZATION>. "We're just barely touching
the tip of the iceberg."
   Employers in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> now spend an estimated <MONEY>$17 billion</MONEY>
to <MONEY>$20 billion</MONEY> a year on mental-health services, and the
limitations on those benefits have affected both outpatient
and in-patient care. A survey last year by <ORGANIZATION>A. Foster Higgins
&amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION>, benefits consultants in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, found that
three-fourths of companies now limit -- to about <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> --
the annual payout for office visits. More than a third
require employees to pay a bigger share -- in some cases <PERCENT>50%</PERCENT>
-- of hospital bills for so-called behavioral care than for
other medical problems.
   In particular, companies have sharply reduced the lifetime
benefit for hospital care. Almost half of surveyed employers
have "capped" their payout at less than <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>, and about
one-fifth now pay <MONEY>$20,000</MONEY> or less -- figures that represent a
fraction of the cost to treat serious disorders.
   <PERSON>Manuel Ellcorie</PERSON>, a 47-year-old management consultant in
<LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, says his insurance plan was providing sufficient
coverage for his son's lengthy hospital treatment, including
one 14-month stay that cost about <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>. But in <DATE>1987</DATE>, the
lifetime benefit was capped at <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>. Since then, <PERSON>Mr.
Ellcorie</PERSON> and his wife have gone through <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> in savings
and have had to take out a <MONEY>$60,000</MONEY> home-equity loan to help
pay for their son's care.
   The <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY> cap, he says, is a "drop in the bucket -- it's
nothing if a child needs residential treatment." A struggle
to obtain help from state officials has, of late, provided
relief, <PERSON>Mr. Ellcorie</PERSON> says. But most families that turn to the
public sector find "no beds and no money," he says. "They're
left with few, if any, alternatives."
   Even when benefits provide for adequate care, families and
physicians say, insurers are pushing hard to suspend
treatment at the first hint of recovery. <PERSON>Linda Silber</PERSON>, a
psychologist in <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, says she recently hospitalized
a 13-year-old girl who was severely anorexic. The child's
weight had dropped to 72 pounds from 115 pounds in two
months, and -- in the hours before she was admitted for
treatment -- she had passed out three times. "She was
starving," <PERSON>Dr. Silber</PERSON> says.
   After almost three weeks of care, the girl's weight
stabilized temporarily at <MONEY>85 pounds</MONEY> -- at which point her
insurance company demanded that she be discharged from the
hospital.
   The problem, says <PERSON>Dr. Silber</PERSON>, was that treatment of the
underlying psychological problems had barely begun. "We had
to get her weight and nutrition up first," she says, "but she
still needed help." An appeal to the insurer finally earned
the child a two-week reprieve, but <PERSON>Dr. Silber</PERSON> expects the
struggle over the girl's care to continue. "These are the
kinds of battles we have to fight all the time," she says.
   A few companies are beginning to take what some physicians
and patients consider a more enlightened approach to
controlling mental-health costs. Among the most popular is
"carving out" the benefits from the rest of a company's
medical plan and having them administered by a company that
specializes in psychiatric care. After watching its
mental-health costs rise about <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> annually in the late
<DATE>1980s</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Harris Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, Fla.-based electronics
concern, hired <ORGANIZATION>American PsychManagement</ORGANIZATION>, a unit of closely
held <ORGANIZATION>Value Health Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Avon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, to help run its program.
   Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION>American PsychManagement</ORGANIZATION> provides a
network of therapists for <PERSON>Harris</PERSON> and monitors all psychiatric
hospital care. "We wanted to control costs without simply
cutting benefits," says <PERSON>Ron Wyse</PERSON>, director of compensation
and benefits at <LOCATION>Harris</LOCATION>, which has kept its own lifetime
maximum for hospital and outpatient care at <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>.
Moreover, the company had discovered that most of its cost
increases were coming from a single source -- in-patient
treatment of employees' children -- and that there was no
need to make wholesale reductions in mental-health benefits.
   Indeed, a recent study by the <ORGANIZATION>American Psychiatric
Association</ORGANIZATION> indicates that companies' horror stories about
the cost of treating mental illness may be exaggerated. The
study found that the overall cost of psychiatric care rose
about <PERCENT>13%</PERCENT> between <DATE>1986</DATE> and <DATE>1988</DATE> -- on a par with other
medical expenditures. But the study also shows that the cost
of treating children and adolescents jumped almost <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT>.
   "Simply putting in limitations may be shortsighted," says
<PERSON>John Erb</PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION>Foster Higgins</ORGANIZATION>. But some
companies, he adds, don't want to take the time -- or don't
have the time -- for a more measured approach. "It's cheap,"
he says, "it's easy, you don't have to hire a consultant, and
the effect is immediate."

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOMB: CASTING A LONG SHADOW; 
</P>
<P>
'DAY ONE' PROJECT MARKS STRONG CONTRAST TO OTHER SPELLING EFFORTS

<P>
If <ORGANIZATION>Aaron Spelling</ORGANIZATION> has heard the question once, he has heard it a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you doing a show like this?" 
</P>
<P>
The program in question this time is "Day One," a three-hour TV movie presented 
by <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> and produced by <ORGANIZATION>Aaron Spelling Productions</ORGANIZATION> about the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> decision 
to develop and drop the world's first atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Emmy Award-winner <PERSON>David Rintels</PERSON>, directed by veteran <PERSON>Joe Sargent</PERSON> and 
sporting a cast that includes <PERSON>Brian Dennehy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hume Cronyn</PERSON> from "Cocoon," 
<PERSON>Michael Tucker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Dysart</PERSON> from "L. A. Law," and <PERSON>David Straithairn</PERSON> from 
"Eight Men Out," the project -- which airs on CBS at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> -- is a far 
cry from the shows for which <ORGANIZATION>Spelling</ORGANIZATION> is best known: "The Love Boat," 
"<PERSON>Charlie</PERSON>'s Angels," "Dynasty," "Fantasy Island," "Mod Squad," "Starsky &amp; 
Hutch." 
</P>
<P>
Spelling is the first to complain that he never gets proper credit for the 
other programs he has made, such as the series "Family" and TV movies about 
anorexia nervosa ("Best Little Girl in the World") and drug addiction 
("Cracked-Up"). 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win. You just can't win," Spelling said, shaking his head sadly. "If 
you try to do something better than 'SWAT,' for example, instead of giving you 
credit for it, people say, 'What right does he have to do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even <PERSON>Rintels</PERSON> admits he was put off by <ORGANIZATION>Spelling</ORGANIZATION>'s flash-and-trash reputation 
when he was first approached to write the script for "Day One" by <PERSON>Bill Haber</PERSON>, 
the two men's mutual agent at <ORGANIZATION>Creative Artists Agency</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The first question I asked was whether I would have creative autonomy. And I 
received assurances that I would," explained <PERSON>Rintels</PERSON>, whose television credits 
include such meaty specials as "Sakharov," "<PERSON>Clarence Darrow</PERSON>," "Fear on Trial" 
and "Gideon's Trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Spelling who first had the idea to make the TV movie after reading 
"Day One: Before <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> and After" by <PERSON>Peter Wyden</PERSON> in <DATE>1984</DATE>. His reaction, he 
recalled, was "Wow. Wow. Wow." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, he thought about adapting the book for television. But did viewers 
need yet another drama about the atomic bomb? Spelling looked for the answer 
within his own family. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out that my daughter, who was 10 at the time, really knew very little 
about why the atomic bomb was built, who started it, what it did to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. And 
even though I think I read a lot, I realized that I never knew the real reason 
that we developed the bomb. And it was then that I said, 'Hey, can we buy this 
book?' " 
</P>
<P>
Spelling got hold of the galleys and immediately enlisted <PERSON>Rintels</PERSON> to write the 
script and co-produce the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The atomic bomb has dominated politics and international relations and debates 
on morality and philosophy for the last 40-odd years," <PERSON>Rintels</PERSON> said. "And it is 
still such a central part of all our lives that I can't imagine that there's a 
more important story than this." 
</P>
<P>
But getting someone to finance production was "a very, very hard sell," 
Spelling said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran producer was still under contract to <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> at the time, so he was 
obligated to take the project there first, even though he knew the network 
already had aired the movie "The Day After" and was unlikely to want to do 
another film about nuclear weapons so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"They just weren't interested in it," Spelling said. "Then we took it to <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, 
and they were fascinated." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt aware that <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> already had aired a 7-part <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> series, "Oppenheimer," 
that covered much of the same ground, however, <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> wanted to cut "Day One" from 
three hours to two. 
</P>
<P>
Then his agents took it to <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION>, which decided to fully underwrite the 
project as the third in its series of "AT&amp;T Presents" specials. 
</P>
<P>
"Without <ORGANIZATION>AT&amp;T</ORGANIZATION> saying, 'We want to do this with you,' we would never have 
gotten it on," Spelling said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rintels</PERSON> said that he based his script not only on <PERSON>Wyden</PERSON>'s book but also on two 
dozen other volumes about the period when <ORGANIZATION>The Manhattan Project</ORGANIZATION> was underway. 
</P>
<P>
He took care, he said, "to write this not from a <DATE>1980s</DATE> perspective but from a 
<DATE>1940s</DATE> perspective, when people were living in a very different world when there 
were specific practical and political dimensions beyond morality that were part 
of the debate over using the bomb." 
</P>
<P>
To keep an eye on the historical accuracy of the movie, the producers enlisted 
the help of <PERSON>James MacGregor Burns</PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION>Williams College 
Center</ORGANIZATION> for the Humanities and Social Sciences and the author of a trilogy on 
American history, "The American Experiment." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the movie "wonderfully authentic," <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> maintains that any controversy 
that results from its broadcast probably will center not on the film itself but 
on the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> decision to drop the bomb on <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and usher in the nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
To <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, the film portrays what he calls the "horrible calculus of death" -- 
the weighing of how many lives would be lost by dropping the bomb versus how 
many would be lost if the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> were to invade <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of agonizing over whether to use the bomb, and the film 
dramatizes the different points of view very effectively," he said. "It shows 
people fumbling and feeling their way to a decision. But I think there still 
will be a question in the minds of some viewers as to whether dropping the bomb 
was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Spelling denies that he wanted to make "Day One" in a bid for a career-crowning 
Emmy. But he also acknowledges that he didn't do it to win big ratings, 
especially up against <PERSON>Robin Givens</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> movie "Penthouse." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a chance -- and I hope this doesn't sound pretentious," 
Spelling said, "that maybe a modicum of the audience that likes my shows will 
say, 'Well, let's watch it. It's one of his.' Whereas maybe if some other 
company were presenting 'Day One,' they wouldn't. Because good, bad or 
indifferent, my name is synonymous with entertainment."
