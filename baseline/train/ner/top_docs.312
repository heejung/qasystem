   Restoring Bryant Park
   To Its Former Beauty

   We read with interest Raymond Sokolov's article on the
demise of Jennifer Bartlett's design for South Gardens at
Battery Park City at Manhattan's southern tip (Leisure &amp;
Arts, Oct. 16). As landscape architects for the Battery Park
City Master Plan and Phases I and II of the esplanade, we
agree with your writer Patti Hagan's assessment that the
gardens were inappropriate and unworkable.
   We should like to point out, however, that Mr. Sokolov's
article may have given the mistaken impression that Lynden B.
Miller had done the redesign of Bryant Park, behind the New
York Public Library. The new restoration work is based upon
designs by Hanna/Olin Ltd., the landscape architectural firm
retained by the Bryant Park Restoration Corp. in 1985. Since
that time, Hanna/Olin has been the prime landscape
architectural consultant for all aspects of the redesign and
restoration of the park. Ms. Miller is designing and
implementing one aspect of that restoration, the perennial
gardens. She is an excellent plants person and garden
designer, and has done an exemplary job in the restoration of
the Central Park Conservatory Gardens and new plantings
within the Central Park Zoo.

<TEXT>
   The goal of opening up the system of walls and hedges
mentioned in the article is but one of several proposed by
our office in <DATE>1986</DATE> that are based in part on research
previously performed by <PERSON>William H. Whyte</PERSON> and the Project for
Public Spaces. These include: increased visibility into the
park, increased circulation within the park, enhancement of
the formal French landscape design, increased public seating
and increased security.

NEW LOOK FOR PARK PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A landscape architect has been hired by disgruntled merchants to remove the 
grass in <LOCATION>Horton Plaza Park</LOCATION> and replace it with flowers and shrubs to discourage 
loitering by drug dealers and panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
But before work can begin, the plans must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>, said 
<PERSON>Ed Foster</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza Park committee</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The grass will be taken out and replaced with seasonal flowers, with hedges 
around the perimeter," Foster said. "We will suggest that plaques be put up to 
designate that the park, including the fountain, is a historical site." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said the estimated cost of the changes is <MONEY>$25,000</MONEY>, which will be covered 
by surrounding business owners and a vendor selected by the city to sell food 
and merchandise. If approved, renovations are expected to be completed in <DATE>July</DATE>, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wanted to improve access to the park, which has become dominated by 
street people, drug sellers and users, panhandlers, and people sleeping on the 
grass," said <PERSON>Daro Quiring</PERSON>, maintenance coordinator of <ORGANIZATION>Center City Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
To prove their point, the Horton Plaza management last year installed a video 
camera for five days in a window of <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s, the only store with an entrance 
on Broadway. The tape was edited into a 13-minute video that showed drug deals 
being made, people putting beer in the fountain, fights, and men urinating in 
cups, said <PERSON>Ron Oliver</PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Central City Assn</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time of the day you go to the park, you will see drug deals, and there is 
always someone with a bottle of booze," <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON> said. "It is against the law to 
drink in a public park. The homeless aren't the problem, although one may be 
the symptom of the other. Some homeless people are substance abusers." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to move these people out of the park and give it back to working 
people and to the city people who pay taxes," <PERSON>Foster</PERSON> said. "If we move them 
out, then they will be forced to go the centers that can provide help for their 
drug abuse." 
</P>
<P>
After merchants began complaining in <DATE>1988</DATE> that the problems were hurting their 
businesses, <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> Manager <PERSON>John Lockwood</PERSON> asked Quiring to establish a task force 
to seek ways to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Steps were taken to improve park conditions. Police patrols were added. 
Planters were removed because they were being used as urinals. Benches were 
removed, but will be returned after the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Oliver</PERSON> said that, after the city removed the benches near the <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON>'s 
entrance, pedestrian traffic increased <PERCENT>62%</PERCENT> in two weeks. He said that people 
would sit on the benches and intimidate customers entering the store. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first redesign for the park. In <DATE>1984</DATE>, while the shopping center 
was being built and the park was closed, a community participation process 
worked with landscape architect <PERSON>Lawrence Halprin</PERSON>. His design ideas -- including 
moving the fountain to the northwest corner of the park -- were rejected, and 
the city restored the park to its historical condition. The <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> 
architect said of the seven-month, <MONEY>$125,000</MONEY> project: "It is stupid to spend all 
this money to patch up a pipsqueak of a park." 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Quiring and representatives of <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza</ORGANIZATION>, the Park and 
<ORGANIZATION>Recreation Department</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Police Department</ORGANIZATION> and nearby businesses 
began meeting monthly, and they agreed about a month ago on redesigning the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage more people to use the park, the city plans to present art 
exhibitions, musical entertainment, and office luncheons, <PERSON>Quiring</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Although such activities may bring "desirable people to the park," <PERSON>Ron Buckley</PERSON>, 
a member of the city <ORGANIZATION>Historical Site Board</ORGANIZATION>, said he is unconvinced that the 
proposal is complete or effective by itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same problems in parks across the nation," he said. "And you don't 
see them rushing to change their parks' designs to solve their problems. An 
increase of police presence and enforcement will solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who is also marketing director of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Grant Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, said that, in 
the past two months, the hotel has lost <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY> in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients don't feel safe, especially walking at night and going to 
restaurants in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Linda Scott</PERSON>, 40, said that she sleeps in the park because there are not enough 
shelters to house all the homeless people in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"This is home to a lot of people," she said. We lay out here and don't hassle 
anyone. We pick up our own trash. This is our home. If they remove the grass, 
they will leave us lying on the dirt."

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: NATIONAL CITY'S CIVIC CENTER PLAN FALLS SHORT OF 
BEING ALL IT COULD 
</P>

<P>
What is it that stands out about <ORGANIZATION>National City</ORGANIZATION>? The Mile of Cars? A few great 
period Victorians? Beyond these images, many of us who don't live there have 
only hazy -- and not always positive -- impressions. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope to change this with a new civic center in the heart of 
town, scheduled to break ground later this year. Designed by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
architects <ORGANIZATION>Wheeler Wimer Blackman &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>, the government complex is 
expected to spur a new era of economic vitality and set a high architectural 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
The positive economic impact seems probable, but, as design goes, the project 
falls several notches below what it could have been, looking too much like a 
speculative office building and not enough like a prestigious, people-oriented 
new soul of a city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials invited about a dozen local firms to bid on the job -- not with 
designs, but prices -- and <PERSON>Wheeler Wimer Blackman</PERSON> was selected simply because 
its proposed fee of <PERCENT>4.85%</PERCENT> of the construction cost was less than half the next 
lowest bid, according to <PERSON>Arnold Peterson</PERSON>, the city's community development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks Aggressive Pursuit 
</P>
<P>
Such a process seems exactly opposite of the best way to get a good design, 
which is to choose the architect with the best ideas, then make a financial 
agreement. <ORGANIZATION>National City</ORGANIZATION>'s approach lacks the aggressive pursuit of fresh 
designs displayed recently by the cities of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>. Both held 
well-publicized civic center design competitions entered by local and national 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism from some local architects that such contests are useful 
mostly for generating publicity, both resulted in top-notch designs. And, 
despite local griping that locals get overlooked when the field is open to 
national stars, that didn't prove true. A local firm (PAPA) did <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s new 
<ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>, and the nationally known <ORGANIZATION>Charles Moore &amp; Urban Innovations Group</ORGANIZATION> 
got the civic center job in <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>. And, in <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, the public was 
invited to comment on designs before the architect was selected. In <ORGANIZATION>National 
City</ORGANIZATION>, comments have been heard only since selection. 
</P>
<P>
The project could have taken a number of directions, since there was no strong 
historic or neighborhood context. Nearby are used-car lots, auto body shops and 
other uses in older buildings of little architectural impact. The site is a 
sloping pie slice of land immediately south of the existing '60s civic center 
with its entrance on <ORGANIZATION>National City Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>, at the edge of <ORGANIZATION>Kimball Park</ORGANIZATION>, a 
wonderful green open space with tremendous potential. 
</P>
<P>
The architects responded with a building of white precast concrete and green 
glass. A circular plaza joining the new structure to the old civic center is 
the best thing about the design. Aligned with <ORGANIZATION>Civic Center Drive</ORGANIZATION>, this outdoor 
space will offer a warm invitation to pedestrians and motorists. Made of 
concrete and stone, with plenty of benches and a piece of public art at its 
center, this promises to be a great people place. Also commendable is the way 
the architects tucked two levels of parking out of sight, below street level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Inspired Move 
</P>
<P>
Locating the council chamber at the back of this plaza, as a sort of link 
between the old and new buildings, is also an inspired move. Symbolically, it 
puts the seat of important decisions in full public view. Architecturally, the 
council chamber is a low, minimalist building with a free-standing 
aqueduct-like arch out front that gives a sense of importance to the complex. 
Adjacent conference rooms cantilevered over the park will have dramatic views. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the plaza sets up a main entry axis that leads into the council 
chamber, the main entrance to the big, new building, the place of prime 
importance to the public, is off to the side. This is a missed opportunity to 
guide users into the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does it lack a strong entry treatment, but also this main building 
will tower over everything else nearby, including the park, with its expanses 
of lawns, palm trees and children's play areas. At seven stories, it will rise 
to about 120 feet in a neighborhood of one- and two-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the city feels the size is needed as a flexing of economic muscle, 
as a catalyst for a new wave of intense development. As such, the civic center 
is too harsh a gesture toward the people who will have to look up at its green 
glass walls from the park side. 
</P>
<P>
There could have been some great interaction here. A public plaza at the edge 
of the building would have eased the transition between park and civic center. 
Instead, the design turns a cold green shoulder on the park -- there's only one 
narrow entrance from this side, and nothing that engages pedestrians. The 
building, at least in model form, looks more like a <ORGANIZATION>Holiday Inn</ORGANIZATION> from the park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeing Workers Inside 
</P>
<P>
The architects say the green glass will allow people outside to see workers 
inside, giving some sense of human interaction to the project. But those of us 
who have wandered through the Golden Triangle or downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> know that 
when strong daylight bounces off colored glass, it becomes nearly opaque. 
</P>
<P>
From the street side, the feeling will be friendlier, but, aside from the 
circular plaza, with its weak link to the main building, not inviting. In terms 
of massing, the architects had the right idea, stepping three elongated 
cylinders back from the street. From some angles, though, the composition is 
awkward, and a cynic might compare the whole thing to a stack of Dough Boy 
pools topped by a giant carrying handle. 
</P>
<P>
Vertical white fins on the outsides of these rounded volumes do a nice job of 
breaking up the expanses of glass; they also pick up the vertical details on 
the old civic center next door. The city requested a building that would look 
different from all angles, and <PERSON>Wheeler Wimer Blackman</PERSON>'s design meets this 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a pet peeve, but it's hard to imagine people working in <LOCATION>San Diego 
County</LOCATION> and not being able to get fresh air. Yet the new civic center will have 
operable windows only on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Natural Light 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the architects have organized the new building's offices around an 
interior atrium space. But it won't rise to the top of the building, so it 
won't let in natural light. Surely, there would have been a way to locate this 
dramatic five-story volume such that it could tap some bona fide daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Against the exciting new civic centers developing in <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>, 
both fresh designs made with people in mind, <ORGANIZATION>National City</ORGANIZATION>'s looks weak. That's 
not for lack of size (60,000 square feet) or budget (<MONEY>$10.6 million</MONEY>), but simply 
because the building doesn't maximize the opportunity for a people-oriented 
government center that opens itself to the beautiful park next door. Perhaps a 
formal competition process, one oriented toward good designs and not the bottom 
line, would have led to more adequate solutions, or spurred these architects on 
to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the architects, the city apparently didn't ask for outside design 
advice. The result makes a strong case for not putting city officials without 
design experience completely in charge of such a significant project.

It's time to give the cities back to the people. 
</P>
<P>
At <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s "Shaping the City" symposium in <LOCATION>UC San Diego</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Mandeville 
Auditorium</LOCATION>, four internationally respected speakers hit relentlessly on the 
problems that those who shape cities -- architects, urban designers, planners, 
developers, politicians -- must solve if our planet, our country and <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION> are to be saved from self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The day served as a powerful warning that all is not well in <LOCATION>U. S.</LOCATION> cities. The 
heavy dose of social awareness came as a pleasant surprise, considering that 
last year's inaugural symposium was dominated by bold, egotistical designs 
rather than proposed answers to society's ills. Both events were intended as 
the single most visible means of generating interest in the university's new 
architecture school, scheduled to open in the <DATE>fall of 1992</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
This year's special guests' greatest works harmonize with cities. Uniformly, 
they called upon architects to think first of the people who use their 
buildings, instead of the grand illusions they can create. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Barton Myers</PERSON> is a professor at <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and heads his own 
large architecture firm. 
</P>
<P>
Urban planner and architect <PERSON>Stanton Eckstut</PERSON> has become legendary in 
architectural circles in recent years for his people-oriented master plan for 
<ORGANIZATION>Battery Park City</ORGANIZATION>, a huge development on the edge of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Developer <PERSON>James Rouse</PERSON> has built huge retail projects, often on waterfronts, 
that have helped revitalize such cities as <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. Having retired from development, he founded the <ORGANIZATION>Enterprise 
Foundation</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE>, which has the lofty goal of housing all of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s 
estimated 30 million poor people within the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> architect and urban planner <PERSON>Daniel Solomon</PERSON> has written design 
guidelines for cities in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>. Much of his work has 
reintroduced courtyards and other human features to multifamily housing. 
</P>
<P>
(An exhibition of the speakers' work will be in the campus' <LOCATION>Mandeville Gallery</LOCATION> 
through <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Introductions and transitions between speakers were handled by moderator 
<PERSON>Richard Bender</PERSON>, former dean of the <ORGANIZATION>College of Environmental Design</ORGANIZATION> at the 
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, who played prominent roles in writing a new 
master plan for <ORGANIZATION>UC San Diego</ORGANIZATION> and setting up the new architecture school. 
</P>
<P>
Bender set up the day's agenda by introducing two ways of viewing the 
contemporary city: "catastrophic" and "optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, most of what they're building is junk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Having acknowledged extensive problems in today's cities, including foul air, 
<PERSON>Bender</PERSON> said that, even so, he is not pessimistic. New technologies in biology, 
materials and social and ecological awareness, if properly applied, can serve 
as "the impetus for a new generation of innovation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Myers</PERSON> called for a "regional collective effort" from <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION>, a big-picture government coalition to coordinate the future of <LOCATION>Southern 
California</LOCATION>'s 200 cities. He said impoverished state and local governments have 
foisted community planning on developers, and that some new form of regional 
government needs to take back this responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
He coined the term vacant lottery to refer to existing zoning and planning 
ordinances "so crude and blunt" that they have a minuscule chance of producing 
good cities. 
</P>
<P>
Bad planning, not density and rapid growth, is the problem, <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said, noting 
that, during the <ORGANIZATION>19th Century</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> doubled its population gracefully in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Myers</PERSON> derided the <DATE>1960s</DATE> notion of urban renewal through scraping down blocks of 
small, old buildings and replacing them with block-size developments. He called 
for a blend of old and new, a move away from skyscrapers as the dominant 
downtown building type. Allowing more and smaller developments, instead of 
mega-block monsters, would let more people participate in making cities, and 
this diversity would be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
In his idealized vision, <ORGANIZATION>Southern California</ORGANIZATION> could become an efficient series 
of small- and medium-size towns, knitted together by more efficient 
transportation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Eckstut carried on the theme of designing cities with their users in mind, with 
wonderful public spaces and street-scapes, not grandstanding buildings, as the 
most important goal for architects and planners. 
</P>
<P>
An explanation of his work on <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION> underscored how <PERSON>Eckstut</PERSON> feels 
about architecture. He set out to make a "real city, not an attraction." Noting 
that the most successful buildings surrounding Central Park are the most 
retrained, he said, "New Yorkers rely on buildings which are not famous." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION>'s 92 acres were left as public open space, 
the most significant being a waterfront esplanade for pedestrians. Both cars 
and pedestrians move through the project; <PERSON>Eckstut</PERSON> believes urban vitality is 
enhanced by carefully mingling the two. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strongest evidence of <ORGANIZATION>Eckstut</ORGANIZATION>'s success in creating a peaceful, 
homey urban environment at <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION> is the building designed by 
architect <PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON>, who has a tendency toward cartoonish abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are not moved by it," <PERSON>Eckstut</PERSON> said of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s low-key <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
building, "and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, at 76 the senior expert at the conference, summed up his philosophy when 
he said that "it's not shape, form, space, structure. It's people we've got to 
be building for." 
</P>
<P>
His talk, the only one presented without the aid of slides, came off more as a 
moving sermon on social responsibility than the practical advice handed down by 
other speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse quoted these figures to make his point about the low-income housing 
crisis: a <PERCENT>26%</PERCENT> annual increase in the nation's homeless, of which there are now 
perhaps 750,000; an estimated 42,000 people in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> sleeping in cars, 
garages and other makeshift shelters; abut 16 million American households 
surviving on less than <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> a year, half of which goes toward rent. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have got to change in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Rouse</PERSON> said. "The people at the bottom 
have to become more important than the people at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon drew applause when he opened by describing the "problem of affluence, 
the poverty of what affluence has bought," the mediocrity of expensive new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Local notables on hand included <LOCATION>San Diego City</LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON>Ron Roberts</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San 
Diego City</LOCATION> Architect <PERSON>Mike Stepner</PERSON>, developer <PERSON>Ernest Hahn</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Centre City 
Development Corp</ORGANIZATION>. Executive Vice President <PERSON>Pam Hamilton</PERSON> and home builder <PERSON>Tawfiq 
Khoury</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, <PERSON>Bender</PERSON> led the four featured speakers through a joint discussion 
with the new dean of the <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> architecture school, <PERSON>Adele Naude Santos</PERSON>, who was 
sitting in to glean ideas for the new school. 
</P>
<P>
Santos stressed her commitment to making the school a "think tank" for solving 
social problems, and an active part of the community, rather than an "elitist, 
hermetic school sitting on top of the mesa." 
</P>
<P>
One left with some hope that, during the '90s, more architects will use their 
talents to address pressing urban problems they often ignored during the '80s.

existing Disneyland-style tourist mall will take its cues from the old police 
station on Market Street, a large part of which will form the heart of the new 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in the late <DATE>1930s</DATE>, the station was one of the last projects from the 
offices of <ORGANIZATION>Quayle Brothers &amp; Treganza</ORGANIZATION>. Some of its ornate Spanish Colonial 
details -- especially on two entry arches and a tower -- make it one of the 
finer remaining <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> buildings from the latter end of a romantic period in 
local architecture that began in <DATE>1915</DATE> with the richly detailed buildings in 
<LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is this: Can we trust the <LOCATION>Seaport Village</LOCATION> developers, led by 
<PERSON>M. B. Taubman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lee Stein</PERSON>, to come through with the commitment the project 
deserves? 
</P>
<P>
Such a commitment will mean dollars, probably tens of thousands, to give the 
project the detailing it needs. Otherwise, it will join the ranks of the local 
Stepford family, just another drone. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, one of the biggest local firms, isn't an obvious choice for the project. 
Its work, spanning 60 years in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, has generally tended in recent years 
toward large, often disappointing corporate build 
</P>
<P>
ings. <ORGANIZATION>First National Bank</ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Centre</ORGANIZATION>, at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and B Streets, 
is one example. Its greatest single shortcoming is its failure to involve 
pedestrians at the street level, a problem that would be even more intolerable 
at people-oriented <LOCATION>Seaport Village</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the Seaport addition, the firm made a conscious decision to steer 
clear of a slick, easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
At Hope's downtown offices recently, project architect <PERSON>Bruce Green</PERSON> brought out 
the firm's initial design, an attempt to contrast, rather than work with, the 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I thought we needed a glass pavilion or something out front, like 
<PERSON>I. M. Pei</PERSON> added to the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION>," Green said, pointing out just such a bauble. 
But, during four years of design work, the approach shifted to one of 
harmonizing with the police buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The project looks inviting. Arched police station entries to be preserved on 
Market and <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Highway</ORGANIZATION> will send a romantic call to pedestrians. A new 
entry on <ORGANIZATION>Kettner Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> near Market (soon to become the realigned Harbor 
Drive) appears to mirror the existing architecture in scale and form, but <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> 
said the detailing has not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling that <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION>, who has historic-preservation background, would 
love to see authentic plaster-cast details applied. But such quality is rare in 
<DATE>1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
As for the inside of the project, it will emphasize shops and restaurants 
grouped around a large L-shaped courtyard the developers call their "Night 
Court." For one cover charge, patrons can do justice to a variety of 
restaurants and night spots, including a "jazz and blues club." 
</P>
<P>
Like the exterior decoration, the design details of the interior shop facades 
are still up for grabs. A soon-to-be-hired consultant will work with Hope on 
guidelines here. Inappropriate materials such as large commercial aluminum 
windows should be written out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Compliments go to the developers for including people-oriented elements in 
their project, such as a 300-seat open-air amphitheater, a new water's-edge 
<PERSON>Ferris</PERSON> wheel and the wonderful <DATE>1890</DATE> Looff carrousel, to be moved to a central 
location next to a new, man-made pond. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening along the waterfront has as much to do with the spaces between 
buildings as with the buildings themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment of <ORGANIZATION>Harbor Drive</ORGANIZATION> is just part of waterfront plans that also 
include the potentially stunning "linear park," now being created by landscape 
designers <PERSON>Peter Walker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martha Schwartz</PERSON>, with local architects <ORGANIZATION>Austin Hansen 
Fehlman Group</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this long, narrow strip of landscaping and art, which will tie 
pedestrian, auto and trolley circulation neatly together, will extend down the 
new Harbor Drive nearly to the edge of the Seaport addition. 
</P>
<P>
Green said thick landscaping placed to camouflage the new parking garage and an 
extra-wide pedestrian strip at this corner will help relate <LOCATION>Seaport Village</LOCATION> to 
the linear park. 
</P>
<P>
Water figures prominently in the expansion. Taubman, founder and chairman of 
<LOCATION>Seaport Village</LOCATION>, has called the theme "water, water everywhere," including 
fountains and the new central pond by the carrousel. 
</P>
<P>
As for tying the project to the existing <LOCATION>Seaport Village</LOCATION>, the older complex 
doesn't have a thing to do with this '80s Spanish Colonial revisited, and it's 
a bit too theme-park-oriented anyhow. So scale, not style, will link the new 
Seaport to the old. The back of the addition will include smaller-massed 
buildings that open onto the pedestrian space behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Several fine old palms ring the police station, both singles and impressive 
clusters. Landscape architects <ORGANIZATION>ONA Inc.</ORGANIZATION> have recommended keeping them, which 
makes both historic and economic sense. According to <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION>, replacement 
groupings of six or so mature trees could cost <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY>. 
</P>
<P>
There are several good signs here. With this project, <ORGANIZATION>Hope</ORGANIZATION> has a chance to set 
an example for the other giant <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architectural firms. If the architects 
are sticklers for detail, and the developers don't balk at spending for 
quality, the project's completion sometime in <DATE>1992</DATE> could prove that it is 
possible for corporate-size architecture machines to turn out sensitive, 
human-scale projects.

DESIGNS FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING -- WITH CHILD CARE IN MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of child-care facilities in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION> may be in the 
hands of 11 young architects from the <ORGANIZATION>Southern California Institute of 
Architecture</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The students recently gathered at the <ORGANIZATION>Warner Center Marriott</ORGANIZATION> to showcase their 
innovative designs for low-income family housing, which may be pooled and 
eventually built on a 7.8-acre site in <LOCATION>Canoga Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Integral to their designs are housing and commercial spaces that are tied 
together, providing a mini-community where residents would live and work -- and 
where child care would be available for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors within ARCH (Architectural Response to <ORGANIZATION>Community Housing</ORGANIZATION>), a design 
studio at the school that promotes low-income housing, have guided the students 
for 15 weeks as they have drawn and built prototypes of their communities. Also 
advising the students are <ORGANIZATION>L.A. Family Housing Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, which has developed 
affordable family housing for low-income working families for six years and the 
2-year-old Center for <ORGANIZATION>Childhood Creativity</ORGANIZATION>, run by <ORGANIZATION>Cal State Northridge</ORGANIZATION> in 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner Center</ORGANIZATION>, which creates and implements innovative child-care solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the students of the importance for homelike environments," said <PERSON>Dianne 
Philibosian</PERSON>, project director of the childhood center. "We've begun to focus on 
providing spaces, but not what happens in those spaces. I tried to communicate 
that," she said, adding that one particular architect really understood her 
concepts. Philibosian walked to a scale model of The Village, designed by <PERSON>Robin 
Morris</PERSON>, a fourth-year student at the architectural institute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center of Model 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the model is a child-care center fronted by a park. Fanning 
out from the facility are commercial zones, including professional offices, 
restaurants and crafts stores for children. Residential units, as in all the 
students' designs, are above retail spaces. Families living in the housing 
units, which curve in a semi-circle around the child-care center, could easily 
look out on the park and center should they want to see their children at play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking of the playful aspects of children when I designed the space," 
said <PERSON>Morris</PERSON>, 32, who lives in <LOCATION>Redondo Beach</LOCATION>. A pyramid-shaped, stepped fountain 
with mini waterfalls is near the child-care center, and water also flows around 
a circular entrance leading up from the underground parking facility and 
through the tree-lined park. A bridge spans <LOCATION>Canoga Avenue</LOCATION>, depositing visitors 
in the project's first retail zone, which contains clothing, video and 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are people, and one needs to be in touch with them, rather than 
applying our adult concepts of what a children's area should look like," 
<PERSON>Philibosian</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea behind this development is that you can work, live and play in 
one tight community," <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The designs are very unlike <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION>," said <PERSON>Arnold Stalk</PERSON>, executive director of 
<ORGANIZATION>L.A. Family Housing Corp.</ORGANIZATION> "But that doesn't mean it won't work. It's an attempt 
to solve a multitude of problems with one development -- affordable housing 
needs, economic development and child care. 
</P>
<P>
"Land is so scarce and expensive now that you're going to see more residential 
and commercial development." 
</P>
<P>
Stalk said residents could lease commercial space or entire families could be 
sponsored by a business while their children are cared for nearby. Families 
would stay in the community for a maximum of five years until they were 
established financially to move on to their own enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Stalk, ARCH and others are negotiating to purchase the land from the <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power</ORGANIZATION>. Should the project be realized, the 
students will pool their ideas under the supervision of established architects 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason I designed the project was to realize and discover the 
child within me," <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said. "As we grow older, we grow full of logic. The 
playful aspect gets denied."

FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: New York's oasis of the park - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's summertime in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and the heat is driving you crazy. The streets
are steaming, the hydrants are streaming and only the oasis of the park can
help to keep you sane. There cannot be another city in the world where a
park is of such importance. It is like <ORGANIZATION>St. Mark</ORGANIZATION>'s Square in <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION> - an
outdoor drawing room. But it is so much more than that. It really is rus in
urbe and it was intended to be by its nineteenth century creators.
When the Street Commissioners of <DATE>1807</DATE> impressed the island of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> with
an immovable grid, they felt that the miles of waterfront around the
shoreline would be enough to give the city breathing space and plenty of
room for exercise and recreation. They were wrong. Commerce and the piers
took up the waterfront and soon the highways, the bridges, the entries and
exits from the tunnels filled up the desireable waterside places. There was
a need for a lung.
It was not until <DATE>1858</DATE> that the city held a competition for the <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION>.
It was won by a writer, <ORGANIZATION>Frederick Law Olmsted</ORGANIZATION> and an architect, <ORGANIZATION>Calvert
Vaux</ORGANIZATION>. Their scheme was called 'The <ORGANIZATION>Greensward</ORGANIZATION>'.
There was something very original about their plan at the time. It was
nothing to do with the classical ideas of the <DATE>eighteenth century</DATE> but it was
deeply romantic and picturesque. It was to look like untamed nature but
every inch of it was to be planned and designed. It was also to have whole
areas where the denizens of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> could promenade in a more formal manner
 -taking the air in a leisurely way - long before the advent of jogging and
manic movement. The Park was also to house some cultural activities and
among the rustic arbours and fountains music would be played and civilised
pleasures provided.
Many of the wishes of the founders of the park have been fulfilled over the
years. But there was a time when the joys of Central Park were overshadowed
by its dangers. In the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s</DATE> vandals and criminals began to ruin
the Prk systematically. Only in the recent past has the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s
<ORGANIZATION>Parks Department</ORGANIZATION>, with the considerable help of the private fund raising
group known as The <LOCATION>Central Park Conservancy</LOCATION>, been able to reverse the
decline and begin the restoration of much of the park to the original
design.
One of the areas that has been the subject of much restoration work and
expenditure has been the park's mall, which stretches from 66th Street to
72nd Street on the east side of the park. An area just to the east of this
mall is known as the Concert Grounds and here stands the remarkably handsome
and appropriate <ORGANIZATION>Naumburg Band</ORGANIZATION> shell - a gift to the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in <DATE>1921</DATE>
from a music enthusiast, <PERSON>Elkan Naumburg</PERSON>. The limestone band shell resembles
a giant ruined portion of a Roman building and its great coffered half-domed
ceiling, while looking marvellous also projects the sound of an orchestra or
band perfectly. The shell is inscribed 'Presented to the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
and its Music Lovers', and it is not just a handsome object in the park but
also a monument to the generosity of a private citizen. It has hosted
concerts by <ORGANIZATION>Duke Ellington</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Percy Grainger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sousa</PERSON>, <PERSON>Irving Berlin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Benny
Goodman</PERSON> and many others. It is, amazingly, to be demolished by <ORGANIZATION>The Parks
Department</ORGANIZATION>.
The row over this perverse decision has grown and grown and complex legal
proceedings are underway to try and save this part of the history of <LOCATION>Central
Park</LOCATION>. If it is demolished it will be a great loss and it is hard to
understand the reasons for its removal. These arguments are that it is
'obsolete for today's amplified concerts' and the <ORGANIZATION>Central Park Conservancy</ORGANIZATION>
are opposed to permanent concert sites in the park. I would have thought
that many musicians are anxious to play in 'natural' acoustic conditions
today, and that there is more than enough amplification of sound in a city
like <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. The other main argument seems to be that the shell was not
part of Olmsted's original design and that it partially blocks a view from
the newly restored <LOCATION>Wisteria Pergola</LOCATION>. The other argument seems very spurious
 -that the band shell attracts the homeless, drug dealers and vandalism. As
one opponent of the demolition has written, 'if that argument is used in
favour of the demolition of historic buildings then <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> should start
with the demolition of <ORGANIZATION>Grand Central Station</ORGANIZATION> and work down.'
The argument over the demolition of an agreeable, useful and important
monument in <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION> demonstrates how vulnerable historic buildings are.
I suspect that the 'improvers' of Central Park who give generously of time
and money think that they are doing the right thing.
But in fact they are demonstrating the fallibility those who believe in
'authentic restoration'. As the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Robert Stern</PERSON> has written:
'Central Park is no longer a 'pure' work of Olmsted and <PERSON>Vaux</PERSON>'s. It is a
palimpsest with many layers . . . History demands that we take a longer
view, preserving all the best elements of the past, which is invariably more
complex and varied than simply returning the clock to a particular moment
will allow. The past should not be erased.'
How right he is. But will politicians see the subtlety of his point or will
they wantonly destroy one of the survivors of the <ORGANIZATION>City Beautiful Movement</ORGANIZATION>?
The band shell may be a small object in a great city, but the fight over its
future concentrates the mind on the complex history of our surroundings. It
is too easy to wipe out the generosity of the past and too easy to believe
in the false gods of 'authentic restoration' to remove anything that may get
in their way.

<TEXT>
<P>
The problem of designing a large theater has challenges similar to those in 
creating a convention center: A boxy large space must somehow be concealed 
within a graceful shell. 
</P>
<P>
Architect <PERSON>Arthur Erickson</PERSON>, using bold repetitive forms in concrete, has made 
the gigantic new <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Convention Center a fine piece of design. His 
excellent exterior detailing makes this building attractive to those arriving 
by car or foot. It's a landmark project for downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Architects <ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble Yudell</ORGANIZATION> have not been nearly as successful in their 
design of the second phase of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s Civic Center, a <MONEY>$55.4-million</MONEY> complex 
that will include 1,500- and 400-seat theaters for stage productions, an arts 
complex and a community meeting center. 
</P>
<P>
The final design for the project, to be built in <LOCATION>Grape Day Park</LOCATION> downtown, site 
of the new <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> completed in <DATE>1988</DATE>, was unanimously approved by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Escondido City Council</ORGANIZATION> this month. The city hopes to break ground next <DATE>fall</DATE>, 
with completion expected in <DATE>1993</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the architects have created wonderful outdoor spaces, the bulky 
100-foot-tall "fly tower," which houses the mechanical equipment above the 
stage, sticks out like a sore thumb, unbroken by architectural detailing or 
other visual devices that could make it attractive. Other potential problems 
include jarring combinations of roof treatments and a confusing variety of 
window and wall treatments used in an attempt to break down the mass of he main 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that the Civic Center complex will have 
insufficient daytime attractions such as food stands or recreation 
opportunities to make the park a success as a people place. 
</P>
<P>
Months of refining should have resulted in a well-composed treatment of the big 
box that will house the necessary stage equipment over the main theater; at 100 
feet, the "fly tower" will be the Civic Center's most noticeable feature. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the theater, at least as depicted in model form, will sit hard by 
<LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION>, its bulk unbroken by details that could tie it to the rest 
of the Civic Center complex. Its flat roof, for instance, sets it oddly apart 
from the pavilion and gable roofs used on the other of the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Project architect <PERSON>Renzo Zecchetto</PERSON> said that softening the impact of this 
looming box was the architects' single toughest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The designers elected to place most of the design interest at the middle level 
of this and the other buildings in the second phase of the Civic Center 
project. Groups of small windows, varied wall angles and assorted architectural 
detailing will break these facades into forms a human being can get close to 
without feeling overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and community leaders have expressed a desire for some softening 
of the theater's stark appearance. Suggestions include a screening wall in 
front of the building's prominent northern face, detailing on the building wall 
itself or a system of vine-covered trellises and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Zecchetto said the architects favor the last approach, partly because it is 
most economical. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the design game, though -- when at least a year has already 
gone into the project -- one expects a more polished design solution. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the architecture are also disappointing. The choice of roof 
forms is puzzling. Some roofs will have the traditional pitched form, while 
others, as on a few small towers, will be flat. The flat towers don't always 
merge well with the slanted roofs nearby. It is difficult, though, to make a 
final pronouncement on these. The material has not been chosen, and these could 
make the actual buildings look much different from cardboard models. Flat tiles 
or a seamed metal are among the choices being considered. 
</P>
<P>
There is other evidence the architects did not arrive at a consistent, coherent 
design vision: Pedestrians will not notice from the ground level, but there is 
something jarring about the way the big theater's northern wall drops from a 
flat roof on top to a slanted roof above the first floor, with twin buttresses 
flying above it. 
</P>
<P>
It is at the level of the pedestrian, in fact, that the architects appear to 
have done their strongest design work. 
</P>
<P>
All along, the design of the entire Civic Center complex, including <PERSON>City Hall</PERSON>, 
has been driven by its situation in the 17-acre <LOCATION>Grape Day Park</LOCATION>, a huge open 
space in the heart of the city. The intention was always to keep this setting 
park-like, even with the addition of several buildings. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble Yudell</ORGANIZATION> put their buildings at the edges of the property, near the 
streets, preserving the interior as open space. A walk through the complex 
should prove to be an interesting stroll among the various plazas and 
courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the new theater complex will be off <LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION> on 
the western edge of the project. Here, a wide plaza of slightly ascending 
levels will lead pedestrians in between the large theater to the north and the 
nearby community theater, set behind a pergola at <LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Valley Parkway</LOCATION>. The pergolas, along with many rows of trees, will soften the 
experience of entering the complex. 
</P>
<P>
The pergolas here and elsewhere are the same sort of vine-covered 
column-and-trellis walkways that became the trademark of legendary <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
architect <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON> early in this century. Some modern architects even use 
arches like the ones <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> favored. 
</P>
<P>
In the Civic Center project, every building has at least one courtyard related 
to it, and most have several. Some are intended to be used for various 
gatherings. A courtyard off the back of the smaller theater could, for example, 
become an outdoor performance space, <PERSON>Zecchetto</PERSON> said. He said that he hopes that 
the city will eventually have the money to add doors to the back of this 
theater's stage so that it can open onto the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the architecture, a larger concern has to do with the programming of 
the Civic Center complex -- the kinds of uses selected for this public park. 
The <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> and theaters will dominate the site, with the community meeting 
building and arts complex as secondary uses. What will the new complex offer 
the person who comes to the park in search of a recreational or cultural 
experience during daylight hours? 
</P>
<P>
A library might have been a good choice, but the city just built a new one 
three blocks away at 2nd Avenue and <ORGANIZATION>Kalmia Street</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
There are now no concrete plans for the kinds of things that make Balboa Park 
so successful: food pushcarts, small cafes, and many 
</P>
<P>
choices of exhibitions, performances, films and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Both Zecchetto and <PERSON>Rolf Gunnarson</PERSON>, assistant executive director of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Escondido Community Development Commission</ORGANIZATION>, say they have considered such 
ideas. A small food outlet and bar in the lobby of the larger theater might be 
open during daylight hours, and a kitchen in the community meeting building 
could be used to produce food for park visitors as well as for those attending 
meetings at the building. Food vendors are also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
These kinds of people-oriented things will be essential to animating the 
well-planned outdoor spaces, which will undoubtedly be the new complex's 
triumph.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: A field of the highest quality - Colin Amery reviews
three further finalists for the FT's architecture prize to be awarded today

<TEXT>
We are almost there. Tomorrow's FT will publish the name of this year's
winner of the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times Architecture Award</ORGANIZATION>. He or she will receive
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s most independent and highly regarded architectural prize at a
luncheon in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> today. The long period of judging and visiting is over
and there will be an opportunity in tomorrow's paper for an assessment of
the significance of the award and of the state of architecture in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>
today.
Previous articles have looked at five of the eight shortlisted schemes:
<LOCATION>Stansted Airport</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Cranfield Library</ORGANIZATION> by Sir <PERSON>Norman Foster</PERSON> and Partners;
and <ORGANIZATION>Bracken House</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Schlumberger Research</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bedfont Lakes</ORGANIZATION> (IBM) Business
Park by <PERSON>Michael Hopkins</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Partners</ORGANIZATION>. The remaining three schemes on the
shortlist represent three very different types of building. The Queen's
Stand at <ORGANIZATION>Epsom Racecourse</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Richard Horden Associates</ORGANIZATION>; the new car park in
<LOCATION>Chichester</LOCATION> by <LOCATION>Birds Portchmouth</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Russum</PERSON>; and <ORGANIZATION>Winchester City</ORGANIZATION> offices
designed by the <ORGANIZATION>Hampshire County Architects</ORGANIZATION> department.
Epsom clearly needed an elegant new stand that could comfortably house the
crowds on <ORGANIZATION>Derby</ORGANIZATION> day as well as provide a centre for functions and
entertainments throughout the year. The choice of <PERSON>Richard Horden</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Associates</ORGANIZATION> as architects was a brave one. The practice is known for its
structural and engineering expertise and its experimental approach to
building technology. The client, <ORGANIZATION>United Racecourses</ORGANIZATION>, has, by choosing a
radical approach that is both refined and practical, acquired a new stand
that is the acme of contemporary design.
The problem of new buildings in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s cathedral cities has been tackled
in two very distinctive and different ways in <LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chichester</LOCATION>.
Both cities have mixed reputations when it comes to new architecture, but it
is fair to say that both places take great care about any additions to their
ancient fabric.
Winchester has a county architects department that is one of the most
distinguished in the country. Under the direction of <PERSON>Colin Stansfield-Smith</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Hampshire</LOCATION> has acquired a high reputation, particularly for its new schools
and other educational buildings. The site of the new offices, which are
partly occupied by the architects' department, is a typical, tight
Winchester street, but one that had been spoiled in earlier days by the
erection of a large multi-storey car park. The new offices try to be both
modern and vernacular, adopting a traditional pitched roofline but lighting
the offices through a completely glazed wall. This gives it the appearance
of working in an atrium, except that it has a remarkable view over the city.
An agreeable courtyard garden designed around an existing tree is another
feature of the scheme, adding to its overall picturesque qualities. The
pavement passed close to one side of the new block and this facade has been
enlivened by the presence of specially commissioned stained glass windows.
Chichester had a problem. The city is keen on traffic management and car
parking is a crucial element of any traffic scheme. The decision to build a
large, new multi-storey car park on the edge of the city centre but outside
the old city walls was a controversial one. Chichester decided to commission
a relatively unknown young practice, Birds Portchmouth and <PERSON>Russum</PERSON>, and the
resulting building is extraordinary in many ways.
The architects decided not to diminish the scale of the whole operation but
to make the car park look like a new set of city defences. The length of the
building is broken up by the fat, circular staircase towers which are built
of perforated brick work. Once you have parked your car the journey from the
car park into the city centre takes you on a series of high level pedestrian
bridges from which you can view the ancient town.
Even in these recessionary years the quality of the best of British
architecture is very high. Choosing a winner for the FT award will not be
easy.

ARCHITECTURE: CHANGES NEEDED IN ESCONDIDO CIVIC CENTER'S PHASE TWO

<TEXT>
<P>
The problem of designing a large theater has challenges similar to those in 
creating a convention center: A large, boxy space must somehow be concealed 
within a graceful shell. 
</P>
<P>
Architect <PERSON>Arthur Erickson</PERSON>, using repetitive, bold forms in concrete, has made 
the gigantic new <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Convention Center a fine piece of design. His 
excellent exterior detailing makes this building attractive to those arriving 
by car or foot. 
</P>
<P>
It's a landmark downtown project for downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Architects <ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble Yudell</ORGANIZATION> haven't been nearly as successful in their design 
of the second phase of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s Civic Center, a <MONEY>$55.4-million</MONEY> complex that 
includes 1,500- and 400-seat theaters for stage productions. 
</P>
<P>
The final design for the project, to be built in <LOCATION>Grape Day Park</LOCATION> downtown, which 
includes the new <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> completed in <DATE>1988</DATE>, was unanimously approved by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Escondido City Council</ORGANIZATION> last week. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to break ground next <DATE>fall</DATE>, with completion expected in <DATE>1993</DATE>. In 
addition to the theaters, the project will have an arts complex and a community 
meeting center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the architects have created wonderful outdoor spaces, the bulky 
100-foot-tall "fly tower," which houses the mechanical equipment above the 
stage, sticks out like a sore thumb, unbroken by architectural detailing or 
other visual devices that could make it attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential problems include jarring combinations of roof treatments and a 
confusing variety of window and wall treatments used in an attempt to break 
down the main theater's mass. There is also 
</P>
<P>
a possibility that the Civic Center complex will have insufficient daytime 
attractions -- food stands, recreation and other forms of enjoyment -- to make 
the park a success as a people place. 
</P>
<P>
Months of refining should have resulted in a well-composed treatment of the big 
box that will house the necessary stage equipment over the main theater; at 100 
feet, this "fly tower" will be the Civic Center's tallest, most massive 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the theater, at least as depicted in model form, will sit hard by 
<LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION>, bulk unbroken by details that could tie it to the rest of 
the Civic Center complex -- it's flat roof setting it oddly apart from the 
pavilion or gable roofs used on the rest of the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Project architect <PERSON>Renzo Zecchetto</PERSON> admitted that softening the impact of this 
looming box was the architects' single toughest challenge. Instead of calling 
attention to this mass with architectural fussiness, the designers elected to 
place most of the design interest at the middle level of this and the other 
buildings in the second phase of the Civic Center project. Groups of small 
windows, varied wall angles and assorted architectural detailing will break 
these facades into forms a human can get close to without feeling overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, instead of causing the larger theater's bulk to fade into the background, 
the lack of detailing up high only makes it stick out like the proverbial sore 
thumb, at least on the model. 
</P>
<P>
But the architects aren't finished yet, <PERSON>Zecchetto</PERSON> said. City officials and 
community leaders have expressed a desire for some softening of the theater's 
harsh mass. Options include a screening wall in front of the building's 
prominent northern face, detailing on the building wall itself or a system of 
vine-covered trellises and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Zecchetto said the architects favor the last approach, partly because it is 
most economical. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the design game, though, when at least a year has already gone 
into the project, one expects a more polished design solution. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the architecture are also disappointing. The choice of roof 
forms is puzzling. Some roofs will have the traditional pitched form, while 
others, as on a few small towers, will be flat. Sometimes, the flat towers 
don't merge well with the slanted roofs nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult, though, to make a final pronouncement on these roofs. The 
material hasn't been chosen, and could make the actual buildings look much 
different than a cardboard model. Flat tiles or a seamed metal are among the 
options being considered. 
</P>
<P>
There is other evidence the architects didn't arrive at a totally coherent 
design vision, the type of consistency which makes the new <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Pacific 
Associates Planners</ORGANIZATION> and Architects of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> such a success. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians won't notice from the ground level, but there's something jarring 
about the way the big theater's northern wall drops from a flat roof on top to 
a slanted roof above the first floor, with twin buttresses flying above it. 
</P>
<P>
Along <LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION>, the architects have softened the theater's mass with 
many combinations of windows and wall forms, but the array of shapes and angles 
seems jarring, at least on the model. 
</P>
<P>
At the level of the pedestrian, the architects appear to have done their 
strongest design work. 
</P>
<P>
All along, the design of the entire Civic Center complex, including <PERSON>City Hall</PERSON>, 
has been driven by its location in the 17-acre <LOCATION>Grape Day Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s 
miniature <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, a huge chunk of open space in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The intention was always to keep this setting park-like, even with the addition 
of several new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble Yudell</ORGANIZATION> responded by pushing their buildings to the edges of the 
property, near the streets, preserving the interior as open space. A walk 
through the complex should prove to be an interesting stroll between the 
various plazas and courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the new theater complex will be off <LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION> on 
the western edge of the project. Here, a wide plaza of slightly ascending 
levels will lead pedestrians in between the large theater to the north and the 
nearby community theater, set behind a pergola at <LOCATION>Escondido Boulevard</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Valley Parkway</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Pergolas here and elsewhere are the same sort of vine-covered 
column-and-trellis outdoor walkways that became legendary <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect 
<PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>'s trademark early this century. Some even use arches like the ones 
<PERSON>Gill</PERSON> favored. The pergolas, with many rows of trees, will soften the experience 
of entering the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Every building has at least one courtyard related to it; most have several. 
Some are intended to be used for various gatherings. A courtyard off the back 
of the smaller theater could become an outdoor performance space, <PERSON>Zecchetto</PERSON> 
said. Eventually, he hopes the city will have the money to add doors to the 
back of this theater's stage so that it can open to the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the architecture, a larger concern has to do with the programming of 
the Civic Center complex, the kinds of uses selected for this public park. City 
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> and theaters will dominate the site, with the community meeting building 
and arts complex as secondary uses. What will the new complex offer the person 
who comes to the park in search of a recreational or cultural experience during 
daylight hours? 
</P>
<P>
A library might have been a good choice, but the city had already built a new 
one three blocks away at 2nd Avenue and <ORGANIZATION>Kalmia Street</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
There are no now concrete plans for the kinds of things that make Balboa Park a 
success: food pushcarts, small cafes, a variety of spontaneous performers and 
many choices of exhibitions, performances, films and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Both Zecchetto and <PERSON>Rolf Gunnarson</PERSON>, assistant executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Escondido's 
Community Development Commission</ORGANIZATION>, say they have considered such ideas. A small 
food outlet and bar in the lobby of the larger theater might be open during 
daylight hours, and a kitchen in the community meeting building could be used 
to produce food for park visitors, not just for meetings within the building. 
Food vendors are also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
These kinds of people-oriented uses will be essential to animating the 
well-planned outdoor spaces, which will undoubtedly by the new complex's 
triumph.

<TEXT>     The city staff is recommending that one of <PERSON>Vallette</PERSON>'s favorite trees -- a
copper beech -- be planted in his memory at one of his favorite places in the
city -- <PERSON>Shinn</PERSON> Park.;    "We feel it will be a nice addition," said <PERSON>Catherine
McKenzie</PERSON>, a city analyst. "Presently, there are none growing at any city
park.";    <ORGANIZATION>Vallette</ORGANIZATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Fremont Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the
historical architectural review board, helped prepare the <ORGANIZATION>Shinn Park</ORGANIZATION> master
plan, which includes an arboretum.;    The historic <PERSON>Shinn</PERSON> ranch was one of the
first nurseries in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and many of <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>'s 80,000 trees can trace
their ancestry to the <PERSON>Shinn</PERSON> operation. Some of the trees at the park are more
than 100 years old.;    <PERSON>Vallette</PERSON> owned and operated his own landscape
architecture business in <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> for more than 25 years and taught landscaping
at <LOCATION>West Valley College</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Saratoga.</LOCATION>;    Dedicating trees to people is rare in
<LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION>, said city spokeswoman <PERSON>Karen George</PERSON>. The only record she could find
was the dedication of a 32-tree Central Park grove in <DATE>1969</DATE> by the family of
<PERSON>Jay Gomez.</PERSON>; WATER, MONEY FLOW: Speaking of trees, the landscaping price tag
for the <ORGANIZATION>Alameda County Water District</ORGANIZATION> project on <LOCATION>Mission Boulevard</LOCATION> near
Interstate 680 will top <MONEY>$200,000</MONEY>. But it includes a sidewalk, planting of
mature trees and a demonstration garden to show developers and property owners
how to landscape in a desertlike environment, district <ORGANIZATION>General Manager Jim
Beard</ORGANIZATION> said. The fee for the landscape architect, <PERSON>Andrea Lucas</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Associates</ORGANIZATION>,
is <MONEY>$11,650</MONEY> of that.;    Once the landscaping is in -- sometime this <DATE>spring</DATE> --
the big job begins. In back of the landscaping and wall already built in
<LOCATION>Mission San Jose</LOCATION> will go a <MONEY>$30 million</MONEY>, 21-million-gallon-a-day water
treatment plant that will cover the area's needs to the year <DATE>2010</DATE>. Southern
<LOCATION>Alameda County</LOCATION>'s water comes <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> from wells, with the rest coming from
the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Water Department</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Aqueduct.; MORE ON
TREES: A new <LOCATION>Fremont</LOCATION> outlet on Albrae Street for the <ORGANIZATION>San Jose-based Tire
Service Co.</ORGANIZATION> (its first outside <LOCATION>Santa Clara County</LOCATION>) is involved in a plan to
plant 150 oak trees next month at <LOCATION>Shoreline Park</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Mountain View</LOCATION>. <PERSON>James
D'Amico</PERSON>, the company president, said that part of the proceeds from a recent
tire sale will pay for the project overseen by the 6-month-old <ORGANIZATION>Treedom Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
The tree-planting group was founded by two <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> businessmen, <PERSON>Gary
Cohn</PERSON> and <PERSON>Adam Snitzer</PERSON>. <PERSON>Snitzer</PERSON> said they hope to plant 10,000 trees in
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> this year. He said that Treedom is looking for local groups to help
plant trees. For more information on Treedom, call 1-800-TREEDOM.; NAMES,

ARCHITECTURE: THE LANDSCAPE AS A PARABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the din of traffic and buzz of busy sidewalks, landscape architects <PERSON>Pamela 
Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Katherine Spitz</PERSON> take refuge in the tranquillity of a tiny downtown 
park they designed on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
"In this very urban space we've called upon metaphor, narrative and journey to 
evoke a special sense of place," <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> says. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, this new vest-pocket park, named the <ORGANIZATION>Broadway Spring Center</ORGANIZATION>, 
celebrates <PERSON>Biddy Mason</PERSON>, a nurse, midwife and former slave who, a century ago, 
opened a refuge for black families at this location. A mural at the park's 
entrance memorializes <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION>'s long and charitable life. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because the graceful <DATE>1893</DATE> Bradbury Building backs onto the park, 
this urban space evokes the memory of Spring Street and Broadway in their 
social and commercial glory in the <DATE>first decades of the 20th Century</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Predating the architecture and the street itself is the recollection of the 
country lane in the midst of a cow pasture that later became Spring Street, 
once <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' main financial thoroughfare. Burton explains that the grove 
of camphor trees in the center of the park "narrates" the site's country lane 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain -- composed of a series of pipes constructed of copper, stainless 
steel and concrete -- mimics the profile of an oil refinery, a metaphor for the 
industries that funded the city's early prosperity. The present is represented 
by the small retail outlets lining the park, businesses that represent 
Broadway's resurgence as a commercial hub, this time serving <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Their imaginative emphasis on metaphor, narrative and journey has placed <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> 
and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> among the leaders of a new wave of younger designers who are 
rethinking the role of landscape architecture in relation to the city. From 
their small office in a brick building in the industrial section of <LOCATION>Santa 
Monica</LOCATION>, the two women have collaborated with some of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>'s most 
avant-garde architects. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Morphosis</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Thom Mayne</PERSON> says he "likes the way <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> deal with 
landscape as a set of emotional and intellectual ideas. They're are no longer 
mere pretty horticulturists supplying plants, but actual conceptualizers of the 
urban scene, and their concepts are deeply poetic, like the best architecture. 
Since both <PERSON>Pamela</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> were trained as architects as well as landscape 
designers, they understand how we think and so can integrate their ideas 
seamlessly with ours." 
</P>
<P>
The architects at <ORGANIZATION>Morphosis</ORGANIZATION> collaborated with <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> on the winning 
entry for the Performing Arts Pavilion in the proposed Arts Park in the 
<LOCATION>Sepulveda Basin</LOCATION>. The plans call for most of the complex to be underground, "to 
preserve the integrity of the surface plane and honor the urban grid that 
dominates the Valley," <ORGANIZATION>Mayne</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
Working with <ORGANIZATION>Barton Myers Associates</ORGANIZATION> in the design of the <ORGANIZATION>Cerritos Community 
Arts Center</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> helped knit the architecture with its 
surroundings by creating "outdoor rooms" such as an Actors' Garden, which 
expresses its dramatic metaphor in a symbolic "tragic" weeping willow and a 
"comic" monkey puzzle tree. 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> create landscapes as parables," said <ORGANIZATION>BMA</ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON>Jonathan 
Hankin</PERSON>. "Their depth of thought is wonderful and adds great resonance to the 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
For their entry in the <ORGANIZATION>Napa Valley Domaine Clos Pegase Winery</ORGANIZATION> competition, with 
architect <PERSON>Robert Mangurian</PERSON> and sculptor <PERSON>James Turrell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> devised 
a Garden of Seven Mysteries that included a "Devil's Chase" and several "Spirit 
Mounds." The purpose of these landscape elements was "to symbolize the 
transition between day-to-day consciousness and the states of dreams, 
disturbances and ecstasies that wine provokes," according to the text that 
accompanied their submission. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a painter before she became an architect and then a landscape 
architect, <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> is accustomed to the use of visual metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask, 'What are our myths?' That is always the first question," she 
said. "In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> we have the myth of the wilderness fused with an overlay 
of settlement expressed in landscape patterns imported from <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>. We have to experiment with the tensions this juxtaposition 
generates, and feel our way through at last to a truly local urban tradition. 
Developing our own landscape is vital to creating our own sense of identity in 
this strange and unique environment." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> first met <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Pistoia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s nursery-garden 
capital. A native <LOCATION>New Yorker</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> had worked in a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> plant nursery 
while still a student. <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> but grew up in the 
<LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION>, was employed by <PERSON>Frank Gehry</PERSON> as a model builder before she qualified 
as an architect (and later a landscape architect), and these varied backgrounds 
seemed to both partners to mesh perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"We love working together, though we often disagree vehemently to the point of 
verbally duking it out," <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said. "Pamela provokes the confrontation, while 
my way is to sulk. It's a great way to get on." 
</P>
<P>
Burton and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> are in total agreement about the need to develop a truly local 
landscape philosophy for <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
They say that three main principles should form the basis of this regional 
philosophy: appropriateness; a vision of landscape as a true form of 
architecture, and an appreciation of the symbolic value of plants. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriateness demands that local landscape, now dominated by a "salad" of 
imported varieties from all over the world, should shift to patterns based on 
the region's native chaparral such as the manzanita and native live oak. As a 
form of architecture, landscape should be used to define spaces and knit 
buildings to the terrain to provide "direction, function and aesthetic 
pleasure." And as an appreciation of the symbolic value of plants, horticulture 
should be linked to its history, including its ancient or contemporary 
mythologies. 
</P>
<P>
"By consciously calling upon these symbolic values," <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> said, "landscapes 
can work at conceptual and metaphoric levels as well as the purely 
horticultural." 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>' fragmented urban sprawl <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> perceive an urgent 
need to "reinforce connections." They suggest that major boulevards, such as 
Olympic, should be developed as linear gardens scaled to the movement of cars. 
"The automobile is a permanent part of our urban landscape, and has played a 
major role in giving shape to the city," <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> said. "Yet few landscape 
architects have given thought to the ways in which we can make the experience 
of motoring through the city more pleasurable while taming the car and tuning 
it into the visual rhythms of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Such linear gardens need to be varied, the designers explain. Our endless 
boulevards pass through many different districts, and each stretch should be 
keyed to the character of its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> points to the section of <LOCATION>San Vicente Boulevard</LOCATION> that runs 
through <LOCATION>Brentwood</LOCATION>, marked by a central median planted with South African coral 
trees. She suggests that, by these distinctions, motorists as well as 
pedestrians are made aware of the contrasts between one part of town and 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying such specific concepts, <PERSON>Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spitz</PERSON> sense an urgent need to use 
landscape as a means to create a sense of comfort and meaning amid the stress 
and confusion of a modern metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
They quote UC <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> urban sociologist <PERSON>Clare Cooper Marcus</PERSON> to express the 
core of their philosophy: "Under the inexorable march of technology and urban 
growth, and the increasing sense of insecurity these advances bring in their 
wake, people yearn for a place to call home in a world in which almost everyone 
is in a sense homeless."

   One of the more bizarre garden stories since <ORGANIZATION>Eden</ORGANIZATION> has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist <PERSON>Jennifer Bartlett</PERSON>. 
And if she and the <ORGANIZATION>Battery Park City Authority</ORGANIZATION> have their way, her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden "artwork" in the downtown complex. 

   South Gardens, as the <PERSON>Bartlett</PERSON> scheme is called, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
It could cost taxpayers <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to install and <ORGANIZATION>BPC</ORGANIZATION> residents <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> a year to maintain. 
Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens, <ORGANIZATION>South Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, as now planned, will die from congestive garden design. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s previous work, which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world, often took gardens as its nominal subject. 
Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the <ORGANIZATION>BPC Fine Arts Committee</ORGANIZATION> think she had a literal green thumb. (<PERSON>Ms. 
Bartlett</PERSON> would not discuss her garden for this article.) 

   Last year she boasted to HG magazine: "I'd never looked at a garden in my life." 
And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA, a <ORGANIZATION>New York State</ORGANIZATION> public benefit corporation: "The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden, which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain." 

   Undeterred, the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect <PERSON>Alexander Cooper</PERSON>, who claimed he had never visited, much less built, a garden, and said of the project, "I don't view this as a landscape. 
I view this as a building." 
The third principal in the South Gardens adventure did have garden experience. 
The firm of <ORGANIZATION>Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects</ORGANIZATION> had created <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Strawberry Fields</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare Garden</ORGANIZATION>. 
The BPCA called its team a "stunning" collaboration. 

   After four years, though, the South Gardens design is <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> uncollaborated <PERSON>Jennifer Bartlett</PERSON>. 
She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall. 
But for <ORGANIZATION>South Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them. 
In a letter to the BPCA, kelly/varnell called this "arbitrary and amateurish." 
The landscape architects were expelled from the garden in <DATE>July</DATE>. 

   All the while, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> had been busy at her assignment, serene in her sense of self-tilth. 
As she put it in a <DATE>1987</DATE> lecture at the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Graduate School of Design</ORGANIZATION>: "I have designed a garden, not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip." 
Moreover, she proclaimed that "landscape architects have been going wrong for the <DATE>last 20 years</DATE>" in the design of open space. 
And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend "five or <MONEY>six thousand dollars</MONEY> . . . on books that I ultimately cut up." 
After that, the layout had been easy. 
"I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail." 
<PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things." (This was never a problem with <ORGANIZATION>South Gardens</ORGANIZATION>, because the client had long since given in to <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s every whim.) 

   Last year the public was afforded a preview of <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s creation in a tablemodel version, at a <ORGANIZATION>BPC</ORGANIZATION> exhibition. 
The labels were breathy: "Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design . . . a rose garden, herb garden, serpentine garden, flower fields, an apple orchard . . . organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form `rooms' . . . here and there are simple architectural forms, a whimsical jet of water, a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid, and chairs of every sort to drag around. . . . 
At the core of it all is a love for plants." 

   Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed. 
They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly. 
<PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s little rooms left little room for plants or people. 
Kelly/Varnell had put South Gardens' carrying capacity at four people per room, or about 100 humans overall. 
This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist's own digs: "My loft was 50 by 100 feet, so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room." 

   Inside the grid were 24 of these plant cells jammed full of clutter. 
One she made into a topiary rec room, replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger, TV, piano and chairs. 
In another, she requisitioned topiary MX missile cones -- costing <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY> each -- in heights up to 20 feet. 
Another she stuffed with eight "rectilinear hedges" for a topiary geometry lesson in the right-angling of plants. 
In the herbal lounge she specified a "plaid knot garden" decor. 
She ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting, and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans. 

   In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit, a "zinc sink," a "huge fishbowl with carp" and a "birdcage with cockatoos." 
Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house, where, she suggested, a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter. 

   In another compartment called the <ORGANIZATION>Linden Bosque</ORGANIZATION>, 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet. (Lindens need about 36 feet.) 

   One thing about the <PERSON>Bartlett</PERSON> plan was never in doubt: It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists. 
<PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> blithely suggested calling upon "semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance." 
Furthermore, she had insisted on paths so narrow (five to eight feet) and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- couldn't maneuver. 

   Then, to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> had thrown up windowless walls (brick, lattice, hedge) eight to 10 feet tall, casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade. 
It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in <LOCATION>South Gardens</LOCATION> without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of Gro-Lites. 

   Finally, flouting the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION>'s wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside <LOCATION>Esplanade</LOCATION>, prized for its expansive views of <LOCATION>New York Harbor</LOCATION>, the Statue of Liberty and <LOCATION>Ellis Island</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall. 
She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront, blotting out the city's great natural water features, the harbor and the river. (Within her garden, she has decreed a waterfall, a rill, ponds and other costly, trivial waterworks beside the Hudson.) 

   While the model was still on view, <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan Community Board</ORGANIZATION> 1 passed a resolution against <ORGANIZATION>South Gardens</ORGANIZATION>. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Parks Council</ORGANIZATION> wrote the BPCA that this "too `private' . . . exclusive," complex and expensive "enclosed garden . . . belongs in almost any location but the waterfront." 
<PERSON>Lynden B. Miller</PERSON>, the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park's <ORGANIZATION>Conservatory Garden</ORGANIZATION>, recalls her reaction to the <ORGANIZATION>South Gardens</ORGANIZATION> model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: "<LOCATION>Bryant Park</LOCATION>, as designed in <DATE>1933</DATE>, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped. 
By removing the hedges and some walls, the <ORGANIZATION>Bryant Park Restoration</ORGANIZATION> is opening it up. 
It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants." 

   The three urban horticulture experts with <ORGANIZATION>Cornell Cooperative Extension</ORGANIZATION> weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began: "We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed." 
They then addressed the decidedly "questionable safety of . . . a complex garden of endless hiding places. 
The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small `rooms' insure . . . that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime." (At <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> had declared: "There are going to be problems with safety . . . 
I'm not going to address questions of safety]") 

   Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>South Gardens</ORGANIZATION> design somehow continues on, seemingly impervious to reason, stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications. 
BPCA President and CEO <PERSON>David Emil</PERSON> hopes to negotiate a seawall that could "be significantly more visually permeable." 
And by substituting yet another landscape architect, <PERSON>Nicholas Quennell</PERSON>, he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the "artistic vision" of a "truly great artist." 
After four years of no progress in this direction, it is doubtful any viable collaboration with <PERSON>Ms. Bartlett</PERSON> will suddenly now be possible. (<PERSON>Mr. 
Quennell</PERSON> has said he plans to go with the grid, regardless.) There is still time, however, for Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> or <PERSON>Fabian Palomino</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION> board, to prevent this topiary "Tilted Arc." 

   These statesmen might take counsel from <PERSON>William Robinson</PERSON>, author of "The English Flower Garden" -- the gardener's bible since <DATE>1883</DATE> -- who seems to have had a <PERSON>Jennifer Bartlett</PERSON> in mind when he wrote: "Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden. . . . 
It is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants."

ARCHITECTURE: IS GASLAMP RIGHT SPOT FOR CONDO TOWER?

<P>
Developer <PERSON>Neil Senturia</PERSON>, a former television sitcom writer, is about to spring 
some high drama on the city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia wants the city to approve a 325-foot-high building in the historic 
Gaslamp Quarter downtown, an area zoned for a maximum of 125 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Several key people within the city's urban planning system are opposed to the 
project's height, including City Architect <PERSON>Mike Stepner</PERSON>; <PERSON>Max Schmidt</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Centre 
City Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s urban planning expert, and <PERSON>Pam Hamilton</PERSON>, CCDC's 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming months, <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> will try to persuade the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> to go 
against the advice of its top planners, arguing that the design fits in with 
nearby high-rises. Going against aides' advice would not be unprecedented. Last 
year, the council approved a 38-story luxury condominium project on lower 
Broadway, despite <PERSON>Stepner</PERSON>'s reservations about its height and bulk. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said they won't make a decision until they get a good look 
at <LOCATION>Senturia</LOCATION>'s project, probably this <DATE>summer</DATE>, after an environmental impact 
report is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The site <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> has optioned (he doesn't own it yet) for the project, <LOCATION>Park 
Plaza</LOCATION>, is bounded by 5th Avenue, K Street, 3rd Avenue and Harbor Drive, at the 
southern entrance to the <DATE>Gaslamp Quarter</DATE> across from the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention 
Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$75-million</MONEY> complex would include 25,000 square feet of retail space and 
150 
</P>
<P>
condominiums. The building would have a six-story base and a 27-story tower, 
set close to K Street and 100 feet back from 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>, a short, wiry, articulate, gregarious man and a preference for crisp 
dress shirts and well-polished shoes, has been working as a developer in <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> since <DATE>1985</DATE>. Some of his projects include the <ORGANIZATION>Union Bank</ORGANIZATION> building at 5th 
and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> avenues in <LOCATION>Hillcrest</LOCATION>, One Harbor Drive (a pair of 41-story 
downtown luxury condo towers scheduled to break ground <DATE>June 15</DATE>), a single-room 
occupancy hotel at 4th Avenue and Fir Street and a large parking structure 
being built on 6th Avenue, between A and Ash streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> laid out his argument for Park Plaza last <DATE>Friday</DATE> in his offices in a 
downtown high-rise, where he enjoys sweeping views of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The project has already gone through many design revisions. Senturia initially 
worked with <ORGANIZATION>Arquitectonica</ORGANIZATION>, the hip, slick, <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> firm, but its design 
apparently didn't please either <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> or city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some of the poorest site planning and design I'd seen," said <PERSON>City 
Councilman Ron Roberts</PERSON>, the lone council member trained as an architect. "There 
were four buildings, with two on Harbor Drive, and none of the architecture or 
site planning related to anything around it." 
</P>
<P>
Senturia now agrees that the scheme wasn't right for the location. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>'s argument in favor of his 325-foot tower is that, because several 
larger high-rises are about to be built 
</P>
<P>
nearby along Harbor Drive (including his own One Harbor Drive), and because the 
Park Plaza site actually stretches beyond 4th Avenue (outside the western 
boundary of the historic district), his tower is really as much a part of 
intense adjacent redevelopment as it is a part of the low-scale historic 
district. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't placate people like <PERSON>Howard Greenberg</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Gaslamp Quarter Planning 
Board</ORGANIZATION> member who is converting the low-rise Pioneer Warehouse to apartments, 
across K Street from <LOCATION>Senturia</LOCATION>'s site. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought long and hard for the increase to 125 feet, and I thought that was 
pushing the envelope," <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON> said, referring to the area's initial height 
limit of 75 feet. "For someone to come in over 300, I think, is pushing the 
envelope too far." 
</P>
<P>
Architect <PERSON>Ralph Roesling</PERSON>, who sits on the Gaslamp board, prepared a computer 
model of the <ORGANIZATION>Gaslamp Quarter</ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>'s project, to study building 
heights and bulk. Roesling also helped write the plan that convinced the city 
to increase the height limit to 125 feet from 75 feet in select cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too high," <PERSON>Roesling</PERSON> said of Park Plaza. "That project is 
definitely within the <LOCATION>Gaslamp Quarter</LOCATION> district, and they're asking for 325 
feet. That would be so out of scale with everything else, I think it would be 
wrong." According to Roesling, the tower would cast large shadows across 5th 
Avenue in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, besides towering over surrounding buildings. 
</P>
<P>
High-rise units generally bring premium prices, and <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> said a lower 
building would be "less economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, several <DATE>Gaslamp Quarter</DATE> businesses have struggled or died 
during delays in the building of the Horton Plaza shopping center and the <ORGANIZATION>San 
Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION>. However, even after those projects opened, many 
businesses continued to stagger, and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Gaslamp Quarter Council</ORGANIZATION> 
(now <ORGANIZATION>Gaslamp Quarter Planning Board</ORGANIZATION>) began thinking that a few large new 
projects, probably hotels, would help turn business in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
When the city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> wrote a plan to limit new buildings to 60 feet (75 
in some cases), the <ORGANIZATION>Gaslamp Quarter Council</ORGANIZATION> commissioned its own height study. 
The conclusion: buildings up to 125 feet should be considered for four large 
parcels, including <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>'s. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>San Diego City Council</ORGANIZATION> passed a Gaslamp planning ordinance solidifying this 
policy late last year, with <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>'s project excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Judged without consideration for height, the present design is a sound piece of 
architecture, though not the masterpiece that <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> claims could spawn a 
whole new phase of downtown architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the six-story portion of the project, along 5th and K, looks very 
good, with <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> promising to use high-grade stone such as granite, brick 
and ceramic tile on the base, and reinforced concrete panels for the tower. 
</P>
<P>
Low-rise facades along K and 5th are well articulated, and these buildings 
would be punctuated by bay windows echoing the bay windows found on many other 
Gaslamp buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia rightly described the site as the gateway to the <PERSON>Gaslamp Quarter</PERSON>, an 
important "transition" block. The corner of the project closest to Harbor Drive 
would be anchored with a low, open pavilion. Broad stairs would lead from 5th 
Avenue to second-level terraces. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the project's back portion is crucial because it would face the 
pedestrian-oriented "linear park" designed for the city under the direction of 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> landscape architects <PERSON>Peter Walker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Martha Schwartz</PERSON>, with the 
local <ORGANIZATION>Austin Hansen Group</ORGANIZATION> and several artists. 
</P>
<P>
Park Plaza's two tiers of restaurants would step down to meet the park, and 
<PERSON>Senturia</PERSON> is offering to donate part of the land for park use at one corner of 
his site. 
</P>
<P>
The tower steps back and would be crowned with Mission tile. It would feature a 
circular sundial emblem created by local artists. The proportions are good, but 
the tile seems too cute a way to incorporate local Spanish influences. 
</P>
<P>
There is also some question as to whether the existing buildings on <PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>'s 
site should be destroyed. None is great architecture, but one was designed by 
early 20th-Century architect <PERSON>William Hebbard</PERSON>, who gave architect <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON> 
his start here. 
</P>
<P>
Historic <ORGANIZATION>Site Board</ORGANIZATION> chairwoman <PERSON>Kathryn Willetts</PERSON> said there's a valid argument 
that the buildings should remain, if only to retain the scale and character of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Senturia</PERSON>'s project isn't yet scheduled for hearings at the CCDC, <ORGANIZATION>Historic Site 
Board</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, he made the latest of several presentations to 
the Gaslamp board. 
</P>
<P>
The most logical response to his 325-foot fantasy seems to be the one offered 
by <PERSON>Stepner</PERSON> and echoed by many others: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very handsome building that deserves to be built somewhere, but 
my question is, is it in the right location?"

ARCHITECTURE: ESCONDIDO BUILDING ON A GOOD IDEA

<P>
Escondido is rapidly becoming an architectural success story. A striking new 
<ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> designed by <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Associates Planners</ORGANIZATION> and Architects of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
opened two years ago, the result of a city-run, open-design competition. 
</P>
<P>
The city subsequently selected internationally known architects <ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble 
Yudell</ORGANIZATION> to design a companion performing arts complex. Construction will start 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Associate's City Hall</ORGANIZATION> set the stage for several new downtown buildings, 
and many of them take their design cues from it. When the county project 
managers hired civil engineers <PERSON>Pountney</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Associates</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect 
<PERSON>Rob Quigley</PERSON> to design a new transit complex downtown, for example, they 
specifically requested a building that would complement the city hall. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting <MONEY>$12.5-million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Escondido Transit Center</ORGANIZATION>, which opened in <DATE>February</DATE>, 
pays direct homage. Quigley borrowed a simple ziggurat pattern and applied this 
unifying motif to monumental concrete towers, paving, decorative grille work 
and signs. Located at <LOCATION>Valley Parkway</LOCATION> and Quince Street, the project anchors its 
key downtown corner with the same romantic spirit as the <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Known for such idiosyncratic buildings as the <PERSON>Linda Vista Library</PERSON> and his own 
downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> office and residence on Cedar Street, <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON>'s work has 
never been so influenced by another building. He freely acknowledges the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The big picture is that <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> didn't have a coherent identity," he said of 
this city of 104,000, which years ago left behind its image as a sleepy 
agricultural town. "There were a thousand different buildings, all going in 
different directions architecturally. That doesn't make for a community. I 
thought it was wonderful the way the <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION> set a direction and theme. I 
wanted to make sure the transit center played its part and contributed in a 
positive way to the formation of an identity." 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pacific Associate's City Hall</ORGANIZATION> is equal parts <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>, <LOCATION>1930s Deco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Balboa 
Park</LOCATION>. It has <ORGANIZATION>Gill</ORGANIZATION>'s smooth, mission-influenced stucco walls, Deco-era grille 
work and decoration, and is anchored by an open lathe dome reminiscent of the 
botanical building in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>. A series of courtyards serves as an outdoor 
lobby to the interior spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's transit center also celebrates this region's warm climate with its 
outdoor "waiting rooms." Concrete benches are placed beneath the open-air 
concrete atrium and three clock towers which tie the project together. Other 
bus stop benches are shaded by trees or steel-and-Lexan plastic awnings. Even 
the ticket office in one of three low concrete buildings is open-air. 
</P>
<P>
All of the structures are made of precast concrete panels that were poured on 
site, tilted into place by crane and bolted together. The largest ones are 36 
feet tall and weigh 40 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Trellis-shaded pedestrian paths fan out from the atrium to parking lots at the 
edges of the complex. Strung along these paths, the towers, with their tall, 
graceful, arched openings, beckon travelers in from the lots. The low buildings 
house ticket and transit offices and, eventually, will include a fast-food 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> said the budget didn't allow much extravagance with materials. Tilt-up 
concrete is an economical but often plain construction method usually reserved 
for industrial buildings, but <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> found ways to dress it up for this public 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Simple decorative ziggurat patterns were cast right into the concrete. More 
expensive materials such as granite, brick, colorful tiles and copper gutters 
were used sparingly to add decoration. Paving tiles made from tire rubber add 
an unusual flair while serving as an apt transportation metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
Pountney and <ORGANIZATION>Associates</ORGANIZATION> gets credit for the project's layout and efficient 
circulation scheme. In the name of smooth operation, cars and buses take 
separate routes through the site. <ORGANIZATION>North County Transit District</ORGANIZATION> and Greyhound 
buses travel a peanut-shaped loop past 15 curbside stops. Cars have their own 
well-marked driveways leading to parking lots at the back. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architect <PERSON>Marian Marum</PERSON> saved several towering eucalyptus trees that 
shade the lots and soften the visual impact of so much asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
The project even includes a decent piece of public art, the result of <LOCATION>San Diego 
County</LOCATION>'s and the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s policies requiring public art in new 
buildings. <PERSON>Peter Mitten</PERSON>'s "Hekkilk" consists of large slabs of concrete in 
earthy tans, oranges and browns, fractured and tilted as if they had slammed 
together. A plaque nearby says <ORGANIZATION>Mitten</ORGANIZATION> meant to create "a big dent as in a pass 
through mountains," sort of an abstract variation on the way the concrete 
transit complex serves as a "pass" to new destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Along with all the plusses, the <ORGANIZATION>Escondido Transit Center</ORGANIZATION> has shortcomings. A 
lack of decoration at the bases of the clock towers makes them unappealing 
close up. Window-like openings in the towers let daylight inside and allow 
police enough views to make sure nothing illegal is going on, but these 
openings are too small and crude, and look like they were hacked into the 
concrete at the last minute. Given the otherwise inviting appearance of the 
center, the reflective glass on the main administration and ticket building 
seems unnecessarily cold. 
</P>
<P>
Transit centers are becoming increasingly important in urban areas. With all 
the movement of people and vehicles, they provide a kinetic design challenge, 
one which <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pountney</PERSON> have met with great success in <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>. Other 
local cities hope to reduce car travel by providing bus and rail alternatives, 
and several new transit centers are being planned. Quigley is working on one 
for <LOCATION>Solana Beach</LOCATION>, while <PERSON>Pountney</PERSON> is designing another for <LOCATION>Encinitas</LOCATION> in 
conjunction with <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>C.W. Kim</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN BRIEFS: <PERSON>Rob Quigley</PERSON> has completed the design of a house in <LOCATION>Telluride</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>, for movie director <PERSON>Oliver Stone</PERSON>. <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> said the 8,500-square-foot home 
is his first "big budget" house, with an estimated price tag of <MONEY>$1.5 million</MONEY>. 
He said he is also working on the design of a <MONEY>$10-million</MONEY> Egyptian-flavored

DIRK SUTRO ARCHITECTURE: OUT-OF-TOWNER HAS A FEEL FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, a wave of buildings by famous out-of-town architects has hit 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Michael Graves</PERSON>, Mitchell/Giurgola, <PERSON>Antoine Predock</PERSON>, <PERSON>Helmut Jahn</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Skidmore 
Owings Merrill</ORGANIZATION> are among the big names coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, though, these architects are merely importing signature styles, 
with little regard for how architecture can be adapted to unique aspects of our 
culture and climate. 
</P>
<P>
That's not true of <PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON>, who has five of his designs under 
construction in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> -- intelligent, inspiring projects suited to the 
region and quite different from what he's done in other cities. In addition to 
this sensitivity, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> has shown an uncanny ability to make architecture a 
collaborative process, one in which he and his co-designers effectively listen 
to clients and citizens, then produce buildings that meet their needs while 
retaining the architects' strong imprint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known for <ORGANIZATION>Sea Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Moore</ORGANIZATION> is best known for his <DATE>1960s</DATE> designs at <ORGANIZATION>Sea Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, an enclave of vacation 
homes along the coast of <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> where the architect adapted a 
woodsy-shed vocabulary to scenic coastal bluffs, with a special concern for 
bringing natural light into the spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, his slate of projects has ranged from the <ORGANIZATION>Piazza d' Italia</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New 
Orleans</LOCATION>, a Cubist collage of classical forms and moving water, to many large 
public and university buildings. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> has taught at several architecture schools, including <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> and, at 
the moment, the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
His current <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> agenda includes the <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION> Civic Center (in 
conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>Urban Innovations Group</ORGANIZATION>) now under construction; a theater 
complex for the city of <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> (designed by <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>John 
Ruble</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Buzz Yudell</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>); a molecular biology research lab 
on the UC <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> campus (also by <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, Ruble, Yudell); a church in 
<ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks Ranch</ORGANIZATION> (in conjunction with <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Austin Hansen Fehlman Group</ORGANIZATION>), 
and a building for <ORGANIZATION>Phoenix House</ORGANIZATION> -- a program for troubled high school students 
-- several miles east of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Moore commented on <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> recently by phone from his home and studio in 
<LOCATION>Austin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He called <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION>City Hall</ORGANIZATION>, designed by <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Associates Planners</ORGANIZATION> 
and Architects of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, a "very skillful piece of work. I think that the 
openness to the outdoors, the way it opens outward toward the park and toward 
the entrance circle, all are very much in the spirit of <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, <ORGANIZATION>Yudell</ORGANIZATION> presented initial ideas for the theater complex to 
<LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION> city officials. Although it's too early to give specifics, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and 
his partners have some ideas as to how they will design the complex, with its 
1,700-seat theater, smaller theater and outdoor amphitheater in <LOCATION>Grape Day Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> acknowledged the lack of a strong architectural heritage from which to 
draw on in <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Our building's happening mostly from the inside out, in the time-honored way 
architects of my generation were taught. Considerations of what kind of light 
will be in the theater will have more to do 
</P>
<P>
with what the building looks like than any image we've got." 
</P>
<P>
In a different way, the <ORGANIZATION>Oceanside Civic Center</ORGANIZATION>, scheduled to open later this 
year, also fits its setting. The design acknowledges nearby buildings by early 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architectural master <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>, but not in a literal way. Where 
<PERSON>Gill</PERSON> was known for rounded arches, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s large openings are squared. As with 
some of <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s buildings, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s outdoor spaces are extremely important. A 
plaza at one corner of the project will feature a grove of palm trees and a 
water feature that <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> refers to as an "alluvial fan." 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity for citizens and city officials to offer opinions on the design 
resulted in minor changes, he said. Most significantly, the city bureaucrats 
rejected <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s first design for the doors to the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> chamber. 
Instead of colorful baked-on porcelain, they will be made from plain gray metal 
by <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> sculptor <PERSON>Robert Phillips</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s Church of the Nativity in <ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, designed in collaboration 
with the local <ORGANIZATION>Austin Hansen Fehlman Group</ORGANIZATION>, shares with the <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION> complex 
sensitive indoor-outdoor relationships and such <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> details as color 
ceramic tile around windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harder-Edged Look 
</P>
<P>
The Molecular Biology Building at <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION>, scheduled for completion this <DATE>spring</DATE>, 
finds <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> working in concrete and glass, a harder-edged look than the stucco 
that will cover the buildings in <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>. But he softens the effect with fine 
detailing, breaking the facades with abstracted pilasters and romantic little 
balconies. A central atrium continues the architect's search for uniquely "<LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION>" solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Is he developing a <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> palette? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there are things we do elsewhere that I wouldn't think of doing in 
<LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said. "In <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION>, every design decision reflected 
what <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> would have done, whether he'd approve. I'm torn, because I like <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> 
a lot, but I also like (<PERSON>Bertram</PERSON>) <PERSON>Goodhue</PERSON>," he said, referring to the designer 
of the ornate <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Tower in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, a 180-degree contrast to the 
stark work of <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
What does <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> think of <ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks Ranch</ORGANIZATION>? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if I didn't comment," he said, pausing. "I just don't 
understand it. I think it's meant to be Spanish, but it hardly ever gets the 
feel right." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>? 
</P>
<P>
He's never visited <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza</ORGANIZATION>, but complimented the historic preservation 
efforts in the <LOCATION>Gaslamp Quarter</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>UCSD</ORGANIZATION> campus? 
</P>
<P>
"I've written negative things about it," said the one-time student of <PERSON>Louis 
Kahn</PERSON>, designer of the masterful <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION> just across <LOCATION>Torrey Pines</LOCATION> Road 
from the campus. "I have never figured out the scheme of the campus. I can't 
locate myself when I'm on it, or understand the relationship between the 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s designs and observations will inspire a more thoughtful 
generation of local buildings in the <DATE>1990s</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: <PERSON>C. W. Kim</PERSON>, Lorimer-Case and <ORGANIZATION>Naegle Associates</ORGANIZATION>, all <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 
architects, have designed the three proposals recently received by the <ORGANIZATION>Centre 
City Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> for a high-rise development at Broadway and <ORGANIZATION>State 
Street</ORGANIZATION>. Both Lorimer-Case and <PERSON>Naegle</PERSON> hope to cross over from tract home work 
into the high-rise big leagues. . . . The Del Mar Plaza project in downtown Del 
Mar, an eclectic blend of shops and restaurants in a complex designed by <ORGANIZATION>Horton 
Plaza</ORGANIZATION> architect <PERSON>Jon Jerde</PERSON>, is months behind schedule and as much as <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY> 
over budget, sources say. Developers attribute the difficulties to complex 
improvements for such tenants as the <ORGANIZATION>Il Fornaio</ORGANIZATION> restaurant.

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRANSPLANTING ROW HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> has a tradition of borrowing architecture, regardless of how well it 
fits this region. Pirated home designs have been especially popular, such as 
the 19th-Century salt boxes and Victorians lifted from the eastern <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, where there hadn't been new homes for decades before '80s, developers 
and architects have built apartment buildings and single-room-occupancy hotels 
that address the street on a pedestrian scale with interesting architecture. 
But so far, there haven't been any truly urban homes for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, the Park Row and <ORGANIZATION>Marina Park</ORGANIZATION> condominiums south of Broadway 
gave <LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION> a chance to buy new homes in the heart of the city, but they 
weren't tailored to the location. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Park is a closed-in, low-rise apartment building, with all of its 
luxuries contained within, an approach more suited to suburbia or cities in the 
<LOCATION>East</LOCATION>, where it is too cold to utilize outdoor spaces. Park Row, with its 
courtyards and airy <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> look (white stucco and tile roofs) was 
better, but also more suburban than urban in the way it turned inward instead 
of out toward the life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-story <ORGANIZATION>Meridian</ORGANIZATION> became the first high-rise condo project downtown when it 
opened in <DATE>1985</DATE>, offering up to 3,300 square feet of living area. Here, at 
least, was an urban experience, with many homes having spectacular views of the 
downtown skyline, and with some of life's essentials available in nearby Horton 
Plaza. Still, a high-rise doesn't give residents the same kind of life style 
they can get, for example, in <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> row houses, with their front stoops 
meeting the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Now along comes <PERSON>Jonathan Segal</PERSON>, 27, a self-assured guy prone to wearing double 
breasted designer suits, touting a new brand of downtown housing. 
</P>
<P>
How self-assured is he? "My goal is to be the leading architect in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, 
then the leading architect in the country," he said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Segal has taken the row house and translated it to downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, where 
his 7 ON KETTNER townhouses are being built. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels as a member of the downtown <ORGANIZATION>Resident Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION>, which 
advises the <ORGANIZATION>Centre City Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> on downtown redevelopment, <PERSON>Segal</PERSON> met 
a variety of movers and shakers. When he mentioned to <PERSON>Charles Tyson</PERSON>, developer 
of a downtown high-rise, that his dream was to do a unique residential project 
downtown, <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> had an idea. His mother-in-law owned a small wedge of land on 
<ORGANIZATION>Kettner Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> at F Street, next to the railroad tracks. Was <PERSON>Segal</PERSON> 
interested? 
</P>
<P>
He was, even though freight trains (and eventually the <LOCATION>San Diego Trolley</LOCATION>'s 
cars) will thunder past only a few feet from his building's back wall. 
</P>
<P>
Segal solved the sound problem by hiring an acoustical engineer, who specified 
double drywall and acoustical theater windows. But the real breakthroughs are 
in the architecture and planning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unique Plan' 
</P>
<P>
"<PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> came along with a unique plan," said <PERSON>Paul Desrochers</PERSON>, assistant vice 
president of operations at the <ORGANIZATION>CCDC</ORGANIZATION>. "When he came in with it, we thought it 
was an excellent way to redevelop that site. The project has an excellent 
relationship to the street. We like the scale. We want to encourage 
smaller-scale development." 
</P>
<P>
The CCDC is contributing <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY> for sidewalk and landscaping next to <PERSON>Segal</PERSON>'s 
project, repayable if the architect's profits top a certain amount. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of <ORGANIZATION>Segal</ORGANIZATION>'s building will have an intimate experience with the city. 
Unlike Park Row just across <PERSON>Kettner</PERSON>, which addresses the street with a parking 
garage, 7 ON <PERSON>KETTNER</PERSON> will utilize the row house entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Segal, married with two children, wanted to offer new homes for young families 
like his. 7 ON <PERSON>KETTNER</PERSON>'s seven homes, scheduled to hit the market later this 
year, will range in size from 1,275 square feet to 2,400, and in price from 
<MONEY>$259,000</MONEY> to more than <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>. The architect and his family will occupy the 
largest of the homes, and <PERSON>Segal</PERSON> will work in a basement office. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described <ORGANIZATION>Modernist</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Segal</PERSON> has designed a clean, functional stucco 
building, with no extraneous architectural decoration. 
</P>
<P>
Entries will have steel gates for security, but they won't be buried somewhere 
within, as they are at <LOCATION>Marina Park</LOCATION>. Several of the homes will have second-story 
balconies, giving their owners broad views of the downtown skyline. 
</P>
<P>
Segal is clearly a sensitive manipulator of natural light. High clerestory 
windows will channel morning and late afternoon light into the homes, washing 
interior walls with changing colors. Rooftop skylights will let in additional 
light. 
</P>
<P>
The architect, in the manner common to today's planners and architects, likes 
to talk about the "dialogue" his building will have with the street. A good 
example is the "cat's paws" that will frame each entry, squarish stucco pieces 
that will jut a couple feet onto the sidewalk as a gesture to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Excellent Eye 
</P>
<P>
Parking is one of downtown's biggest problems. <PERSON>Segal</PERSON> has tucked his 
underground, squeezing in two slots for every home, although he hopes many of 
the residents will walk to jobs downtown. Auto access is from the side of the 
building, leaving the front dedicated to foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does <PERSON>Segal</PERSON> design with functional good sense, but, based on his model 
for 7 ON <LOCATION>KETTNER</LOCATION>, he appears to have an excellent eye for form and proportion. 
Subtle touches give the building sophistication, like the way the curved 
balconies mirror the shapes of the entry landings below them, and the way the 
building's massing and window placement form a well-balanced composition. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he has secured two 10,000-square-foot lots at 2nd Avenue and Market 
Street, where he plans to build his next generation of downtown housing. 
</P>
<P>
Segal is an architect to watch. Even if he doesn't make the pages of <ORGANIZATION>GQ</ORGANIZATION>, his 
architecture is bound to get attention. The emphasis on problem-solving, not 
flash or gimmicks, is rare in a young architect.

ARCHITECTURE / DIRK SUTRO: BIGGEST FIRM KEEPS LOWEST OF PROFILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even if you are familiar with <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architecture, you probably haven't 
heard much about the largest local architecture company. 
</P>
<P>
Yet <ORGANIZATION>SGPA Architecture &amp; Planning</ORGANIZATION> probably effects your daily life more than 
any other <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> firm. Specializing in retailing centers, the company has 
designed more than 400 such projects since opening in <DATE>1969</DATE>, including at least 
40 in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. Among these are town centers in <LOCATION>Rancho Bernardo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rancho 
Penasquitos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Del Mar Highlands</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Carmel Mountain Ranch</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Rancho San Diego</LOCATION> On 
the strength of its reputation for designing economical, financially successful 
retailing centers, the company has grown to 135 employees and <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in 
annual revenues, with satellite offices in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
But SGPA has not received a single design award during the <DATE>last eight years</DATE> 
from the local <ORGANIZATION>American Institute of Architects</ORGANIZATION> chapter. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to confirm the suspicion one gets, driving around <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, that 
most retail projects are driven by economics, not innovative architecture and 
planning. What works is replicated over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Most of <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION>'s newer shopping complexes have elements in common. Budgets 
dictate affordable stucco walls, often with simple, easy-to-build geometries, 
usually in a vaguely <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> style. Tile roofs predominate: The accepted 
method of adding "authentic" regional flavor; even worse, stark 
industrial-grade metal seems to be the roofing choice for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
At the new town centers, the automobile takes precedence over the pedestrian. 
The ritual of entering the center, parking the car and finding your store of 
choice has superseded a walk down Main Street. And the fast food restaurant has 
replaced city halls and churches as the most prominent community building, with 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Critics may not always find much cause for optimism at these malls, but <PERSON>Mike 
LaBarre</PERSON>, one of 11 principals at the <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION>, stands by the company's designs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely satisfied with the quality of our work," he said. "But we 
would like more recognition from the <ORGANIZATION>AIA</ORGANIZATION>. Every year we get awards from the 
retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the <ORGANIZATION>AIA</ORGANIZATION> awards tend to go to unusual architecture more than 
mainstream, even if the mainstream project is very well designed, has a 
positive impact on a community and has met client objectives." 
</P>
<P>
As for the difficulty of creating dignified town centers with fast food 
restaurants as their most visible elements, <ORGANIZATION>LaBarre</ORGANIZATION> hopes this will gradually 
change. 
</P>
<P>
'The <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION> thing is a function of land development economics. McDonald's 
is the tenant willing to pay the highest price for a premier location. Until 
the shopping center conventions of today change, you're always going to see 
that." 
</P>
<P>
LaBarre and other SGPA architects blame economics for limiting forms and 
materials, putting a damper on creativity, even though other architects have 
proven, with projects such as the newest downtown single-room-occupancy hotels, 
that it is possible to make interesting, functional buildings using low-cost 
stucco construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have a big challenge: how to create a positive aesthetic that 
projects quality for less dollars," <PERSON>LaBarre</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
This may be an long battle with few victories. Just compare a '70s SGPA project 
like the wood-shingled Pacific Plaza on <PERSON>Garnet Avenue</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Pacific Beach</LOCATION> with 
such '80s stucco cousins as The Promenade on <LOCATION>Mission Boulevard</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Pacific Beach</LOCATION> 
or <LOCATION>North County Plaza</LOCATION> near Highway 78 in <LOCATION>Carlsbad</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Architects at <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION>, seeing the wood shingle style as a bygone sign of the '70s, 
have taken to calling such designs "woodsy goodsy." But there's no denying a 
certain warmth and charm often lacking in the larger all-stucco projects of 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the shingles, which give scale and detailing to the buildings, <LOCATION>Pacific 
Plaza</LOCATION> has unusually inviting landscaping: small, beachy hillocks resembling 
coastal dunes soften the impact of buildings, concrete and tile. Low wooden 
benches and tables, shaded by umbrellas and trees, provide plenty of inviting 
places to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
These days, landscaping seems a lower priority. New retail centers usually have 
several trees, but few large-scale patches of greenery. Or maybe it only seems 
that way because a good portion of the budget goes toward breaking up huge 
parking lots with landscaped islands, instead of greening the insides of the 
projects, where people spend most of their time. Today's centers also have 
benches and outdoor tables, but they generally seem to be fewer and more poorly 
shaded. 
</P>
<P>
On a hot afternoon recently at the SGPA-designed <LOCATION>Costa Verde</LOCATION> retailing complex 
off La Jolla Village Drive in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, expanses of unshaded tiles underfoot 
served as unintended passive solar devices, absorbing sunlight and re-emitting 
the heat, so that the temperature for shoppers was several degrees above the 
air temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe all of this is unfairly morose, but it is disturbing to see the county 
gobbled alive by dozens of these new centers. In all fairness to <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION> and other 
architects, much of the blame for the blandness rests with developers who favor 
proven formulas and tenant design demands over fresh architecture and planning, 
and consumers who worship easy auto access and fast food. 
</P>
<P>
Also in fairness to <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION>, the company has designed some excellent retailing 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercado in <LOCATION>Rancho Bernardo</LOCATION>, completed in <DATE>1987</DATE>, replaced an earlier complex 
which had foundered financially. It's a fresh interpretation of <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> 
and Spanish elements, impressive in a community already gorged on stucco and 
tile roofs. Project designer <PERSON>Jerry Silva</PERSON> is said to be a stickler for 
detailing, and this is evident in the way the carefully varied facades blend 
from one to another. Signage has been kept to a minimum, and there is a 
symbolic domed tower, so that even if commerce is the order of the day, there's 
some sense of civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
Uptown District, a new project on University Avenue in <LOCATION>Hillcrest</LOCATION>, may be SGPA's 
most significant breakthrough, with <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION>'s mixed retail-office buildings 
merging into condominiums designed by Lorimer-Case. Parking is hidden so that 
human-scaled storefronts, designed to blend with adjacent '30s and '40s 
architecture, become the dominant image from the street. 
</P>
<P>
The people from <PERSON>Ralph</PERSON>'s took a risk by situating their supermarket internally, 
so that the smaller storefronts could be nearest the street. According to 
<PERSON>LaBarre</PERSON>, the store is a financial winner. 
</P>
<P>
This well-designed mixed-use project, including retailing, residential and 
office space, could well make SGPA a role model for architects in the '90s. 
Already, this broader approach to retail development has spurred some of <ORGANIZATION>SGPA</ORGANIZATION>'s 
best work.

Pei</PERSON>'s glass pyramid entrance to the <LOCATION>Louvre</LOCATION> -- the sun is shining brightest on the most ambitious and strangest of them all. 
At the forlorn eastern edge of the city, formerly a center for slaughterhouses and prostitution, the 75-acre <ORGANIZATION>Parc de la Villette</ORGANIZATION> is under way. 

   Ideas for injecting some new life into the greater 125-acre site on which the park is now emerging (and into the surrounding neighborhood as well) have been percolating since the <DATE>1970s</DATE>. 
And there was sufficient interest in devoting some of the space to a mix of activities having something to do with science, technology and culture that <PERSON>Adrien Fainsilber</PERSON>'s adaptation of one of the slaughterhouses into an exhibition center that is now known as the <ORGANIZATION>City of Science</ORGANIZATION> was launched. 

   It was in <DATE>1982</DATE>, though, that a concept for developing the whole site crystallized and an international competition was held for the design of the park that would serve as its heart. 
In <DATE>1983</DATE>, that commission was awarded to <PERSON>Bernard Tschumi</PERSON>, a 39-year-old Swiss-French architect who then was based in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (and continues to be, since he has just been named dean of the <ORGANIZATION>Graduate School of Architecture Preservation</ORGANIZATION> and Planning at <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>). 

   <PERSON>Mr. Tschumi</PERSON> had been teaching, writing and exhibiting his work in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> and had established a reputation as a theorist. 
But he had built virtually nothing. 
Even his admirers wondered if his complexly beautiful, edgy, abstract drawings (which showed three unrelated, superimposed systems: jigsawlike patches of ground; sinuous paths intersecting abrupt curved and straight axes; and a grid of tiny, brilliantly red cubes that were meant to be the park's "follies") could successfully be translated into a three-dimensional environment. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Tschumi</PERSON> has been able to turn his design into reality. 
And, as chief architect of the <ORGANIZATION>Parc de la Villette</ORGANIZATION>, he also has managed to steer the whole project (which also involves other architects, landscape architects and artists) through a bureaucracy that is at least as bizarre as any other and to bring it halfway to completion. 

   Things are moving along so well, in fact, that this <DATE>fall</DATE>, <PERSON>Mr. Mitterrand</PERSON> himself showed up to inaugurate the park with a formal ceremony and an elaborate display of Chinese fireworks. 
And in <DATE>December</DATE>, the French government awarded <PERSON>Mr. Tschumi</PERSON> its highest honor: the Medal of the Legion of Honor. 

   Nine follies are now in place in the landscape of la Villette and, as was intended, they establish a rhythm and a spirit for what now exists of the park. 
With obvious debts to Le Corbusier and even more to the Russian constructivists, their forms also have evolved from the architect's private lexicon, which is rooted in such contemporary sources as cinema technique and the literary theory of deconstruction. 

   Made of steel or concrete frames, the little buildings are sheathed in meticulously finished, red, porcelain-enameled steel panels, with some brushed aluminum and painted steel here and there. 
And while each structure clearly was derived from a cubic rectangle, each also appears to have been stripped, exploded, interrupted, skewed or added on to in a way that makes it distinctive and yet related to the others. 

   Movement and exploration are encouraged by the looped and winding ramps and stairs as well as the openings and enclosures. 
One folly serves as a belvedere, others house restaurants, a cafe bookstore, a gallery, a theater and visual arts workshops for children and adolescents. 

   The follies are set against very green, very manicured grass, brushed aluminum catwalks and bridges, pale blue terrazzo paving stones and benches, the latter embedded with tiny lights. 
Along one east-west axis a raised and covered walkway bites into each of the follies in its path at the second level as it heads toward another north-south walkway that is covered by an undulating blue metal canopy (these structures have been brought along to their present incarnation with the help of the fabulous <PERSON>Peter Rice</PERSON>, a London-based engineer). 
The theatrical effect is marred only by the depressing backdrop of slab highrises in the distance. 

   La Villette is, as its sounds, only very loosely a "park." 
It is "a place of activities rather than of repose," and it is a continuation, to some degree, of the urban fabric rather than an interruption. 
From the start, it was meant to reestablish in its own way that disappearing urban phenomenon: the gathering place. 
How this will work out still isn't clear. 
Many of the activities are geared to the young and a group already has been formed to keep an eye out for unruly teen-agers and to prevent the kind of scene that infests the space around the Beaubourg museum complex in central <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. 

   Some elements were beyond the chief architect's control. 
When he began to build, <PERSON>Mr. Tschumi</PERSON> had to work around the <ORGANIZATION>City of Science</ORGANIZATION>, the round metallic "Geode" that stands in front of it (within which films are projected at nearly 360 degrees) and a fabric-covered rock concert hall (the <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>) that was put up as a temporary structure in about <DATE>1983</DATE> and has been so successful that it will be maintained permanently. 

   There also were some surprisingly good buildings left over from the site's earlier purposes, and they have been restored. 
And on the horizon is the new two-part City of Music that will be designed by the young French architect <ORGANIZATION>Christian de Portzamparc</ORGANIZATION> and that will flank the entrance to the park. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Tschumi</PERSON> explains, though, that his design was meant to be inclusive and to accommodate oddities, interruptions and accidents as well as disparate work. 
Besides which, he is orchestrating a series of gardens and projects that will be threaded in a winding pattern through the park. 
So far a sunken bamboo garden and a walk-through "sound cylinder" with little waterfalls are already in place. 

   Meanwhile, various collaborations between luminaries of the cerebral avant-garde also are moving ahead. 
<PERSON>Peter Eisenman</PERSON> has been working with philosopher <PERSON>Jacques Derrida</PERSON> on a "garden" of Cor-ten steel, onyx and sand that can be entered from underneath and that is scheduled for completion this <DATE>spring</DATE>. 
<PERSON>John Hejduk</PERSON> is working with poet <PERSON>David Shapiro</PERSON> on a series of haunting sentrylike metal constructions and a spiky metal fountain. 
<PERSON>Claes Oldenburg</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Coosje</ORGANIZATION> van <PERSON>Bruggen</PERSON> also are on the list of participants, as is the much-hyped <PERSON>Philippe Starck</PERSON>, who is designing the chairs and lampposts. 

   It will be interesting to see how many of these statements la Villette can accommodate without turning into an architectural theme park (and what's wrong with a little repose, anyway?). 
But nearly all of the parts of the la Villette complex are risky and interesting endeavors that have been undertaken by persons who are excited about what they are doing -- which feels like a breath of fresh air.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s wisest urban planners aren't urban planners at all, just 
<LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION> with a sincere concern for their city. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them turned out last week for two forums on public spaces led by <LOCATION>San 
Diego City</LOCATION> Architect <PERSON>Mike Stepner</PERSON> and organized by various civic and 
professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, a group of about 200 gathered at the <ORGANIZATION>Casa del Prado Theater</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION> for a "town meeting" on the subject of public squares. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a slide lecture on the <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Courthouse Square</ORGANIZATION>, a 
lively downtown plaza in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>, that covers an entire city block. A 
thoughtful discussion followed, with comments from both the audience and a 
panel whose members ranged from <PERSON>Tim Chambers</PERSON> of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Espresso Company to 
developer <PERSON>Ernest Hahn</PERSON>, artist <PERSON>Mario Lara</PERSON> and the city's <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> for Arts and 
Culture public arts coordinator <PERSON>Gail Goldman</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
<DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, many of the same faces returned to <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION> to see how 
lessons learned the night before might apply to three <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> public spaces 
in dire need of attention: <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza Park</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Community Concourse</ORGANIZATION>, both 
downtown, and the Plaza de <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in front of the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Museum of Art in 
<LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>David Porter</PERSON>, who manages <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Courthouse Square</ORGANIZATION> and organizes its events, 
was the featured guest at both meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But the real star of the discussions wasn't a participant. The name of 
pioneering urban planner <PERSON>William Whyte</PERSON> surfaced often at both meetings. His 
<DATE>1988</DATE> book "City: Rediscovering the Center" has become something of a bible to 
anyone with an interest in a vital public spaces. It seems even the general 
public now knows about him. 
</P>
<P>
Whyte spent years in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> researching what makes public spaces come 
alive. Many of his recommendations are simple, but it's surprising how seldom 
they are followed. 
</P>
<P>
People need places to sit, <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON> says. They need plenty to do and see: art, 
retail shops with their wares in full view, street performers, food vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Courthouse Square puts these ideas to work. It gives <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> the kind 
of public heart downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> has never had. People from a variety of 
socioeconomic groups mingle peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
According to <PERSON>Porter</PERSON>, the success of <ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Courthouse Square</ORGANIZATION> is attributable 
to six concepts: simplicity, location, history, ownership, activity and 
neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Pioneer Courthouse Square</ORGANIZATION> has a clean, functional design, yet plenty of whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> dreamed up a way to give citizens a stake in the project: 65,000 
bricks were sold for <MONEY>$15</MONEY> to <MONEY>$30</MONEY> and used to pave the square, each with the 
donor's name on them. 
</P>
<P>
The square has action galore: a travel bookstore, four food vendors, a 
restaurant, interactive art pieces and such events as an annual "Festival of 
Flowers" and noontime "Peanut Butter and Jam" concerts. 
</P>
<P>
A weather machine gives the forecast, accompanied by a fanfare of trumpets, 
sprays of water and flashing temperature lights. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Horton Plaza Park</LOCATION> is a prime candidate for such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the city's lack of initiative in finding ways to reclaim the park 
from downtown's street people, the <ORGANIZATION>Central City Assn.</ORGANIZATION>, an organization 
representing downtown businesses, has proposed to the city council to replace 
the grass with flower beds. It is even ready to pay to do so, but hasn't gotten 
the council's approval yet. 
</P>
<P>
This might help keep the transients away, but it still wouldn't make the park a 
great place for a cross section of the public to gather and mingle. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 50 or so planners, artists, business people and others who met with 
<PERSON>Stepner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Porter</PERSON> <DATE>Friday</DATE> agreed that the long range goal should be to replace 
the landscaping around the <DATE>1910</DATE> Irving <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> fountain with hardscaping -- bricks 
or another paving material. An open, paved park would offer people places to 
congregate and allow for a variety of uses, while plans dominated by grass 
and/or flower beds have limited possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney <PERSON>Leo Sullivan</PERSON> is a partner in a law firm with offices across <LOCATION>Fourth 
Avenue</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Horton Plaza Park</LOCATION>. He is also co-owner of <ORGANIZATION>Reidy O'Neil</ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant 
on the ground floor of the building, which has a view of the troubled park. 
</P>
<P>
In making his pitch, <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> cited <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON>. He suggested replacing straight 
benches with round, backless ones more suited to group conversations. He 
proposed an entertainment stage, a food stand and night lights that would play 
on the park from adjacent buildings. 
</P>
<P>
These ideas aren't in the <ORGANIZATION>Central City Assn.</ORGANIZATION>'s plan, and <PERSON>Stepner</PERSON> endorsed the 
association's flower beds as a short-term solution. In fact, the hardscaping, 
which seems like an excellent idea, may never happen. Posts and chains 
bordering the grass are period pieces, and historic preservationists strongly 
oppose their removal. 
</P>
<P>
Whyte-like ideas also flowed during <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s discussion of the <ORGANIZATION>Community 
Concourse</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Ernesto Guerrero</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Centro Cultural de la Raza</ORGANIZATION> who was 
also on the panel, proposed a radical solution to the plaza's hostile, windy 
environment: destroy some of the sterile buildings around it. 
</P>
<P>
More realistic suggestions included a city commitment to managing the space 
(including new art and events), food and retail outlets, a new downtown library 
at the plaza's edge, more seating and a landscaping plan that would open better 
lines of sight. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Porter</PERSON> believes the <ORGANIZATION>Community Concourse</ORGANIZATION> desperately needs public art that 
acknowledges local history and adds a taste of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s broad cultural 
heritage. History and broad-based art could help make the space appealing to 
more <LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The city has commissioned a community concourse reuse study, and <PERSON>Stepner</PERSON> 
promised to forward several of these ideas. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, the Plaza de <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> was converted this <DATE>summer</DATE> from a parking 
lot while it was occupied by a touring <PERSON>Frank Lloyd Wright</PERSON> house. Long-range, 
the city plans to replace the parking lot with a plaza. Landscape architect 
<PERSON>Steve Estrada</PERSON>, a consultant hired by the city to draft a detailed plan for the 
heart of the park, proposes a fountain in the middle of the Plaza de <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, 
palms around its fringes and a large, hardscaped surface where people can 
gather. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas proposed for the Plaza de <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> weren't as interesting as suggestions 
made for the other two public spaces. A major portion of the debate focused on 
whether automobiles should be allowed to cross the edge of the plaza, and where 
new parking lots might be built in the park.

<HL> REAL ESTATE:
Different Approach Winning
Acceptance in Urban Projects

   <LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> ARCHITECT <PERSON>Alexander Cooper</PERSON> is something of a heretic. 
He thinks, for instance, that building design is of secondary importance to how the public spaces in a city are arranged. 
He believes in "background" buildings, structures that aren't show-stoppers but nevertheless enhance a neighborhood's ambiance. 
He accepts the automobile in the city and relies on streets to create life and visual order. 

   The views of the 50-year-old former director of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>'s urban-design program run counter to current practice. 
For many builders, public spaces are afterthoughts needed only to build larger towers, and they prefer high-rent "signature" buildings that clamor for attention. 

   Though <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>'s ideas go against popular practice, they are making headway. 
For example, <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> and his former partner <PERSON>Stanton Eckstut</PERSON> are the designers of the streets and open space for <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION>, a 92-acre, mixed-use development in lower <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> magazine called the plan "urbanity at its best." 
Urban critic <PERSON>William Whyte</PERSON> says <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>'s work is "outstanding." 

   WITH SUCH PRAISE, <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> is bound to influence cities, builders, planners and architects. 
His newest project is another <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> job -- <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>'s 62-acre <LOCATION>Television City</LOCATION>. 
But the next of his projects to rise will be <ORGANIZATION>Cityfront Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, 60 acres of largely vacant industrial land owned by <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Life Assurance Society and Chicago Dock &amp; Canal Trust Co</ORGANIZATION>. 
The city last year approved the plan, which envisions about 22 million square feet of new offices, apartments and hotels being built over the next 20 years or so. 
Ground was recently broken for the project's first building, regional offices for <ORGANIZATION>National Broadcasting Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which is being developed by <ORGANIZATION>Tishman Speyer Properties</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <ORGANIZATION>Cityfront Center</ORGANIZATION> will feature broad tree-lined streets and a pedestrian esplanade along a stretch of the <LOCATION>Chicago River</LOCATION>. 
High-rise offices on the western end of the site and apartments and townhouses on the eastern side will be clustered around five large public spaces. 
"It's the public spaces that define the plan," <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> says. 
Oddly enough, the allocation of <ORGANIZATION>Cityfront Center</ORGANIZATION>'s land -- about half for buildings, a third for public open spaces and rest for steets -- is comparable to that for <ORGANIZATION>Battery Park City and Television City</ORGANIZATION>. 
"My reaction to that is either we only know how to do things one way or there's a certain internal logic to this," says <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>. 

   The plans for <ORGANIZATION>Cityfront Center</ORGANIZATION> are based on <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>'s credo for urban design: Keep it simple. 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Cityfront Center</ORGANIZATION> is well-located, stretching from <LOCATION>North Michigan Avenue</LOCATION> east to <ORGANIZATION>Lakeshore Drive</ORGANIZATION> along the north bank of the <LOCATION>Chicago River</LOCATION>, it posed some formidable design problems. 

   THE FOREMOST CHALLENGES were the 35-foot drop in the site's elevations and the fact that access from <LOCATION>Michigan Ave.</LOCATION> -- the most desirable approach -- is blocked by a public plaza and the existing <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Building</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> rejected the usual solutions, such as multiple levels running throughout the project ("I don't like them."). 
His plan puts all of the commercial buildings level with <LOCATION>Michigan Avenue</LOCATION> and the residential portion at ground level on the eastern end of the site. 
Escalators and stairways will connect the two. 
As for a project entrance, <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> put the ceremonial access off <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Street. 
By creating a drive and public space similar to the Channel Gardens at <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s Rockefeller Center and redesigning the existing plaza, <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> hopes to let passers-by on <LOCATION>Michigan Avenue</LOCATION> know that there is something worth seeing behind the <ORGANIZATION>Equitable Building</ORGANIZATION>. 

   <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>'s ideas required a bit of salesmanship. 
For instance, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> city officials assumed that <ORGANIZATION>Cityfront Center</ORGANIZATION>'s streets would be multilevel like <ORGANIZATION>Lakeshore Drive</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> wanted no part of that. 
"Lakeshore Drive is 25 feet up in the air," he says. 
"Since this side of the project is residential, I didn't want a raised street running through the project between residences and the water. 
You can't plant trees underneath it, and I don't want three levels of parking underneath townhouses." 

   CHICAGO DOCK balked at first at <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON>'s idea of running a street alongside the river esplanade; it wanted the apartment buildings next to the esplanade. 
<PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> explains: "I don't like private property abutting a park. 
Besides, you'd have the backs of the buildings instead of the entrances overlooking the river, and without a street you could have security problems. . . . 
The site had no acceptance in the marketplace. 
That's what streets bring to it." 

   But perhaps the most innovative aspect of the city-approved plan is its flexibility. 
While it limits development for the entire project and sets public space requirements, the plan allows the developers to concentrate public space in five locations instead of apportioning it on a lot-by-lot basis. 
"We broke the site up into small parcels so it won't seem like a project," <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> says. 
"But the city let us aggregate the open space, so we won't get 40 or 50 'postage stamps' for open space." 
He adds: "We approached all three of our big projects from the same point of view. 
They're all organized around public spaces and are driven by quality design." 

   For all his achievement as an urban designer, however, <PERSON>Mr. Cooper</PERSON> has yet to design a building in the three big projects he has planned. 
Sensing the irony in this, he grins and says he wants to change that.

GLENDALE SCALES DOWN HOTEL'S SIZE BUT NOT AMENITIES

<P>
Plans for <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION>'s proposed downtown hotel and convention center have been 
scaled down in size, but not in amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The latest design proposal unanimously approved <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Glendale 
Redevelopment Agency</ORGANIZATION> calls for a 350-room, 18-story hotel to be built on the 
south side of <LOCATION>Glenoaks Boulevard</LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION>Central Avenue and Brand Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Red Lion Inns of <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>, proposed building a 403-room, 
20-story tower in <DATE>December</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
While city officials had approved the preliminary design of the larger project, 
they said they were concerned about a series of complex issues involving 
traffic circulation and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limitation OKd 
</P>
<P>
Red Lion had agreed to a 350-room limitation when it was awarded the 
development rights two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas W. Henry</PERSON>, vice president of design and development for the hotel chain, 
said architects revised plans after meeting with city officials and 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal calls for dramatic step-backs in the upper floors of the 
tower on both the north and south facades, which will allow for larger rooms 
and suites with corner windows, balconies and sweeping views. 
</P>
<P>
New plans for traffic circulation will include a private street through the 
hotel garage allowing access from <LOCATION>Glenoaks Boulevard</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arden Avenue</LOCATION>. Drop-off 
points for the hotel lobby will be separated from the entrance to the 
convention wing with its ballroom and banquet areas. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fuller of <ORGANIZATION>ELS Design Group</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, the city's consultant, said the 
"design of the hotel has genuinely improved" with plans that offer more 
"creativity and excitement," such as changes in the form of the building and 
abundant landscaping that will include a large fountain. He said the changes 
represent "a large improvement in quality . . . which will be readily perceived 
by hotel users." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lush Setting 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Barbara Knight</PERSON>, acting deputy redevelopment director, said one of the most 
unusual aspects of the urban hotel will be its lush park-like setting. The 
<ORGANIZATION>Verdugo Wash</ORGANIZATION>, which separates the hotel site from <LOCATION>Glenoaks</LOCATION>, will be covered 
with concrete and landscaped as part of the park, city officials said. It is 
the first such proposal in <LOCATION>Glendale</LOCATION> to cover and use a channel owned by the <ORGANIZATION>Los 
Angeles County Flood Control District</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Perry Burr</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> landscape architect working with the developer, 
said landscaping over the wash is a particularly "critical issue." He said 
berms seven feet high and taller will be created to provide enough soil to 
support large conifers and flowering trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's essentially planting on top of concrete," he said. The berms will also 
serve to buffer noise from surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The architecture of the building and the park environment around it will make 
the project one of the more unique hotels in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
A final design review is scheduled in 60 days. Construction on the <MONEY>$36-million</MONEY> 
project is expected to begin next <DATE>fall</DATE>, with completion projected for the 
<DATE>spring of 1991</DATE>.

This image-conscious, beachfront city is about to become an architectural 
mecca. A new civic center designed by <PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON> is a pleasing and 
perplexing piece of work, the kind of place that should gain national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the center's human scale, wit and strong ties to the 
surrounding streets should provide the fabric that the city's threadbare core 
needs so desperately. 
</P>
<P>
Already, several new projects are scheduled to break ground nearby, including 
an apartment/retail complex, the kind of mixed use so effective in downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, who designed the legendary '60s condominiums at the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Ranch</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sonoma 
County</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Piazza</LOCATION> d'Italia in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> and a soon-to-be-built theaters 
complex for <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, has given <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION> a late-century homage to early 
20th-Century <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the civic center's strong points are its rich detailing, sensitive 
siting, subtle echoes of <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON> and a nod to the importance of the 
automobile. Weaknesses include detailing, which at times obscures strong basic 
lines, and colors so whimsical that they sometimes distract from the solid 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's the bare backside of the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> building, which <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> 
envisioned as cloaked in vine-covered trellises. These were vetoed by the 
current council after being approved by its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1929</DATE>, <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> drew his own plans for a civic center on this same site in the 
middle of downtown at North Hill Street and 3rd Avenue, featuring his trademark 
arched arcades. Although most of the complex was never realized, his fire 
station and administrative building still stand on <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Street</ORGANIZATION>. These will 
eventually be renovated and put to city use. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s design incorporates several Gill-inspired arches. Most often, these are 
used at the edges of covered public walkways that provide key pedestrian 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
But, where <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s architecture was spare modernism, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, hailed by many as a 
forefather of the postmodern movement, believes in rich ornamentation and a 
more light-hearted approach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the civic center has some of <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s austerity, it has much more of 
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s own playful complexity, nowhere more apparent than in several of the 
public areas, where most of the money for ornamentation was spent on the 
colorful tiles. These flow like a rainbow sherbet river up walls and down a 
mock alluvial fan leading into the fractured geometries of a large fountain. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful perspective on these colors can be had from mid-block on <PERSON>Ditmar 
Street</PERSON>, looking west through the heart of the project. A soaring opening marks 
the center of the project, its ziggurat forms lined with maize, gray, mauve and 
red tiles. Below this pedestrian entry, workers were putting the finishing 
touches on a palm fountain to be bordered by eight tall lights in the form of 
palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Expanses of tile frame the entrance to the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> chamber lobby, a 
wonderful space beneath a gigantic rectangular skylight, where a dramatic sky 
bridge crosses overhead to connect this building with the one next door. 
</P>
<P>
Progress on the council chamber was slowed when the city decided to add such 
high-tech features as large-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of the various offices in the center, the first of which should be 
occupied late in <DATE>February</DATE>, shows up a few shortcomings. The partitioned work 
cubicles often clutter the spaces and block valuable light and views. Project 
design consultant <PERSON>Robbin Hayne</PERSON> said the architects wanted lower partition 
walls, and he wishes they had lobbied harder. 
</P>
<P>
Looking out from upper-level offices and hallways, the viewer is often 
confronted with unsightly rooftop mechanical equipment. <PERSON>Hayne</PERSON> said there wasn't 
sufficient budget to hide these appliances. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, though, the project succeeds magnificently with its two 
grandest gestures: a pedestrian space at the southwestern corner and the 
automobile entry along <PERSON>Ditmar Street</PERSON>, which runs through the project beneath an 
enclosed pedestrian bridge between two of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Working with <ORGANIZATION>Urban Innovations Group of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> and production architects 
<PERSON>Danielson</PERSON> Design of San <PERSON>Juan Capistrano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was selected from a talented 
field in a <DATE>1986</DATE> competition. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Edgardo Contini</PERSON>, former president of UIG, had a hand in the design, lending his 
rational site planning to the group of designers who helped <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> work in his 
favorite team fashion. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hayne</PERSON> remembers the creation of the tiled "alluvial fan" that runs downhill 
through the center of the project, culminating in the large public fountain 
near the corner of Hill and Third streets. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the result of Charles having pencil in hand and drawing it during a 
design session. He is wholly responsible." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s unconventional alluvial fan and fountain, with their jagged angles, are 
screened by a grid of palm trees anchoring the corner in the most orderly 
fashion. Here's the epitome of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s left and right brains working in happy 
tandem, as they do, with varying degrees of success, throughout the project. 
</P>
<P>
The library is the only portion of the project now in use. Its witty interior 
is marred only by mundane oak shelving and counters. The entry space has 
amazing energy. It rises to two stories, ringed by huge clerestory windows 
which make artificial lighting unnecessary during daylight hours. Study carrels 
line the second-floor railing behind arches set atop long, thin columns. 
</P>
<P>
Moving through this main space, one gets a sense of awe and respect appropriate 
for the repository of the city's knowledge and history. 
</P>
<P>
The northern side of the project is the least visible, but generates its own 
architectural excitement. A series of concrete buttresses fly toward the street 
from the parking garage, as if to prove that acres of rainbow tiles aren't 
essential to creating dramatic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering painting these bold forms. Pray that they don't. 
Architects and citizens should fight tooth and nail to preserve these finely 
crafted, unadorned details. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy pressure is also needed to make the city change its mind regarding the 
trellises <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> designed to soften the stark walls of the council chamber 
building. Of their <MONEY>$320,000</MONEY> total cost, <MONEY>$160,000</MONEY> had been spent when the new 
council did their flip-flop last <DATE>summer</DATE>. In an homage to <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>, these would have 
warmed the plain, white walls, including two five-sided turrets, with flowering 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday, someone will realize it would be nice to put them up," <PERSON>Hayne</PERSON> 
said.

What would <PERSON>Louis Kahn</PERSON> do? 
</P>
<P>
Architects <PERSON>Jack MacAllister</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Rinehart</PERSON>, former associates of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s, 
asked themselves that question often as they worked during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
And, last week at the meeting of the <LOCATION>North County</LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Institute of Architects</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MacAllister</ORGANIZATION> unveiled their company's design for a 
significant expansion of the <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, one of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s 
masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
The building, just south of a La Jolla bluff popular among hang gliders, is the 
only work of local architecture to achieve international acclaim as one of the 
20th-Century's great works. 
</P>
<P>
Architects, architecture critics and architecture lovers visit from all over 
the world to stand in its austere travertine plaza, suggested to <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> (who died 
in <DATE>1974</DATE>) by the Mexican architect <PERSON>Luis Barragan</PERSON>. They marvel at study towers 
lining the plaza, angled to capture ocean views. And engineers admire the 
generous mechanical core that runs the length of both wings between floors, 
allowing the <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION>, completed in <DATE>1965</DATE>, to easily reconfigure 
laboratory spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The three-level, 97-by-408-foot addition proposed by <ORGANIZATION>MacAllister</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Rinehart</PERSON> and 
their associates at Los Angeles-based Anshen + <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> would house offices, labs, 
a 300-seat auditorium and a large flexible meeting room-lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But already, controversy is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
The city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Historical Site Board</ORGANIZATION> has discussed designating the 
<ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION> as historical, which would not prevent the addition but would 
mean a series of public design presentations in front of the board. <PERSON>Jeffrey 
Shorn</PERSON>, a member of the site board, hasn't seen Anshen + <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s scheme, but 
said he fears an addition might compromise <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s building. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most significant buildings in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, and its 
significance means the community needs to be involved in the expansion," <PERSON>Shorn</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the new 105,000-square-foot structure would be built in the middle of a 
eucalyptus grove, 125 feet east of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s building. 
</P>
<P>
To many <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> lovers, the existing approach to the building through the trees 
captures the enigmatic, spiritual nature of his architecture. You wander 
through the grove, climb a few steps and find yourself at the edge of a vast, 
hard-edged plaza sprawling toward the blue <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> like something out of a 
Surrealist painting. 
</P>
<P>
"People may think it's romantic (to approach through the eucalyptus), but a 
visitor doesn't know where to go," said <PERSON>MacAllister</PERSON> in defense of the addition. 
"Some people end up entering on the side." 
</P>
<P>
A plaza between the old building and the new, with trees -- perhaps jacarandas 
-- and pads for sculptures, would preserve some of the mystique, but the 
addition would give visitors an entirely different first impression of the 
complex than they get today. 
</P>
<P>
The new building would be 30 feet high, 15 1/2 feet lower than <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s. Between 
symmetrical halves of the <MONEY>$18-million</MONEY> structure, a square courtyard would serve 
as the <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s new "front porch." In the middle of this space, four 
curved, 24-foot-high hollow concrete "light prisms" would stand in a circle, 
serving as entry monuments and bouncing light down to a lower-level lobby 
outside the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
A stainless steel bridge would cross the courtyard 12 feet overhead, connecting 
the building halves. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most powerful elements of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s design is the east-west axis 
established by the plaza, through which a narrow channel of water courses 
toward the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Last week after <PERSON>MacAllister</PERSON>'s presentation, some observers questioned the 
courtyard within Anshen + <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s building, wondering whether it should be more 
open, in keeping with <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s. Maybe the concrete light tubes should be 
eliminated, some said. 
</P>
<P>
But the soaring dimensions of the new space will make it grander than it 
appears in model form. <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> might enjoy the play of light and shadow over the 
tall, unusual skylights. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that both <PERSON>David</PERSON> and I very consciously considered not only the roots 
of this project in the original building, but also, in <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s drawing, where he 
anticipated a building on that end," <PERSON>MacAllister</PERSON> said. "We continue to practice 
architecture very much in the philosophical spirit of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>, that's the basis of 
our work. Therefore, it's natural that this building should be designed the 
same way. We're not necessarily copying the forms of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> or the architectural 
language, but the philosophical approach." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn always intended for the <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION> to have an entry building, 
<PERSON>MacAllister</PERSON> said. One of his original drawings shows a three-story, T-shaped 
building, with the top of the T fronting the existing plaza, and the stem 
extending east to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Today's space requirements dictated a substantially larger building, according 
to <ORGANIZATION>MacAllister</ORGANIZATION>. The rectangular addition would be as wide as the existing 
building, but the landscaped open space between old and new structures would 
allow <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s building some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
In details, proportions and materials, the new building would take its cues 
from <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s, except that it wouldn't have teak window frames. Like its 
predecessor, the addition would be built of concrete, travertine and stainless 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
From preliminary drawings and photos of models presented by <ORGANIZATION>MacALlister</ORGANIZATION> last 
week, it is hard to tell exactly what the exterior would look like, but the 
design doesn't seem to have the power of <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s original. MacALlister, <PERSON>Rinehart</PERSON> 
and associates may have erred on the conservative side in attempting to let 
<PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s building keep the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Another troubling aspect of the proposed expansion is the need for additional 
parking that would accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
For the short term, the institute will expand surface parking to the northwest 
of the original complex. Long-range, though, <ORGANIZATION>MacAllister</ORGANIZATION> envisions a 
three-level parking structure where the east lot is now, with one level 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a new parking structure on the east lot is a bad one. Additional 
parking should go somewhere else on the <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s 27 acres, or even on 
other property. 
</P>
<P>
During the design process, <ORGANIZATION>MacAllister</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Rinehart</PERSON> (who also worked on the 
original <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION>) and the rest of the design team solicited criticism 
from people who knew <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> and his work, such as <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> architecture professor <PERSON>Tim 
Vreeland</PERSON> and architect and publisher <PERSON>Richard Wurman</PERSON>, who both worked with <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>. 
MacAllister said they approve of Anshen + <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s design. 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> did in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, the architects are working closely on the design with 
the institute's founder, polio vaccine developer <PERSON>Dr. Jonas Salk</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Salk who brought Anshen + <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> back to design the addition, 
after an underground addition proposed by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architects Deems <PERSON>Lewis 
McKinley</PERSON> didn't please him, <PERSON>MacAllister</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the expansion, the institute is considering building housing in a 
canyon west of the existing building, where <PERSON>Kahn</PERSON> envisioned housing for 
visiting researchers. The first structure would be a house for the institute's 
president, since the high cost of housing in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION> makes it difficult to 
lure top academics from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
A conference center to the northwest of the existing building, included in 
<PERSON>Kahn</PERSON>'s original master plan, may also be built some day. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION> has raised <MONEY>$9 million</MONEY> toward the addition, and is continuing 
its fund-raising efforts. MacAllister said construction could begin if the 
institute has <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> of the <MONEY>$18-million</MONEY> cost in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction can start, however, the project must be reviewed by the 
city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. MacAllister is confident that work will begin next <DATE>October</DATE> 
and be completed in 20 months.

ARCHITECTURE: TROLLEY HELPS TO PUT DESIGN ON RIGHT TRACK DOWNTOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the city's downtown grows up, new combinations of uses are giving architects 
fresh design challenges. The results are some of the most interesting buildings 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
Take transportation systems, for example. Developers now realize that by 
integrating their projects with bus and trolley lines, they can make city 
planners happy while delivering office workers and retail consumers to their 
doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
As the <LOCATION>San Diego Trolley</LOCATION> expands downtown, architects are getting a chance to 
do lively projects along its tracks. <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Helmut Jahn</PERSON>'s new 
headquarters for <ORGANIZATION>Great American Bank</ORGANIZATION>, now being built on Broadway, will 
straddle the trolley line. The movement of trolley cars and people through 
these spaces should give the project the same kind of energy <PERSON>Jahn</PERSON> captured in 
his widely publicized <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> terminal for <ORGANIZATION>United Airlines</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Across downtown, at 12th and Imperial avenues, the <PERSON>James R. Mills</PERSON> Building -- a 
mixed-use project incorporating a trolley station, government offices and 
ground-level shops -- shows how exciting the confluence of people, cars and 
trolleys can be. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which opened early last year, has received several awards for its 
design. Last <DATE>June</DATE>, the local <ORGANIZATION>American Institute of Architects</ORGANIZATION> chapter selected 
it to receive an Honor Award, its highest recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being just another government office complex, the building is a 
people machine. Walking toward it from any direction, you find yourself drawn 
by its graceful 220-foot-high clock tower ground-level activity. 
</P>
<P>
Trolleys roll through, stopping to pick up passengers. People come and go. Some 
leave their cars in the parking structure and take the trolley into downtown. 
Others observe and are observed as they sit outdoors at a large circular plaza 
in front, at tables outside a deli and at a smaller outdoor area behind the 
main building. This last area will serve the trolley's bayside line, scheduled 
to open this <DATE>summer</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the station's convenience mart-snack shop, people relax with a 
newspaper, a deli sandwich or a soft drink from stools behind large panes of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Such vibrant urban transportation hubs are common in the east, but are all too 
rare in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Deceptively simple in appearance, the complex marks a sophisticated departure 
from what's been done downtown. The building's strong, clean exterior 
geometries grew from its structural system, instead of being lifted from this 
year's trendy design book or designed as an imitation of history. 
</P>
<P>
Starboard Development was hired by the <ORGANIZATION>Metropolitan Transit Development Board</ORGANIZATION> 
to build the project on time and on budget. As part of its team, Starboard 
brought in the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architectural firm of <ORGANIZATION>Delawie Bretton Wilkes 
Associates</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a client can make. The architects had also collaborated with 
Starboard on the city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s downtown police station, completed in 
<DATE>1985</DATE>, but with a much less impressive result. <PERSON>Michael Wilkes</PERSON>, a partner in the 
firm, defended the police station as a decent building on a limited budget. 
After additional prodding, though, he indirectly acknowledged the transit 
building's more sophisticated design. 
</P>
<P>
"Why the chemistry was better, I can't tell you," he said. One reason, perhaps, 
is that transit officials seemed to have an intuitive sense of what makes good 
architecture. MTDB General Manager <PERSON>Tom Larwin</PERSON> insisted that his company's new 
office building incorporate the trolley station, instead of making it separate. 
</P>
<P>
The architects' initial design shows where the project might have gone without 
input from <LOCATION>Larwin</LOCATION> and others, such as City Architect <PERSON>Mike Stepner</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Centre City 
Development Corp.</ORGANIZATION> urban design expert <PERSON>Max Schmidt</PERSON> and <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> city planners 
<PERSON>Paul Curcio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marianne Munsell</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
A downtown train station designed early this century by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect 
<PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON> served as a stylistic point of departure (it was torn down a few 
years later when the tracks were moved). 
</P>
<P>
The early version of the MTDB complex was a weird combination of free-standing 
walls resembling mission ruins, in front of a low glass box. The trolley tracks 
passed behind the building. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by <ORGANIZATION>Larwin &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> to provide a new building incorporating additional 
office space that could be leased to other users, the architects designed a 
clean-lined building with trolley trains running through its base and a clock 
tower as a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, MTDB decided to maximize development of its site. Starboard signed 
up the county of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> to take <PERCENT>75%</PERCENT> of the space, and MTDB asked for a 
10-story building with a six-story parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the architects pulled the clock tower away as a separate feature. 
It serves as the project's visual anchor, while giving downtown <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> a 
significant landmark in an area mostly occupied by run-down industrial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of completely covering the building's steel frame, the architects made 
it a key feature. Painted red to pick up the color of the trolleys, the steel 
members form striking giant X's at the building's base. A single size of 
window, repeated many times, cut costs and generated eye-catching visual 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Between windows, the building is covered with a light, Styrofoam-like material 
called <ORGANIZATION>Sto</ORGANIZATION>. It had never been used in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, according to the architects, 
and it gives the building a rich, solid appearance. 
</P>
<P>
City planner <PERSON>Munsell</PERSON> gets credit for suggesting landscaping the top of the 
parking structure. Planters atop tall pillars contain creeping vines that will 
eventually spread along the structure's perimeter, following a network of 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its many successes, the <LOCATION>Mills</LOCATION> building has shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the clock tower should be more than a giant piece of art. At 
30-by-30-feet square, couldn't it have housed some uses? MTDB General Counsel 
<PERSON>Jack Limber</PERSON>, who departed from his usual legal and management duties to oversee 
this project, said the construction budget didn't allow anything inside the 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
But a 30-by-30 space could have become a 900-square-foot artist's loft on each 
of several floors. It would have been interesting to see proposals for 
developing the tower's interior. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a useful purpose within, the tower needs something to animate its 
base. A ground-floor snack shop, sandwich counter, news stand or some other use 
would give people a reason to use the adjacent plaza more often. It's not too 
late to consider this. 
</P>
<P>
A final drawback is the shady central plaza, where the sun's rays are blocked 
by the office building most of the day. That's not a problem during the warmer 
months, but, on a breezy <DATE>March morning</DATE>, the plaza was deserted. People 
clustered in one splotch of sunlight at its outer edge. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: <PERSON>Michael Graves</PERSON>, designer of the <LOCATION>Aventine</LOCATION>, the new La Jolla 
office-hotel complex that is not well-liked by many <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architects, gets 
heavy coverage in the <DATE>March</DATE> issue of Progressive Architecture. If <LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION> 
think the <LOCATION>Aventine</LOCATION> is wild, they should see Graves' cartoonish <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> hotels 
for <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION>, topped with giant swans.

<P>
This image-conscious, beachfront city is about to become an architectural 
mecca. A new civic center designed by <PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON> is a pleasing and 
perplexing piece of work, the kind of place that should gain national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the center's human scale, wit and strong ties to the 
surrounding streets should provide the fabric that the city's threadbare core 
needs so desperately. 
</P>
<P>
Already, several new projects are scheduled to break ground nearby, including 
an apartment/retail complex, the kind of mixed use so effective in downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, who designed the legendary '60s condominiums at the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Ranch</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sonoma 
County</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Piazza</LOCATION> d'Italia in <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> and a soon-to-be-built theaters 
complex for <LOCATION>Escondido</LOCATION>, has given <LOCATION>Oceanside</LOCATION> a late-century homage to early 
20th-Century <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Among the civic center's strong points are its rich detailing, sensitive 
siting, subtle echoes of <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON> and a nod to the importance of the 
automobile. Weaknesses include detailing, which at times obscures strong basic 
lines, and colors so whimsical that they sometimes distract from the solid 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's the bare backside of the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> building, which <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> 
envisioned as cloaked in vine-covered trellises. These were vetoed by the 
current council after being approved by its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1929</DATE>, <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> drew his own plans for a civic center on this same site in the 
middle of downtown at North Hill Street and 3rd Avenue, featuring his trademark 
arched arcades. Although most of the complex was never realized, his fire 
station and administrative building still stand on <ORGANIZATION>Nevada Street</ORGANIZATION>. These will 
eventually be renovated and put to city use. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s design incorporates several Gill-inspired arches. Most often, these are 
used at the edges of covered public walkways that provide key pedestrian 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
But, where <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s architecture was spare modernism, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, hailed by many as a 
forefather of the postmodern movement, believes in rich ornamentation and a 
more light-hearted approach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the civic center has some of <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s austerity, it has much more of 
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s own playful complexity, nowhere more apparent than in several of the 
public areas, where most of the money for ornamentation was spent on the 
colorful tiles. These flow like a rainbow sherbet river up walls and down a 
mock alluvial fan leading into the fractured geometries of a large fountain. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful perspective on these colors can be had from mid-block on <PERSON>Ditmar 
Street</PERSON>, looking west through the heart of the project. A soaring opening marks 
the center of the project, its ziggurat forms lined with maize, gray, mauve and 
red tiles. Below this pedestrian entry, workers were putting the finishing 
touches on a palm fountain to be bordered by eight tall lights in the form of 
palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Expanses of tile frame the entrance to the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> chamber lobby, a 
wonderful space beneath a gigantic rectangular skylight, where a dramatic sky 
bridge crosses overhead to connect this building with the one next door. 
</P>
<P>
Progress on the council chamber was slowed when the city decided to add such 
high-tech features as large-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of the various offices in the center, the first of which should be 
occupied late in <DATE>February</DATE>, shows up a few shortcomings. The partitioned work 
cubicles often clutter the spaces and block valuable light and views. Project 
design consultant <PERSON>Robbin Hayne</PERSON> said the architects wanted lower partition 
walls, and he wishes they had lobbied harder. 
</P>
<P>
Looking out from upper-level offices and hallways, the viewer is often 
confronted with unsightly rooftop mechanical equipment. <PERSON>Hayne</PERSON> said there wasn't 
sufficient budget to hide these appliances. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, though, the project succeeds magnificently with its two 
grandest gestures: a pedestrian space at the southwestern corner and the 
automobile entry along <PERSON>Ditmar Street</PERSON>, which runs through the project beneath an 
enclosed pedestrian bridge between two of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Working with <ORGANIZATION>Urban Innovations Group of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> and production architects 
<PERSON>Danielson</PERSON> Design of San <PERSON>Juan Capistrano</PERSON>, <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was selected from a talented 
field in a <DATE>1986</DATE> competition. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Edgardo Contini</PERSON>, former president of UIG, had a hand in the design, lending his 
rational site planning to the group of designers who helped <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> work in his 
favorite team fashion. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hayne</PERSON> remembers the creation of the tiled "alluvial fan" that runs downhill 
through the center of the project, culminating in the large public fountain 
near the corner of Hill and Third streets. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the result of Charles having pencil in hand and drawing it during a 
design session. He is wholly responsible." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s unconventional alluvial fan and fountain, with their jagged angles, are 
screened by a grid of palm trees anchoring the corner in the most orderly 
fashion. Here's the epitome of <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s left and right brains working in happy 
tandem, as they do, with varying degrees of success, throughout the project. 
</P>
<P>
The library is the only portion of the project now in use. Its witty interior 
is marred only by mundane oak shelving and counters. The entry space has 
amazing energy. It rises to two stories, ringed by huge clerestory windows 
which make artificial lighting unnecessary during daylight hours. Study carrels 
line the second-floor railing behind arches set atop long, thin columns. 
</P>
<P>
Moving through this main space, one gets a sense of awe and respect appropriate 
for the repository of the city's knowledge and history. 
</P>
<P>
The northern side of the project is the least visible, but generates its own 
architectural excitement. A series of concrete buttresses fly toward the street 
from the parking garage, as if to prove that acres of rainbow tiles aren't 
essential to creating dramatic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering painting these bold forms. Pray that they don't. 
Architects and citizens should fight tooth and nail to preserve these finely 
crafted, unadorned details. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy pressure is also needed to make the city change its mind regarding the 
trellises <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> designed to soften the stark walls of the council chamber 
building. Of their <MONEY>$320,000</MONEY> total cost, <MONEY>$160,000</MONEY> had been spent when the new 
council did their flip-flop last <DATE>summer</DATE>. In an homage to <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>, these would have 
warmed the plain, white walls, including two five-sided turrets, with flowering 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday, someone will realize it would be nice to put them up," <PERSON>Hayne</PERSON> 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the most part, new buildings at UC <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> have disregarded their 
settings. Until a few years ago, this was a campus of low-key wooden structures 
set among the eucalyptuses. 
</P>
<P>
Into their midst in recent years dropped such intergalactic interlopers as the 
Price Center and the <ORGANIZATION>Graduate School of International Relations</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Pacific 
Studies</LOCATION> -- contemporary buildings that would work better in a more commercial 
or industrial setting. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the new <ORGANIZATION>Molecular Biology Research Facility Unit II</ORGANIZATION>, designed by 
architects <ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble Yudell</ORGANIZATION> in collaboration with <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> landscape 
architect <PERSON>Andy Spurlock</PERSON> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> artist <PERSON>Jackie Ferrara</PERSON>, is one of the best 
buildings on campus. It proves that a contemporary structure housing 
cutting-edge research can cut a subtle profile. The building was funded by the 
<ORGANIZATION>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>, which has a history of backing 
well-designed research facilities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its fine design, the building marks the first time the <PERSON>Stuart 
Collection</PERSON>, which oversees public art on campus, has been involved so early in 
the design process. <PERSON>Mary Beebe</PERSON>, the collection's director, suggested that 
artist <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> join the design team. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara first met architect <PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Max Protetch Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
in the early '80s, when <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s drawings were in one room, while <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON>'s art 
was in another. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> had a meeting to test their compatibility, and, despite 
cultural differences, they hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other new campus buildings, which fail to address the campus master plan 
and its key circulation routes, the new research facility was intended to be 
relatively secluded. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want a lot of foot traffic, but they did want some sense of 
connection to the campus," said architect <PERSON>John Ruble</PERSON>, who, with partner <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, 
played a key role in the design. "It's a building where a few initiated people 
work long hours. Any laboratory building is a controlled environment. The air 
is conditioned and filtered, and the work can involve toxic stuff. They didn't 
want uncontrolled access." 
</P>
<P>
Unit II, situated on a prominent site near the southern entrance on <ORGANIZATION>Gilman 
Drive</ORGANIZATION>, was artfully grafted to 3-year-old Unit I, a stark concrete-block 
structure designed by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Leonard Veitzer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Why does this new building succeed where its peers on campus fail? 
</P>
<P>
Mainly because its designers knew where to add flourishes and where to play 
their hand close to the vest. 
</P>
<P>
The facade facing <ORGANIZATION>Gilman Drive</ORGANIZATION>, made of steel, glass and concrete, is neither 
overtly busy, like the Price Center, nor awkwardly composed, like the massive 
new concrete Engineering Building Unit I designed by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architects BSHA. 
</P>
<P>
Materials in muted grays and greens, combined with the subtle mound of earth 
between the building and <PERSON>Gilman</PERSON>, help the structure recede behind a screen of 
eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
The real drama is saved for the other facade. Here, terraces detailed by 
<PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> from <PERSON>Spurlock</PERSON>'s original landscape plan flank main entry steps that 
lead to a dramatic courtyard detailed by <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the building consists of two wings of laboratories on three 
levels, joined by the architects' entry plaza and <ORGANIZATION>Ferrara</ORGANIZATION>'s terraces. 
</P>
<P>
Screened by low walls of concrete block, the terraces are intended for the 
scientists who work in the building, not for the campus community at large. 
</P>
<P>
Consisting of angular slate paths set in gravel, punctuated by lines of 
Australian willows, the terraces make a striking, somber statement, though even 
<PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> is not sure what emotions she hoped to convey. 
</P>
<P>
"I met some of the scientists, and came away with a notion about a stone 
garden," <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> said. "I consistently try to do work that is non-referential, 
so that it will tend to have timeless connotations, like Stonehenge or the 
pyramids." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara modeled the shapes of her two terraces on the footprints of the wings 
they parallel. 
</P>
<P>
Moore designed the curved entry steps between the terraces. Ferrara had 
proposed angular steps, but the curved forms are better. They serve as a sort 
of animated hinge between the terraces. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the entry to Unit I, directly connected to sidewalks, offers the 
easiest pedestrian access to the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> didn't see the architects' design before she did her work, 
there is a surprising continuity of mood between the terraces and the 
courtyard: primitive and monumental. 
</P>
<P>
Inlaid granite gives richness to weighty concrete-block walls around the entry 
court. Smooth plaster is sculpted into a variety of classically influenced 
forms, such as large pilasters on the main entry tower and courtyard columns 
topped with angular Pharaoh's heads. 
</P>
<P>
Curved and straight concrete benches in the courtyard form a yin-yang sort of 
ensemble in front of a fountain beneath an arch. A shading trellis of thick 
wood beams rests atop massive plaster columns. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the architects gave the labs a sense of openness reminiscent of <PERSON>Louis 
Kahn</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION>, barely a mile away. Natural light comes from large banks 
of conventional and clerestory windows. 
</P>
<P>
The building, now partly occupied, opens officially in <DATE>June</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON>, clearly a perfectionist, isn't done. For one thing, she 
doesn't like the "elephant trunk" shapes of the stair railings near her 
terraces. These will be altered or replaced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the school is trying to find money for 15 teak benches designed by 
<PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> for the terraces, <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> said. These would make the expanses of gravel 
and slate more user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara's successful collaboration with <PERSON>Moore Rubell Yudell</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>The Spurlock 
Office</ORGANIZATION> proves that involving an artist early in the design process can produce 
art more subtle and innovative than the plop-art afterthoughts bolted to so 
many concrete pads outside other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Lee Platt</PERSON> died <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after brain surgery. 
Platt, 40, had won several awards for his work. Most recently, he completed 
designs for a recreation center in <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Penasquitos</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Maritime Museum</ORGANIZATION> 
in <LOCATION>Old Town</LOCATION>. Platt's late father, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>, was also a local architect. Platt is 
survived by a daughter <PERSON>Emily</PERSON>, 2, and wife, <LOCATION>Chica</LOCATION>, an architect who will take 
over as president of <ORGANIZATION>Platt Architects</ORGANIZATION>. Services will be held at <TIME>10 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> 
at <ORGANIZATION>Glen Abbey Memorial Park</ORGANIZATION>. Donations can be made to <ORGANIZATION>Mercy Hospital</ORGANIZATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Cancer Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's column on the new Uptown District project in <LOCATION>Hillcrest</LOCATION> should have 
credited Lorimer-Case Architects for all residential and commercial design on 
the portion of the development east of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> Street.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (8): The rural fabric of
domesticity - Most new towns are notable for their unmemorable architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH new towns conjure up the whole range of architectural visions of the
<DATE>second half of the twentieth century</DATE>.
In fact, their architectural origins go right back to the early days of new
town propaganda when <PERSON>Ebenezer Howard</PERSON> published his manifesto about garden
cities in <DATE>1898</DATE>, Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform.
This book was full of utopian ideas about town planning based upon <PERSON>Howard</PERSON>'s
own version of what he called, 'Common sense socialism'. Ebeneezer Howard
was to go on to found in the early <DATE>1900s</DATE> his <ORGANIZATION>First Garden City Company</ORGANIZATION> and
to assemble the land and devise a plan for the building of <LOCATION>Letchworth Garden
City</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Hertfordshire</LOCATION>.
To plan the very first British new town <PERSON>Howard</PERSON> employed the services of
<PERSON>Barry Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Raymond Unwin</PERSON>, two very young architects who were
responsible for the physical form of <ORGANIZATION>Howard</ORGANIZATION>'s socially reforming ideas.
Gardens and landscape were almost as important as the architecture - indeed
the main architectural virtues of <LOCATION>Letchworth</LOCATION> are to be seen in the modest
and sensibly planned traditional houses.
Architects involved in the early days of the garden city movement were
responsible for building the visions of practical idealists. At <LOCATION>Letchworth</LOCATION>
and later at <LOCATION>Welwyn Garden City</LOCATION> the architecture definitely takes second
place to the planning of interrelated housing and industrial areas.
Domestic architecture is agreeable and modest in these towns and the public
buildings are mainly traditional and unadventurous. The mission of the early
new towns was not to create architectural monuments but to provide good
simple homes with gardens and easy access to the workplace.
In <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, the first new towns were far from the forefront of 20th Century
architecture. There is little sign of the influence of the <ORGANIZATION>International
Modern Movement</ORGANIZATION> or of pioneers such as Le Corbusier in the British new towns
until well after the second world war.
Harlow new town in <LOCATION>Essex</LOCATION> was one of the first towns to acquire a distinctive
architectural character. The architect for the town was Sir <PERSON>Frederic
Gibberd</PERSON>, probably better known as the architect of <LOCATION>Heathrow Airport</LOCATION> and the
wig-wam shaped Roman Catholic cathedral of Christ the King in <LOCATION>Liverpool</LOCATION>.
He had very strong architectural ideas and introduced the first tower block
of flats into a new town. Harlow was designated in <DATE>1947</DATE> and its town centre
has some of the modern sentimentality of the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>. The sentiment
comes in modern interpretations of traditional market square and clock
tower.
The atmosphere of the new towns of the <DATE>1950s</DATE> was that of the Festival of
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> - a sort of spiky contemporary architecture and a child-like use of
primary colours. Harlow, however, did pioneer the commissioning of works of
art and is now famous for its outdoor sculpture collection.
<LOCATION>Stevenage</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Crawley</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bracknell</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Basildon</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hemel Hempstead</PERSON> and
<LOCATION>Welwyn</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Newton Aycliffe</PERSON> and Peterlee all belong to the English first
generation of new towns being designated in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>. They are all
architecturally unmemorable.
Of this first wave only Peterlee had a distinctive architectural agenda. The
emigre Russian modernist architect <PERSON>Berthold Lubetkin</PERSON>, famous for the penguin
pool at <LOCATION>London Zoo</LOCATION>, was brought in to design the town. His proposals were
imaginative and very promising essays in abstract modern architecture. But
<PERSON>Lubetkin</PERSON> fell foul of the elaborate committee system that tends to dog any
major public enterprise in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and felt obliged to resign. He was not
prepared to compromise on his distinctive architectural designs and so
Peterlee lost the chance to be an uncompromisingly modern new town.
Of the second wave of new towns (late <DATE>1950s</DATE> and early <DATE>1960s</DATE>) it was
<LOCATION>Cumbernauld</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> - commissioned in <DATE>1955</DATE> - that took the opportunity
to have a remarkable town centre design that separated the motor car from
the pedestrian and effectively made the whole town centre one large
megastructure.
The architects were a firm called <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Womersley</ORGANIZATION>. Their design was
based on the wish to make the town easy for the pedestrian. The vast town
centre on a hilltop has never won many architectural plaudits. The use of
concrete as the main material was an unwise choice for the Scottish climate
and the centre has weathered badly.
It has been left to <PERSON>Milton Keynes</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s largest new town founded in
<LOCATION>North Buckinghamshire</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, to be the one town that had produced
architecture and landscaping that could be considered remarkable.
The appointment of <PERSON>Fred Lloyd Roche</PERSON> and <PERSON>Derek Walker</PERSON> to head up the
development team of architects created an unusual architectural climate in
the new city. The <ORGANIZATION>Development Corporation</ORGANIZATION> built up a very strong team of
architects so that a great deal of the new architecture was designed
'in-house'.
The main manifestation of this policy is the great shopping centre that is
one giant mall. It is designed in a simple and elegant way - unremarkable
outside but beautifully planted and finished internally. Two things
particularly distinguish <PERSON>Milton Keynes</PERSON> - its grid plan of roads - designed
by the master planners Llewelyn-Davies, <PERSON>Weekes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Forestier Walker</PERSON> and Bor,
and the quality of its industrial buildings that were all supervised by the
<ORGANIZATION>Development Corporation</ORGANIZATION> architects.
On the housing front the town is also interesting being built at a time when
private housing played its part in the growth of the city. A wide range of
architects and developers built housing in the city including Sir <PERSON>Norman
Foster</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ralph Erskine</PERSON>. There are no monuments in any of the new towns -
<PERSON>Milton Keynes</PERSON> is remarkable for a <ORGANIZATION>Buddhist Temple</ORGANIZATION> and a domed ecumenical
church in the very centre of the town.
Architects played their part in the development of the new towns but it has
to be said that the British wish to live in green places that may well
appear suburban is what has won the day in the new towns. Their mixture of
uses makes them urban but in appearance and spaciousness they are not so
much towns as new suburbs.
The British like the idea of the country in the town and <PERSON>MIlton Keynes</PERSON> has
achieved this to an unusual degree. Although <PERSON>Milton Keynes</PERSON> has very good
architecture - it has millions of very good trees. These make the town
almost invisible from the roads - and perhaps it is true of almost all the
towns that the landscaping puts the architecture in its place.

Manager <PERSON>Harry Peacock</PERSON> said the Civic Center's architectural design represents
a "happy medium" between an institutional-looking building and a residential
appearing structure. "We wanted something that said this is a civic building,

construction should take seven to nine months.;    The Civic Center
Improvement Project was authorized by the council last year to ease staff
overcrowding and better accommodate the public. Bond financing for the project
has already been approved.;    Other elements include landscaping and redesign
of the parking lots for the entire Civic Center, interior remodeling of the
<ORGANIZATION>Community Center</ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION>Allendale Avenue</ORGANIZATION>, renovation and addition to the city's
corporation yard building, renovation work on the nearby <ORGANIZATION>Warner Hutton House</ORGANIZATION>,
and the construction of a skateboard center between the corporation yard and
the <ORGANIZATION>Community Center.</ORGANIZATION>;    The council inspected the drawings for a nearly
4,000-square-foot skateboard complex with three bowls. The design is similar
to a skateboard park that recently opened at <LOCATION>Greer Park</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Palo Alto.</LOCATION>;   
Three bowls will be surrounded with concrete decking and grass, and there will
be a shed containing helmets, pads and other skateboard equipment. A six-foot
chain link fence will also be put around it.  </TEXT>

<P>
Few weeks go by in the design community without some sort of an award program 
or other. Last week, it was the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Endowment</ORGANIZATION> of the Arts 
traveling to <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> to hand out the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence 
to regional winners, having already announced the awards a few months ago at 
ceremonies in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This week Progressive Architecture (<ORGANIZATION>PA</ORGANIZATION>) magazine is scheduled to disclose the 
winners of its coveted annual awards program in the categories of architectural 
design, urban design and planning, and applied research, with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 
practitioners as usual expected to garner more than their share. 
</P>
<P>
Bestowing honors in <DATE>December</DATE> was the Society of American Registered Architects, 
the <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>American Society of Landscape 
Architects</ORGANIZATION>, and Architectural Record magazine, the latter in a new, highly 
touted awards program entitled "In the Public Interest." 
</P>
<P>
And scheduled over the next few months are the awards ceremonies of the <LOCATION>San 
Fernando Valley</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> chapters, among others, of the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Institute of Architects</ORGANIZATION>, culminating with the institute's national awards in 
<DATE>May</DATE>. Also on tap is the bi-annual <PERSON>Rudy Brunner</PERSON> Award for Urban Excellence and 
the tri-annual Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
I have generally viewed many of the awards programs with a certain reticence. 
Too often, juries have appeared predisposed and doctrinaire, influenced by peer 
pressure, passing fads, flashy photography, and heavily promoted personalities 
easily identified by signature styles. (Except sometimes to the embarrassment 
of the juries, it is hard to tell the masters from the mimics.) Such self 
congratulatory exercises can become a bore. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I have found most awards programs to be of value, presenting as they do 
glimpses of the shifting styles and prejudices of the design profession in 
select geographic areas and project categories. When sitting at the design 
table it is instructive to know what deck the players are dealing from, and if 
jokers are wild. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally gems are uncovered. This usually happens when juries in fits 
of independent intelligence judge submissions based on a critical matrix of 
substantive architectural issues, such as social, contextual and structure, 
instead of trying to pigeonhole them according to the shifting superficial 
styles sanctified by a <PERSON>Charles Jencks</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Robert A.M. Stern</PERSON>, or a similar 
pedant. 
</P>
<P>
Award programs also have the potential when properly focused, conducted and 
publicized to heighten public and professional awareness of the potential of 
good design. In addition, by honoring such efforts others involved in a 
particular design process might be encouraged to emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
Given this potential, and the general low level of publicly funded design, I 
feel the Presidential Awards program deserves special mention. Presented every 
four years, the program honors designs in a variety of federally sponsored 
projects, including architecture, landscape design, planning and historic 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the Design Excellence list was the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans Memorial on the 
<LOCATION>Washington Mall</LOCATION>, including both the expressive, intersecting black granite 
walls designed by <PERSON>Maya Ying Lin</PERSON>, and the accompanying realistic sculpture of 
three soldiers by <PERSON>Frederick Hart</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included the urban design of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Avenue</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, 
the planning of a transit project in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, and the engineering of a bridge in 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>. (Of the 10 top awards, only one -- in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> -- was west of the 
<LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, indicating once again what I feel is a distinct <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> 
prejudice of Washington-based programs. But that is another topic for another 
time.) 
</P>
<P>
Locally, one of the 68 national Achievement Awards went to the adaptive reuse 
of the former hotel overlooking the <LOCATION>Arroyo Seco</LOCATION> south of <LOCATION>Colorado Boulevard</LOCATION> as 
a federal court and office building. Architects for the imaginative effort that 
preserved the landmark was the <LOCATION>Pasadena</LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION>Neptune &amp; Thomas 
Associates</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Also winning an Achievement Award was the renovation of a dated, deteriorated 
bungalow at <ORGANIZATION>2303 Fifth St.</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Ocean Park</LOCATION> area of <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> into a 
desirable apartment complex. It was accomplished by the determined non-profit 
<ORGANIZATION>Community Corp.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> and the resourceful architecture of the local 
firm of <ORGANIZATION>Fondi-Bonardi &amp; Associates</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In bestowing a bevy of awards, the jury for the <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION> chapter of 
the <ORGANIZATION>American Society of Landscape Architects</ORGANIZATION> made the provocative point that 
the profession's focus was in flux. It declared that "while the variety of 
projects receiving awards reflected the landscape architect's broad ability to 
successfully design for any location, the real challenge is to create more 
'livable' urban spaces designed with people in mind." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate its point, the jury gave an Award of Excellence to the <LOCATION>Santa 
Monica</LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION>Campbell &amp; Campbell</ORGANIZATION> for its design of the pier area of 
<ORGANIZATION>Imperial Beach</ORGANIZATION>. It was noted that the design featuring the conversion of a 
derelict parking lot into a landscaped plaza was developed with the intense 
participation of local residents, in design jargon, the potential user. 
</P>
<P>
Other landscape architecture winners included Dike/Runa of <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION> for 
the Hidden Oaks Ranch in <ORGANIZATION>Valley Center</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>SWA Group of Laguna Beach</ORGANIZATION> for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Baywood Apartment</ORGANIZATION> complex in <LOCATION>Newport Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
This recognition of the "user" is heartening. And while few actual "users," the 
person or persons a project is specifically designed for, are ever invited onto 
the juries of the various associations conducting awards program, they are, of 
course, the ultimate jurors, passing judgment daily on the projects experienced 
in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, we are all jurors, and design critics.

 DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: URBAN SPACE MESSAGE FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to urban spaces, <PERSON>William Whyte</PERSON> is our leading lab technician. His 
findings aren't mere theories. For nearly 20 years, he's been dissecting <LOCATION>New 
York City</LOCATION> and other dense urban areas to find out what makes them tick. In his 
new book "City: Rediscovering the Center," the summation of <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON>'s knowledge 
to date is compiled in a single volume for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite tools is the hidden camera. The book is full of candid 
photos showing how people behave in cities, what they like, and what they don't 
like. Street vendors, comfortable seating, warmth and wind shielding, and 
various forms of entertainment are all essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of these things seem like obvious ways of attracting and pleasing 
people, they are still often ignored. Right here in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON> would be 
appalled at the backwards ways of some of our downtown plazas. A noon walk 
through the heart of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> indicates all is not well. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, in anticipation of the opening of the Horton Plaza shopping 
center in <DATE>1984</DATE>, much hype touted the coming of the new downtown. The <ORGANIZATION>Hahn Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 
the project's developer, began spending promotional dollars, and the results 
made the heart of downtown appear lively for a time. On barriers around the 
construction site were murals of prominent downtown figures, a pioneering (for 
<LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>) form of urban art. <PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> also brought live noon concerts to Horton 
Plaza Park, and mimes and other street entertainers to various locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>Desolate Place 
</P>
<P>
Horton Plaza Park</ORGANIZATION> today is a desolate place. Plants have died in the planters 
outside the Broadway store facing the park; one suspects they are used as 
urinals during what you might call the wee wee hours. At the heart of the 
original <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza</ORGANIZATION>, around the fountain designed by architect <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>, 
street people sit on benches or recline on the grass. Not a single white-collar 
type dares walk through this park, even with three police officers on duty. 
</P>
<P>
What's happened is that the <ORGANIZATION>Hahn Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s promotional dollars are now spent inside 
the mall, where you'll find the pushcart vendors and entertainers. Now, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza Activities Committee</ORGANIZATION>, including city officials and 
</P>
<P>
downtown business types, is doing what it should have done long ago: bringing 
back some action. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to handle the problem of undesirables is to make a place 
attractive to everyone else," <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON> writes in his book. "Good places are 
largely self-policing. . . . In the 16 years that I have been studying <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 
plazas and small parks, there has been real trouble in only three, all three of 
them badly designed and managed." 
</P>
<P>
A new Arts Tix kiosk near the park will help generate a stream of office 
workers who will make their peers more comfortable in <LOCATION>Horton Plaza Park</LOCATION>. And, 
by mid-July, there should be live entertainment and food carts, according to 
<PERSON>Ted Medina</PERSON> of the city's Parks and <ORGANIZATION>Recreation Department</ORGANIZATION>. Asked why it took so 
long, he said the park was never intended as a place for entertainment. 
Apparently, someone is seeing the wisdom of <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON>'s ways 
</P>
<P>
The plaza at the <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo Bank</ORGANIZATION> building at 101 W. Broadway works better than 
most; yet a significant portion of the public space at the federal building 
across the street remains a wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Out in Droves 
</P>
<P>
According to the hot dog vendor at <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo</ORGANIZATION>'s plaza (there's also an 
espresso stand), people come out in droves as the weather warms up. Whyte is a 
proponent of public sculpture, and there is a piece here -- <PERSON>Charles Ross</PERSON>'s 
"Light, Rock and Water," significant for its presence even if it isn't our 
greatest piece of art. As <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON> would wish, low walls around planters provide 
plenty of good seating. 
</P>
<P>
Bill the hot dog vendor is thinking of hiring a mime or some other 
entertainment for his customers this <DATE>spring</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't the building's management provide this under a promotional budget? 
<PERSON>Steve Hess</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>La Salle Partners</ORGANIZATION> manages both the <ORGANIZATION>Wells Fargo</ORGANIZATION> building and the 
<ORGANIZATION>Coast Savings</ORGANIZATION> building next to <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza</ORGANIZATION>, including their plazas. Coast's 
plaza has hosted events such as rallies for presidential candidate <PERSON>Michael 
Dukakis</PERSON>. Hess is considering weekly art exhibits, an excellent idea that they 
should put into action ASAP. But as for the plaza at <LOCATION>Wells Fargo</LOCATION>, no regular 
entertainment is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Near the federal building's main entrance, a variety of people congregate 
during the noon hour. Seating is good, and the entry provides a steady supply 
of people. But only yards away, <ORGANIZATION>Beverly Pepper</ORGANIZATION>'s sculpture "Excalibur," angular 
black steel masses which seem to take off toward the sky, sits alone. It's not 
hard to see why: there's a railing around it to keep you from getting too 
close, and it's at the end of a wind tunnel-like opening in the building which 
funnels stiff gusts through the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Several blocks away, at the corner of 5th Avenue and B Street outside the <ORGANIZATION>First 
Interstate Bank</ORGANIZATION> building, the nude figures in the "Fountain of Two Oceans" 
sculpture by <PERSON>Sergio Benvenuti</PERSON> are the only people who seem to enjoy the outdoor 
plaza. At one time, there were vending carts here, and, even though there's 
nowhere to sit, a few people would congregate. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a deli and sundry shop on the third floor, and they wanted 
protection from competition," explained <PERSON>Steve Hess</PERSON>, the building's manager. He 
said the building's tenants prefer a pristine plaza without a lot of 
hangers-on. What a contrast to walk a block east up B to the plaza at the base 
of <ORGANIZATION>Great American First Savings</ORGANIZATION>' downtown office tower. For years, the place 
has had a huge lunchtime crowd. Whyte would find much to praise here: a coffee 
pushcart, a flower shop, low walls that can be used as seats, good landscaping 
and sun exposure that keeps the place warm at the noon hour year-round. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving Slowly 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>New City</LOCATION> Architect <PERSON>Mike Stepner</PERSON> said he accepts a major portion of the 
responsibility for the life (and death) of downtown's streets, and is well 
aware of <ORGANIZATION>Whyte</ORGANIZATION>'s ideas. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, good intentions are progressing slowly. Street musicians who play 
for tips are, for the moment, illegal. On a recent weekday, only one musician 
was spotted playing a street corner during the noon hour downtown. As for 
pushing pushcarts, sidewalk cafes and better landscaping of public spaces, 
<PERSON>Stepner</PERSON>, again, is all for these things, but says there's a shortage of funds 
and/or cooperation from other city departments. 
</P>
<P>
Small efforts would make big differences downtown. The city and such downtown 
business groups as the <ORGANIZATION>Central City Assn.</ORGANIZATION> should become more aggressive in 
bringing activity to downtown's streets. Local jazz radio stations might be 
invited to help bring live music downtown. College music departments would 
probably also be interested in having an active hand in the life of their 
city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Theater groups, both professional and collegiate, might be enticed to give 
spontaneous performances downtown. And the city needs to advertise for some 
more pushcart vendors -- reduce the cost of permits for stands in public spaces 
(they now require a <MONEY>$500</MONEY> deposit to cover processing costs), and they would 
surely attract more than the existing three pushcart-permit holders. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, we won't be completely embarrassed if <PERSON>Whyte</PERSON> comes for a visit.

<DATELINE> London  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Future scholars may date the nadir of British architecture to <DATE>May 30, 1984</DATE>. 
That's when Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> raised a furor by pillorying a design for a <ORGANIZATION>National Gallery</ORGANIZATION> annex. 
Starved for patronage, the trustees wanted to build an office building overlooking <LOCATION>Trafalgar Square</LOCATION>. 
His highness called it a "monstrous carbuncle." 

   The trustees trembled, and the <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION> family anted up for a nicer building without the crass protrusion. 
<LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> architects <PERSON>Venturi</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Rauch &amp; Scott Brown</ORGANIZATION> designed a much more sensitive addition, politely mindful of regal neighbors and royal tastes. 

   Critics and architects quibble with the prince -- lots -- for being overly reactionary. 
But give him this much: <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s carbuncle quotient is plummeting. 
Leading architects have taken to heart all those fashionable theories about urban contexts and classical elements and put them to work in an extraordinary flurry of new construction here. 
The results mightn't live up to the glorious past, but far surpass the rude concrete junk of recent decades. 
The new breed of buildings here has manners, deferring to the surroundings like wealthy matrons at a <ORGANIZATION>Buckingham Palace</ORGANIZATION> garden party. 

   Not all the attempts succeed, but then not all the matrons dress so well. 
<PERSON>Philip Johnson</PERSON>, ever the troublemaker, last year proposed a grand-scale faux pas, a Kuwaiti-backed office complex that looked just like the Houses of Parliament -- only much larger, and sheathed in mirrored glass. 
The dedicated tourist will find dozens of other architectural malaprops around town with overly intricate exterior detail, eccentric cornice lines and pretentiously formal entrances. 

   The grand-scale projects, on the whole, are utterly correct. 
Any tour has to start with <PERSON>Broadgate</PERSON>, a sprawling redevelopment of some ugly old British Rail yards around Liverpool Street station, on the "fringe" of the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 

   Broadgate is a series of 13 buildings, each square and solid and intended as the home of a square and solid bank. 
The buildings present interesting facades to the street, and make pleasing, nicely scaled public spaces outside while giving their occupants big open trading floors inside. 
The first phases -- the work of a British firm called <ORGANIZATION>Arup Associates</ORGANIZATION> -- go in heavily for atria with some Babylonesque upper-level gardens. 
There's a plaza with an ice rink, a homage to Rockefeller Center that, after the stock-market crash, seems an extravagance. 

   The later phases are the work of <ORGANIZATION>Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</ORGANIZATION> (SOM), which has embraced the neoclassical mode so popular among developers the world over. 
A huge building going up on the east side of the station has arches, grand stairways and granite facing, evoking the Victorian insurance and shipping houses elsewhere in town. 

   These buildings dress up a dreary patch of city, but still fit in. 
The impact of <ORGANIZATION>Canary Wharf</ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest and most ballyhooed commercial development, is harder to gauge. 
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s once-derelict Docklands, a few miles downriver, it has nothing much to fit into. 
The project's creator, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> developer <PERSON>G. Ware Travelstead</PERSON>, had a futuristic vision of asymmetrical towers and a massive substructure of roads and parking-garage space. 

   Last year he was elbowed aside by <ORGANIZATION>Olympia &amp; York</ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <PERSON>Reichmann</PERSON> brothers from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, who are now completing <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>World Financial Center</ORGANIZATION>. 
As reshaped by the <LOCATION>Reichmanns</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Canary Wharf</ORGANIZATION> is twice the size of the <ORGANIZATION>WFC</ORGANIZATION>, but similarly respectful to architectural history in spirit. 
SOM went back to the drawing board and came up with a more formal parade of fashionably postmodern towers along a central parkway. 
The Canadians hired Sir <PERSON>Roy Strong</PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION>Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</ORGANIZATION>, to be their "open-space adviser." 
Sir <PERSON>Roy</PERSON> gushes about the parks, shrubs and trees. 
There will be railings, lampposts and park benches built just as they used to be, he says. 

   Lampposts can't hide the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Canary Wharf</ORGANIZATION> is going to be one crowded dock, chockablock with hulking if tasteful edifices from such noted <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> firms as <PERSON>Kohn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pederson</PERSON>, Fox and SOM. <PERSON>Cesar Pelli</PERSON> designed the centerpiece, a skyscraper that will be the tallest in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>. 
<PERSON>Mr. Pelli</PERSON> says the obelisk doesn't look like anything in particular. 
In fact, it looks an awful lot like one of the towers at the <ORGANIZATION>WFC</ORGANIZATION>, another <PERSON>Pelli</PERSON> creation. 
But that's probably fine, because the outsize scale of this will be more like <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> than ye olde <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. 

   Canary Wharf won't pierce the horizon for a year or two yet, keeping attention focused on projects upriver. 
Preservationists and developers just had it out -- again -- in a five-week hearing about No. 1 Poultry, a small triangle in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> right at the historical heart of global finance. 
Owner <PERSON>Peter Palumbo</PERSON> originally proposed a Mies van der Rohe office block, all sleek and rectangular and now almost laughably out of fashion. 
Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> called it a "glass stump." 
That plan bit the dust in <DATE>1985</DATE>. 

   Its replacement is the right shape and the right size, and in the right stone materials. 
It's by one of the right architects, much-praised museum wizard and native son <PERSON>James Stirling</PERSON>. 
But it's startling all the same, with a medley of circular and triangular elements and big portals straight out of an Egyptian temple. 
At the triangle's apex -- staring straight down the street at illustrious neighbors such as the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of England</ORGANIZATION> -- <PERSON>Mr. Stirling</PERSON> placed a turret, with little gangplanks on either side. 
The government is expected to rule yea or nay by fall. 

   Still ahead is what could be the archidrama of the decade, hearings over a replacement for <ORGANIZATION>Paternoster Square</ORGANIZATION>, a dreadful <DATE>1960s</DATE> complex just to the north of <ORGANIZATION>St. Paul's Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>. 
Gray, bleak and Stalinist, it encapsulates the evils of insensitive modern architecture. 
The developers chose <ORGANIZATION>Arup Associates</ORGANIZATION> to design a Broadgatelike complex, with a long arc of a shopping mall, a new piazza and a landscaped buffer between the complex and the great church. 

   Alas for <ORGANIZATION>Arup</ORGANIZATION>, Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> already has made his displeasure known. 
He stood up a few months ago at a <ORGANIZATION>Royal Institute of British Architects</ORGANIZATION> dinner to bite the hands that had just fed him. 
"This is very much the age of the computer and the word processor," he said, "but why on earth do we have to be surrounded by buildings that look like such machines?" 

   The hearings promise to be spirited. 
The <ORGANIZATION>London Evening Standard</ORGANIZATION>, an evening tabloid, took up the royal battle cry. 
It is backing a resolutely classical design by <ORGANIZATION>John Simpson &amp; Partners</ORGANIZATION>, which would put modern offices and shops behind old-fashioned facades and restore ancient street patterns. 

   The plan, like Prince <PERSON>Charles</PERSON>'s laments, is a shade too wistful. 
This is a thriving city in the <DATE>late 20th century</DATE>, not Disneyland and not <LOCATION>Williamsburg</LOCATION>. 
If <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> were rebuilt to 18th-century scale, where would all the Londoners live and work?

<TEXT>
Every year the <ORGANIZATION>Civic Trust</ORGANIZATION> announces its awards for schemes that it
considers to be the best contributions to the improvement of the quality of
the environment. The quality of the architecture, planning, landscape and
civic design are all taken into account.
In order to cover the whole country thoroughly it is divided by alternate
years into the Metropolitan counties and the 'shire' counties. This year is
the turn of the shires of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Northern
Ireland</LOCATION>, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The awards are sponsored
by <ORGANIZATION>Redland plc</ORGANIZATION>.
The value of these wide ranging and catholic awards is that they paint a
clear picture of the state of the arts of architecture and design. In the
middle of the harshest recession in the building and construction industry
for some 45 years it may be surprising to find that nearly 1,100 entries
were received. Cynics may say that publicity is even more important during
recession; or is it that architects and developers have time on their hands?
Despite the large number of entries, the trust is forced to admit that high
quality new development is disappointingly rare. The assessors reported that
far too many were mediocre and ordinary and that there are still far too
many 'overscaled, bland and totally inappropriate modern developments.' It
is a depressing picture of the new buildings of the <DATE>last two years</DATE> and a
very poor reflection of the low standards that the majority of the
architectural profession finds acceptable.
The report of the awards, written by the director of the Civic Trust, <PERSON>Martin
Bradshaw</PERSON>, makes depressing reading. On the evidence before him of all the
entries he is forced to say that the centres of too many British provincial
towns and cities are spoilt by new schemes that 'seem designed to secure
planning permission and avoid criticism, and are all too often lifeless and
ordinary.' Commercial interests come in for particularly strong criticism.
One assessor pointed out the horror of a group of truly awful luxury
headquarters built by nationally known insurance and financial institutions.
The overall gloom of the report makes the highlighting of the few good
schemes more important. There are some 18 award winners and one special
<ORGANIZATION>Redland Prize</ORGANIZATION>. The winners do not exactly glow like beacons of quality, but
a few are exceptional and several are on the road to excellence. In terms of
sheer architectural quality, <LOCATION>Stansted Airport</LOCATION> and the Crescent Wing at the
<ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury Centre</ORGANIZATION> for the Visual Arts at the <ORGANIZATION>University of East Anglia</ORGANIZATION>, both
designed by Sir <PERSON>Norman Foster</PERSON> and Partners, are outstanding.
The two commercial award winners are good, but not quite in the Foster
league. <ORGANIZATION>Royal Insurance House</ORGANIZATION>, on a landscaped country site near
<LOCATION>Peterborough</LOCATION> designed by <ORGANIZATION>Arup Associates</ORGANIZATION>, is distinguished by its successful
integration of buildings and landscape. The landscaping, a series of outdoor
rooms with beech and lime plantings, is by <PERSON>Derek Lovejoy</PERSON> and Partners. The
second commercial scheme is a shopping and office development in <LOCATION>Belfast</LOCATION> by
the Building Design Partnership for <ORGANIZATION>John Laing Developments</ORGANIZATION>. I have not seen
this in the flesh, but it looks to be only of average standard from the
photographs.
If these awards are in any way a reflection of the economic state of the
nation, then we have to face the fact that the growth area seems to be in
tourism and restoration of historic buildings. The assessors were full of
praise for high standard of much conservation work and it is undoubtedly
true that the architects who work in this area show dedication and skills
that are absent from much new development. It appears that, when faced with
a clean slate, architects are unable to decide what to do with any real
conviction.
One award winning building is a set of studios and workshops dedicated to
training courses in crafts and restoration at <LOCATION>West Dean College</LOCATION>, near
<LOCATION>Chichester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sussex</LOCATION>. In designing an addition to the long range of a partly
17th-century listed mansion, The Architectural and Planning Partnership has
pulled off something of a coup. The firm has designed a strong flint and
stone wing with almost <PERSON>William Burgess-like</PERSON> projecting windows: powerful
stuff. At <ORGANIZATION>Buckfast Abbey</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Devon</PERSON> the addition of a restaurant in stone and
slate shows the value of using local materials as well as the ingenuity of
incorporating the remains of a 13th-century gatehouse.
There is one inevitable but usually grim modern building that architects
have failed to tackle convincingly: the multi-storey car park. This year
there are two among the 18 award winners. The <ORGANIZATION>Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> and Quay Car Park in
<LOCATION>Exeter</LOCATION>, designed by <PERSON>Niall Phillips</PERSON> Architects, is singled out for the
special <ORGANIZATION>Redland Award</ORGANIZATION> because of the way it achieves the remarkable feat of
fitting a car park onto a city slope, and in the process managing to dignify
the whole function of car parking. The other car park award winner is the
more flamboyant and controversial Avenue de <LOCATION>Chartres</LOCATION> car park in <LOCATION>Chichester</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Sussex</LOCATION>, designed by Birds, <LOCATION>Portchmouth</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Russum</PERSON> Architects. This intriguing
complex won an architectural competition, and its five circular brick towers
and honeycomb brick walls have become a landmark.
Tourist buildings and visitors centres that have won awards include the
extraordinary White Cliffs experience in <LOCATION>Dover</LOCATION> and the more discreet
reception centre at <ORGANIZATION>Brodick Castle</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>Isle of Arran</ORGANIZATION>. A lead mine, an
iron furnace, disused Welsh quarries and restored canals all reflect the new
uses for a defunct industrial past, and all are good of their kind.
But what is missing from this year's awards are any significant and good new
houses. The Civic Trust rightly complains of the low standards that are
accepted by the volume house builders. This is ultimately the most
depressing element of all. A low standard of house design means a
universally low awareness of the value of good design. And good design, like
so many other values, begins at home. The people of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> suffer from a
design vacuum on the domestic front, which is not a good omen for the
future.

<LEADPARA>  ONE city document describes the park and the grand old buildings surrounding
it as "the most vital urban remnants of 19th century San Jose.";    Another

PRESERVATIONISTS ARE PUSHING HARD TO KEEP WHAT THEY CONSIDER AN INTEGRAL PART
OF CITY HISTORY FROM BECOMING PART OF ITS PAST  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/19/91, pg. 2F);  Because of
a reporter's errors, stories about St. James Square in the April 14 Living
section incorrectly reported several details. The names of Dr. Mark Rifenbark
and the Sainte Claire Club were misspelled. Fred Richards is no longer a
member of the vestry at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. The First Unitarian
Church has 220 members. Because of an editor's error, the former home of the
Eagles Order was incorrect. The correct name is Eagles Hall.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Yet if your San Jose tour guide offered you no further clues, you would be
hard pressed to find this aging central patch of urban greenery, this common
ground.;    It's <LOCATION>St. James Square</LOCATION>, the city center including the 7 1/2- acre
<LOCATION>St. James Park</LOCATION>, containing grass, trees, benches and even a renovated
fountain. The square is encompassed by <LOCATION>East St. James</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>St. John</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>North First
and Third</ORGANIZATION> streets.;    In the <DATE>1800s</DATE>, when <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> was a centrally populated
city of 25,000, <LOCATION>St. James Park</LOCATION> was the place to gather -- for speeches,
parades or <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> strolls.;    More recently, as the city lost its
commercial and residential core, the park has been neglected, forgotten, a
refuge for street people and little else.;    Within the last few years,
however, a preservationist movement has begun in <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>. New voices are
demanding the city retain some of its architectural and cultural history, and
people have a vision for the <ORGANIZATION>St. James Square</ORGANIZATION> of the '90s.;    Most of the
historic buildings facing the park are still there and still in use: the <ORGANIZATION>San
Jose Athletic Club</ORGANIZATION> (a former <ORGANIZATION>Scottish Rite Temple</ORGANIZATION>), <ORGANIZATION>First Unitarian Church</ORGANIZATION>,
<ORGANIZATION>Trinity Episcopal Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Post Office, <ORGANIZATION>Santa Clara County Courthouse</ORGANIZATION>
(temporarily closed for earthquake repair) and the <LOCATION>St. Claire Club.</LOCATION>;    "It
represents one of the smallest historic districts in the country," says
downtown architect <PERSON>Craig Mineweaser</PERSON>. "We're really in danger of losing the
district as a designation if we lose one more building.";    And one
architectural treasure on the square is in grave danger. Architect <PERSON>Willis
Polk</PERSON>'s 87-year-old <ORGANIZATION>First Church of Christ</ORGANIZATION>, Scientist sits empty and
deteriorating on valuable land the owners hope to turn into a parking lot.
Inspired by the Ionian temple of <LOCATION>Ulysses</LOCATION>, it's a simple but elegant building.
San Jose architect <PERSON>Jerome King</PERSON> has studied the building and calls its
Classical Revival design nearly perfect.;    King is working on a feasibility
study for the <ORGANIZATION>Preservation Action Council</ORGANIZATION>, a citizens' group hoping to save
the church. His report will propose future uses for the building, in the hope
of preventing it from becoming another <LOCATION>St. James Square disaster.</LOCATION>;    If ever
there was a city park with a haunted history, <LOCATION>St. James</LOCATION> is it.;    (box) In
<DATE>1933</DATE>, two thugs kidnapped and murdered department store heir <PERSON>Brooke Hart</PERSON>. They
were dragged from their jail cells by an angry mob and lynched there. The
trees from which their bodies swung are long gone, but the bitter memories
remain.;    (box) President <PERSON>William McKinley</PERSON> spoke there in <DATE>1901</DATE>, six months
before he was assassinated. A statue was erected in his memory.;    (box)
<PERSON>Robert F. Kennedy</PERSON> spoke there in <DATE>1969</DATE>, shortly before his assassination. A
podium in his honor stands there today.;    This is <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s answer to
<LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Central Park</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> Common?;    "The square, I'm sure,
played a central part in the history of the times, but it has not been written
because it was taken for granted," says Mineweaser.;    "It really exemplified
the American city," says urban planner <PERSON>William Zavlaris.</PERSON>;    The park is a
stage;  In <DATE>1848</DATE> -- two years before <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> became a state and <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>
became its first city -- <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> surveyor <PERSON>Charles Lyman</PERSON> plotted <LOCATION>St.
James Park</LOCATION> as the town's central open space. The park's walkways were inspired
by <PERSON>Frederick Law Olmstead</PERSON>, the pioneer urban landscape designer. As the city
grew, religious, social and public buildings went up around it. "The park is
the stage and the surrounding buildings act as backdrop," says King.;    The
result? Something of an an architectural microcosm: Gothic, Greek, Spanish
Colonial and Romanesque revival, <ORGANIZATION>Neoclassical</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance</ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>.
"The square sort of represents the various architects and the various movers
and shakers of their time," says Mineweaser.;    More recently, however, the
park has been a derelict space -- and worse. In <DATE>1955</DATE>, Second Street was
extended, eliminating the central fountain and cutting the park in two. In
<DATE>1968</DATE>, a "temporary" pagoda-style community center was built in the park to
serve the elderly, and political pressure has kept it there. In <DATE>1983</DATE>, the
graceful <ORGANIZATION>Eagles Hall</ORGANIZATION> -- built as a Masonic temple in <DATE>1900</DATE> -- was replaced by
the ugly, nine-story <LOCATION>St. James Park</LOCATION> office tower, which merely retains the
temple's portico as a kind of cut-and-paste false front.;    "<LOCATION>St. James Square</LOCATION>
never was the center of the city in the sense that Plaza Park was," says <PERSON>Jack
Douglas</PERSON>, head of Special Collections at <ORGANIZATION>San Jose State University</ORGANIZATION> and former
chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Historic Landmarks Commission</ORGANIZATION>. "It's off-center so it never
was urban removed," <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> says with obvious sarcasm.;    <ORGANIZATION>Eagles Hall</ORGANIZATION> has
been all but removed, however, a loss that moved the <ORGANIZATION>Historic Landmarks
Commission</ORGANIZATION> to adopt strict construction guidelines to control future uses of
this fragile historic district.;    Preservationists find recent public
efforts at historic renovation -- the <PERSON>Thomas Fallon House</PERSON>, county courthouse
and the park itself -- encouraging, however. The park is being refurbished,
with landscaping and a Victorian fountain designed to mirror the spirit of its
origins. Although most of the old elm trees were diseased and had to go, in
<DATE>December</DATE> the city -- and neighborhood residents -- planted new trees in the
park, a gesture intended to encourage people to begin thinking of this open
space as their own.;    And the <ORGANIZATION>Preservation Action Council</ORGANIZATION> will soon release
<PERSON>King</PERSON>'s feasibility study proposing potential future uses for the <ORGANIZATION>First Church
of Christ</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Scientist.</LOCATION>;    Classic challenge;  "It's a classic renovation
challenge in terms of a city trying to keep an historic landmark with land
values where they are," says King. His report will show that -- "though
creative adaptive re-use" -- historic buildings can be "opportunities, not
liabilities.";    Partially funded by the <ORGANIZATION>National Trust for Historic
Preservation</ORGANIZATION>, the study will stress the building's architectural significance
as well as the historical importance of Polk -- a quirky, flamboyant character
who has emerged as one of the leading turn-of-the-century <LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION>
architects.;    It will offer many potential uses for the building -- a
community center, museum, art gallery, performing arts center, even a church
-- but no specific recommendations.;    Nonetheless, the report's clear
preference reportedly will be the use of the building as the central focus of
a mixed-use, high density retail and residential complex.;    "Demolition is
not an option -- because there are so many others," says King.; EAGLES CLUB;  
 Graceful <PERSON>Eagles Hall</PERSON> was built as a Masonic temple in <DATE>1900</DATE>. The Greek Revival
structure later became the home of the <ORGANIZATION>Eagles Order</ORGANIZATION>. In <DATE>1983</DATE>, it was replaced
by the nine-story <LOCATION>St. James Park</LOCATION> office tower, which has kept its portico as
an entrance. Ninety percent of the original building is gone.; TRINITY
EPISCOPAL CATHEDRAL;    This remarkable old redwood church was built in <DATE>1863</DATE>
and is the oldest permanent house of worship in <LOCATION>San Jose.</LOCATION>;    "<ORGANIZATION>Trinity Church</ORGANIZATION>
setting itself there established the fact that this was going to become the
city's center square," says urban planner <PERSON>William Zavlaris.</PERSON>;    A fine example
of carpenter Gothic architecture, <ORGANIZATION>Trinity</ORGANIZATION> follows the design of English
country churches. It originally faced <PERSON>St. James Park</PERSON>, but the parish grew in
the <DATE>1870s</DATE>, so it was cut in half, enlarged and turned sideways facing Second
Street. The tower and spire were added in <DATE>1884</DATE>. "When it was turned sideways,
it became the cruciform (cross-shaped) church that it is now," says <PERSON>Fred
Richards</PERSON>, church vestry member and a retired architect who did structural
repairs in the '50s.;    "The walls were 14 inches out of plumb. There was no
foundation under it," he recalls. "The joke at the time was that the good Lord
and Dr. (Mark) <PERSON>Rifendark</PERSON> (an early church rector) held the church together."; 
  <DATE>Two years ago</DATE>, more work was done on the church by <PERSON>Michael Lorimer</PERSON>, the
architect in charge of <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>'s renovations, to improve its
lighting and acoustics and remove a screen that blocked worshipers' views of
the beautiful stained glass windows.;    Church historian <PERSON>Janice Paull</PERSON> says
<ORGANIZATION>Trinity</ORGANIZATION>'s parish has included many San Jose notables -- including the city's
first mayor, <PERSON>Thomas Fallon</PERSON>. (We may have found the ideal location for that
statue.); <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> POST OFFICE;    In <DATE>1933</DATE>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s downtown post office moved
from one great old building to another -- from the <DATE>1892</DATE> Richardson Romanesque
structure facing Plaza Park (and now serving as the San Jose Museum of Art) to
the Spanish Colonial Revival building facing <LOCATION>St. James Park.</LOCATION>;    The new post
office was built on the site of the former <ORGANIZATION>St. James Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, downtown <LOCATION>San
Jose</LOCATION>'s major hostelry from the <DATE>1890s</DATE>, a structure that also had added stature
to the park. It was designed by <PERSON>Ralph Wykoff</PERSON>, a little known but obviously
capable <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> architect, and built at a cost of <MONEY>$308,000</MONEY> as a <ORGANIZATION>Works
Progress Administration</ORGANIZATION> (WPA) project under the administration of <PERSON>Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.</PERSON>;    The ornate lobby features marble floors, brass lighting
fixtures and carved, exposed-beam ceilings, and the twin projecting towers on
the north and south ends of the building's rectangular roof mirror the towers
of such other buildings on the square as the <ORGANIZATION>First Unitarian Church</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>St.
Claire Club.</ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION>SANTA CLARA COUNTY</LOCATION> COURTHOUSE;    <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> had been <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s
first state capital, from <DATE>1849</DATE> through early <DATE>1851</DATE>. In <DATE>1866</DATE>, the city made a
bold, if fruitless, attempt to lure the state government back here. Esteemed
architect <PERSON>Levi Goodrich</PERSON> was hired to design a county courthouse so grandiose
that it might later serve as the new state capital.;    Although the scheme
failed, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> was left with one of the state's most impressive public
buildings -- and also one of the last remaining structures designed by
<PERSON>Goodrich</PERSON> in his home city. (He may have designed the <PERSON>Thomas Fallon</PERSON> house.);   
"This building really is St. <PERSON>James Square</PERSON>," says <PERSON>Bonnie Bamburg</PERSON>, the
renovation consultant coordinating the county's <MONEY>$16 million</MONEY> repair of the
building after it was damaged in the <LOCATION>Loma Prieta</LOCATION> quake. "Because of the size
and magnitude of this building, it is unquestionably the keystone of the
square.";    <ORGANIZATION>Bamburg</ORGANIZATION> also says the judges and lawyers are adamant about
getting the building back because it's both grand and functional.;    The
original Renaissance Revival courthouse had two stories and a central dome,
but it was damaged in the <DATE>1906</DATE> earthquake, gutted by fire in <DATE>1931</DATE> and rebuilt
with a new third floor and no dome.;    "The building is in large measure from
<DATE>1931</DATE>," says <PERSON>Bamburg</PERSON>, "with a lot of division for small offices primarily on
the north and south sides. Beyond that are the courtrooms. The grand space of
the lobby retains what the general public would see as historic."; <ORGANIZATION>ST. CLAIRE
CLUB</ORGANIZATION>;    Organized in <DATE>1888</DATE> as an elite men's business and social club, the <ORGANIZATION>St.
Claire</ORGANIZATION> celebrated its centennial in <DATE>1988</DATE>. But it was a very quiet affair.;   
One of its early members was <PERSON>James Phelan</PERSON>, banker, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator and former <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> mayor. "<PERSON>Phelan</PERSON> spent his winters in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, came down here
summers and wanted to have a social club," says urban planner <PERSON>William
Zavlaris</PERSON>. "It's still by far the most private, exclusive men's club in the
area.";    The building, of Mission Revival styling with unusual ornamental
brick detailing, was designed and built in <DATE>1893</DATE> by <PERSON>A. Page Brown</PERSON>, a leading
<LOCATION>Northern California</LOCATION> architect -- which tells us something about the
significance of the building in its day. "None of the other private clubs had
architecture of that high quality," Zavlaris says.;    <PERSON>Jack Douglas</PERSON>, head of
<ORGANIZATION>San Jose State University</ORGANIZATION>'s Special Collections, says the club actually was
"the unofficial seat of power in the county.";    Inside, the dining room is
to the right of the central stairway and a large social hall is on the left.
The walls are adorned with <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> landscapes and the upstairs bar, lounge
and library have dark walnut paneling and overstuffed chairs. This is the
stodgy, private, rich man's club all of us non- members have seen again and
again in <LOCATION>New Yorker</LOCATION> cartoons.; THE SAN JOSE ATHLETIC CLUB;    This massive
three-story neo-classical structure, -- an example of <ORGANIZATION>Renaissance Revival</ORGANIZATION> with
Beaux Arts styling and Egyptian ornamentation, was built by the local <ORGANIZATION>Masonic
Order</ORGANIZATION> as its <ORGANIZATION>Scottish Rite Temple</ORGANIZATION> in 1924.;    Designed by <LOCATION>Bay Area</LOCATION> architect
<PERSON>Carl Werner</PERSON>, the building's portico features six Ionic columns, a grand
14-step entrance stairway and twin sphinxes projecting from the ground floor.
The auditorium features ornate wood beams and a marble floor.;    Now the home
of the <ORGANIZATION>Athletic Club</ORGANIZATION>, the building's facade has been restored and its
foundation structurally strengthened. "The <ORGANIZATION>Athletic Club</ORGANIZATION> saved the most
historic elements of the building -- the main entrance space and the
auditorium, which is now a restaurant by day and a ballroom at night," says
architect <PERSON>Jerome King</PERSON>. "It's the best place in town for a black tie.";    A
swimming pool has been added to the rear of the building, but it's
unobtrusive. "They just stuck it in there and it's ideal," says King.;    This
building and the county courthouse, which face one another across <LOCATION>St. James
Park</LOCATION>, are the two buildings of monumental scale on the square.; FIRST
UNITARIAN CHURCH;    This beautiful Romanesque Revival church was built by
local architect <PERSON>George Page</PERSON> to resemble a Unitarian church in <LOCATION>Transylvania</LOCATION>. He
broke ground in <DATE>September 1891</DATE>; the congregation is planning a yearlong
centennial bash beginning this fall.;    The odd design includes 70 Romanesque
arches, 48 stained glass windows, four domes and two towers that flank the
entrance. The sanctuary is something of a "church in the round" and the
acoustics created by its geodesic dome are so good that the San Jose Symphony
played here in its early days and the San <ORGANIZATION>Jose Chamber Music Society</ORGANIZATION> performs
here to sellout crowds.;    "The church was built by 100 people, the whole
size of the congregation then," says church historian <PERSON>Charlie Newman</PERSON>. "It has
dwindled down to as few as 40." The congregation has always been small but
influential. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>Don Edwards</PERSON>, <PERSON>D-San Jose</PERSON>, is a member and its early
members included <PERSON>A. T. Herrman</PERSON>, the civil engineer who built the road up <LOCATION>Mt.
Hamilton</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Dr. Benjamin Cory</PERSON>, <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s first physician, and <PERSON>J. E. Brown</PERSON>,
founder of the first free library.;    The Unitarians also have been on the
cutting edge of many social movements. The church was the site of <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION>'s
first soup kitchen and gay church. It offered draft counseling during the
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War, and in <DATE>1965</DATE> the church's Host Project brought 40 black teen-agers
from <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> for the summer.; THE FIRST CHURCH OF <LOCATION>CHRIST</LOCATION>,
SCIENTIST;    The last of the elegant structures to go up across from <LOCATION>St.
James Park</LOCATION> at the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, this Classical Revival church "should
be on the <ORGANIZATION>National Register of Historic Places</ORGANIZATION> by virtue of its architect
alone," according to <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Jerome King.</PERSON>;    <ORGANIZATION>Willis Polk</ORGANIZATION> came to
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> and quickly established himself as a leading
architect, egomaniac and Bohemian Club ne'er-do-well.;    In <DATE>1904</DATE>, he built
this church with a floor plan in the shape of a Greek cross. He said he was
inspired by the Ionian temple of <LOCATION>Ulysses</LOCATION>, but he made design changes similar
to those of the <DATE>16th century</DATE> Venetian designer <PERSON>Andrea Palladio.</PERSON>;    <LOCATION>Polk</LOCATION>, once
described by <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and Garden magazine as "the enfant terrible of western
architecture," led a return to period design that swept through <LOCATION>Northern
California</LOCATION>. He also was responsible for many Mission Revival mansions in the
valley.;    The building is a wood-framed structure, not stone -- typical of
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> construction, because wood was available and more resistant to
earthquake damage. A wooden structure also is more susceptible to
deterioration, but easily can be retrofitted and made safe.;    Four fluted
ionic columns dominate the facade. The interior is a simple, elegant, light
and airy space with the columns accentuating its height. Although the building
is not very large, Polk designed in a sense of grandeur. The church also has
been used as a midnight movie house, but has been empty and falling into
disrepair for years. It is currently owned by the <ORGANIZATION>St. Claire Corp.</ORGANIZATION>
partnership, which has been prevented from demolishing it by the building's
historic district designation.  </TEXT>

FT  13 JUN 94 / Architecture: Academe's Coventry climax - Colin Amery
praises the new work by Richard MacCormac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patronage is the key to good architecture. When a top British company has
the courage and skill to commission a leading architect to design one of its
major buildings the result can be inspiring, both for British business and
the architectural profession. The new residential training college for Cable
and Wireless at <ORGANIZATION>Coventry</ORGANIZATION> shines like a beacon of encouragement in a world
where good architecture is badly held back by both the recession and client
timidity.
Quite simply it is one of the best and most thoughtful new buildings to have
been built in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> for some time.
When it came to its search for an architect for a new college on a rural
site near <LOCATION>Coventry</LOCATION>, Cable and Wireless was wise enough to follow the route
of a private competition by interviewing a shortlist of potential
candidates.
The company's choice of <PERSON>Richard MacCormac</PERSON>'s firm of <ORGANIZATION>MacCormac</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Jamieson</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Prichard</PERSON> was made for two reasons. First, it appreciated the experience of
the firm in the building of academic and residential buildings. Second,
Cable and Wireless recognised the firm's distinction: <PERSON>Richard MacCormac</PERSON> had
made it to the top of the architectural tree as president of the <ORGANIZATION>RIBA</ORGANIZATION>.
Before choosing, the selectors took a tour of <ORGANIZATION>MacCormac</ORGANIZATION>'s existing
buildings, such as the waterside, residential <ORGANIZATION>Sainsbury</ORGANIZATION> Building at
<LOCATION>Worcester College</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION>, the New Court at <ORGANIZATION>Fitzwilliam College</ORGANIZATION> and the more
recent chapel at the same college in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>. These showed the clear
aesthetic and practical development of the practice over the last decade.
MacCormac's most recent building in <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> is the Garden Quadrangle for <ORGANIZATION>St.
John</ORGANIZATION>'s College; and his competition winning scheme for <ORGANIZATION>Balliol</ORGANIZATION> is awaited
with interest.
Cable and Wireless is relatively unusual for a British company (although one
that is global in its activities), in wanting to build a residential
training centre from scratch on a virgin site. Many British companies find
it almost irresistible to acquire a old country house, preferably in a
stately park.
The site outside <ORGANIZATION>Coventry</ORGANIZATION> is close to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Warwick</ORGANIZATION> and shortly
to be bordered by a new business park. It is perfectly placed and designed
with assurance and imagination. MacCormac has rare gifts. He is fascinating
to talk to and refreshingly flexible in his approach to architectural
debate. His quiet thoughtfulness shows at every point in the Cable and
<ORGANIZATION>Wireless College</ORGANIZATION>.
The company wanted somewhere that immediately gave a sense of a special
place of learning; a place where residential life is made dignified and
enjoyable by the surroundings. You sense its special qualities the moment
you arrive, driving past the water and scrunching on the gravel as you reach
the gently modulated steps beneath the wave-like curves of the roofs.
A parallel series of single-storey teaching studios stretch out on each side
of the main entrance. As you pass through you reach the central space of the
college - an oval court that is partly sheltered and partly open to the sky.
This is the heart of the college: in a traditional way the refectory,
library and common rooms gather here. The college garden separates you from
the residential buildings. At one end of the long garden court is the
leisure and fitness centre.
Water plays an important part in the overall layout - a long rill running
through the garden culminating in a waterfall beneath the leisure centre.
The firm of <PERSON>Colvin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moggridge</PERSON> were the landscape architects and they seem
to have understood the sense of almost oriental simplicity of the
architecture. The gardens, water, trees and varied surfaces underfoot all
unify the whole site and create a rare feeling of another world.
The atmosphere of calm is as much to do with the choice of materials as it
is with the sense of enclosure. The specially made green ceramic tiles on
the wave-like roofs have an extraordinary capacity to reflect the changing
light in the sky. The stone and concrete is everywhere finely finished; the
palette of colour inside and outside is natural and elegant.
There is no sense of pretension or contrivance about this building. It is a
place which is respected and liked by those who work there. Prof <PERSON>David
Ashton</PERSON>, the college's chief executive, explained how well the traditional
collegiate qualities of the design help to cement working relationships on
his courses on advanced communications technology.
The architect and the client had to marry the everyday world of human
relationships, laboratory and classroom teaching with a mass of high-tech
equipment and its necessary services. This is where the students learn. They
do so in a new building that, by its beauty and careful planning,
demonstrates that good architecture can inspire and humanise the most arcane
technology.

<HEAD>Architect Unveils Plans for New American Center</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT spelling of Pritzker, sted Pritzger.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> architect on <DATE>Friday</DATE> unveiled a scale
model of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>' new American Center, saying he hoped it would be
``a party in the park.''
   ``I wanted a building which would reflect the energy of the
American Center program,'' said <PERSON>Frank O. Gehry</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> ``It's joyous, and I wanted the building to have that
feeling.''
   Gehry, born in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, is one of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>'
most-admired architects, a recent winner of the prestigious
Pritzker Prize for architecture and almost always associated with
fish designs.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Center</ORGANIZATION> looks nothing like a fish. It is a strong
rectangular design with a pan coupe, or as <PERSON>Gehry</PERSON> put it, `` a box
with one side missing.''
   The design, imposed by the shape of the park, was a first for
<ORGANIZATION>Gehry</ORGANIZATION>. ``It was torture, and it took me three months to figure out
what to do with it,'' he said.
   Although building materials have not yet been chosen, <PERSON>Gehry</PERSON> said
he envisioned a pinkish-beige limestone for the facades. His dream,
he said, is to have sliding glass entrance doors that could be left
open during the <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   ``That will be my <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> contribution,'' he said. ``I'd like
people to be able to wander in from the park and peek around
without being intimidated.''
   The main entrance is topped by a ballet-skirt shape zinc roof
that fills the diagonal space between the other three sides of the
building, all of which are ringed with balconies.
   Groundbreaking for the <MONEY>$25 million</MONEY> center is expected to begin
in <DATE>June</DATE>, with completion scheduled for <DATE>June 1992</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>American Center</ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit educational and cultural
institution founded in <DATE>1931</DATE> to promote exchange between <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1987</DATE>, it sold its prestigious Left Bank quarters, which had
become too small to accommodate an ever-growing demand for its many
cultural offerings including language and civilization lessons,
dance, art, photography, computer and music workshops. The new
center will feature performing studios, a permanent art museum and
a 350-seat auditorium.
   The center will be built in <LOCATION>Bercy Park</LOCATION> in the southeastern
corner of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> that, until recently, was a desolate stretch of
train tracks and empty warehouses.
   The ultramodern, high-tech <ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> and the newly
inaugurated Opera-Bastille _ just minutes from the new <ORGANIZATION>American
Center</ORGANIZATION> and the new Bibliotheque de <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> across from it _ changed
all that.
   The new center is expected to handle 350,000 visitors yearly.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Let the stones speak for themselves - Colin Amery
considers Stonehenge and the winning design to house the tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY

<TEXT>
It was <PERSON>Inigo Jones</PERSON> who was asked by King James I of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> and VI of
<LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> to offer an account of the origins, meaning and purpose of
Stonehenge. His thoughts and researches were not published until <DATE>1655</DATE>, and
when they were they were curiously inaccurate and speculative. Jones thought
that the group of megalithic stones was a Roman temple in the Tuscan Order,
open to the heavens, and dedicated to <LOCATION>Coelus</LOCATION>, or Uranus, the oldest god in
the classical pantheon.
Like many architects <PERSON>Inigo Jones</PERSON> was not above re-interpreting history to
his own ends. He was at the time an enthusiast for the severity of the
Tuscan Order and the simplicity of Roman temple architecture. It suited him
to see the monument as a reinforcement of his own historical ideas.
Today we look at a monument like Stonehenge in a variety of different ways.
It is described as the most important pre-historic monument in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. It is
designated as a World Heritage Site by <ORGANIZATION>Unesco</ORGANIZATION>. It is still the site of some
strange solstice rites when white robed Druidic figures try to bring
together the forces of time and space to manufacture a creative coincidence
based on the certainties of geometry. It is a gathering place for Romanies
and travellers drawn there as if by a giant magnet. Above all we still look
upon Stonehenge as a place of mystery, a place that has a strange and
powerful hold upon the imagination.
In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> until <DATE>January 16</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Institute of British Architects</ORGANIZATION> (and
later in <LOCATION>Wiltshire</LOCATION>) is an exhibition of the ideas of six architects, called
Visions for Stonehenge. Galvanised by the energetic new chairman of <ORGANIZATION>English
Heritage</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr Jocelyn Stevens</PERSON>, 150 architects submitted proposals for new
facilities for visitors to the monument. The present arrangements for the
one million or more people who visit the site annually are grotesque and
inconvenient. The brief for the new proposals is for a centre one kilometre
to the north of the stones for visitors, where they will also park their
cars. From this distant site you will walk processionally to the stones,
which will be once again more isolated and united with the landscape by the
removal of much of the fencing and the A344 road, which at present passes
within feet of the sacred stones.
The winning architect from the six short listed is <PERSON>Edward Cullinan</PERSON> - who
also won the last <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> 'Architecture at Work Award.' The other
five were: <PERSON>Jeremy Dixon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edward Jones</PERSON>; Birds Portchmouth and <PERSON>Russum</PERSON>;
Future Systems; <PERSON>Colvin</PERSON> and Moggridge Landscape Architects; and <PERSON>Plincke
Leaman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Browning</PERSON>.
It was a difficult competition for an architect, because it really called
for invisibility for any new buildings and a lot of effort to be put into
the enhancement of the setting of the stones themselves - which are, as far
as we know, untouched by the hands of even the most ancient architects.
Circumspection and reticence are not always qualities associated with
architects, but <PERSON>Mr Cullinan</PERSON> has designed a simple scheme which consists of a
single storey visitors' centre with a grass roof which gives the appearance
of being underground. There is a potentially handsome circular viewing
terrace and a promenade along the roof top along which you can saunter and
contemplate the distant view of the standing stones.
The worrying thing about this new facility, which still has to go through
the planning hurdles and is unlikely to be opened until <DATE>1996</DATE>, at the
earliest, is that it is so enormous. Much of the space is taken up by
amorphous halls apparently designated for 'interpretation', exhibitions and
displays. There is a separate audio visual theatre to 'introduce' the
visitor to Stonehenge and a restaurant for the serving of Stonehenge snacks
and Druid dinners. There will be a shop selling souvenirs - candles in the
shape of Stonehenge, full length Druid outfits, horns and harps and plastic
mistletoe. There are also special rooms for the changing of nappies,
delivery bays for the unloading of <ORGANIZATION>Coca-Cola</ORGANIZATION> bottles and rooms for the large
numbers of staff to rest their limbs and smoke their cigarettes.
This Stonehenge experience will be surrounded by a 'landscaped' sea of
nearly 1000 cars and coaches. Visitors will have to walk on grass paths
(which will surely soon wear out) to the monument itself.
The architects who have entered this important national competition are not
to be blamed for the nature of the brief, which has been drawn up over eight
years by endless committees of bureaucrats and well intentioned do-gooders
of all kinds. But there is no doubt at all in my mind that the right thing
to do at Stonehenge is to move the offending roads, so that the stones are
more remote and mysterious, and then do everything possible to lessen public
interest in the site.
All the bogus 'interpretation' in the world is not going to add any
certainty to anyone's knowledge of Stonehenge. All the shopping and parking,
lavatories and nappy changing will do nothing to enhance the real nature of
this monument. A distant car park and a long walk is all that is needed. It
will save <ORGANIZATION>English Heritage</ORGANIZATION> from drumming up sponsorship and perhaps allow
the stones to speak for themselves.

<P>
Something was missing at this year's <ORGANIZATION>Orchids &amp; Onions</ORGANIZATION> program, the People's 
Choice awards of local design. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was people. Fewer than 800 seats in the 3,000-seat Civic Theatre were 
occupied last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, and the cavernous space seemed empty. In past 
years, 1,200 have attended. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was just the salty spray that the event, now 16 years old, has 
thrown off in past years. This year, that bite was watered down when the 
program's organizers prevented the jury from awarding a couple of well-deserved 
Onions. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of the refreshing directions the program might have taken if the 
lay public had been given a significant role, the process has remained too much 
under the thumb of the design and planning professionals who run it. 
</P>
<P>
Without the reek of the discarded Onions, jurors were left with several solid 
-- but fairly predictable -- winners. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Orchids were the <ORGANIZATION>Oceanside Civic Center</ORGANIZATION> (designed by architect 
<PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION>Urban Innovations Group</ORGANIZATION>), the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> 
(designed by architect <PERSON>Arthur Erickson</PERSON> with local help from Deems <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON>), 
<LOCATION>Uptown District</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Hillcrest</LOCATION> (designed by <ORGANIZATION>SGPA Architecture &amp; Planning</ORGANIZATION> with 
<PERSON>Lorimer</PERSON> Case Architects) and the 103-unit <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Place</ORGANIZATION> condominiums downtown 
(<ORGANIZATION>Lorimer Case</ORGANIZATION> again). 
</P>
<P>
Onions were given in two areas that had deserved them for years but never 
before received them. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Carmel Mountain Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, the 3,200-home master-planned community along Interstate 
15, with its "endless rows of ticky-tacky boxes" resting atop recklessly graded 
landforms, according to the jury, served as a scapegoat for many badly designed 
tracts throughout <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado was finally chastised for years of negligent planning that led to 
high-rises on the beach and the "scraping of charming, older homes to make way 
for oversize, under-designed shoeboxes." 
</P>
<P>
But the best of the best and the worst of the worst weren't very daring, and 
that's why the show was a bore. 
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Onions would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
One would have gone to an industrial glass box in <LOCATION>Carlsbad</LOCATION>, as a symbol of 
dozens of lousy glass boxes that litter the county; the other to a towering 
house in <LOCATION>Ocean Beach</LOCATION> that looks more like a commercial office building place in 
the midst of a residential neighborhood. When jurors drove by, a little girl 
was bouncing a ball off its looming back wall -- probably the only redeeming 
value of it. 
</P>
<P>
According to awards Chairman <PERSON>Larry Pappas</PERSON>, the glass box award was overruled by 
the program's 29-member organizing committee because it wanted the jury to 
focus on choosing individual winners from more than 300 nominations, instead of 
using one project as a symbol of a larger trend. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>O.B.</LOCATION> house represented a more serious derailing of the program's ambition 
to serve as a barometer of public taste. The house received 12 Onion 
nominations, making it one of the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
"When the program was established, certain by-laws were written that prevent us 
from going after one man's castle," said awards chairman <PERSON>Larry Pappas</PERSON>. "I can 
appreciate that, but . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Pappas</PERSON> said the board of directors of the local <ORGANIZATION>American Institute of 
Architects</ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the program, ultimately squelched the <ORGANIZATION>O.B. Onion</ORGANIZATION>, 
adhering to the established policy of not honoring individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the awards were interesting and well-deserved, if not controversial. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Oceanside Civic Center</ORGANIZATION> was praised for respecting nearby buildings 
designed by <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON>, for creating a source of civic pride and for 
"magnificent fountains (that) provide a refreshing retreat and also help remove 
hot air from <LOCATION>City Hall</LOCATION>." (The fountains serve as part of the projects' cooling 
system.) 
</P>
<P>
Since opening last year, the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Convention Center</ORGANIZATION> has sparked polar 
remarks. Many people love the building itself, but hate the way the massive 
structure blocks the waterfront from public views and access. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>O &amp; O</ORGANIZATION> jury recognized this by giving the project both an Orchid and an 
Onion, honoring its bold architecture and recognizing the unfortunate siting. 
</P>
<P>
Uptown District, the mixed-use project along <ORGANIZATION>University Avenue</ORGANIZATION>, deserved its 
Orchid for respecting the scale and character of the surrounding neighborhood, 
but it lacks public art and high-quality storefront designs. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Columbia Place</ORGANIZATION>, like other <PERSON>Lorimer</PERSON> Case projects, is a competent but bland 
piece of architecture. Its Orchid was given for the way the architects 
accommodated the older buildings on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Postmodern architect <PERSON>Michael Graves</PERSON>' only <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> design -- the Aventine 
hotel/office complex in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION> -- had jurors at each other's throats. It 
received more nominations for Orchids -- and for Onions -- than any other 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Although not spelled out during the awards ceremony, jurors meant for the award 
to go only to the Hyatt Hotel portion of the project; they considered the 
nearby office complex an awkward juxtaposition of forms. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors lobbied against the Orchid because they didn't approve of such a 
large, loud project in a sensitive location, but the <ORGANIZATION>Aventine</ORGANIZATION>'s excellent 
detailing and originality carried a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller projects had their place too. Orchids went to the year-old Church of 
the Nativity in <ORGANIZATION>Fairbanks Ranch</ORGANIZATION>, designed by architect <PERSON>Charles Moore</PERSON> with the 
firm of <ORGANIZATION>Moore Ruble Yudell</ORGANIZATION>, to a gem of an underground parking garage at 
<ORGANIZATION>Scripps Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION>, and to the Bookstar bookstore in <LOCATION>Point 
Loma</LOCATION>, a renovation of the art deco <ORGANIZATION>Loma Theatre</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orchids went to murals in <LOCATION>Chicano Park</LOCATION> south of downtown, and the mural 
by artist <PERSON>James Jackson</PERSON> in the lobby of the <ORGANIZATION>Symphony Towers</ORGANIZATION> high-rise on B 
Street downtown; a park-like desiltation pond in <LOCATION>Carlsbad</LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION>Anza Borrego 
Visitors Center</ORGANIZATION>, designed by <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architect <PERSON>Robert Ferris</PERSON> and completed in 
<DATE>1978</DATE>, which blends smoothy with surrounding desert landforms; architect 
<PERSON>Jonathan Segal</PERSON>'s tiny 7 on <PERSON>Kettner</PERSON> condominium project, a well-designed in-fill 
project downtown, and the <ORGANIZATION>County Administration Center</ORGANIZATION>'s dramatic new lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Additional Onions went to a gaudy plastic surgeon's office, the U-Store storage 
complex next to Interstate 8 in <LOCATION>Alpine</LOCATION>, and an awful adobe-electronic community 
monument in <LOCATION>San Marcos</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to do something different with the program," confessed one juror 
after all was said and done. (The jury included six design and planning 
professionals and three members from other professions.) "Based on the turnout, 
I'd say people are burned out. They should let the jury do more creative kinds 
of awarding, and find a way to get the public more involved in the jurying 
process."

<TEXT>
The college of the <ORGANIZATION>Blessed Virgin Mary</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>St. John</LOCATION> the Evangelist and the
<ORGANIZATION>Glorious Virgin St. Radegund</ORGANIZATION> is better known as <ORGANIZATION>Jesus College</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>.
When the college was founded in <DATE>1496</DATE> by <PERSON>John Alcock</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Bishop of Ely</ORGANIZATION>, he took
over the convent buildings, including the priory church which was begun in
<DATE>1150</DATE>. <ORGANIZATION>Jesus College</ORGANIZATION> is fortunate in having a site that is extremely spacious
 -the five courts are surrounded by generous gardens and playing fields.
Large trees add to the park-like atmosphere and there is a homogeneity about
the mainly brick buildings, although the college's architectural history is
long and complex.
The first glimpse of the college from <PERSON>Jesus Lane</PERSON> is an intriguing one -
trees seen over old brick walls, the square tower of the chapel looking
almost like a parish church, and then the slender opening that leads to the
narrow entrance path, known as 'the chimney'. This is the main pedestrian
approach, usually lined with abandoned bicycles, ending at the Tudor
gatehouse.
It is one of the simplest and best gatehouses in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, dating from
around <DATE>1500</DATE> and looking at its most romantic when the college flag is flying
from the battlemented top.
Once a visitor has passed through the gatehouse into first court, one of the
architectural conventions of the college is immediately apparent  - the
three-sided court: first court, second court, chapel court, and north court
are all open on one side. This makes the college seem fluidly connected to
its parkland and gardens and adds an intensity to the experience of the
fully enclosed, four-sided cloister court. The north side of the original
cloister was the refectory of the convent and is now the college hall. There
are some fine Early English gothic arches that remain in the cloister from
the original <ORGANIZATION>Chapter House</ORGANIZATION>.
The simple brick three-storey ranges typify the Jesus style and different
architects at different periods have added buildings in a careful and
coherent way. Alfred Waterhouse (of <ORGANIZATION>Manchester Town Hall</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Natural
History Museum</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Prudential</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s Holborn) added the north range
of the second court in <DATE>1870</DATE> and managed to be disciplined by the convention
of low-key brick walls, adding only a slight touch of flamboyance with an
asymmetrical tower and spire. In the <DATE>1920</DATE>'s and <DATE>1930s</DATE> the architect <PERSON>Morley
Horder</PERSON> added connected ranges around the southern end of the chapel court.
Horder (1870-1944) is an almost forgotten contemporary of Sir <PERSON>Edwin Lutyens</PERSON>,
who is best known for his traditional country houses, particularly in the
<LOCATION>Cotswolds</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Dorset</LOCATION>. He was renowned for his Bohemian appearance and for
designing a modest house for <PERSON>Lloyd George</PERSON>, but he should be re-examined as
he was a master of materials and built, like <PERSON>Lutyens</PERSON>, at a time when English
craftsmanship was still practised and taught. He also built <ORGANIZATION>Westcott House</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Agricultural Botany</ORGANIZATION> - an exercise
in the <PERSON>Wren</PERSON> manner. His substantial group of stone Italian Renaissance
buildings for the <ORGANIZATION>University of Nottingham</ORGANIZATION> are his best known works.
In the <DATE>1960s</DATE> the college added a large new court by the <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> architect
<PERSON>David Roberts</PERSON>, with student rooms arranged on an echeleon plan to maximise
sunlight. It is in a different tradition from the rest of the college and
only its distance from the older buildings renders it acceptable.
Recently the college announced that it planned to build a new court to
commemorate the quincentenary in <DATE>1996</DATE> of its foundation. The site was
selected to the south of the <PERSON>Morley Horder</PERSON> neo-Tudor buildings on what is
now a car park and part of the <ORGANIZATION>Master</ORGANIZATION>'s garden.
The college, advised by the architect Fellow, <PERSON>Nicholas Ray</PERSON>, prepared a
master plan and embarked on the delicate procedure of choosing an architect.
A committee of twelve, chaired by the Master, <PERSON>Lord Renfrew</PERSON>, considered 30 or
so firms and reached a shortlist of eight. Great care was taken, and the
eight firms were interviewed in their offices. Then selected buildings by
four of the original eight firms were visited and finally two were chosen to
prepare sketch proposals for the development.
Selecting an architect is a difficult business and the college procedure
seems to have been exemplary. The two firms finally chosen to compete were
<PERSON>Edward Cullinan</PERSON> and Partners and <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shalev</PERSON>. Interestingly, the two
were briefed together and then paid a reasonable sum to prepare schemes that
had to be presented to the college and the whole fellowship. There was a
clear majority of Fellows in favour of the <PERSON>Evans</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shalev</PERSON> scheme.
Evans and <PERSON>Shalev</PERSON> are now best known for their law courts at <LOCATION>Truro</LOCATION> (winner of
the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times Architecture Award</ORGANIZATION>) - a fine contemporary building that
is very sensitive to the townscape and context of <LOCATION>Truro</LOCATION>. They also won the
competition to design the <ORGANIZATION>Tate Gallery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cornwall</LOCATION> that is under
construction on a sensitive and important site in <LOCATION>St. Ives</LOCATION>. Their scheme for
<ORGANIZATION>Jesus College</ORGANIZATION> is first class and promises to add a very distinguished new
court to the college.
It deals with the difficulties of the historic context in a sensitive way.
The designers have sensed the architectural atmosphere of the college and
followed the language of well-proportioned windows in substantial brick
walls which are trimmed in real stone. There are pitched roofs behind
parapets that align in height with the rest of the college. These architects
understand appropriateness - designing what is fitting for the context but
with a strong character of its own.
There are three phases of the proposed development: firstly a new college
library and computing centre, secondly some 60 residential rooms, and
thirdly an auditorium to seat 200 with associated music teaching rooms.
Limited funds at present have meant that the architects have had to produce
designs that allow for a phased development and also for the unlikely
possibility that some phases may never be built.
The library will be built first. It has a formality and dignity that suits
its purpose as well as subtle and potentially beautiful lighting effects
from the unusual windows and vaulted ceiling. The circular top-lit stair is
reminiscent of the similar space at <LOCATION>Truro</LOCATION>, where it is a great success.
As the college has gone to such trouble to find good architects who have
prepared a sensitive and effective design for a difficult site, it is much
to be hoped that benefactions will soon be found to build the entire new
court to as high a standard as possible. What better way of marking five
hundred years of careful college growth on this beautiful <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> site?

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Architecture: Bringing the Stroller Set to Battery Park City </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Battery Park <LOCATION>City</LOCATION>'s abnormally attractive mix of apartment buildings and office towers is about the closest this grungy, overbuilt city has come to an urban miracle. 
Just south of the <ORGANIZATION>World Trade Center</ORGANIZATION>'s sleekly creepy twin towers, the complex rises on 92 acres of landfill, a breezy multibillion-dollar oasis ornamented with fruit trees and park benches on a riverside esplanade. 

   What's wrong with this pretty picture? 
What has <ORGANIZATION>New York State</ORGANIZATION>'s Battery Park <ORGANIZATION>City Authority</ORGANIZATION> not managed to attract to its tree-lined terraces with harbor views of Miss Liberty, not to mention ambitiously supervised architecture and deep-dish tax abatements? 
Little people in diapers and strollers. 
That's what. 

   And, more's the pity, all the amenities are in place for the missing nippers: a cookie store, a clean, well-lit school, a supermarket, sandboxes. 
But families are few and toddlers under 12 are only <PERCENT>5%</PERCENT> of Battery Park City's total population. 
The main reasons are cost and apartment size. 
The <ORGANIZATION>Battery Park Housing Authority</ORGANIZATION> left these two crucial matters to the discretion of individual developers, after setting a minimum of 400 square feet for the smallest residential units. 

   Behind the attractive facades, all sported up with ornamental grills, cornices and subtle brickwork, are mostly studios and small one-bedroom apartments designed for the model tenant all builders seem to have in mind these days: sterile investment bankers under 5-foot-2. 
Who else can fit comfortably into a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> condo and not mind the price? 
Rentals are few, and only 61 of 2,207 new apartments are subsidized. (There also are some cheaper, very ugly flats designed during Battery Park's quixotic, financially blighted infancy, before the state took it over from <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.) 

   Eventually, even the yuppies move out to breed in the 'burbs. 
And <ORGANIZATION>BPCA</ORGANIZATION> is worried this pattern of transiency will hurt its ambitions to foster a real community. 
So BPCA is studying design options for future family housing scheduled on three empty lots north of the new <LOCATION>North Cove</LOCATION> marina. 
Four firms of architects, chosen from 100, are working up new concepts in affordable family housing. 

   Each firm was awarded <MONEY>$50,000</MONEY> to explore what could be done about increasing space without increasing and preferably reducing hard costs: about <MONEY>$100</MONEY> per square foot. (That's any apartment in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>. 
Cost difference between a luxury and budget apartment is suprisingly small, and comes from such cosmetic flourishes as marble bathrooms and parquet floors.) 

   Suppose you offer tenants the flexibility normally extended to offices? 
Max Bond of Bond Ryder James Architects argues architects should, because who are they to know just exactly who is moving in and what their needs might be? 
He thinks changing the design process might favorably change the economics. 

   In <PERSON>Mr. Bond</PERSON>'s ideal housing, the architect leaves everything beyond permanent fixtures such as bathrooms to tenants, who design their interiors on a computer screen. 
Numbers are crunched out simultaneously, telling you, say, that the neat entertainment niche in malachite you have just doodled up is costing out at <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY>. 
You may wish to wait a bit. 

   That's the appeal of the scheme: Not only do apartment prices run about <PERCENT>20%</PERCENT> lower, but young couples could space out improvements as their financial situation blossoms. 
In <LOCATION>Holland</LOCATION> this combination of computer aids and loft-type spaces has proven very popular, though you do wonder whether this constant remodeling may be less manageable in a 12-story building in <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION> than in a two-story Dutch apartment house with fewer people hammering into the night or hogging the elevator with stacks of two-by-fours. 

   Rather than wait for future tenants to express themselves at a computer terminal, <PERSON>Joan Goody</PERSON> came down to <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION> from the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION>Goody, Clancy &amp; Associates Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to interview a few families already ensconced. 
What do you want? 
No dogs in the sandbox was followed by a longish wish list. 

   In response, the <ORGANIZATION>Goody Clancy</ORGANIZATION> proposal provides <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> more storage space and sunny eat-in kitchens big enough for highchair diners to practice throwing carrot goo a decent distance. 
<PERSON>Ms. Goody</PERSON> positioned many of the larger units around an interior courtyard so parents could keep an eye on little <PERSON>Manny</PERSON>. 
And tenants could carve out a small kid's room by subdividing the master bedroom and still have two windowed rooms that would meet building codes. 

   <PERSON>Ms. Goody</PERSON> also met the challenge of where to put a working mom's au pair. 
Getting babysitters is a problem, families told her. 
<PERSON>Ms. Goody</PERSON> conceived of "swing" rooms on every floor, inserted between two units. 
Either apartment has the option of connecting to this little studio and the Danish pastry within. 

   Other nice surprises lurk in the layouts proposed by <ORGANIZATION>The Ehrenkrantz Group &amp; Eckstut</ORGANIZATION>. 
<PERSON>Ezra Ehrenkrantz</PERSON>, the principal partner, points to a model showing a splitlevel, skip-stop building whose charm is such you wonder why the type isn't seen more often. 
With elevators stopping on every other floor, there's a <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> gain in livable space and layouts are enormously varied, ranging from studios to a variety of duplexes that can be subdivided and rented out. 

   Still, hard questions obtrude on these <PERSON>Edens</PERSON>. 
Will the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> construction trade embrace the <PERSON>Ehrenkrantz</PERSON> proposal's newfangled insulating and load-bearing Canadian Polysteel? 
High construction costs probably also will put the kibosh on the precast concrete giant neo-classical ornaments the Spanish-born architect, <PERSON>Ricardo Bofill</PERSON>, has used so awesomely in his new <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> apartment complex and wants to try here too. 

   To make any of this feasible for middle-income families earning <MONEY>$45,000</MONEY> or less, mere ingenuity on the architects' part does not seem to have been enough to bring down the cost per apartment. 
So BPCA is exploring various types of subsidies to get the desirable social mix that used to happen naturally in this city before rent controls distorted the housing market. 
Very likely <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> of the apartments will be reserved for the moderate incomes, with wealthier tenants forking up market prices. 

   Does it make sense to build subsidized housing on land almost as expensive as the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> Ginza? 
Logic would suggest otherwise, and <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> is doing what it can to make sure it doesn't happen. 
Right now, the city uses profits from <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION> to rehab rubbled sections of the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>. 
It would like to keep the faucet flowing full strength. 
So the city is opposing a bill introduced into the state legislature by the BPCA that would make cheap financing available to developers for the duration of construction. 

   So the outlook for babies without silver spoons in their mouths on the <LOCATION>Battery Park City</LOCATION> esplanade is not brilliant. 
Their best friend, BPCA <PERSON>Uhairman Meyer</PERSON> (<PERSON>Sandy</PERSON>) <PERSON>Frucher</PERSON> is resigning, seeking bigger bucks in the private sector to pay for the education of his own children. 
Maybe what we need is a children's crusade, hundreds of toddlers forming INPAC, Infant's <ORGANIZATION>Political Action Committee</ORGANIZATION>, with yowling phone squads that won't hang up until state reps agree to vote them a little pork and a chance to live within stroller range of Wall Street.

<TEXT>
In <DATE>1950</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Ordnance Survey</ORGANIZATION> published a map of monastic <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> which gave
the names and locations of the 900 monasteries and nunneries of the
pre-Reformation country. It is hard for us to imagine the holocaust of
destruction that followed <PERSON>King Henry VIII</PERSON>'s suppression of the monasteries
and today it is difficult to conceive of a <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> that in some ways must
have been like <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> - a land full of monks and nuns, even in its remotest
corners.
It was, I think, <PERSON>Sacheverell Sitwell</PERSON> who said that the great monastic ruins
of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> were the equivalent of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>'s Angkor Wat or <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Abu
Simbel</PERSON>. They seem as dead and defunct as those places because the ruins are
not even corpses but skeletons, with no traces left of the souls and minds
that once inhabited them. Even the most remarkable of all the monastic
remains in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fountains Abbey</LOCATION>, demands a feat of imagination to evoke
the nature of the monastic lives that were followed there.
The problem, even in as remote and beautiful a place as <ORGANIZATION>Fountains Abbey</ORGANIZATION> by
the <LOCATION>River Skell</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION>, is that the remains of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>'s abbeys have
been secularised at least once in their long lives. Fountains' first
secularisation came at the dissolution; its second in the <DATE>18th century</DATE> when
<PERSON>John Aislabie</PERSON> and his son laid turf in the fields around the abbey and
incorporated the ruin as a picturesque fragment in their new landscape
gardens. In this century, the remote and silent abbey ruins and the adjacent
landscape park of <ORGANIZATION>Studley Royal</ORGANIZATION> have been drawn closer still to the secular
world by waves of visitors and their cars.
In <DATE>1983</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>National Trust</ORGANIZATION> bought the <ORGANIZATION>Fountains Abbey</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Studley Royal</ORGANIZATION>
estate, acquiring not just the 18th-century landscaped water gardens, but
also the most complete Cistercian abbey in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. The Trust also acquired a
problem of the most sensitive kind. It was not just a matter of how to
restore and care for the estate, it was also a matter of preserving the
extraordinary atmosphere while coping with more than 300,000 annual
visitors.
It is the combination of landscape and architecture that makes Fountains
Abbey special. There are two aspects to this. When the monks of <ORGANIZATION>St Mary's
Abbey</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> begged their superiors to remove them from the laxity of town
life in <DATE>1132</DATE>, their archbishop selected Skelldale because it was 'a place
remote from all the world, uninhabited, set with thorns . . . fit more for
the dens of wild beasts than the uses of mankind'. To this aspect of
remoteness must be added the approach of the 18th-century landscapists, who
reduced the abbey ruins to picturesque features while elevating the entire
estate into a vision of the sublime imagination.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Trust</ORGANIZATION> has continued the development of the estate by planning
for the reception of visitors in ways that remove the worst aspects of the
visibility of car parking and allow more rewarding circular walking routes.
But the most important element is the new visitors' centre that has now been
opened after years of delicate treading of the planning tightrope. The saga
is in many ways a story of our times. The amount of local, regional and
national negotiation needed to build a centre that is, itself, dedicated to
the enhancement of the whole estate in retrospect seems almost unbelievable.
But the concerns were the correct ones; many people felt that the greatest
Cistercian abbey in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, in its wild valley, should be sacrosanct.
The selection of the architect was a vital part of the process and the
<ORGANIZATION>Trust</ORGANIZATION>'s choice of <PERSON>Edward Cullinan</PERSON> and Partners was brave and inspired. The
choice of site to allow the invisibility of the centre from the abbey was
also important, but this did not mean that the centre should be designed as
a shy and retiring creature lurking secretly in a remote meadow. The
<ORGANIZATION>National Trust</ORGANIZATION> has taken the appointment of architects very seriously and at
<ORGANIZATION>Fountains Abbey</ORGANIZATION> the opportunity to add something of quality from the <DATE>late
20th century</DATE> was rightly considered to be important.
The result of this act of patronage is a remarkable new building located as
an incident in the entire landscape plan of the estate. The visitor
approaching from the new road now sees new axial views of the pinnacled
spire of <PERSON>William Burgess</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>High Victorian St. Mary's Church</ORGANIZATION> (built by the
pious Marchioness of <LOCATION>Ripon</LOCATION> in the 1870s). Aislabie's grand avenue, focused
on the distant view of <LOCATION>Ripon</LOCATION> cathedral, is another new, fine view. After a
sharp turn away from the obelisk of <DATE>1815</DATE> the road brings the visitor to the
new centre.
The initial view of the centre, which will be very different when the new
trees have grown, is something of a surprise. Cullinan's design is both
vernacular and flamboyant. Dry stone walls root the building to its site,
steeply pitched sandstone roofs and dramatically curved flying, lead roofs
seem to want to carry it to heaven. The architectural language is original,
owing more perhaps to <ORGANIZATION>Tolkien</ORGANIZATION> than to ecclesiastical towers. As the centre
is built around a courtyard, which opens at an angle on to a dramatically
foreshortened view of the top of the great abbey tower, the echoes of the
cloister are present without being over emphasised.
Inside the centre <PERSON>Cullinan</PERSON> displays his conviction that structure and the
construction process should be expressed. The steel frame can be seen
beneath the timber roofing joists, bolts and dowels are also visible
throughout. The sense of an architect playing with a parts kit is emphasised
by the architect's decision to utilise a colourful, even childlike palette
on elements of the timber ceiling (in the restaurant, the sensation of being
in the hall of a rather progressive new primary school is only just
avoided). But the architectural jollity is refreshing and the centre should
indeed have a sense of both pleasure and education.
I enjoyed the frisson of an architectural experiment, admired the marriage
of materials, and appreciated the air of anticipation provided by the siting
and landscaping of the centre. I know from the time I have spent on the
<ORGANIZATION>National Trust</ORGANIZATION>'s architectural panel how hard it is to achieve the balance
between the undisturbed silence of historic places and the need to provide
for large numbers of visitors. Honeypots mean bees. At <ORGANIZATION>Fountains Abbey</ORGANIZATION> the
new hive is a highly skilled creation.

<DESCRIPT>  CITY; DEVELOPMENT; ...; BUILDING; DESIGN; PLANNING; PUBLIC; MEETING; SUNNYVALE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Sunnyvale residents will get a chance to help plan their new downtown at two
community forums, and a 15-member Downtown Task Force will work closely with
the city to prepare a specific plan for revitalization of the central business
district.;    The city council created the committee last week and set up a
series of community meetings and public hearings. Adoption of the specific
plan, which translates decisions already made about the direction of downtown
development into design guidelines and other details, is expected in the fall.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The council last <DATE>December</DATE> approved new zoning to encourage construction of
apartments, offices, hotels, restaurants and entertainment facilities in the
city's historic center, culminating a four-year effort.;    Belated input;   
During the process the city was criticized for bringing the public into the
planning belatedly.;    Though no specific dates for forums and hearings have
been set, an initial community meeting early this month will define the scope
of the process for developing a specific plan that addresses design,
development standards, downtown identity and design treatment of public spaces
and open spaces.;    <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Pat Castillo</PERSON> last week took the lead with
the task force, increasing the number of citizen representatives from five to
eight and eliminating representatives of three city commissions on grounds
that they'll get sufficient chance to review the plan before adoption.;    The
council accepted her suggestion that two residents be chosen from the northern
part of the city, three from the central section and two from the south. The
other citizen representative must be a Realtor or finance professional, the
council said.;    Representatives;    Other members will represent Town and
Country Village shopping center; the <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Hahn Corporation</PERSON>,
owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Town Center Mall</ORGANIZATION>; a small-business person; someone involved in
community theater; an architect or landscape architect, and a member of the
city <ORGANIZATION>Parking District Advisory Board.</ORGANIZATION>;    <PERSON>Castillo</PERSON>'s revisions eliminated
representatives from the planning commission, heritage preservation commission
and arts commission.;    <PERSON>Chuck Wallin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gary Lee</PERSON>, leaders of a group which
fought a successful battle last year to scale down the level of proposed
office and apartment development, urged a heavier representation from downtown
residents. <PERSON>Wallin</PERSON> said, "The staff's suggested makeup is obviously weighted
against the downtown residents who are directly affected by what's going on.";
   He said some representatives of business should be eliminated and one or
two downtown residents placed on the committee.;    Although <PERSON>Castillo</PERSON> proposed
her revisions after the two spoke, she said she already had worked them out
before she came to the meeting.;    "I felt it was important that they (task
force members) represent all the people, not just north, south, business or
whatever," she said.;    She said she left the parking board member on the
panel while removing the other city commissioners because "I felt parking is a
very crucial part of the site specific plan" and constant contact with the
task force needed to be maintained.;    The task force will be an advisory
group which will work with consultant <PERSON>David Miller</PERSON>, the city staff, the
planning commission and the council. It will be a source of ideas and a
sounding board against which the various aspects of the plan will be tested.; 
  The staff proposed that the task force meet four to six times during the
planning process.;    The specific plan activities will revolve partly around
a "village" concept for the downtown, with small scale development accessible
not only to motorists, but to pedestrians. Some elements of the plan could
include are architectural standards, lighting fixtures and street furniture, a
phasing schedule for public improvements, a circulation and parking plan and
concepts for economic development incentives.;    Both the Town and <ORGANIZATION>Country
Village Shopping Center</ORGANIZATION>, which the owners would like to tear down, and <ORGANIZATION>Town
Center Mall</ORGANIZATION> are in the area. Many view the mall as needing work to bring it
out from behind its parking garage and integrate it with the rest of the
area.;    The city also proposes to build a large performing arts center on a
parking lot near the Town and Country Village.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For

<P>
When architects try to justify poor designs by pointing to low budgets, they 
should be exiled for a night to either of two single-room occupancy hotels 
(SROs) designed by architect <PERSON>Rob Quigley</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
These downtown buildings, the just-opened J Street Inn and the 4-year-old 
Baltic Inn, were done on a shoestring budget, <MONEY>$6.8 million</MONEY>, and provide 
sub-apartment-size rooms to low- and moderate-income folks, most of whom live 
and work downtown. And the projects succeed with a special flair usually 
reserved for pricier projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION>, which opened in <DATE>1986</DATE>, <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> used standard low-budget 
construction methods to shape a building to manipulate light and space in 
interesting ways. 
</P>
<P>
Two light wells cut through the 209-unit structure, giving interior rooms 
plenty of natural light. Extra money and design time were dedicated to the 
entry, with its tall arch, neon lettering and colorful tile patterns. Only two 
front units have small balconies, but these add scale and texture to what 
otherwise would have been a flat stucco facade. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the Baltic is best known for its attractive, bargain-basement 
graphic: a large wedge of natural-color stucco that points to the entry. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms at the Baltic -- which was the first SRO to be built in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> 
in 50 years and the first in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> since <DATE>1914</DATE> -- are 10 by 12 feet, and 
include basic kitchens with small refrigerators and microwaves, and bathrooms 
with toilets only. Showers are down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The J Street Inn is <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON>'s second downtown SRO for a partnership including 
developers <PERSON>Chris Mortenson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bud Fischer</PERSON>. The 221-room building, which took 
in its first tenants last week, is a step up from the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION>, with larger (230 
to 308 square feet), better-equipped rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "living units," the rooms are "somewhere between an SRO and a small 
studio apartment," <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> said. They include full bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Rents at the Baltic start at <MONEY>$275</MONEY> a month, while at the J Street Inn, the least 
expensive rooms are the 22 at <MONEY>$340</MONEY> a month set aside for people earning less 
than <MONEY>$15,918</MONEY> a year. Twenty-two additional rooms at <MONEY>$397</MONEY> a month are reserved 
for those making less than <MONEY>$18,571</MONEY>, 88 for those making less than <MONEY>$26,500</MONEY> and 
the rest for those making less than <MONEY>$31,836</MONEY>. Room rents are determined by 
income levels. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a <MONEY>$900,000</MONEY> loan at 1 point over prime from the city's 
<ORGANIZATION>Redevelopment Agency</ORGANIZATION>, the developers agreed to rent to these low- and 
moderate-income groups for the 30-year life of the loan. If they comply, the 
loan and interest will be forgiven at the end of the term. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also asked for on-site parking. The J Street Inn has 92 underground 
spaces, which added nearly <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> to the project's cost. Mortenson figures 
the new SRO's tenants are more likely to own cars than those at the lower-rent 
Baltic, which has 30 spaces on a nearby lot, but none on site. 
</P>
<P>
New SROs seem to have a strong market. So far, 88 of the J Street Inn's rooms 
have been rented. At the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION>, occupancy averages about <PERCENT>85%</PERCENT>, according to <PERSON>Joe 
Miller</PERSON>, a manager there. 
</P>
<P>
Where <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> had little more than wood and stucco to work with at the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION>, 
the J Street Inn's budget afforded more perks. Landscape architects <PERSON>Martin 
Poirier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Laura Burnett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andy Spurlock</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>The Spurlock Office</ORGANIZATION> made the 
interior light wells into art events. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic's light wells double as leisure space for the tenants, but, as it 
turns out, socializing tenants create a din that bothers other tenants who want 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Mortenson</PERSON> told his designers that the interior light well at the J Street Inn 
shouldn't be usable or conventionally landscaped -- water causes problems when 
it seeps through to underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
To add a calming effect while giving tenants something to look at, <ORGANIZATION>The Spurlock 
Office</ORGANIZATION> designed two large but inexpensive art pieces for the light well. 
</P>
<P>
One is a fountain consisting of water coursing down a 50-foot length of 
galvanized storm drain pipe. The other is a diagonal concrete beam that 
disappears into the ground, tethered by stainless steel cables. 
</P>
<P>
Interior landscaping consists of crushed granite and seven stands of bamboo. 
Overall, the effect is of a low-budget Japanese Zen garden, and the attempt at 
serenity succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Baltic's, much of the J Street Inn's budget went toward the entry, 
with a tower extending on a diagonal to beckon you in from the corner of 2nd 
Avenue and J Street. The lobby is much larger than the <ORGANIZATION>Baltic's</ORGANIZATION>. First-floor 
ceilings are extra high, adding a sense of richness considering the budget. 
Colorful tiles help liven things up near the entry. 
</P>
<P>
Also like the Baltic, the J Street project uses a limited number of balconies 
to break up the building's exterior walls. Window awnings help, too. 
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the J Street Inn in the heart of the city's 
redevelopment area -- next to luxury housing such as One Harbor Drive, an 
expensive condominium project about to break ground across the street -- the 
city's redevelopment program shows encouraging signs of meeting diverse housing 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The new Convention Center and several new downtown hotels require scores of 
blue-collar workers. The Quigley-designed SROs and several others recently 
completed or nearing completion offer clean, affordable living. 
</P>
<P>
But even with abundant new housing ranging from <ORGANIZATION>SRO</ORGANIZATION> rooms to luxury condos, 
downtown redevelopment isn't covering all the bases. 
</P>
<P>
As a variety of new redevelopment projects, including housing, have spread 
through the <ORGANIZATION>Marina Redevelopment Area</ORGANIZATION> south of Broadway and west of the <ORGANIZATION>Gaslamp 
Quarter</ORGANIZATION>, several older, very inexpensive SROs have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
This could well be the reason for the escalating presence of the homeless 
downtown, especially in <LOCATION>Centre City East</LOCATION>, a few blocks from the core of the 
<LOCATION>Marina</LOCATION> area. 
</P>
<P>
Two new SROs scheduled to open on 13th Street in <DATE>August</DATE> with monthly rents in 
the low <MONEY>$200s</MONEY> could help the situation. 
</P>
<P>
While SROs seem to be the predominant new building type in <LOCATION>Centre City East</LOCATION> at 
the moment, <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> Architect <PERSON>Mike Stepner</PERSON> doesn't feel they are being overdone. 
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, they are an improvement over vacant lots and abandoned buildings. 
I feel strongly that they can coexist with other forms of development. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of problem areas, but we're getting new development beyond SROs 
in <LOCATION>Centre City East</LOCATION> -- apartments, new commercial, the new Fine Art Store. 
Little things are happening that are slowly changing the area." 
</P>
<P>
Some people wonder whether more SROs should have parking, but <PERSON>Stepner</PERSON> doesn't 
believe the lowest-cost ones need it. Most of their tenants don't own cars. 
Only three of the 30 spaces in the <LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION>'s lot are rented by tenants, 
<PERSON>Mortenson</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a need for parking downtown in the future, it will be met by 
private-sector providers," <PERSON>Stepner</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the new SROs, including the Baltic and the J Street Inn, are 
large, they have only one entrance and offer no uses other than residential. So 
they contribute only marginally to the kinds of street activity that can 
revitalize neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
New SROs designed by <PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> for sites on <LOCATION>Island Avenue</LOCATION> and on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> Street 
will break that trend with ground-floor retail and restaurant uses. 
</P>
<P>
Such mixed-use SROs would generate pedestrian traffic, which would help 
naturally buffer the impact of street people in places such as <LOCATION>Centre City 
East</LOCATION>. Veteran planners know that an intelligent blend of well-designed projects 
does a lot more than a beefed-up police force to make an urban core secure.

<LEADPARA>  THE WORST place to design a livable city is in a city council or planning
commission meeting. Fighting developers over the number of parking slots
doesn't leave time to contemplate the big question: What makes a city
livable?;    But Silicon Valley cities need that far-ranging inquiry to

<HEADLINE>  WHAT SOUTH BAY CITIES CAN LEARN FROM NEW
CAMPUS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Architecture
Alan Hess is a Bay Area architect whose column appears every other week in
Perspective.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Fortunately, other institutions permit the experimentation that produces
fresh city shapes. The latest example is the newly completed <ORGANIZATION>College Eight</ORGANIZATION> at
the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Santa Cruz.</LOCATION>;    It wasn't meant as a lesson in
town planning, but the college, by <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> architects <PERSON>Simon Martin-Vegue
Winkelstein Moris</PERSON>, offers a 3-D model that could be adapted to the challenges
facing <LOCATION>South Bay cities.</LOCATION>;    A population of about 1,000 students live, work,
eat and socialize within <ORGANIZATION>College Eight</ORGANIZATION> boundaries. The dorms are the
residential neighborhood. The classrooms are the workplaces. The dining room
and cafe are restaurants and entertainment centers.;    That's the skeleton of
a city. But to flesh it out with character, appeal, mystery and memory is
another matter. College Eight is valuable because of the way it's designed.
It's focused. Each part is articulated. Everything is within easy walking
distance and is accessible by foot; towers and gateways are clear landmarks to
guide you. A rich variety of activities and shapes make an exciting
environment.;    You can tell the housing from the classrooms from the dining
rooms. Yet overall the college has a specific character. It's organized enough
to be immediately understandable but complex enough to give the variety that's
a city's lifeblood. Terraces allow people to congregate.;    The formal entry
is at the top of a hill, near the edge of the forest that conceals most of the
other colleges at the university.;    From afar it looks like a town. The
grouping of gabled structures have a civic heft to them. A vestigial
bell-tower dominates the skyline, a mini-campanile borrowed from <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>'s
campus.;    The similarity to its sister campus doesn't end there. College
Eight's buildings sort themselves out on either side of a long axis like a
small-scale version of <PERSON>John Galen Howard</PERSON>'s plan for <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>. The Beaux Art
symmetry is modified by some suitably Californian shifts and quirks along the
way.;    Though not classical in style, these stucco buildings echo the sober
demeanor of <ORGANIZATION>Howard</ORGANIZATION>'s; they lack the witty play of <PERSON>Fernau</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hartmann</PERSON>'s new
Student Center.;    The axis stair-steps slowly down the hill, pausing to
widen into plazas and terraces for outdoor music or sunning. Off the large
central plaza -- which someday ought to be graced by a fountain -- is the
college's great interior meeting space, the Dining Hall.;    The white stucco
of the public buildings gives way to panels of wood and trellis that give the
residential quarters a more casual feel despite their size; they're overgrown
camp cabins. The three-story dorms each wrap around a small courtyard open to
the ocean view.;    College Eight's lessons for cities such as <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Milpitas</LOCATION>: Tie nature into your town center; use images resonant of the place,
the history, the people; cluster buildings close together but counter that
with open plazas and vistas; use the natural variety of a town to give variety
to the architecture.;    They work for a small college. Can these lessons be
adapted to real cities?;    <ORGANIZATION>Mountain View</ORGANIZATION> is halfway there with its superb new
city hall and theater. But unlike <ORGANIZATION>College Eight</ORGANIZATION>'s pedestrian axis, Mountain
View is stuck with <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> Street as its defining axis. For the time being it
will remain a linear town. Future housing, offices and stores can be woven
together with a master plan to focus housing, shopping, workplaces and
culture.;    <LOCATION>Sunnyvale</LOCATION> has more space to work with if the Town and Country
Village shopping center site is planned as a sizable pedestrian- oriented
district. An even better plan: Blow up that urban travesty, the so-called
"Town Center" mall, and devote even more space to a compact city center mixing
housing, shops, offices and parks on the <ORGANIZATION>College Eight</ORGANIZATION> model. Focus it on some
public building -- an arts center possibly -- and keep architectural standards
high.;    There's nothing radical about the urban concepts College Eight
champions. It's time to move them out of the small-scale experimental stage
and bring them into the civic arena. (box)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
<P>
The greening of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> is about to pick up speed. 
</P>
<P>
For too long in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, landscaping has been an afterthought, if a thought 
at all. After <PERSON>Kate Sessions</PERSON>, the mother of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> horticulture, died in 
<DATE>1940</DATE>, no one stepped in to push for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Architect <PERSON>Ed Malone</PERSON> once remarked, quite rightly, that landscaping has a 
greater overall impact than architecture. When plants mature, they screen and 
soften the impact of buildings. For pedestrians and motorists, plants modulate 
the experience of moving along city sidewalks and streets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, through the efforts of city officials and concerned <LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION>, 
landscaping is once again getting the attention it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The city is gearing up to better carry out a <DATE>1986</DATE> ordinance and an accompanying 
manual spelling out how new projects must be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Kelly Broughton</PERSON> was hired in <DATE>December</DATE> as principal landscape architect, 
replacing <PERSON>Tom Story</PERSON>, a guiding force in drafting and implementing the 
ordinance. (Story is now deputy director of city planning.) 
</P>
<P>
Soon, nine new landscape experts will be added to the current staff of five, 
augmenting <PERSON>Broughton</PERSON>'s ability to see that landscaping on new commercial and 
multifamily residential projects gets as much attention as architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1986</DATE>, <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> created a position of principal landscape architect to 
oversee the new landscape ordinance passed earlier that year. 
</P>
<P>
The private sector is also lending a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of single-family homes, which are not covered by the ordinance, are 
being enlightened by such private groups as <ORGANIZATION>People for Trees</ORGANIZATION>. Formed early last 
year, the organization has already helped several neighborhoods plant trees 
along streets. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions, who for years operated a huge nursery at Sixth Avenue and Upas Street 
on the edge of <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, was single-handedly responsible for many of the 
trees (especially palms) that are such a large part of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s character. 
She was the city's first proponent of palms, planting hundreds and hundreds, 
including the Cocos plumosas along 6th venue, between Upas and Date streets, 
and at <ORGANIZATION>Horton Plaza</ORGANIZATION> park downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But as <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> rapidly grew in the '70s and <DATE>'80s</DATE>, and as city funds for 
landscaping public rights-of-way dwindled, neighborhoods suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some streets are lined with large old trees, which add a kind of 
friendliness and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Far more, however, are lined with concrete sidewalks, driveways and other cold, 
harsh elements. Entire neighborhoods, on the edge of <LOCATION>Point Loma</LOCATION>, for example, 
have coaxed gravel or painted concrete front yards into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
One trend that prompted the new law was the tendency for large, desolate 
apartment complexes to replace small, single-family homes -- and their 
accompanying front gardens -- in many neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Already, according to Story, the ordinance has led to improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"What was happening in the Mid-City area (including <ORGANIZATION>Normal Heights</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Kensington</LOCATION> 
and portions of <LOCATION>East San Diego</LOCATION>) was that homes were being bought up, leveled 
and replaced with a six- or eight-plex," Story said. "They were filling the 
entire lot, except for the required setbacks, and putting all the parking right 
up front by the streets. Front yards became garages and concrete driveways for 
two- or three-story buildings. If there was enough density, they also put 
parking on the back sides of the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Under the landscaping ordinance, such "street yards" must now be <PERCENT>80%</PERCENT> 
landscaped, precluding the parking lot syndrome. Builders have had to tuck the 
rest of their parking behind or beneath buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also requires a minimum of landscaping in front of commercial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the ordinance and manual have improved new projects. 
</P>
<P>
On Sports Arena Boulevard across from the Sports Arena in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, a shopping 
complex changed owners two years ago and was remodeled, adding a new Home Depot 
store and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Home Depot opened, existing landscaping was kept, but we had them add 
a lot more trees," Story said. "People have mentioned how good the quality of 
the development is now." 
</P>
<P>
In front of the mall, <ORGANIZATION>Sports Arena Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> is now lined with carrotwood 
trees. Peppermint eucalyptus and evergreen pear trees break up the monotony of 
the parking lots. Median strips are planted with such low water-use shrubs as 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> hawthorn and natal plum. Grass, known for its thirst, is used sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
Besides specifying both the quality and quantity of landscaping for a variety 
of projects, the ordinance details plant materials that conserve water and 
resist fire. One goal is to encourage the use of drought-tolerant ground covers 
in lieu of lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Native vegetation is to be retained where possible. Irrigation systems must 
meet strict standards, including the use of moisture sensors to minimize water 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
But city rules alone won't make for a more beautiful <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>, especially in 
older residential neighborhoods, where new development governed by the 
ordinance is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing this, and knowing that there's no city money available for landscaping 
these streets, a group of <LOCATION>San Diegans</LOCATION> led by <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Ocean 
Beach</ORGANIZATION> has banded together, calling itself People for Trees. 
</P>
<P>
Story has been a member from the beginning. The organization tries to join 
needy neighborhoods with corporate donors, with advice on tree selection 
available through the city's Planning and Park and Recreation departments. 
</P>
<P>
People for Trees coordinated the planting last <DATE>spring</DATE> of 50 fern pines on 
<ORGANIZATION>Waring Road</ORGANIZATION>, just north of Interstate 8 near <LOCATION>Mission Valley</LOCATION>, where several 
large ash trees had been removed after their roots began to destroy sidewalks. 
The trees were donated by <ORGANIZATION>Kaiser Permanente</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
All told, <ORGANIZATION>People for Trees</ORGANIZATION> has supervised the planting of 2,000 trees along 
streets, and at schools and other public places. This year, the organization 
will plant at least 1,400 more trees, with the help of a <MONEY>$42,000</MONEY> state grant 
for street trees awarded last fall. 
</P>
<P>
In <LOCATION>Southeast San Diego</LOCATION>, Project First Class, started five years ago by 
then-City Councilman <PERSON>William Jones</PERSON>, is aimed at neighborhood improvements, 
including the installation of street trees purchased with federal money 
channeled through the city of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>. So far, 65 trees have been planted in 
and around Memorial Park, and five at <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr</ORGANIZATION>. Park. 
</P>
<P>
The city is encouraging these efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Led by <ORGANIZATION>People for Trees</ORGANIZATION>, the city is adopting a citywide tree-planting goal 
and policy statement," <PERSON>Broughton</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
With state <PERSON>Arbor</PERSON> Day coming <DATE>March 7</DATE>, and national <ORGANIZATION>Arbor Day</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>April 28</DATE>, it's a 
good time to think about trees. You can contact <ORGANIZATION>People for Trees</ORGANIZATION> at 231-3713

<DESCRIPT>  PALO-ALTO; PARK  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT'S THE ultimate case of turning a sow's ear into a silk purse: A garbage
dump on the Palo Alto bayshore has been transformed into a park of poetry and
pleasure.;   The first phase of Byxbee Park, located east of Highway 101 on
Embarcadero Road, opens today. Tied into shoreline bike paths, the park
returns part of the bayshore to a public hemmed in by asphalt. That alone is
good news. But Byxbee goes much farther. setting a new standard for public
landscape design.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PALO ALTO PARK CELEBRATES THE BAYSHORE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Architecture; Alan Hess is a Bay Area architect whose column appears every
other week in Perspective.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Byxbee's designers, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> landscape architects <PERSON>George Hargreaves</PERSON>
and <ORGANIZATION>Associates</ORGANIZATION>, are responsible for Market Plaza, the magnetic site in
downtown <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> with a misting, bubbling, jetting fountain. Hargreaves also
designed the <LOCATION>Guadalupe River Park.</LOCATION>;   Each project shows the firm's rare
sensitivity to the character of a site. A park is more than a plot of grass
for picnics. Byxbee's imaginative design offers a place to commune with the
natural beauty of the <LOCATION>South Bay</LOCATION> while it acknowledges the presence of human
accomplishments.;   The eloquent <PERSON>Hargreaves</PERSON>' design draws inspiration from a
mix of elements in the site's vicinity. He weaves them together into a
provocative essay. That's the standard Byxbee now sets for every new
subdivision, every public park, every revitalized downtown in the <LOCATION>South Bay.</LOCATION>; 
 <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay</LOCATION> is both a working and a natural landscape. No longer the
pristine wilderness De Anza found, it is a playground, a home site, an
industrial center. Man-made additions -- the giant power poles wading just
offshore Byxbee, airplanes landing at <LOCATION>Palo Alto Municipal Airport</LOCATION> nearby, even
the garbage lying beneath a thick clay seal -- are part of a landscape that
cannot and should not be ignored.;   Utilitarian power lines and airports may
seem unconventional elements for a public park, but this park has something to
say about how we co-exist with nature. The result is a design far bolder and
more appealing than any other recent public landscape, whether park, plaza,
business park or boulevard. Those may provide some pleasant greenery but have
absolutely nothing to say. Adding nothing to our understanding or appreciation
of our environment, they are literally dumb.;   Instead of hiding the park's
literal roots in garbage, its artificial hills and dales reflect the sculpted
clay cap over the 60-foot mounds of refuse. In place of trees whose roots
could crack the clay cap, low native grasses cover most of the park. Even the
required methane gas burn off is highlighted in a small fenced area with a
key-shaped concrete pad for service trucks. The invisible flame's heat waves
distort the air and view like a lens, literally altering our perceptions.
That's what the entire design does.;   The <LOCATION>Palo Alto Municipal Airport</LOCATION> just
north of Byxbee is another unexpected element integrated into a park.
Single-engine aircraft buzz over the park throughout the day, casting shadows
on the grass. To mark that fact, <PERSON>Hargreaves</PERSON> places a series of low concrete
chevrons stepping down the slope under the flight path. For a pilot they point
to the runway's edge. From the ground these low concrete walls create a series
of stairs that will retard rainwater runoff. Over the years, these weirs will
develop their own crop of lusher grasses and wildflowers to mark the flight
path. The park design builds in a process of organic change.;   A pathway of
crushed oyster shells -- they add a springy crunch under your feet -- winds
through the park's features. Near the parking lot is the land gate, a dam of
earth breached by an opening reminiscent of the sharp, faceted planes of a
highway cut. From its crest stretches one of the park's panoramic vistas
focused on the giant hangar and air tunnel at <ORGANIZATION>Moffett Field</ORGANIZATION> as well as
<ORGANIZATION>Shoreline Amphitheater</ORGANIZATION>'s tent. Like gigantic toys, these are the only local
features big enough to add counterpoint to the hills.;   Topping the mounds
nearby are small hillocks facing into the wind like seagulls. Their teardrop
forms mirror the natural forms of land eroded by wind. Covered with grass,
they lose all scale and blend with the silhouettes of the distant <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION>
hills -- visually tying the foreground with the distant view. Hargreaves thus
manages to borrow the magnificent slopes of the <LOCATION>East Bay</LOCATION> and make them part of
his design -- a clever and inexpensive way to visually expand the size of his
client's property.;   The park's northeast tip is planted with a field of 72
evenly spaced poles. They rise out of the earth like the pilings of an
abandoned pier in the bay, or like 72 sundials tracing the sun across the sky.
Their tops describe a tilted plane whose strict geometry adds another
counterpoint to the undulations of the ground. Part Stonehenge, part seagull
perch, some poles tower overhead, some are short enough to sit on.;   <LOCATION>Byxbee
Park</LOCATION> is rooted in tradition: Like 19th-century <LOCATION>Golden Gate Park</LOCATION>, its rambling
paths are carefully plotted to lead through a mix of sheltered refuges and
dramatic prospects. But it charts a new course by making no attempt to create
the illusion of a natural setting. Like Brazilian <PERSON>Roberto Burle Marx</PERSON>, the
world's greatest living landscape architect, <PERSON>Hargreaves</PERSON> is as interested in
reflecting man's culture and its inventions as he is in nature and its
wonders.;   <LOCATION>Byxbee Park</LOCATION> is superb design. Every planning department, developer
and architect ought to study it. The <ORGANIZATION>Palo Alto Arts Commission</ORGANIZATION> that shepherded
the idea from its inception has made a tremendous contribution to the <LOCATION>South
Bay</LOCATION>. If we're lucky, it's started a trend. (box)  </TEXT>

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRIBUTE TO S.D. WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commonly held wisdom has it that <PERSON>Irving Gill</PERSON> is <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s sole legacy to the 
world of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Pick up almost any architectural book, and, if it mentions <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> at all, 
the reference is usually to <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, he has been this city's most significant innovator of the <ORGANIZATION>20th 
Century</ORGANIZATION>, designing clean-lined, modern buildings beginning in <DATE>1907</DATE> or so, years 
before <PERSON>Le Corbusier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mies Van Der Rohe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Loos</PERSON> and others became modern 
architecture's heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But there are important <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architects and designers largely ignored by 
history. Among them are the three women featured in the exhibit "In Harmony 
With the Land," opening <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Museum of San Diego History</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Balboa 
Park</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Women in Architecture and the <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Historical Society are teaming up to 
present the show, which will run through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Opening at the same time and running through <DATE>Sept. 10</DATE> is "That Exceptional 
One," a tribute to 100 years of female architects, dating back to <DATE>1888</DATE> when 
<PERSON>Louise Blanchard Bethune</PERSON> became the first woman member of the <ORGANIZATION>American 
Institute of Architects</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> architects featured in the local show, <PERSON>Lilian Rice</PERSON> is 
the best known. Also included are <PERSON>Hazel Waterman</PERSON> and landscape designer 
<PERSON>Harriett Wimmer</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed in Total Site Planning 
</P>
<P>
The show's title is meant to reflect the way all three women believed in total 
site planning, with close relationships between buildings and their surrounding 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is best known for the Spanish-influenced buildings she designed in <ORGANIZATION>Rancho 
Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> between <DATE>1922</DATE> and her death in <DATE>1938</DATE> at the age of 49 from an 
undiagnosed case of appendicitis. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was working for <PERSON>Richard Requa</PERSON>, the well-known designer of many of <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION>'s finest Mediterranean-style homes, and his partner <PERSON>Herbert Jackson</PERSON>, when 
they were commissioned to come up with a master plan for <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and 
design several buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Because the commute from <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> would have occupied too much of the 
partners' time, they turned day-to-day details over to Rice, and she eventually 
designed many of the buildings on <LOCATION>Paseo Delicias</LOCATION> in the business district of 
<ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, as well as about 60 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Today, these buildings house <PERSON>Quimby</PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION>Mille Fleurs</ORGANIZATION> restaurants, <PERSON>Ashley</PERSON>'s 
market and other local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, some of the only buildings in the area were adobe ranch houses 
dating back to the mid-1800s. With these -- and probably the <LOCATION>San Diego County</LOCATION> 
missions -- in mind, the <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe Land Improvement Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the developers of 
<ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, decided that Spanish-flavored architecture would be 
appropriate for the new community. 
</P>
<P>
Many of <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s buildings in <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> have tile roofs, deep-set window 
and door openings, interior courtyards and carefully laid-out gardens linked to 
the homes by French doors and generous windows. Most have white stucco walls 
that imitate the thick, plastered-over adobe found on buildings in the 
<LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't a pioneer or innovator; she was carrying out the plan the 
developers wanted," said <PERSON>Lucinda Eddy</PERSON>, who completed her master's thesis on 
Rice at the <ORGANIZATION>University of San Diego</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE> and helped organize the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s work. Outside <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION>, her residential 
designs have an entirely different appearance. Many use horizontal wood siding 
and shingle roofs, with interior walls paneled in redwood. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of this style is the rustic ZLAC <ORGANIZATION>Rowing Club</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>1111 Pacific Beach 
Drive</ORGANIZATION>. A high ceiling supported by heavy redwood beams rises to a peak above a 
hardwood floor. French doors open out on a veranda at the edge of the beach on 
the shore of <LOCATION>Mission Bay</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Rice learned to love natural materials while studying architecture at 
<ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION>, when the department was headed by <PERSON>John 
Galen Howard</PERSON>, who designed many campus buildings. Buildings such as the rowing 
clubhouse echo the organic, Craftsman style that <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> saw in the work of 
<LOCATION>Howard</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bernard Maybeck</PERSON> and other San Francisco-rea architects. 
</P>
<P>
Although <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s buildings are simple in form and materials, they do a masterful 
job of manipulating light and space. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted her structures to be an extension of the outdoors," <PERSON>Eddy</PERSON> said. "Her 
houses were intended to be details in the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subtle Innovations 
</P>
<P>
Although it is easy to pass off Rice as a talented but unoriginal designer 
heavily influenced by her mentors, her best work is innovative in subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine replacing the tile roofs on many of her <ORGANIZATION>Rancho Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> homes with the 
flat roofs preferred by <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>, and her buildings show a strong relationship to 
modernism. Examine the way she masses and composes a home such as the <PERSON>Carpenter</PERSON> 
residence of <DATE>1928</DATE>, and you see the eye of an artist at work. 
</P>
<P>
Like <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s, the work of <PERSON>Waterman</PERSON>, who apprenticed with <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> and his partner, 
<PERSON>William Hebbard</PERSON>, is also under-appreciated. (<PERSON>Waterman</PERSON> later hired Rice as her 
own apprentice.) 
</P>
<P>
As <PERSON>Eddy</PERSON> pointed out, <PERSON>Waterman</PERSON>'s success is remarkable considering she had only 
a year of college work in design and learned architecture from correspondence 
courses. <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> hired her after he designed a house for her and her husband and 
sensed she had talent. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her finest designs, including buildings in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION> for the <LOCATION>San 
Diego Children</LOCATION>'s Home, completed in <DATE>1925</DATE>, are no longer standing. But 
photographs of them, and buildings such as her <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Club</ORGANIZATION> (<DATE>1911</DATE>) at Ivy 
Lane and 6th Avenue, show that she assimilated <PERSON>Gill</PERSON>'s flat surfaces, arched 
openings and carefully placed square and rectangular windows. 
</P>
<P>
While Rice and <PERSON>Waterman</PERSON> are well-represented by drawings and historic photos, 
<PERSON>Wimmer</PERSON>'s work is tougher to document, according to <PERSON>Eddy</PERSON>. Wimmer laid out 
landscapes mostly in her head, so no drawings ever existed. Instead, her work 
will be represented by several photographs, and the lineup is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Working with landscape architect <PERSON>Joe Yamada</PERSON>, who became her partner in <DATE>1960</DATE>, 
<PERSON>Wimmer</PERSON> handled plant selection and placement for <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography</ORGANIZATION>, areas of the UC <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> campus, <LOCATION>Sea World</LOCATION> and many homes. 
</P>
<P>
Next <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, in Room 102 at the <ORGANIZATION>Casa del Prado</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Balboa Park</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sally Bullard 
Thornton</PERSON>, the author of a biography on <PERSON>Waterman</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Barbara Thornburgh Carlton</PERSON> 
will discuss <PERSON>Waterman</PERSON>'s work.

<HEAD>After Three Decades, Seattle's Westlake Center Opens</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 30 years of committees, proposals and no
small amount of bickering, a downtown center opens this week giving
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> a combination town square, office tower, shopping arcade,
bus station and monorail terminal.
   ``That's a minor miracle,'' says <PERSON>Stephen Koehler</PERSON>, president of
<ORGANIZATION>Koehler McFayden &amp; Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, one of the project's
co-developers.
   ``There's so many people and so many ideas of what was going to
go into the small space called <LOCATION>Westlake</LOCATION>, that it's really
impossible to make all the people happy about this. But I think the
overwhelming majority will like what's here.''
   What's here is a 24-story office building, a five-story shopping
and restaurant pavilion and a one-acre city plaza on a roughly
triangular wedge in the middle of the city's retail district. It's
a compromise of three decades of discussions, lawsuits, civic
commissions and studies over what to do with one of the few open
spaces left in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>'s core.
   ``It's been such a controversial project for so long, I'm just
kind of glad it's done,'' says Mayor <PERSON>Charles Royer</PERSON>.
   Westlake Center was formally opening today amid speeches, bands,
doves and 50,000 balloons.
   <PERSON>Koehler McFayden</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>The Rouse Co.</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, developer
of such projects as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s South Street Seaport and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>'s
Harborplace, built the <MONEY>$110 million</MONEY> office and shopping complex. It
adjoins the <MONEY>$18.9 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>Westlake Park</LOCATION>, paved in multi-colored
granite to resemble a Salish Indian basketweave pattern.
   The center's lower level opens to a station of a bus tunnel to
be completed next year. The third floor is the terminus for the
one-mile monorail ride to <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Center</ORGANIZATION>, site of the <DATE>1962</DATE> world's
fair.
   Westlake, at the junction of <LOCATION>Westlake Avenue</LOCATION>, Pine Street and
Fifth Avenue, has long been a place to find flower vendors, hear
street musicians and political speeches, and to duck out of the
rain beneath the old monorail terminal.
   It's also a place to shop. Bordering are large department
stores. A few blocks away is the <ORGANIZATION>Pike Place Market</ORGANIZATION>, a collection of
fresh fish and vegetable stalls, bakeries, espresso cafes and
open-air entrepreneurs.
   Since the <DATE>1950s</DATE>, when the city closed a two-block stretch of
<LOCATION>Westlake Avenue</LOCATION>, the site has been the focus for big plans.
Proposals have included a pedestrian mall, a hotel-shopping
complex, a home for the <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Art Museum</ORGANIZATION> and a central city park.
   Downtown merchants wanted to attract shoppers. Open-space
advocates, including the late <PERSON>Victor Steinbrueck</PERSON>, an architect who
battled to save the <ORGANIZATION>Pike Market</ORGANIZATION>, wanted a central plaza, a ``living
room'' for the city.
   Steinbrueck, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee for Alternatives</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Westlake</LOCATION>,
led a successful legal fight to block a plan by <PERSON>Royer</PERSON> to locate the
art museum at <LOCATION>Westlake</LOCATION>. That led to the city agreeing to the joint
venture by <PERSON>Rouse</PERSON> and <PERSON>Koehler McFayden</PERSON> in <DATE>1983</DATE>.
   Construction began in <DATE>January 1987</DATE>. The result pleases the
developers, satisfies the city and is accepted with mixed feelings
by <PERSON>Steinbrueck</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON>.
   ``<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> lost a great opportunity for a grand square,'' says
<PERSON>Steinbrueck</PERSON>, himself an architect. But, ``I think the park and
shopping pavilion will be a major enhancement to the retail core.''
   Steinbrueck thinks the park is good architecturally. He's less
kind about the center, which he says blocks Westlake Avenue from
the plaza and doesn't fit with nearby buildings. And the ``awful,
tacky blue glass'' of the tower's windows creates an eyesore, he
said.
   <PERSON>Royer</PERSON> says the city has ``a clear winner'' in the retail center,
but thinks it might be a while before the park becomes popular.
   ``It's sort of like a new shoe, it will take a little time for
it to become comfortable as a gathering place,'' said <PERSON>Royer</PERSON>.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Central Park bandstand project aims to recapture
historic design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BETSY GOTBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Let me clarify some of the issues raised in '<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s oasis of the
park' (<DATE>July 13</DATE>), an account of <ORGANIZATION>New York City Parks &amp; Recreation</ORGANIZATION>'s proposed
removal of the <ORGANIZATION>Naumburg Bandshell</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION>.
When Central Park was built, <ORGANIZATION>Frederick Law Olmsted</ORGANIZATION> included an octagonal
cast-iron bandstand designed by <PERSON>Jacob Wrey Mould</PERSON> on a grassy area to the
west of the mall. This bandstand remained until <DATE>1923</DATE> when it was demolished
owing to its dilapidated condition, and replaced by the current bandshell on
the east side of the mall. Now my agency feels that this facility, too, has
seen its day, and should be removed.
Unlike the original bandstand, which was open on all sides, the massive
stone bandshell broke up the sweeping vista along the mall that Olmsted had
intended. From the <ORGANIZATION>Wisteria Pergola</ORGANIZATION> atop the hill behind the bandshell, it
was no longer possible to enjoy (as Olmsted had intended) a panoramic view
of the mall and lake.
For the next 50 years, popular classical concerts were held at the bandshell
 -until <DATE>1980</DATE>, when the Naumburg family concert series abandoned the
bandshell for <LOCATION>Damrosch Park</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Center</ORGANIZATION> because the site had become
too loud and active for their concerts. As no one wanted to use it, the
bandshell fell into decay.
The mall is now in the final stages of an 18-month, Dollars 4m restoration.
The project's purpose is to recapture the historic design of <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION>'s
most architecturally formal space, and to offer New Yorkers an unparalleled
green setting featuring lawns and permanent seating under a cathedral canopy
of elm trees. The bandshell has become an anachronism that attracts illegal
activity and vandalism.
The removal of the bandshell will restore the area to Olmsted's original
plan, and make the area safer. My agency cannot afford to commit its limited
resources to restoring and maintaining structures that no longer serve a
useful public function.

ARCHITECTURE: INPUT PUT A BETTER FACE ON 2 COASTAL HOTELS

<TEXT>
<P>
Some architects would rather face a school of hungry sharks than the layers of 
design review most projects go through these days. In particular, designing 
buildings along the coast, where local sentiments run especially deep, can be a 
touchy process. 
</P>
<P>
Yet two elegant new oceanfront hotels -- the <LOCATION>Sheraton Grande</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Torrey Pines</LOCATION> in 
<LOCATION>La Jolla</LOCATION> and L'Auberge Del Mar -- prove that extensive design review can 
produce better buildings. Feedback from local government and community factions 
helped, in both cases, to produce thoughtfully designed hotels with minimal 
impact on <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s precious coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, <ORGANIZATION>L'Auberge Del Mar</ORGANIZATION> is the more successful design. Inside and out, it 
conveys a low-key, homey warmth through intimate scale and materials such as 
brick and wood shingles and beams. The Sheraton, by contrast, is a sound, 
modern building that suffers from a few lapses in detailing. Rooftop vents and 
air-conditioning equipment, for example, are eyesores to motorists on <LOCATION>North 
Torrey Pines Road</LOCATION>. An exterior of white stucco and reflective glass makes the 
place about as inviting as a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A significant portion of L'Auberge's sensitive design is directly attributable 
to concerned Del Mar citizens and politicians. Architects <PERSON>Jim Galvin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joe 
Cristilli</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Galvin Cristilli Architects</ORGANIZATION> spent four years refining the project 
to meet the community's desires. The <MONEY>$30-million</MONEY>, 123-room hotel, which opened 
in <DATE>July of last year</DATE>, was subject to voter approval. It didn't pass until its 
second time on the ballot in <DATE>February, 1988</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
The city had good reason to proceed with caution. The hotel site is a key 
downtown corner at 15th Street and <ORGANIZATION>Camino Del Mar</ORGANIZATION>, where other corners are 
occupied by a bank, the new Del Mar Plaza retail complex and <LOCATION>Stratford Square</LOCATION>, 
a <DATE>1927</DATE> Tudor-style building. Strong traditions came with the location. Many 
locals fondly remember the <DATE>1909</DATE> Tudor-style Inn at <ORGANIZATION>Del Mar</ORGANIZATION> that was torn down 
in <DATE>1969</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Galvin</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Cristilli</ORGANIZATION>'s new hotel suits downtown Del Mar well, even though 
its Tudor-based design has a contemporary flair. 
</P>
<P>
L'Auberge takes many of its cues from <LOCATION>Stratford Square</LOCATION>, which houses the 
popular <ORGANIZATION>Carlos &amp; Annie's Cafe</ORGANIZATION>. Steep, gabled roofs and tan stucco walls 
make the two buildings cousins. But the architects did not imitate <LOCATION>Stratford 
Square</LOCATION>'s Tudor half-timbering with its vertical, horizontal and diagonal boards 
applied to exterior walls that give an appearance dating back to 16th-Century 
<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and citizens were as concerned about the new hotel's siting and 
size as they were about its style. Set back generously from the street, with 
parking well concealed underground, the hotel is a gentle presence. Wood 
trellises shade public areas and soften the hotel's visual impact. Lots of 
brick adds to the Old World atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
A retail annex and the hotel's main restaurant are both near the street. These 
public attractions also make the hotel an especially good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The key corner of the project -- at 15th and <ORGANIZATION>Camino Del Mar</ORGANIZATION> -- is essentially 
an offering to the citizens of the city, and comes complete with a small 
concrete amphitheater. A park-like pedestrian entrance is enhanced by a 
man-made stream and waterfall, which mask the din of nearby traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Cars reach the project via driveways slightly removed from the corner, thereby 
keeping the pedestrian entrance clear. And hotel rooms are arranged in three 
wings, which are aligned with neighboring blocks of condominiums to the west in 
order to save view corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the hotel's main entry off Camino Del Mar a gabled, glassed roof floods 
the lobby with natural light. Overstuffed chairs, a Citizen Kane-sized brick 
fireplace and big ceiling beams painted with a delicate floral pattern give the 
place a country-style charm. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$60-million</MONEY>, 400-room Sheraton, which opened in <DATE>November</DATE> at the edge of 
<ORGANIZATION>Torrey Pines Golf Course</ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION>UC San Diego</LOCATION>, could use more of <ORGANIZATION>L'Auberge Del 
Mar</ORGANIZATION>'s careful detailing, especially on the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Architects <ORGANIZATION>Welton Becket Associates of Santa Monica</ORGANIZATION> gave the building a stark 
front of white stucco and copper-colored reflective-glass windows with green 
mullions. With its wide concrete driveways, the Sheraton looks more like an 
office building than a place you'd want to spend a relaxing weekend. By 
contrast, the pocket decks, patios and outdoor public dining areas visible 
around the edges of <ORGANIZATION>L'Auberge Del Mar</ORGANIZATION> make it immediately inviting. 
</P>
<P>
In its favor, however, the Sheraton makes only a minimal impact on its coastal 
bluff site. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of the crash danger posed by ocean-borne fighter jets leaving <LOCATION>Miramar 
Naval Air Station</LOCATION> a few miles inland, the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> played a key role in dictating 
the hotel's low profile. Designed for maximum safety, the structure is partly 
embedded in the bluff, with several key meeting rooms and a main restaurant on 
lower floors. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the <ORGANIZATION>University City Planning Group</ORGANIZATION> served as a watchdog during the 
design process, making sure the hotel would suit its site and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Architecturally, the <ORGANIZATION>Sheraton</ORGANIZATION> borrows from its neighbor, <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Clinic</ORGANIZATION>, which 
was designed by <ORGANIZATION>Edward Durell Stone</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION>Salk 
Institute</ORGANIZATION>, architect <PERSON>Louis Kahn</PERSON>'s <DATE>1960s</DATE> concrete masterpiece. The hotel's 
pattern of square windows vaguely echoes the squares of <ORGANIZATION>Scripps Clinic</ORGANIZATION>'s 
exterior. Rooms in the hotel's wings are angled to capture fantastic views of 
the golf course and ocean, in the same way that the <ORGANIZATION>Salk Institute</ORGANIZATION>'s labs and 
offices gain their views. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is laid out with four wings strung behind the long front building, 
which houses the lobby and main hallways. Between the wings, three large 
terraces provide great ocean views. A pool in the middle courtyard is 
surrounded by classical stone railings with large concrete posts topped with 
flower-filled urns. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the <ORGANIZATION>Sheraton</ORGANIZATION> is a mixed bag. A high-beamed ceiling over the grand lobby 
makes the space as comfortable as a <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain</ORGANIZATION> ski lodge. At the back of 
this impressive space, wide stairs descend to the <LOCATION>Torreyana Grille</LOCATION> restaurant. 
Nearby, a curving wall of glass provides light and great views of a pool and 
formal terrace outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton is decorated in a vaguely Southwestern style with expensive 
materials and furnishings, including slate floors, marble-topped counters and 
odd metal lighting fixtures in the form of gnarled shrubs. A provocative art 
collection ranges from abstract and figurative pieces to wiry metal coyotes 
poised in niches. Sometimes the materials get too glitzy, as with the the 
gigantic, copper-trimmed fireplace and the mirrors behind overhead planters. 
</P>
<P>
Both hotels compare favorably with the best of <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION>'s new hotels downtown, 
as well as in the Golden Triangle near <ORGANIZATION>University Towne Centre</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Both hotels compare favorably with the best of the new hotels downtown and in 
the Golden Triangle area, near <ORGANIZATION>University Towne Center</ORGANIZATION>. And both prove that 
when architects lend an ear to outside opinions, they can create buildings that 
please both their users and their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Canceled: Because of limited audience response, a symposium on <PERSON>Frank Lloyd 
Wright</PERSON> scheduled for <DATE>Sept. 15</DATE> has been canceled. The program, organized by the 
<ORGANIZATION>San Diego Architectural Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and sponsored by the foundation and the <LOCATION>San 
Diego</LOCATION> Museum of Art, will not be rescheduled. Tickets can be refunded through 
<ORGANIZATION>Ticketmaster</ORGANIZATION>.
