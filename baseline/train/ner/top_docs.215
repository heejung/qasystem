   Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> came home
<DATE>Friday</DATE> after five days in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and said his visit restored the
friendly Indian-Chinese relations of the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>.
   Also <DATE>Friday</DATE>, about 100 Tibetan students outside Parliament set
fire to a Chinese flag and denounced <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s recognition of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> as
part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. Police with bamboo canes watched the rally but did
generally not interfere.
   Gandhi told a news conference at <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>'s international
airport, ``I believe this visit will be a new beginning for both
countries.''
   A border dispute has strained relations between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>,
the world's two most populous countries, for nearly three decades.
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has more than 1 billion people, and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has about 800
million.
   Gandhi's visit to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> was the first by an Indian prime
minister since his grandfather, <PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON>, visited <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1954</DATE>.
   The two countries issued a communique in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> earlier <DATE>Friday</DATE>,
agreeing to set up a joint working group to take up the territorial
dispute, which led to war in <DATE>1962</DATE>. <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said the group would set a
time frame in which to resolve the issue.
   The communique also said Chinese Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> has accepted an
invitation to visit <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, but no date was set.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier that
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> says is part of its Arunachal Pradesh state. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> also says
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> illegally occupies 14,500 square miles in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>
state.
   Gandhi also told reporters that Chinese leaders respected <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
views on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, another sore point in relations. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> invaded
mountainous <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> in <DATE>1949</DATE> and annexed it a year later.
   The communique noted that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ``expressed concern over
anti-China activities by some Tibetan elements in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>,'' and that
the Indian side had repeated its policy of recognizing <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> as a
part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese
political activities on Indian soil.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has granted asylum to the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s religious
leader, and thousands of his followers who fled <ORGANIZATION>Tibet</ORGANIZATION> after an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in <DATE>1959</DATE>. <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> blames
supporters of the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> for pro-independence activities that
led to clashes with police in the last 14 months.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> signed three agreements _ a civil
aviation accord calling for direct flights between <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, a three-year cultural agreement, and a science and
technology pact.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> ended a visit
to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> today with the two nations expressing a common desire to
improve ties after nearly three decades of strained relations.
   Gandhi, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON>Sonia</PERSON>, departed for home from
<LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> after his five-day visit, the first by an Indian head of
government since his grandfather, <PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON>, visited in <DATE>1954</DATE>.
   Both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good will
between the world's most populous nations. <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said his trip
marked a ``new beginning'' for the two countries.
   During the visit, the countries agreed to set up a joint working
group to take up their most divisive issue, a territorial dispute
that broke out into a short border war in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   ``The leaders of the two countries held earnest, in-depth
discussions on the India-China boundary question and agreed to
settle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations,''
a joint communique said.
   It added, ``They also agreed to develop their relations actively
in other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate and
conditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundary
question.''
   It said <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s talks with Chinese Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> were held
``in an atmosphere of friendship, candidness and mutual
understanding.'' Gandhi also met with senior leader <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON>Zhao Ziyang</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Yang Shangkun</PERSON>.
   The border issue, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said, is ``very complicated'' and a
quick solution is unlikely.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
<LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> says is northeast <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Arunachal Pradesh province.
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> says <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   The communique said <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ``expressed concern over anti-China
activities by some Tibetan elements in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>,'' and that the Indian
side repeated its policy of recognizing <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> as a part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and
banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activities
on Indian soil.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has been the home of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s religious leader, the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai
Lama</ORGANIZATION>, and thousands of his followers who fled <ORGANIZATION>Tibet</ORGANIZATION> after an
abortive anti-Chinese uprising in <DATE>1959</DATE>. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> blames supporters of
the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> for pro-independence activities that have led to
violent clashes with police the past 14 months.
   Gandhi on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> presided over the signing of three bilateral
agreements _a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights
between <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, a three-year cultural agreement and a
science and technology agreement.
   The communique said Premier Li accepted an invitation to visit
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, but no date was set.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, grappling with economic problems at home, has made a
commitment to improving relations with its neighbors.
   Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> is expected to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
next year, becoming the first Soviet leader to do so in 30 years.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will likely normalize relations with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>
during the visit. The two countries fought a border war in <DATE>1969</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s
president, <PERSON>Yang Shangkun</PERSON>, today discussed <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s troubled region of
<LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said his country will not interfere in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s
internal affairs.
   The Indian leader spent much of his second day in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>
sightseeing.
   The official <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua News Agency</ORGANIZATION> said Yang explained <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s
position on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Gandhi</LOCATION> during a one-hour meeting at the <PERSON>Great
Hall</PERSON> of the People.
   Yang, 81, who has held the largely ceremonial post of president
since <DATE>April</DATE>, stressed that the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> government provides
assistance to the Tibetan region, one of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s most backward areas.
   ``We respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the
Tibetan people, and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief,''
<PERSON>Yang</PERSON> said.
   Gandhi repeated <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s position that <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> is an autonomous
region of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will not interfere in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s
internal affairs, <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The Tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the
two countries because <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has provided refuge to the Tibetan
religious leader, the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, and his followers, who have
demanded independence for <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> fled to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in
<DATE>1959</DATE> after he led a failed uprising against Chinese military forces.
   At least one Tibetan monk was shot and killed by Chinese security
forces during a demonstration in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION>Lhasa</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Dec. 10</DATE>. It was the third outbreak of anti-Chinese violence in <LOCATION>Lhasa</LOCATION>
in the past 14 months.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> are trying to restore friendly ties after <DATE>a
quarter century</DATE> of soured relations, which hit bottom during a
21-day border war in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   The border question was the main topic during talks <DATE>Monday</DATE>
between <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of what <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> says is part of
its northeast state of <LOCATION>Arunachal Pradesh</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> claims 14,500 square
miles of land seized by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   Gandhi and Li, however, vowed not to let the border problem
interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties.
   Gandhi is the first Indian leader to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> since his
grandfather, former Prime Minister <PERSON>Jawalharlal Nehru</PERSON>, came in <DATE>1954</DATE>.
   Accomapnied by his Italian-born wife, <PERSON>Sonia</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> today
traveled about 37 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> to the Badaling section
of the Great Wall, the 3,720-mile-long barrier built over a
2,000-year period to keep out invaders.
   The Indian leader also visited the <ORGANIZATION>Temple of Heaven</ORGANIZATION>, a 15th
century structure where <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s emperors once prayed for good
harvests and performed sacrificial rituals.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> is scheduled to meet 84-year-old senior
leader <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party General</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Zhao
Ziyang</PERSON>.
   The two sides are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation,
border trade, science and technology and the exchange of consular
offices in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>.

<FÊP=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <DATE>February 4</DATE>--The Indian government is 
"seriously considering" doing away with the situation that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category, 
as part of ongoing liberalisation process, <ORGANIZATION>UNI</ORGANIZATION> reports. 
  This has been conveyed by the Prime Minister, <PERSON>Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, in the Indian government's reply to the "Kohl 
memorandum" sent to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> after the German Chancellor, Dr 
<PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <DATE>February last year</DATE>. 
  The memorandum, entitled `Proposals on Economic Policies and 
Procedures of the <ORGANIZATION>Government of India</ORGANIZATION>', was forwarded by the 
Chancellor in <DATE>July last year</DATE>. 
  Some of the other proposals for further liberalisation, made 
in the memorandum and under active consideration of the 
government, are: 
  --Liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry; 
  --Removal of the phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy; 
  --Increasing the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations; 
  --Amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act. 
  The government's reply to the memorandum also states that on 
some other issues, such as enforceability of foreign awards, the 
government had an "open mind" and was willing to consider the 
matter. 
  The Indian reply to the memorandum was given to the German 
government a few days before <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>'s arrival on a state visit 
here. 
  The Indian reply states that it must be appreciated as a 
fundamental point relating to the issues raised in the "Kohl 
memorandum" that since the process of reforms was initiated 
several policy changes had been progressively made and 
procedures increasingly streamlined to improve the business 
environment in the country. 
  The reply adds that several of the proposals made in the 
memorandum were already under implementation. They were 
identified as: 
  --To decrease the number of industries reserved for the 
public sector; 
  --Faster clearance for applications under the <ORGANIZATION>EPCG</ORGANIZATION> [Export 
Promotion Capital Goods] scheme; 
  --Negotiation of more favourable double-taxation agreement; 
  --More liberal procedures for payment of foreign 
technicians; 
  --Long duration purchase agreements for power and secured 
fuel supplies for such projects; 
  --Equal opportunities for manufacturers in the telecom 
sector. 
  Under six broad classifications, the memorandum put forward 
suggestions on a vast range of areas and subjects such as 
desirability of a "negative" list; speeding up of state 
governments' proposals; uniform industrial policy in the states; 
remittance facilities for foreign nationals; disinvestment 
procedures; and governing law and arbitration for contracts 
entered into with foreign parties. 
  PTI adds: Leading political parties in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
have assured <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> that the new `<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> concept' unveiled by the 
Chancellor, Dr <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation and embracing a wide range of 
fields, would be honoured irrespective of which party came to 
power in this year's elections there. 
  This assurance was conveyed to <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>, when a series of 
important German political leaders called on him here yesterday. 
  An official spokesman said that by and large there was "a 
multi-party support" to Dr <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>'s new `<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> concept', as <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
has willingly recognised that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 
would be the important political and economic powers in the 
coming years. 
  The important German leaders who called on <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> included 
<PERSON>Mr 
Hans Ulrich Klose</PERSON>, chairman of the parliamentary group of 
<ORGANIZATION>Socialist Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, Dr <PERSON>Wolfgang Schauble</PERSON>, chairman of 
the parliamentary group of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, and 
Dr <PERSON>Hermann Otto Solms</PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Free Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Meanwhile, <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> reached the historic city of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> <TIME>this 
afternoon</TIME> on the last leg of his six-day tour to <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
  <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> is scheduled to meet the German President, <PERSON>Mr Richard 
von Weizsaecker</PERSON>, besides opening the cultural festival programme 
at the Indian cultural centre there tomorrow.

<HEAD>Gandhi In China: First Visit Of Indian Leader In 34 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> comes to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> for the first
visit by an Indian prime minister since his grandfather, <PERSON>Jawalharlal
Nehru</PERSON>, made the trip 34 years ago.
   For <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s nation and his political future, the stakes appear
high. For <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, little seemingly can go wrong.
   During a week long on symbolism but short on substance, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>
will be feted in the capital, tour the ancient city of <LOCATION>Xian</LOCATION> and
visit <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>.
   The visit, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> recently said, will be ``very important ... for
this globe, for <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and for both of us.''
   The two nations _ the world's most populous _ will probably sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology, Indian and Western diplomats said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> also may agree to establish consular
offices.
   But no substantial progress is expected on the critical issue of
their 2,400-mile border, over which the two countries fought a brief
war in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   The two countries began border talks in <DATE>1981</DATE> but have made little
progress. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of Indian territory.
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> rejects the claim and demands that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> return the 15,200
square miles it took in the <DATE>1962</DATE> war.
   Since then, relations have improved, but only slightly. The
border remains heavily guarded on both sides and bilateral trade,
which resumed in <DATE>1977</DATE> but amounted to only <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> last year,
is limited.
   Both <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> say <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s visit is intended to create an
atmosphere for greater communication and not to resolve the border
question. But Western diplomats said pressures on Gandhi could make
him more willing to compromise than his Chinese counterparts.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is moving quickly to improve relations with the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> after nearly three decades of hostility. A summit between
Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> and Chinese leader <PERSON>Deng
Xiaoping</PERSON> may be held next year.
   Better Chinese-Soviet relations will eliminate <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s need to
cultivate <LOCATION>New Dehli</LOCATION> as a foil against <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. And by removing
tensions along its northern border, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will be under less
pressure to accomodate <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> on its southern flank.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> continues its close relationship with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
traditional enemy. <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s new prime minister, <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON>, is
expected to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE> on her first official trip abroad.
   ``For <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>, the whole visit has an air of him running along so
he doesn't get left out in the cold,'' said a Western diplomat in
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> who recently returned from <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. ``For the Chinese, the
visit can't possibly go wrong.''
   A society that speaks with one voice when it comes to foreign
affairs, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has watched with apparent enjoyment as the Indian
press has pressured Gandhi to make progress on the border issue,
Western diplomats said.
   ``The prime minister has decided to stick yet another label to
his travel bags,'' wrote the normally pro-government Times of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
in an editorial <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``The more important question, however,
is, what is the prime minister going to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for?''
   Gandhi also faces an election next year in which victory is far
from certain. Diplomats say he must convince his public that simply
establishing goodwill with the Chinese _ and not achieving a
dramatic breakthrough _ is a worthy goal.
   ``If he feels that he is failing at that, he might be persuaded
to do something rash,'' the Western diplomat said.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> could use the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, the exiled Tibetan leader who has
taken refuge in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> since <DATE>1959</DATE>, to embarrass the Chinese. The
Tibetan refugees' parliament-in-exile on <DATE>Friday</DATE> called on <ORGANIZATION>Gandhi</ORGANIZATION> to
raise the issue of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> with Chinese leaders.
   But <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s hand is weakened by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s apparent willingness to
crush dissent in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, regardless of international opinion. On <DATE>Dec.
10</DATE>, police shot and killed at least one monk in <LOCATION>Lhasa</LOCATION>, the capital
of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, during an anti-Chinese demonstration. In addition, <LOCATION>New
Delhi</LOCATION> also has backed <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s claims to the region.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>. Relations soured in the early <DATE>1960s</DATE> over
the border question and political disagreements.
   Relations improved slightly in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> invited an
Indian leader to visit as early as <DATE>1979</DATE>, but <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> agreed to come
only in <DATE>November</DATE> of last year.
   Western diplomats say the timing of the acceptance was
significant because it came well after Sino-Soviet relations had
begun to improve.

   Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and Chinese
leaders spent most of their time together today discussing their
troubled border, the main issue dividing the world's most populous
nations, Indian journalists said.
   Gandhi also discussed <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> and trade with his Chinese hosts.
   Gandhi and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s premier, <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON>, met for two hours in the
morning following <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s arrival from <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. They continued
meetings after lunch, said the journalists who attended a news
briefing closed to non-Indian reporters.
   Gandhi's five-day visit marks the first time an Indian leader has
come to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> since <DATE>1954</DATE>, when his grandfather <PERSON>Jawalharlal Nehru</PERSON>
came to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>.
   The last time Chinese and Indian leaders met was in <DATE>1960</DATE>, when
Premier <PERSON>Chou Enlai</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. Two years later, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> fought a war over the border and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> occupied a large chunk
of Indian territory.
   Gandhi flew into <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> accompanied by about 100 top officials
and the two nations were expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology.
   Consular offices in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> may also be established.
   Little progress was expected on the 2,400-mile border.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua News Agency</ORGANIZATION> and Indian journalists said <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> and
Li agreed that the two nations had to find a way of settling the
border question peacefully.
   ``We should work now toward resolution of the border issue while
we work at the same time to expand and strengthen our bilateral
relations,'' the journalists quoted <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> as saying.
   Li said the border problem was hindering the two countries'
relations, <ORGANIZATION>Xinhua</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   Xinhua also said <PERSON>Li</PERSON> expressed ``admiration'' for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s position
on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, a Chinese province bordering <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has reiterated that <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and forbids
Tibetan refugees in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> from engaging in political activities. In
<DATE>1959</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s leader, and thousands of Tibetan
refugees fled to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> after an abortive, anti-Chinese uprising.
   On <DATE>Dec. 10</DATE>, at least one monk was killed in the Tibetan capital
of <LOCATION>Lhasa</LOCATION> during a clash between Chinese troops and Tibetans who seek
an end to 38 years of Chinese rule. It was the third bloody clash in
<LOCATION>Lhasa</LOCATION> in 14 months.
   Earlier <DATE>Monday</DATE>, at the <PERSON>Great Hall</PERSON> of the People in downtown
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> was given a 19-gun salute and met by Premier LI.
   Indian and Chinese flags lined <LOCATION>Tiananmen Square</LOCATION>, colored flags
lined the city's main boulevard, Changanjie.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> soon after <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1949</DATE> revolution. In the early
<DATE>1960s</DATE>, relations deteriorated over the border question and personal
and political disagreements between Chinese leader <PERSON>Mao Tse-tung</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Prime Minister Nehru</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> now claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>
rejects the claim and demands that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> return the 15,200 square
miles it took in the war.
   In the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>, relations improved slightly when <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations instead of
exporting socialist revolution.
   Direct trade resumed in <DATE>1977</DATE> but it amounted to just <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY>
in <DATE>1986-87</DATE> with few prospects for growth.
   The two countries began border talks in <DATE>1981</DATE> but have made little
progress in eight rounds.
   Interviews with Chinese scholars over the weekend found them
pessimistic about the possibility for good Sino-Indian ties. For
one, they said, the economies of the two countries are too similar
to allow for much trade.
   ``They export textiles and we export textiles. They want high
technology and we want high technology,'' said <PERSON>Zhang Minqiu</PERSON>, deputy
director of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of South and Southeast Asian Studies</ORGANIZATION> at
<ORGANIZATION>Beijing University</ORGANIZATION>. ``We're competitors so we lack cooperative
spirit.''
   In addition, Chinese researchers said the border question appears
intractable.
   ``In some of the areas that we claim, the Indian government has
made big investments and has registered good economic growth,'' said
<PERSON>Ms. Zhang</PERSON>. ``It's very hard to see them giving it up.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and Chinese
leader <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON> agreed today to restore friendly ties between
the world's most populous countries despite a long-standing border
dispute.
   ``Welcome, my young friend,'' the 84-year-old senior Chinese
leader said to <LOCATION>Gandhi</LOCATION>, 44, as the two leaders met in the <PERSON>Great Hall</PERSON>
of the People.
   ``Beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as
friends,'' <PERSON>Deng</PERSON> said. ``The two countries' leaders will become
friends, the countries will become friends, the people will become
friends.''
   ``I agree and would like to thank you for your warm welcome,''
<PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said.
   Deng said he knew <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON>, who
came to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in <DATE>1954</DATE>, the last Indian prime minister to do so.
   ``In the considerable period of time in between, there was
unpleasantness with each other,'' <PERSON>Deng</PERSON> said. ``But let us forget it.
We should be looking forward.''
   Later at a speech at presitigious <ORGANIZATION>Qinghua University</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>
summed up the goal of his five-day trip.
   ``I have every hope that during this visit we will, together with
our Chinese friends, build a better political climate for the
solution of the border issue,'' he said.
   In the past, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   ``I am heartened that the Chinese leadership is more than
prepared to put behind us past rancor and past prejudices,'' <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>
said. ``I am heartened that we are both prepared not to be mired in
the past.''
   Chinese-Indian relations were good in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> but a boundary
dispute led the two countries into war in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> rejects
the claim and demands <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> return the 15,200 square miles it took
in the <DATE>1962</DATE> war.
   During <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s visit, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> are expected to sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology. Consular offices in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> may also be
established.
   Little progress is expected on the border.
   Gandhi arrived in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and spent most of the day
meeting with Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON>. His visit marked the first time Indian
and Chinese leaders have met since <DATE>1960</DATE>, when then-Premier <PERSON>Chou
Enlai</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
   Gandhi and Li discussed the border problem and <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> called for
a renewal of friendship between the two nations.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said at a
banquet <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>. ``It is now time to look forward to the
future. It is now time to restore the relationship between our two
countries.''
   In the past, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   Gandhi also discussed <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, trade and the Cambodian conflict
with his Chinese hosts in talks his official spokesman described as
``warm, cordial and very friendly.''
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> met with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON>Yang Shangkun</PERSON>, and
again talked about <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s troubled region of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said his country will not interfere in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s internal
affairs. The issue is sensitive because <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s spiritual leader,
the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, fled to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <DATE>1959</DATE> after an abortive,
anti-Chinese uprising.
   Gandhi was to meet tonight with <PERSON>Zhao Ziyang</PERSON>, general secretary of
the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>. On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, he is to fly to the
ancient city of <LOCATION>Xian</LOCATION> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> he will go to <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> soon after <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1949</DATE> revolution. In the early
<DATE>1960s</DATE>, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements.
   Relations began to improve in the late <DATE>1979s</DATE> but the border
remains heavily guarded. The two countries began border talks in
<DATE>1981</DATE> but have made little progress in eight rounds, the last of
which was held in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has more than 1 billion people. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, the world's largest
democracy, has a population of about 800 million.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <DATE>February 3</DATE>--The German Chancellor, <PERSON>Dr Helmut 
Kohl</PERSON>, today assured the Prime Minister, <PERSON>Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, 
that his country would do everything in its power to boost 
industrial and technological co-operation with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and 
announced that a high-level Indo-German commission on science 
and technology would be set up soon, report <ORGANIZATION>PTI</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>UNI</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Addressing the Indo-German economic conference along with <PERSON>Mr 
Rao</PERSON>, the German Chancellor said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s economic development was 
on the "right course" and acknowledged that there was scope for 
further increasing German investments in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
  <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>, declaring there was "absolutely no hesitation or 
dilution in the commitment to liberalisation," urged German 
industrialists to take "one more determined step" to increase 
the flow of investments, in view of the "ideal opportunity" 
provided by the reforms process in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
  The Prime Minister assured both Indian and German 
industrialists at the conference that he and Dr <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> would solve 
"any problem, if it comes to our level." 
  The two leaders told the delegates that both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> were aware of the vast and untapped potential for 
further deepening and strengthening bilateral economic relations. 
  The federal government and German industry were following 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s policy of reforms with close attention and sympathy and 
"modern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, with its reform-oriented economic policy aimed at 
liberalisation, is one of our most important partners on the 
Asian continent," the German leader told <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>. 
  <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> said further liberalisation to cover some more items 
was on the anvil. The items to be liberalised were those which 
one could think of, he said and added that he could not say a 
syllable more because the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> budget was only three weeks away. 
  <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> welcomed the <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> offensive of the German 
industrialists who are increasingly turning towards the 
Asia-Pacific region for investments. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> have 
been identified as major thrust areas by the newly-launched 
<ORGANIZATION>Asia-Pacific Association</ORGANIZATION> (APA). 
  In his observations, the president of the <ORGANIZATION>Confederation of 
Indian Industry</ORGANIZATION> (CII), <PERSON>Mr Jamshed N. Godrej</PERSON>, announced the 
signing of a memorandum of understanding between <ORGANIZATION>CII</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>BDI</ORGANIZATION> 
(the German federation of industry). 
  <PERSON>Mr Godrej</PERSON> said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> could enter into 
trilateral partnership to exploit the complimentaries and 
individual advantages in areas of skilled manpower, technology 
and industrial sophistication. 
  Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> has told <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> that it would continue to 
adopt a neutral stance on the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> issue and avoid making any 
value judgment in the matter. 
  The issue figured prominently during the talks <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> had 
with German leaders, during which he voiced serious concern over 
the problems his country faced with regard to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s aid to 
terrorists in the Indian border states of <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION>. 
  The issue also figured during the foreign secretary-level 
talks where the Indian foreign secretary, <PERSON>Mr K. Srinivasan</PERSON>, 
briefed his German counterpart on the outcome of the recent 
foreign secretary level talks in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> and the subsequent 
six proposals mooted by <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>." 
  <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> urged <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to sign the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty (NPT), which <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> has refused to comply with, 
arguing that the existing global non-proliferation regimes were 
discriminatory against the developing countries. 
  The German Chancellor reiterated his strong commitment to 
nuclear non-proliferation which he has been consistently and 
resolutely pursuing at all international fora. 
  The German leader told <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> that strengthening the 
existing 
global non-proliferation regimes must take "absolute priority" 
and reiterated his government's resolve for an indefinite 
unconditional extension of the <ORGANIZATION>NPT</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1995</DATE>. 
  The two countries have been engaged in a comprehensive 
dialogue on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and other 
political matters of mutual concept at the foreign office-level 
talks for quite some time. The two sides have already held three 
rounds and the fourth round is due to commence shortly. 
  Three high-level ministerial delegations from <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> will 
visit <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in the first half of the current year. 
  An official spokesman today said these high-level visits, 
which will follow <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>'s current visit, were in line with 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s "new-look" <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> concept unfolded by the Chancellor, Dr 
<PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>. 
  The spokesman said the German development co-operation 
minister would visit <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> next month, followed by the visit of 
the German economic co-operation minister in <DATE>April</DATE>. 
  The German vice-chancellor and foreign affairs minister, <PERSON>Mr 
Klaus Kinkel</PERSON>, is expected to come in <DATE>May</DATE>. 
  The new German perception was that it had put too many eggs 
in the European basket. It now wanted to expand its influence in 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> as well and had identified <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for 
cementing ties, the spokesman said. 
  <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>'s visit, his second to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in less than three 
years, was extremely important because <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had already 
declared <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> "a partner of choice in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>." <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had also 
described its relationship with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> as a "strategic" one. 
  <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s number one and the world's third largest 
economy, till recently used to be the second largest investor in 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, after the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but had gone down to the tenth 
position after <DATE>1990</DATE>. 
  However, trade volume between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had been 
growing steadily and touched nearly 5.5 billion <ORGANIZATION>Deutsche Mark</ORGANIZATION> 
(DM) in <DATE>1992</DATE>. It was anticipated to cross the DM <MONEY>6 billion mark</MONEY> 
in the current financial year. 
  Indian exports to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> have been getting more and more 
sophisticated and diversified.

<LEADPARA>  Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng arrived in India on Wednesday for a six-day
visit aimed at improving relations between the world's two most populous
nations at a time when both are struggling to define their places in the
rapidly changing international order.;   Li's visit, the first by a Chinese
premier in 31 years, is being described by officials of both countries as an
important step in a continuing effort to thaw a relationship that has remained
chilly since the two countries fought a Himalayan border war in 1962. The
recent warming trend began when former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
visited Beijing three years ago.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This week's talks are expected to produce agreements on bilateral
cooperation in space exploration and improved trade ties, including the
reopening of consulates in <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>. But Indian and Chinese
officials say they do not expect any breakthroughs on the main border dispute
between the two countries, which involves unresolved claims to thousands of
square miles of largely uninhabited territory in the Himalayas.;   In
interviews published before <PERSON>Li</PERSON>'s arrival, both the Chinese premier and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
prime minister, <PERSON>P.V. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, emphasized that their countries shared an
interest in asserting themselves internationally at a time when an ascendant
West is moving to shape the post-Cold War order.;   In an apparent gesture to
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, Indian officials arrested about 20 Tibetan democracy advocates before
<PERSON>Li</PERSON>'s arrival and imposed tight security in the capital. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has for decades
provided safe haven to Tibetan exiles, including <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, the
<LOCATION>Dalai Llama</LOCATION>, but had never arrested activists. A number of Tibetan protesters
demonstrated in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> but were unable to get near the

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Alok Mukherjee</PERSON>: "<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, A Priority Area for </F>
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 4</DATE>--The Prime Minister, <PERSON>Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, today began the last leg of his <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> visit. 
Flying into <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> in a German Government plane, the 
Prime Minister's major programme for the day was a meeting with 
the German President, <PERSON>Mr. Richard von Weizsacker</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> also 
had a luncheon meeting with eminent Indologists here, when a 
number of issues to facilitate studies on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> were brought to 
the notice of the Prime Minister. 
  With <PERSON>Mr. Weizsacker</PERSON>, the discussions were general in nature, 
it being basically a courtesy call. The German President is well 
acquainted with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, having been there in <DATE>1991</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr. Weizsacker</PERSON> 
was in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> at the height of its political crisis when the 
minority <PERSON>Chandra Shekar</PERSON> Government was in power and its 
continuance in office was under doubt. This aspect was 
highlighted by the German authorities on many occasions as a 
measure of their commitment to maintain high political relations 
with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, irrespective of the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> in power. 
  In fact, the importance that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> attaches to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has 
been confirmed to the Prime Minister not only by the present 
Government in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, but by the host of Opposition leaders as 
well, who called on <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> during his two-day stay in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>. 
<H5>  `<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> policy' </H5>
  The leaders of the coalition parties in the present 
Government, as well as those from other political parties, have 
also told <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> that the new "<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> policy" of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had a 
national consensus and would be pursued by any Government that 
comes to power after the federal elections in <DATE>October</DATE> this year. 
The "<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> policy" of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> focuses on the entire Asian region 
as the priority area for trade and economic concentration as 
well as for high political contacts. Almost all the countries of 
<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> have been included in the priority list, including <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, but three countries have been identified for 
intensive co-operation--<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
  Parallel meetings conducted by the members of the <ORGANIZATION>Prime 
Ministerial</ORGANIZATION> delegation had also indicated that the <ORGANIZATION>German 
Government</ORGANIZATION> has sent out the signal to its industrialists that 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is now a priority area for investment and that 
concentration should begin. The process has been facilitated by 
the fact that just a few days before <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON>'s visit, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Government of India</ORGANIZATION> relied to a detailed memorandum that was 
submitted by the German Chancellor, <PERSON>Mr. Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, after his 
return from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <DATE>February last year</DATE>. This memorandum listed 
out the various irritants that were obstructing German 
investment in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the response of the Government of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 
had been sought to the points raised. 
  The proposals submitted by the Germans were broadly divided 
into six categories covering the financial sector, the 
pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the power sector, 
telecommunications, air traffic and general issues. The Indian 
response too has been fairly detailed with areas listed out 
where decisions have already been taken. The pending areas 
include liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry, removal of phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy, 
increase in the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations, amendments to the 
Industrial Disputes Act and removal of the condition that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> has also indicated that it is not in a 
position to agree to the suggestion for a negative list of 
imports, an uniform industrial policy in all the States, 
abolition of octroi and automatic adoption of environmental 
standards prescribed in advanced countries. 
<H5>  Joint Ventures </H5>
  Individual interactions between the Prime Minister and chief 
executive officesr of multinational corporations too have 
confirmed that German industry was now positive about investment 
in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. For instance, the representative of <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes Benz</ORGANIZATION> said 
that a passenger car project was being finalised with the <ORGANIZATION>Tata</ORGANIZATION> 
group which would make the project one of the major investments 
by <ORGANIZATION>Benz</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> group will be setting 
up two power projects in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>--one at Jayamkondan with a 
capacity of 1,500 MW [megawatts] and another at <LOCATION>Gandhar</LOCATION> of 600 
MW capacity. Another multinational, <ORGANIZATION>BASF</ORGANIZATION> is setting up a 
chemicals factory in <LOCATION>Mangalore</LOCATION> for the manufacture of dyestuff.

  [Text] <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 7</DATE>--<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> has responded favourably 
to the Indian request for greater access to German technology 
and to its middle-level industry for partnership. 
  The Germans have also reassured the Prime Minister, <PERSON>Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, during his just-concluded visit to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> of 
clear political support for German programmes aimed at expanding 
Indo-German economic cooperation. The German Chancellor, <PERSON>Dr 
Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, has conveyed his intention to nominate one of his 
ministerial-level colleagues to monitor the progress of economic 
cooperation and to remove obstacles, if any, in the process. 
  Both the countries have also agreed to synchronise their 
efforts for further democratisation of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, to 
reflect the existing ground realities, including expansion of 
the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> by increasing the number of permanent 
members with veto. Both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> are keen for a place 
in the extended <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> with veto power. 
  In the next few months three high-level delegations from 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, each headed by a minister such as the Minister for 
Development, Minister for Economic Cooperation and Foreign 
Minister are slated to visit <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to provide fresh impetus to 
growing Indo-German cooperation in various fields. 
  According to official sources in the <ORGANIZATION>External Affairs 
Ministry</ORGANIZATION>, in the context of German view of playing an important 
role in world affairs, <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> has formulated a priority programme, 
"<LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> concept policy," for opening itself up towards "high 
growth" Asian countries like <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. The market 
in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was not considered to be sufficient to meet 
the growing German capabilities in fields like science, 
technology, economic, investment abroad. 
  These sources are quite optimistic that in the near future 
large-scale German investments could be expected in various 
spheres of cooperative economic interaction for mutual benefit 
and advantage, though it is "very difficult to quantify" the 
outcome of the visit so early. 
  However, <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> himself said that he was satisfied with the 
outcome of his German visit. 
  These sources further pointed out that the reception the 
Prime Minister received in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> was much warmer and greater 
than the one he received during his first visit in <DATE>September 
1991</DATE>. 
  These sources asserted that during the Prime Minister's 
talks 
with German leaders at no point the issue of nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) figured. Thus a report circulated 
by some news agency to say that the issue figured during the 
talks was totally baseless. The sources further stated that the 
German official sources also denied having given any such 
briefing at all.

talks the prime minister, <PERSON>Mr. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, had with the German 
leaders in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>. The prime minister explained to them the 
problems faced by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> due to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s abetment of terrorism 
in <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Narasimha Rao</PERSON> also 
apprised the German leaders of the serious threat posed to the 
country's unity and integrity from cross-border terrorism. The 
prime minister said <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is deliberately creating conditions 
for not having a meaningful dialogue. He also informed them 
about the confidence-building measures his government had taken 
in the past toward good neighborly relations with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>. 
  The issue also figured prominently during the foreign 
secretary-level talks in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>. The Indian side told the Germans 
about the setting up of the commission to look into the 
allegations of human rights abuses and permission given to the 
Amnesty International to visit the country. Attention was also 
drawn to the threat by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> to move an anti-India resolution 
at the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> session on human rights. <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> sought 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s help to thwart the attempt. Bonn assured that the 
anti-Indian motion on <ORGANIZATION>Kashmir</ORGANIZATION> will not serve any useful purpose. 
Both countries also called for wider representation in the <ORGANIZATION>UN 
Security Council</ORGANIZATION> to ensure the political effectiveness of the 
collective will of international community. Both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> are aspirants of a permanent seat in the council.

<HEAD>India, China Agree To Set Up Group To Discuss Border Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> have agreed to establish a group
to take up their thorny border dispute following discussions with
visiting Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>
announced today.
   Ministry spokesman <PERSON>Li Zhaoxing</PERSON>, speaking at the end of <ORGANIZATION>Gandhi</ORGANIZATION>'s
visit to the Chinese capital, also said good will fostered by the
trip could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the near
future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> since
his grandfather <PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON> in <DATE>1954</DATE>, left <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> for the
ancient capital of <LOCATION>Xian</LOCATION> <TIME>this afternoon</TIME> following three days of talks
with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s top leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph and declared that the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute, which exploded into a short war in <DATE>1962</DATE> and
since has poisoned relations between the world's two most populous
nations, was the most pressing topic in <LOCATION>Gandhi</LOCATION>'s talks with Premier
<PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> and other senior leaders.
   Spokesman Li, speaking at a news conference, said:
   ``Thanks to the visit, the Sino-Indian history of relations now
ushers in a new period. Leaders of the two countries conducted
sincere and in-depth discussions on the border question between
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, which are conducive to reaching a solution on the
boundary question in the near future.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister-level
and will be like a joint commission.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> have held eight rounds of talks in the past seven
years on the border, but there has been no formal structure to the
meetings, which have achieved little or no progress.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
<LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> says is northeast <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s Arunachal Pradesh province.
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> says <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   Gandhi and the Chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the
boundary question. ``The border issue is very complicated,'' <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>
said at a <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> news conference. ``We can't expect instant
solutions.''
   The symbolic restoration of friendly ties dominated the <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>
trip, although the two sides added some substance today by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for direct flights between <LOCATION>New
Delhi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and two other accords.
   The two sides also signed a three-year cultural exchange
agreement and a science and technology accord promoting contacts
between their scientific communities.
   Gandhi also is to tour <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Friday</DATE>. The two sides are to issue a joint communique when he
departs.

   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that it and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will
establish a group to tackle a border dispute that flared into a
brief war in <DATE>1962</DATE> and has poisoned relations between the world's
most populous nations ever since.
   The agreement was announced at the end of Indian Prime Minister
<PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>'s historic visit to the Chinese capital. Foreign
Ministry spokesman <PERSON>Li Zhaoxing</PERSON> also said good will fostered by the

   Both sides declared the visit a triumph, and declared the

   The border dispute exploded into a short war 26 years ago and has
since kept the nations apart. It was the most pressing topic in
<LOCATION>Gandhi</LOCATION>'s talks with Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> and other senior leaders.
   <PERSON>Li Zhaoxing</PERSON>, speaking at a news conference, said, ``thanks to the

   He said the two sides ``agreed to establish a joint working
group, which is specially devoted to the boundary question.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister level.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> have held eight rounds of talks since <DATE>1981</DATE> on the

said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. ``We can't expect instant solutions.''
   Gandhi's trip to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> brings a new era of detente to
Sino-Indian relations that is likely to be followed next year by a
visit by Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>. The <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> visit
will formally end 30 years of political strain and distrust between
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.

   Indian Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> put aside the
affairs of state for some sightseeing <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, a day after talks
with Chinese leaders on a border dispute and other issues that have
divided the world's two most populous nations.
   No breakthroughs were reported on the border issue, which led to
war in <DATE>1962</DATE>.
   Gandhi also discussed <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, trade and the Cambodian conflict in
the <DATE>Monday</DATE> talks which his official spokesman described as ``warm,
cordial and very friendly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chinese Premier <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> met most of <DATE>Monday</DATE> following
<ORGANIZATION>Gandhi</ORGANIZATION>'s arrival from <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> for a five-day visit to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Xian</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>. Gandhi and his wife, <PERSON>Sonia</PERSON>, were later treated to
a state banquet at which Li acted as host.
   Gandhi's grandfather, <PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON>, was the last Indian
leader to travel to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, going to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> in <DATE>1954</DATE>. Chinese and
Indian leaders last met in <DATE>1960</DATE>, when then-Premier Chou En-lai went
to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> toured the <ORGANIZATION>Temple of Heaven</ORGANIZATION>, a 15th century
structure where <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s emperors once prayed for good harvests and
performed sacrificial rituals.
   In the <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, he was to travel 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>,
the capital, to the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The
3,720-mile-long barrier was built over 2,000 years to keep out
invaders from the north.
   Gandhi's only scheduled meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was with 81-year-old
President <PERSON>Yang Shangkun</PERSON>, a former senior army leader who took over
the largely ceremonial state post <DATE>last April</DATE>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> is to meet 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON>Deng
Xiaoping</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party General</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Zhao Ziyang</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology. Consular offices
in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> may also be established.
   In comments throughout <DATE>Monday</DATE>, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> and <PERSON>Li</PERSON> said Chinese-Indian
relations should follow a two-track policy of solving the border
dispute and improving other areas of their relationship.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said at the
banquet. ``It is now time to look forward to the future. It is now
time to restore the relationship between our two countries.''
   The pronouncements appeared to signal a change in Indian policy,
bringing it more in line with that of the Chinese. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> said in the
past it would improve Indian-Chinese ties only after progress was
made on the border.
   Western diplomats said last week that <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s political worries
and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s external problems could have sparked the change.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is improving its relations with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and
maintains strong relations with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s traditional enemy
on its northeastern border.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s strong international position may have convinced <LOCATION>New
Delhi</LOCATION> to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, the
diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At home, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> faces an election year next year in which victory
is by no means assured.
   Li also praised <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s position on the restive region of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>,
which <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> recognizes as part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   The Indian spokesman also said <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> and Li discussed <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>,
but he refused to elaborate. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> recognizes the current government
of <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>, which was installed by <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> after the <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION>
government invaded the country in <DATE>December 1978</DATE>. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> supports
Cambodian resistance groups.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> soon after <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1949</DATE> revolution. In the early
<DATE>1960s</DATE>, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements. The border remains heavily guarded despite eight
rounds of Indian-Chinese talks on the question since <DATE>1981</DATE>, the last
of which took place in <DATE>November 1987</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> says <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> should return 15,200 square miles of territory
it took in the <DATE>1962</DATE> war.

<DESCRIPT>  INDIA; GOVERNMENT; CONTROVERSY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  With the dominant Congress Party set to form a new government, a major power
struggle erupted Tuesday over the prime minister's job that pits the frail
party president against a younger, influential regional leader from the
business capital, Bombay.;    Meeting through the day and evening in closed
sessions at party headquarters and at various hotels, party officials were
faced Tuesday night with a potentially bruising clash between P.V. Narasimha
Rao, the 70-year-old former Cabinet minister who stepped into the party's
presidency after the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and Sharad
Pawar, the tough, pragmatic, 51-year-old chief minister of India's key
industrial state, Maharashtra. Although Rao is favored, Pawar is staging a
dogged fight.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  INDIA'S CONGRESS PARTY PLAGUED BY INFIGHTING
OVER GANDHI POST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At issue between the two men are less their ideologies, which are centrist,
than their personalities and styles, which are strikingly different.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Pawar</ORGANIZATION>, who has said in the past that he abhors "the social and political
culture in <LOCATION>Delhi</LOCATION>," the capital, is a highly successful regional politician
with a reputation for toughness and an ability to raise <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>
for the party in the state and nation among businessmen in <LOCATION>Bombay.</LOCATION>;    <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>, on
the other hand, is an ailing, soft-spoken leader who has no political base and
few enemies, an intellectual whose critics say he would be too pliant to the
various factions in the party, thereby leaving the nation adrift for six
months to a year until new elections are called. Among those favoring <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> are
the so-called coterie of aides to <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>, a group that <PERSON>Pawar</PERSON> is known to
detest.;    By <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>, at least 40 members of Parliament who are
believed to be supporters of Pawar demanded, in a statement, that lawmakers be
"left free" to elect their leader and that the party "opt for the democratic
process of election.";    Implicit in the somewhat unusual statement was
concern by <ORGANIZATION>Pawar</ORGANIZATION>'s supporters that the <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> bosses as well as the
former aides to <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> were seeking to steamroll the appointment of <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>, a
former foreign minister who served under <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> as well as his mother, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.;    The debate comes as the party, which has ruled
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> for 40 out of 44 years, prepared to return to power after emerging as
the front-runner in the nation's 10th parliamentary election. Projected to win
about 210 to 215 seats in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION>, out of 511, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is now in the midst
of talks with left-of-center parties to forge a coalition that would enable it
to form a government.;    With Parliament set to resume on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> leadership is working under a deadline in which it will either
choose the leader and present the choice as a fait accompli to lawmakers, or
leave it up to the rank-and-file members of the party, who are seeking a
stronger voice in the control of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s dominant party after <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>'s
death.  </TEXT>

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 6</DATE>--On the completion of the 
week-long foreign visit to <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, the Prime 
Minister, <PERSON>Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, returned home today, highly 
satisfied with the interactions with political and business 
leaders. 
  Declining to address the customary on-board conference on 
his 
special aircraft, <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> just told presspersons in his 
delegation that "you have seen how the visit went off. I don't 
think I have anything more to add." 
  The task of elaborating on the Prime Minister's successful 
trip was left to the top officials who accompanied him, 
including his Principal Secretary, <PERSON>Mr. A.N. Verma</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Finance 
Secretary</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia</PERSON> and the Foreign Secretary, 
<PERSON>Mr. K. Srinivasan</PERSON>. These officials drew attention to some of the 
significant aspects of the Prime Ministerial visit both in terms 
of economic and political content. 
  On the economic front, there were two factors which emerged 
from the visit. In <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION> for instance, <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> chose the 
gathering of world business leaders to clarify <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s position 
that it would go along on the path of economic reforms, but 
would choose its own pace and direction. 
<H5>  Pressure Resisted </H5>
  The insistent pressure on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to speed up the reforms 
process has been resisted by the assertion that the country 
would not blindly follow the prescriptions laid down by "people 
sitting thousands of miles away, but would instead choose its 
own model of development, suited to its genius and 
circumstances." In other words, potential foreign investors have 
been assured of the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to the reforms 
process but with the caution that all their demands would not be 
met. 
  "There is a standard check-list with these people before 
they 
take investment decisions. Has the country de-regulated; has it 
lowered tariff barriers; has it privatised (meaning the public 
sector); has it liberalised labour laws, etc. We have said "Yes" 
to some of these points and "No" to the others. That is our 
position and it has been made clear to the investors what to 
expect from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>," a senior official said. 
  That the Indian official position this year could be 
different from what it was in <DATE>1992</DATE>--the Prime Minister's first 
visit to <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION>--is obviously based on the stronger economic 
position today. With foreign exchange reserves of over <MONEY>$10 
billions</MONEY>, with a large number of proposals for foreign direct 
investment being cleared and with buoyant foreign institutional 
investment in the stock markets, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> could afford to take a 
stronger stand at <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION> this time, the official added. This 
strong economic position is reinforced by the fact that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is 
now definitely on the "investment radar screen" of most 
industrial groups, particularly with the collapse of the 
expectations that had arisen with the changes in <LOCATION>eastern Europe</LOCATION> 
two years ago. 
  "The euphoria about <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is over. The other markets don't 
show much prospects. The Asian region and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> are the few 
bright spots for investors and most of them are aware that they 
should be in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in the medium term. This is the message we 
got in <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION>," the official added. 
<H5>  Industry, Government Mix </H5>
  The second important development of the Prime Ministerial 
visit is the new relationship established between <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> and 
industry. This was evident not only in <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION> but also in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
where the inter-mixing of the official and industrial delegation 
was so much that the entire entourage of industrial leaders 
practically became part of the Prime Minister's delegation. 
  The meeting between Indian and German industrialists in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> 
was held in the office of the German Chancellor, <PERSON>Mr. Helmut 
Kohl</PERSON>. "This is unprecedented. Never has the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> [<ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation</ORGANIZATION>] room of the Chancellor's office been thrown 
open for an industrial meet," the Indian Ambassador in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. 
K.S. Rana</PERSON>, pointed out. The second point to note was that at 
this meeting, where <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mr. Kohl</PERSON> were present, the top 
bureaucrats of the Government of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> literally took a back 
seat and were seated behind the Indian industrial delegation. 
"This too has never happened before. Imagine the <ORGANIZATION>Finance 
Secretary</ORGANIZATION> sitting behind an industrialist," one official pointed 
out. 
  "The industrialists were given the signal that they were as 
much important in selling <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> as an investment destination as 
the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION>. This close relationship between <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> and 
industry is a new development, unlike in the past when 
officialdom maintained a distance from industry," the official 
said. 
<H5>  Politically Significant </H5>
  On the political front too, <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON>'s second visit to 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
in a little over two years is of much significance. As is known, 
this is an election year in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, including that for the 
<ORGANIZATION>Federal Chancellery</ORGANIZATION> and going by indications available now, <PERSON>Mr. 
Kohl</PERSON> faces an extremely difficult task in getting re-elected. 
His bane has been the economy, which has come under severe 
pressure with the unification of West and <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>, an 
achievement for which <PERSON>Mr. Kohl</PERSON> had taken the entire credit in 
the past. 
  Today, there is over 10 per cent unemployment in the 
country, 
the economy is expected to grow at zero per cent and interest 
rates are too high for fresh investment. In short, the economy 
is in recession and is burdened by the continuing cost of 
reconstruction of the eastern parts. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON>'s singular political achievement with this visit has 
been the establishment of a rapport with the entire political 
spectrum in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. The packed schedule that the Prime Minister 
had in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> was marked for the more meetings he had with 
<ORGANIZATION>Opposition</ORGANIZATION> political leaders against the one meeting with <PERSON>Mr. 
Kohl</PERSON>. Moreover, the message that <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> got from these meetings 
was that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> would continue to be a priority area for <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, 
irrespective of the Government that comes to office after the 
<DATE>October</DATE> elections. 
  "The <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> Policy of <PERSON>Mr. Kohl</PERSON> has national support and this 
has been confirmed by the political leaders who met the Prime 
Minister. Thus, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> would remain a partner of choice and the 
strategic partnership between the two countries would remain 
unaltered even with political changes in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. This assurance 
has been received by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>," another top official in the Prime 
Ministerial entourage said.

<FÊP=106> [Report signed "sm": "Installation Constructers Hope for </F>
Large-Scale Orders"] 
  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, 31 <DATE>January</DATE> -- Economic relations will be 
the focal issue of a four-day visit to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION>Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao</ORGANIZATION> to begin on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [2 <DATE>February</DATE>]. 
German companies hope this visit will support their efforts to 
get large-scale orders from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. In return, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> is working 
for German investment on the subcontinent. 
  One of the central issues of the talks in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> is the 
participation of German companies in expanding the power supply 
in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. This involves orders worth double-digit billion sums. 
Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION>Indian Energy Minister Salve</ORGANIZATION> explained to leading 
German installation constructors in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> his government's plans 
for expanding the energy supply. According to him, new 
construction is planned of seven conventional power stations 
with a capacity of 5,500 megawatts and an investment of <MONEY>12 
billion German marks</MONEY>. In addition, seven existing power 
stations are to be modernized, that is, to be equipped with 
modern environmental technology. Furthermore, it is planned to 
expand <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s mains distribution. [passage omitted] 
  During his visit to <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> will take time for a 
"German-Indian economic conference," and for individual talks 
with the directors of <ORGANIZATION>Hoechst</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>BASF</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Mercedes</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> as 
well as with <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Ferdinand Piech</PERSON>. 
  The political talks with Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, Foreign 
Minister <PERSON>Klaus Kinkel</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> Chairman 
<PERSON>Rudolf Scharping</PERSON> will focus primarily on coordinating a joint 
route toward the goal of the two countries getting permanent 
seats on the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION>. The Germans will also be 
urging <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to sign the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty</ORGANIZATION>.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- After warnings from 
<LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> because of the conflict between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai 
Lama</ORGANIZATION>, the Tibetan leader, has declined an invitation to the 
1,200th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION>Frankfurt/Main</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> had 
warned the city that the simultaneous invitation of the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai 
Lama</ORGANIZATION> and the mayor of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION>'s Chinese partner city of 
<LOCATION>Guangzhou</LOCATION> could lead to "problems." On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> [16 <DATE>February</DATE>] 
the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>'s Swiss representative office declined the 
invitation that <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Andreas von Schoeler</PERSON> (Social 
Democratic Party of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>) had extended to the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, who 
lives in exile in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. 
  The 58-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> winner is calling for the 
reestablishment of the autonomous status of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, which is 
under Chinese sovereignty. The statement of the Tibetan office 
in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> had been very sorry to hear that 
his acceptance of the invitation had led to problems that had 
been created without his fault "as a result of obviously 
political motives." He wants to spare the city and its 
population difficulties. He had been pleased with the 
invitation, it was stated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> (DPA) -- In his talk with Indian Prime 
Minister <PERSON>P.V. Narisimha Rao</PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> called on 
German industry to make more investments on the subcontinent, 
which is inhabited by 900 million people. On <DATE>Thursday</DATE> [3 
<DATE>February</DATE>], the second day of his visit to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, which will 
last four days, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> met in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON>Klaus 
Kinkel</PERSON> (Free Democratic Party of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>) and was then received 
by Kohl with military honors in front of the Chancellor's Office. 
  It has been said that in the political part of this talk 
with 
<PERSON>Rao</PERSON>, <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> clearly expressed the Western community interest in 
having <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Kohl had 
broached this topic already during his visit to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> last 
<DATE>February</DATE>. During this visit representatives of German and 
Indian industry signed an agreement on building two conventional 
power plants with an order value of <MONEY>5.6 billion German marks</MONEY>. 
  After the political exchange of opinion, <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> and Rao opened 
a German-Indian economic conference in the <ORGANIZATION>Chancellor's Office</ORGANIZATION>, 
which is under the patronage of the "Asia-Pacific Committee" of 
German industry. Kohl cited the focal issues of cooperation, 
which he sees as part of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Government</ORGANIZATION>'s Asian concept. 
The dialogue of the consultation forum, which was established 
during <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE>, must be continued 
with representatives of industry, science, and members of the 
governments. Kohl announced that a German-Indian committee for 
science and technology, which will be staffed with high-ranking 
officials from both states, will soon start its work. 
  Kohl pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION>FRG</ORGANIZATION> is currently <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s second 
most important supplier and its fourth most important sales 
market. "Our investments in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> are remarkable, but they 
could still increase," the chancellor said. The deregulation 
and liberalization of the Indian economy also plays a big role 
in that. The successful conclusion of the <ORGANIZATION>GATT</ORGANIZATION> round is of 
great importance for the further development of the 
German-Indian economic relations. 
  On the first day of <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s visit the <ORGANIZATION>Fraunhofer Society</ORGANIZATION> for 
the <ORGANIZATION>Promotion of Applied Research</ORGANIZATION> and the "Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research" had signed an agreement on cooperation 
in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and 
environmental research. 
  The Indian prime minister's schedule also included meetings 
with the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION>Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Free Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag</ORGANIZATION> 
groups as well as a continuation of the exchange of views with 
leading representatives of German industry. On <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> will 
receive <PERSON>Rudolf Scharping</PERSON>, minister-president of 
<LOCATION>Rhineland-Palatinate</LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> 
of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, before he goes to <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, where he will be welcomed 
by President <PERSON>Richard von Weizsaecker</PERSON>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <DATE>June 3</DATE> KYODO -- The Chinese Government 
will soon allow the young spiritual head of the Kagyu sect of 
Tibetan Buddhism to make his first visit to his seat in <LOCATION>Rumtek</LOCATION> 
monastery in <LOCATION>northeast India</LOCATION>, sources belonging to the sect said 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> [2 <DATE>June</DATE>]. 
  The 11-year-old <PERSON>Ugyen Thinley Dorjee</PERSON>, whose identity as the 
reincarnation of the sect's 16th karmapa was revealed in <DATE>1992</DATE>, 
currently lives in the sect's former headquarters in <LOCATION>Tsurphu</LOCATION> 
monastery, some 50 kilometers from the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION>Lhasa</LOCATION>. 
  "The <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to allow the new karmapa 
to go to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> for a brief visit," the sources said. The timing 
and duration of the visit is still unknown, they said. 
  A high-level team of lamas, including <PERSON>Tai Situ Rimponche</PERSON> who 
was largely responsible for the discovery of the sect's 17th 
living god, returned to the Indian capital of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> after 
successful negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>last 
week of May</DATE>, the sources said. 
  The reincarnation of the 16th karmapa was found with Chinese 
help through a prediction letter which <PERSON>Tai Situ Rimpoche</PERSON>, a 
regent of the last karmapa, discovered in <DATE>1989</DATE> almost a decade 
after the last karmapa's death. 
  All 15 karmapas since <DATE>1193</DATE> were identified in their 
childhood 
on the basis of prediction letters left by their predecessors. 
  However, a rival group of lamas questioning the authenticity 
of the letter this <DATE>March</DATE> enthroned a 10-year-old Tibetan boy, 
<PERSON>Tenzin Chentse</PERSON>, in a Buddhist monastery in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> claiming he 
is the last karmapa's true reincarnation. 
  According to a Tibetan follower of the sect, it is the first 
time that two karmapas have been enthroned, although numerous 
succession struggles have occurred throughout the sect's 
900-year history. 
  Both vie for control over <LOCATION>Rumtek</LOCATION> monastery, which became the 
sect's center after the last Karmapa fled <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> during the <DATE>1959</DATE> 
uprising. The karmapa is considered No. 3 in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s 
religio-political hierarchy after the dalai lama and the panchen 
lama. 
  By retaining the new karmapa in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> is trying to 
calm the restive Tibetan populace there, one expert on <ORGANIZATION>Tibet</ORGANIZATION> 
said. 
  Beijing needs a religious figure compliant to its policies, 
with the panchen lama dead in early <DATE>1989</DATE> and no successor in 
sight, and the dalai lama remaining in his self-imposed Indian 
exile, he said.

<TEXT>
CSO 

  [Text] <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is in the agonising process of an evaluation 
whether the Prime Minister, <PERSON>Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, should 
call-off or postpone his proposed visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, 
sometime in <DATE>summer</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of External Affairs</ORGANIZATION> itself is 
sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly 
advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the 
vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would 
help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove 
growing misunderstandings on a host of issues. 
  If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks 
by the American President, <PERSON>Mr Bill Clinton</PERSON>, and his aides, it is 
evident that they do not see <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> requiring any high-level 
attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two 
decades. No American President visited <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> since <PERSON>Mr Jimmy 
Carter</PERSON>, nor for that matter has any <ORGANIZATION>Secretary of State</ORGANIZATION> come in 
the past decade. There do not seem to be any plans for any 
visits in the near future either. 
  The Americans have even managed without an Ambassador to 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Basically, there is a love-hate relationship between 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. But all the loving and hating is 
done by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> only. 
  Be that as it may, there are those who feel that the recent 
spate of provocative statements from the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and the 
<ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> makes it all the more imperative for <PERSON>Mr 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON> to meet the top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> leadership and other opinion 
makers in the country. They point out that such 
misunderstandings can only be sorted out at the highest 
political level and the Prime Minister would be making a mistake 
if he did not do so because of false prestige. 
  If indeed, as is widely believed here, certain key aides of 
President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> were responsible for pushing this 
administration towards a hostile position vis-a-vis <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, a 
personal encounter between him and <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> may well restore the 
balance. Moreover, Prime Minister <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> would also have the 
opportunity in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to meet influential Congressmen, 
Senators, officials, academics and journalists to explain <LOCATION>New 
Delhi</LOCATION>'s case on <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 
(NPT) and a host of other contentious issues. 
  Those who support <PERSON>Mr Narasimha Rao</PERSON>'s going to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> are 
convinced that he would get strong backing from the business 
lobby there which is keen to invest in this country because of 
the economic liberalisation. The Prime Minister himself is 
perceived as the chief sponsor of the reform policy and this 
should enable him [to] project a progressive image of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as a counter to anti-Indian propaganda about 
human rights violations in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION> as well as on 
nuclear proliferation in the sub-continent. 
  Comparisons are being drawn with the political leadership in 
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> which has managed to deflect criticism on the human 
rights front by luring big American business with tempting 
investment prospects in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. A similar gambit by <PERSON>Narasimha 
Rao</PERSON>, it is argued, could yield handsome dividends with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
businessmen pressurising the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> Administration to stop 
making provocative statements and gestures against this country. 
  The other argument in favour of the proposed visit by <PERSON>Mr 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON> is that if he refused to go to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> out of 
pique with the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration, it would only allow 
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>--its Prime Minister, <PERSON>Ms Benazir Bhutto</PERSON>, is also 
scheduled to visit the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> within a few months--a free 
propaganda run. It is felt that <PERSON>Ms Bhutto</PERSON> would then use this to 
project <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> as inflexible and recalcitrant on issues like 
<LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NPT</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Those who are against the Prime Minister going to 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, 
however, turn these arguments on their head. They point out that 
in diplomacy, timing is almost everything and at a time when 
there is so much suspicion and misunderstanding between 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, a Prime Ministerial visit could be 
counterproductive with only the differences between two 
countries getting articulated. 
  Conventional wisdom would suggest that the overall impact on 
bilateral relations of the sustained barrage of negative 
pronouncements on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION>Clinton Administration</ORGANIZATION>, 
including the President himself, cannot be healed by a mere 
visit to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Mr Narasimha Rao</PERSON>. In fact, there is a 
possibility of both sides being unduly sensitive about working 
out a compromise at the moment. 
  There is also the question of personal vibes between <PERSON>Mr 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President. Both leaders come from 
different generations and cultures with clashing styles and 
world views. 
  While it is possible that a leader like <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> may 
have 
hit it off with President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, this appears to be far more 
unlikely in the case of Prime Minister <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>. Even if there are no 
open hostilities, there is every chance that a personal 
encounter between the two would be lacklustre and per-functory, 
resulting in no diplomatic breakthrough. 
  <PERSON>Mr Narasimha Rao</PERSON>'s mild professorial style, however 
impressive to the knowledgeable on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> affairs, is also 
unlikely to attract much media attention in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
This may lead to unfavourable comparisons with <PERSON>Ms Bhutto</PERSON>'s visit 
which is bound to cause more flutter in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media. 
  In any case, the flamboyant young <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> educated leader 
has 
many more personal friends in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> establishment, 
particularly in the <ORGANIZATION>Clinton Administration</ORGANIZATION>. Under the 
circumstances, <PERSON>Mr Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, if he goes to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, would 
be running a patently unequal race with his Pakistani 
counterpart. 
  Significantly, most officials both in the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> and 
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) are palpably unenthusiastic 
about <PERSON>Mr Narasimha Rao</PERSON> visiting <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> at this point. While 
the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> is worried about the risk of an unsuccessful 
Prime Ministerial visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> further 
complicating the already vexed triangular relationship between 
<LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>PMO</ORGANIZATION> is apprehensive 
about the political repurcussions at home in the event of <PERSON>Mr 
Narasimha Rao</PERSON> failing to pull off a public relations coup with 
President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>. 
  There is a vast body of opinion-makers in this country 
today, 
including the national media, which closely follows the progress 
of Indo-U.S. ties under a microscope. Not surprisingly, the 
success or failure of <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON>'s visit in all probability would be 
exaggerated beyond its real implications for the relationship 
between the two countries. 
  While in the long run, whether the Prime Minister goes ahead 
or not with his trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> may have far less 
impact on bilateral ties than other factors. <PERSON>Mr Rao</PERSON> would have 
to carefully weigh the pros and cons before agreeing to fix 
dates for the proposed visit. 
  This has posed a serious dilemma for the Prime Minister who 
has been pressing for a visit to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for the past many 
months. A successful trip, besides restoring balance to 
Indo-U.S. ties, would add yet another diplomatic feather to <PERSON>Mr 
Rao</PERSON>'s cap already embroidered with recent breakthroughs in 
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Davos</LOCATION>. 
  A failure or even a damp squib in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, on the other 
hand, would not only mean a personal loss of face for Prime 
Minister <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> but also further add to the mounting strident 
anti-U.S. chorus in this country.

<FÊP=106> [Article by <PERSON>Alok Mukherjee</PERSON>: "<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> Will Stay Neutral on </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>, <DATE>Feb. 3</DATE>--<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has conveyed to the German 
Government the latest position in the bilateral talks with 
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> at the Foreign Secretary level, held in <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> this 
<DATE>January</DATE> and the follow-up in terms of exchange of "Non-papers." 
  At <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s request, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has given a summary of the 
discussions that took place. Also handed over are copies of two 
non-papers presented by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>, including the one on 
plebiscite in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION>, which were subsequently rejected by 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, and the six Indian proposals pertaining to 
confidence-building measures aimed at improving bilateral 
relations. 
  These documents were handed over during the Foreign 
Secretary-level discussions here on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. The Indian side 
was led by the new Foreign Secretary, <PERSON>Mr. K. Srinivasan</PERSON>, who 
flew into <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> to be part of the Prime Ministerial delegation. 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s discussions were the fourth in a series of talks 
structured by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> for closer political contacts. 
The earlier three rounds were conducted by the then Foreign 
Secretary, <PERSON>Mr. J.N. Dixit</PERSON>, and his predecessor, <PERSON>Mr. Muchkund 
Dubey</PERSON>. 
  Though maintaining a neutral stance on <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and 
Indo-Pakistan relations in general, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is interested in 
seeing an early resolution of the problem and improvement in 
ties between <LOCATION>Delhi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>. The same dilemma confronts 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> over <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s strident propaganda against <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> on the 
question of alleged human rights abuses. 
  The talks here took notice of the shrill speech by the 
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> Prime Minister, <PERSON>Ms. Benazir Bhutto</PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights 
Conference</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, when <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> conveyed its 
displeasure at the Pakistani move to try and get a resolution 
passed against it. The Indian side has conveyed to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> what 
<LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>'s attitude would be if the resolution is indeed moved 
and the consequences. 
  In response, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, typically, remained non-committal, 
saying it was neutral on the issue and added that moving such a 
resolution would not help in improving Indo-Pakistan bilateral 
relations. 
  The other matter that came up for discussion pertained to 
the 
restructuring of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> already filed 
papers for election as a non-permanent member in the <ORGANIZATION>Security 
Council</ORGANIZATION> and solicited Indian support. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> kept its options 
open, saying many others had filed papers and a final decision 
on supporting a particular country would be taken later. The 
decision would, of course, depend on the status of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 
bilateral relations with the contending countries, it was said. 
  Strategic alliance: According to observers, the 
significance of the Prime Minister, <PERSON>Mr Narasimha Rao</PERSON>'s visit to 
this country twice within a short span of two years is part of a 
strategic alliance <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> want to form. While trade 
and economic exchanges are in the forefront of such an alliance, 
the political aspect is equally significant. 
  <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, on the other hand, is keen on taking advantage of 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s new <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> policy under which it wants to focus on the 
continent with emphasis on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, 
therefore, wants closer political contacts with an emerging 
global power as well as one of the key nations of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 
  The idea is to have greater interaction so that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> will 
have a better perception of the Indian position on various 
thorny issues, including <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and human rights, which are 
being internationalised. The fact that <PERSON>Mr. Kohl</PERSON> in particular 
and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in general enjoy a good rapport with the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> administration under <PERSON>Mr. Bill Clinton</PERSON> is also taken note 
of. 
  To keep up political contacts, with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> a series of 
bilateral visits has been planned for the current year, though 
this is year of elections, also involving the offices of 
President and Chancellor, are to be held in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. 
  Talks at the level of officials are also on for finalising 
treaties on double taxation avoidance and extradition and a 
bilateral agreement for investment guarantee.

<FÊP=106> [Editorial: "<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s Goodwill Gesture"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese ambassador, <PERSON>Mr Cheng Ruisheng</PERSON>'s 
statement, that <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> is soon likely to officially recognise 
<LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION>'s merger with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, is further good tidings for <LOCATION>New 
Delhi</LOCATION> and indicates that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> can now look forward to the 
dividends of last year's agreement which marked a departure from 
past hostility between the two countries. Ever since <PERSON>Indira 
Gandhi</PERSON>'s decision to make the "Protectorate" of <LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION> a State 
of the Republic in <DATE>1975</DATE>, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> has steadfastly questioned the 
legality of the annexation. More than the technicality of the 
Himalayan kingdom's merger with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and whether or not a 
sovereign nation had been subjugated, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> was bothered by 
the disappearance of a buffer between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. After 
all, <LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION> had been the gateway to <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> and its merger with 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> meant pushing the Indian frontier that much forward. 
Indeed, Chinese unhappiness with the turn of the events was 
reflected in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s refusal to acknowledge <LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION> as a part 
of the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Union</ORGANIZATION>, a view which has been repeatedly expressed 
over the years. 
  It was <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> that led to a softening 
in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s stand on <LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION> insofar as any official mention of 
the protectorate's merger with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was concerned. It is 
possible that the Chinese political leadership remained unhappy 
with the merger, but it refrained from striking public postures 
on the issue. Two factors have since contributed to the removal 
of doubts in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> about <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s motives behind granting 
<LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION> statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 
last year which led to the Sino- Indian agreement on maintaining 
peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and, 
second, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s interest in forging a regional front to prevent 
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> from meddling in Asian affairs. Both the factors have 
contributed towards an upswing in Sino-Indian relations to the 
detriment of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s hegemonistic designs in the region, an 
added spinoff being the weakening of the Pakistan-China axis. 
  True, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s official recognition of <LOCATION>Sikkim</LOCATION>'s merger will 
not necessarily mean the removal of all irritants in Sino-Indian 
relations; neither should it be seen as indicative of a smooth 
road to solving the vexatious border dispute. At the same time, 
the benefits of narrowing down differences in other areas by 
stepping around what is apparently an intractable problem cannot 
be over- emphasised. Some problems will continue to plague 
Sino-Indian relations and both <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> will have 
to learn to cope with them if a lasting relation is to be forged 
between the two Asian giants. For instance, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> will have 
to stop doubting <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>'s official position on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> -- that 
it is an autonomous zone of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> -- and accept the 
inevitability of pluralism in a democratic society. By 
cavilling at views on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s future expressed by individuals at 
seminars and rallies, like it did recently, <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> will be 
running the risk of setting the clock back. A better option 
would be to hasten the reopening of the silk route which once 
connected two civilisations.

<HEAD>Tibetan Spiritual Leader and Nobel Winner Returns to India</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Tibetans threw flowers and
offered silk scarves in a tumultous welcome <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> for their
spiritual leader, the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, who returned to his home-in-exile
with the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> arrived at <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>'s international airport just
past midnight and was greeted by cheering men, women and children
from the 100,000-member Tibetan community exiled in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Inside the airport's arrival lounge, monks in maroon and saffron
robes lined up to welcome the 54-year-old <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> with low bows
and traditional gifts of white scarves. Outside, thousands of
Tibetans lighted incense sticks and covered the roadway with
marigold and rose petals.
   ``I feel (the award) is recognition of my sincerest motivation
for nonviolent action,'' the leader of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>'s resistance to
Chinese rule told reporters. ``I feel it may help to create more
awareness for the value of compassion and nonviolence.''
   When he was awarded the prize in <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> was in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> on one of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> visits he makes at
least twice a year to minister to Buddhist faithful and to heighten
international awareness of the Tibetan struggle. He spent four
weeks in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on this trip.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> fled to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in <DATE>1959</DATE> after an abortive uprising
against the <DATE>1951</DATE> Chinese annexation of his remote Himalayan nation.
He has set up a government-in-exile in <LOCATION>Dharamsala</LOCATION>, an Indian town
300 miles north of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>.
   In recent months, he has dropped demands for complete Tibetan
independence and has proposed that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> retain responsibility for
military and foreign policy.
   So far, there has been no concession by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>
government has said it is willing to discuss <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>. However, it
insists <ORGANIZATION>Tibet</ORGANIZATION> must remain an integral part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.
   Asked whether his receiving the <DATE>1989</DATE> Nobel Prize could alter
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s stance, the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> said: ``At the moment, I don't
know. But after a few months you may see something.'' He did not
elaborate.
   <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has condemned the award as an insult and interference in
its internal affairs.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, dressed in the sleeveless robes of an ordinary
Buddhist monk and wearing a rosary on his left wrist, said he had
still not decided what to do with the award's <MONEY>$469,000</MONEY> cash prize.
   ``I may contribute something for the starving people in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>
or create an institution for world peace,'' he said. ``I need some
more ideas. I will speak to my colleagues.''

  [Text] <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, <DATE>March 22</DATE> (AFP)--<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> strongly criticized 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> [22 <DATE>March</DATE>] for failing to prevent a recent 
conference on <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> from being held in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, slamming the 
event as a "gross interference" in its internal affairs. "We 
deeply deplore that such anti-China political activities had not 
been forestalled on the territory of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>," said a foreign 
ministry spokesman, referring to last week's All-Party Indian 
Parliamentary Forum for <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>. 
  The three-day convention, attended by parliamentarians from 
30 countries, "openly trumpeted for `liberation of <ORGANIZATION>Tibet</ORGANIZATION>' on the 
grounds that there were human rights problems in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>," the 
spokesman said. "This anti-China act and gross interference in 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>' internal affairs has aroused great indignation of the 
whole Chinese people including the Tibetan compatriots," he said. 
  The conference statement denounced alleged Chinese human 
rights abuses in <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION>, urged the release of all Tibetan 
political prisoners and expressed concern over Chinese nuclear 
testing in the region -- which Chinese troops entered in <DATE>1951</DATE>. 
It also called on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to open unconditional talks with the 
<ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> and urged the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> to grant observer status 
to the Tibetan spiritual leader's government-in-exile, based in 
northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> but not recognised by any country. 
  "We thoroughly condemn the anti-China clamours made at the 
meeting," which was organised by "a small number of Indian 
parliamentarians in collusion with the international 
anti-Chinese force," said the foreign ministry spokesman. 
  The Indian government has also come under fire from 
conference delegates, who accuse it of succumbing to Chinese 
pressure by trying to scuttle the event by denying a venue in 
the heart of <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> and by allegedly declining visas to some 
MPs. "The (Indian) government put obstacles at the behest of 
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> twisted <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s arm," said Indian MP <PERSON>George 
Fernandes</PERSON> <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, calling on the Indian government to support 
the Tibetan cause. <PERSON>Fernandes</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, who has 
lived in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> since fleeing his homeland in <DATE>1959</DATE> after a failed 
anti-Chinese revolt, did not make an appearance at the 
convention because of Indian pressures. 
  <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, which is home to some 100,000 Tibetan exiles, treats 
<LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> as an autonomous region of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and has cracked down 
hard on Tibetan protestors during visits by Chinese leaders in 
recent years.

  [Text] The Czech president, <PERSON>Dr. Vaclav Havel</PERSON>, has been 
presented with the <ORGANIZATION>Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace</ORGANIZATION>, Disarmament, 
and Development for the year <DATE>1993</DATE>. Presenting the prestigious 
award at the <ORGANIZATION>Ashoka Hall</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Rashtrapati Bhavan</LOCATION> [<ORGANIZATION>President House</ORGANIZATION>] 
in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> today, the president, <PERSON>Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma</PERSON>, 
described <PERSON>Mr. Havel</PERSON> as a champion of human rights. He said <PERSON>Dr. 
Havel</PERSON> has done a (?signal) service in providing politics its 
moral dimension. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister, <PERSON>Mr. Narasimha 
Rao</PERSON>, said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has an exemplary record on human rights. He 
said the aspersion on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s record on this issue is caused by 
those who themselves do not have any respect for human dignity. 
<PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> described the president of the new republic as the 
father of democratic movement in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. The award carries 25 
lakh rupees and a plaque. 
  The Czech president described the award as the best tribute 
to the people of his country, who waged a relentless struggle 
against the totalitarian regime through nonviolence. The vice 
president, <PERSON>Mr. Dr. K.R. Narayanan</PERSON>, and the chairperson of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mrs. Sonia Gandhi</PERSON>, also spoke on 
the occasion. 
  Later, addressing a press conference, <PERSON>Dr. Vaclav Havel</PERSON> said 
there is great potential for economic cooperation between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 
and his country. He observed that both countries are pursuing 
economic reforms and there is a need for exchanging information 
about the opportunities available in each country. In this 
regard, <PERSON>Mr. Havel</PERSON> sought to have an investment protection 
agreement with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and hoped that the draft agreement 
submitted by his delegation in this regard will be formalized by 
the middle of this year. Expressing his satisfaction at the 
discussions with the Indian leaders and businessmen, he said two 
agreements on trade and avoidance of double taxation have been 
signed. 
  Replying to a question on supplying spare parts to Indian 
defense equipment, <PERSON>Mr. Havel</PERSON> said there is no reason why his 
country should not export defense equipment to peace-loving 
democratic countries. He, however, firmly said that the <LOCATION>Czech 
Republic</LOCATION> will not export defense equipment to some countries 
which were receiving armaments from the former <LOCATION>Czechoslovakia</LOCATION>. 
The deputy prime minister of the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Ivan 
Kocarnik</PERSON>, said companies from his country will now onwards 
participate in tenders for projects in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. A delegation of 
Indian businessmen will visit <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION> soon to establish relations 
with the Czech businessmen. 
  Earlier, the prime minister, <PERSON>Mr. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, and the 
visiting Czech president, <PERSON>Dr. Havel</PERSON>, discussed the possibilities 
of cooperation in several areas between the two countries at 
their meeting in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> today. <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was 
particularly interested in the cooperation in infrastructure 
development. The two leaders deliberated on the role and 
relevance of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Mr. Rao</PERSON> said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was 
committed to the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> and its democratization. He also accepted 
the Czech president's invitation to visit the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Rao</PERSON> said in accepting the party's nomination.;    <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> won the lion's
share of votes in national elections that concluded <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, but fell short
of a majority. Rao's first task will be to shore up his government, either in
a coalition or by guaranteeing reliable support from an outside party for a
minority government.;    Leftist parties and the centrist <ORGANIZATION>National Front</ORGANIZATION>
alliance say they will back a <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> government on the merits of each issue.
But none has shown interest in joining a coalition committed to blanket
support to the government.;    Until Pawar's withdrawal, the party had feared
a bitter power struggle among regional leaders. Rao is a veteran politician
from the southern state of <LOCATION>Andhra Pradesh</LOCATION> who was foreign minister under Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.;    After <PERSON>Indira Gandhi</PERSON>'s <DATE>1984</DATE> assassination, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>
remained in the Cabinet under <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>, who served as prime minister from
his mother's death until 1989.;    The party leadership fell vacant when <PERSON>Rajiv
Gandhi</PERSON> was assassinated <DATE>May 21</DATE> while attempting a political comeback, and <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>
was chosen party president after <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s Italian-born widow, <PERSON>Sonia</PERSON>, refused
to accept the post.;    After a show of hands confirmed <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s election as
prime minister today, the meeting chairman, <ORGANIZATION>Sita Ram Desari</ORGANIZATION> said: "I declare
<PERSON>Mr. Narasimha Rao</PERSON> unanimously elected as leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> parliamentary
party.";    <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s selection was greeted with cheers and shouts of "<PERSON>Rajiv
Gandhi</PERSON> is immortal.";    Referring to <LOCATION>Gandhi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> told the 200 <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
delegates that "sometimes the responsibilities of the great fall on someone
who is not great. Since you cannot bring them back, you just have to carry
on.";    He added: "We owe it <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>, to his memory, to the party and to
the country to implement his manifesto to the hilt.";    <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>, who is 69 and
has undergone a heart bypass operation, did not run for a seat in <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>.
Indian law requires the head of government to be a member of <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION>, and
he must win a by-election within six months.;    The governing party can
guarantee a victory by running Rao in a constituency vacated by the death of a
lawmaker, or by having a party member resign in a district where <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
would be judged a shoo-in.;    <ORGANIZATION>Pawar</ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s election, citing <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s
five decades of experience in the party and in government. "His total
contribution to the <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> is more than my age," said <PERSON>Pawar</PERSON>, who is
50.;    <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> had played a key role in the election campaign, writing the
party's manifesto, which calls for encouraging high-tech foreign investment
while remaining committed to the longstanding notion of a self-sufficient
economy.  </TEXT>

regime to overcome the macroeconomic crisis. 
  <PERSON>Mr. Narasimha Rao</PERSON> was speaking at the historic <ORGANIZATION>Humboldt 
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> today. He called for a determined fight

<HEAD>Gandhi Arrives in China in First Such Visit in 34 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Indian Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> arrived in the
Chinese capital <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the first visit to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> by an Indian
leader since his grandfather, <PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON>, came 34 years ago.
   Gandhi flew into <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> on a special <ORGANIZATION>Air India</ORGANIZATION> jet provided for
the trip. His usual plane remained in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> because rats had
gnawed electrical cables in the aircraft.
   The five-day visit marks the first time the leaders of the
world's two most populous countries have met since <DATE>1960</DATE>, when
Premier <PERSON>Chou Enlai</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has about 1.08 billion
people, and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has about 880 million.
   Gandhi will meet with the communist government's leaders in
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, tour the ancient city of <LOCATION>Xian</LOCATION> and visit <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION>.
   On arrival at the airport, the Indian prime minister, wearing a
brown overcoat, was greeted by about 100 Indians who live in
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. He made no statement to reporters.
   Before leaving his country, <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said the visit will be ``very
important ... for this globe, for <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and for both of us.''
   The two nations are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade, and science and technology. Consular offices
in the Chinese city of <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and the Indian city of <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION> may
also be established as a result.
   However, little progress is expected on the main issue dividing
the two countries, their 2,400-mile-long border. They fought a brief
border war in <DATE>1962</DATE>, and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> occupied about 15,000 square miles of
Indian territory that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> still wants back.
   The two countries began border talks in <DATE>1981</DATE> but made little
progress in eight rounds.
   <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> soon after <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s <DATE>1949</DATE> revolution.
   In the early <DATE>1960s</DATE>, relations deteriorated over the border issue
as well as personal and political disagreements between Chinese
leader <PERSON>Mao Tse-tung</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Prime Minister Nehru</ORGANIZATION>.
   In the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>, relations improved slightly when <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations, instead of
exporting communist revolution.
   Both Chinese and Indian officials say <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s visit is intended
to create an atmosphere for greater communication _ not resolve the
border question.

   With most of the votes now tallied, India's election
victors are struggling to splice together the country's
fourth government in 19 months. What kind of government it
will be now becomes the crucial question for India.
   The biggest winner, the traditionally dominant Congress
(I) Party, had only one candidate who seemed to have learned
enough both from past successes and mistakes to offer a
chance of hauling India into the modern world. That was
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, whose five-year term
ended with the loss of his party's parliamentary majority in
1989. Mr. Gandhi was courting voters this round with promises
to resume his mid-1980s drive for a more open economy when he
was assassinated May 21 at a campaign rally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON>'s murder, his <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> has been
trying frantically to scrounge up a viable nominee for prime
minister. <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON>'s replacement as <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION>
president, 69-year-old <ORGANIZATION>P.V. Narasimha Rao</ORGANIZATION>, is in bad health
and seems to be serving mainly as a place holder. The mission
of finding a lasting party leader has become urgent now that
the projected vote totals show <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> short of a majority,
but with enough seats to negotiate the leadership of a new
coalition government.
   To form a government, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> members face the double
challenge of drumming up a viable prime minister as well as
pasting together a majority coalition over which this mystery
minister could preside. Small wonder that with the top
politicians so befuddled, the <DATE>June 15</DATE> edition of one of the
country's leading magazines, <LOCATION>India Today</LOCATION>, refers to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> as
"one of the most ungovernable countries in the world."
   Fortunately, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> still has one ace in the hole -- its
voters. With each creak and heave of the three recent
administrations, voters seem to have been getting a sharper
idea of what they want -- and what they are fed up with. If
the politicians would stop squabbling long enough to heed the
message of the recent polls, they might find that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s 835
million people are trying to steer their country in a more
governable direction.
   What voters clearly don't want is the old-style
poverty-making state planning, which mainly promotes economic
stagnation, corruption, frustration and resulting ethnic
strife.
   The steps needed for economic development are by now no
secret. The world has seen enough socialist experiments fail
-- from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s democratic version to the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s and
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s more hideous communist models. We have all marveled
at the rise since World War II of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>'s capitalist tiger
economies. Even <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s traditionally statist neighbors in
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> have been turning recently toward
more free-market ways. When <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> pointed in that
direction for two years or so in the mid-1980s, Indians were
clearly ready to follow; they responded with a burst of
economic growth. Now they want more.
   <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> died while seeking what he called a "second
chance" to pursue the reforms that would let <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> fulfill
its huge potential as the most populous of the world's
democratic, developing nations. The challenge for the
jostling <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> leaders who survive <PERSON>Mr. Gandhi</PERSON> is to redeem
his free-market election pledge that has won them this second
chance.

  [Text] <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>, <DATE>April 24</DATE> (AFP) -- The Tibetan settlement 
of <LOCATION>Dharamsala</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> was calm <DATE>Sunday</DATE> [24 <DATE>April</DATE>], but 
tension remained after the death of an Indian in a street fight 
triggered a burst of rioting, reports said here. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>'s government-in-exile issued an appeal to the 
residents of the hill town to maintain "peace and calm during 
this period of tension," a spokesman for the Tibetan spiritual 
leader's office in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> said <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
  Tibetan refugees were urged not to retaliate against "acts 
of 
violence from anyone" and the Indians in <LOCATION>Dharamsala</LOCATION> were asked 
to help restore the traditional goodwill between the two 
communities. 
  Tibetan property, including some exile government offices, a 
hospital and library, were damaged and about a dozen people 
injured when angry Indian residents armed with bricks and sticks 
went on the rampage <DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
  The attacks were sparked by the death of a 20-year-old 
Indian 
youth in a knife fight <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with a Tibetan refugee, 
who also was injured and hospitalised. 
  Police reinforcements have reached <LOCATION>Dharamsala</LOCATION>, where the 
authorities imposed a ban on public protests in response to a 
Tibetan request for additional security, the spokesman for the 
<ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>'s office said. 
  "Our information is that it is now calm and quiet, but there 
is some tension still," the spokesman said, adding that Indian 
leaders in the region had expressed their regret over the 
rioting. 
  He said the incident which sparked the riots was an 
altercation between two individuals and "no one should take 
steps which will result in communal tension." 
  Dharamsala has been home to the <LOCATION>Dalai Lama</LOCATION> and the seat of 
his government-in-exile since he fled <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> in <DATE>1959</DATE> following an 
abortive anti-Chinese uprising. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is home to about 100,000 
Tibetan exiles. 
  The Tibetan spiritual leader is now on a visit to the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> and expected to return <DATE>May 1</DATE>. 
  His government-in-exile used <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s statement to express 
Tibetan gratitude to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> for "coming to our help at this 
critical period in our history." 
  "<LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> have had close spiritual and cultural ties 
for centuries," the statement said. "The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> has always 
been reminding our people that the relationship between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> is that of a teacher and a disciple."

Elections in <LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION> are scheduled <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for both <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> and the state

<PERSON>Sharad Pawar</PERSON> were in the running to be the next prime minister.;    Pawar is
the chief minister, the top elected official, of western <LOCATION>Maharashtra</LOCATION> state,
whose capital is <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>. He was considered in a strong position because the
<ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> won 37 of the state's 47 parliamentary districts.;    "The
process of consultation is on, but we have nothing definite to offer," party
spokesman <PERSON>Pranab Mukherjee</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE>. "The election of the leader will have
to wait until all the results are declared.";    The counting is not expected
to be completed until Wednesday.;    With 438 of the 511 seats at stake
decided, the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> won 213, television reported. Its small-party allies won
another 12. Partial returns from other districts showed the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would win
only about 15 of the remaining 73 seats, television said.  </TEXT>

  [Text] The prime minister returned to <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> <TIME>this 
morning</TIME> on the completion of his week-long visit to the <LOCATION>United

minister, <PERSON>Mr. Ghlam Nabi Azad</PERSON>; and the Harayana chief minister, 
<PERSON>Mr. Bhajan Lal</PERSON>, besides others. 
  As reported the prime minister's arrival in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> was 
slightly delayed as <ORGANIZATION>Air India</ORGANIZATION>'s special aircraft carrying him 
and his delegation developed a minor technical snag while 
landing at <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> for a scheduled halt. A standby aircraft 
already stationed at <LOCATION>Charles de Gaulle Airport</LOCATION> was used for the 
onward journey home. 
  India-American business leaders have proposed creating two 
new institutions on Wall Street in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to chalk out 
programs for the modernization of Indian industry. Sponsored by 
the <ORGANIZATION>Greater Houston Partnership</ORGANIZATION>, the plan was presented to the 
finance minister, <PERSON>Dr. Manmohan Singh</PERSON>, who accompanied the prime 
minister, <PERSON>Mr. Narasimha Rao</PERSON>, on his just concluded <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> visit. 
A press release issued by the group says the plan envisages 
creating mutual funds, venture capital funds and other debt and 
equity instruments to raise capital for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in the next 
decade. The release estimated a contribution of at least <MONEY>$100 
billion</MONEY> by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> private industries for Indian markets in the 
next five years. It also said the Indian Americans have the 
capacity to fund <MONEY>$5 billion</MONEY> per year for the modernization of 
the country's industry. 
  The leader of the opposition in the <LOCATION>Lok Sabha</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Atal

  [Text] Koenigswinter (DPA) -- The <LOCATION>Dalai Lama</LOCATION> has 
encouraged the <ORGANIZATION>FRG</ORGANIZATION> to take over responsibility in international 
politics. He hopes that, as a result of its special historical 
development, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> will play an important role in establishing 
world peace, the secular and spiritual head of <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> said in 
<LOCATION>Koenigswinter</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> [30 <DATE>April</DATE>]. 
  The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION>, who has lived in exile in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> for 35 
years, 
pointed to the "particularly friendly relations" between <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. However, this should not lead to a strong tolerance 
toward the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> has the opportunity to 
influence Chinese policy. The 58-year-old man stressed that 
awareness of the special situation in his homeland is widespread 
among the German public. 
  The Nobel Peace Prize laureate affirmed his path of 
nonviolence. "I am, on principle, against the use of weapons." 
This is also the basis of the support granted to the Tibetan 
people by the world public. The <ORGANIZATION>Dalai Lama</ORGANIZATION> is paying a 
three-day visit to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> on the invitation of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Friedrich-Naumann Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with the Free 
Democratic Party of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>.

in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION>Red
Army</ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.
   ``<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> said at a ceremony
where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister
<PERSON>Indira Gandhi</PERSON>.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> said on the second day of his three-day
state visit to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> agreed in <DATE>April</DATE> to withdraw its estimated
100,000 troops from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, and about half the troops have
left. Soviet troops entered in <DATE>December 1979</DATE> and have been helping
the Marxist government battle U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> accuse <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> of continuing to
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord.
   Earlier today, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> said a challenge by the Soviet republic
of <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> authority was part of the ongoing process of
``perestroika,'' or social change promoted by the Soviet leader.
<LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION>'s parliament this week declared <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION> was sovereign and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   In his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the
<LOCATION>Baltic</LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Latvia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> said:
``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure
things will settle down.''
   The Soviet leader also said good relations between the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> were necessary for peace in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations,'' he said. ``Our own relations with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> are also
evolving in an encouraging way.''
   ``Thinking of countries like the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>,
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them
are extremely important for the destinies of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and for global
progress.''
   Indian Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>
next month, the first Indian head of government to visit the country
in 34 years. Chinese leader <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON> is scheduled to visit
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> early next year.
   Both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have had long-standing border
problems with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> fought a brief war in <DATE>1962</DATE> over
the issue.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s comments on the unrest in the Baltic states were made
informally to reporters at a memorial to <PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON>, which he
visited before the award ceremony.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON>, placed a wreath of red
roses at <PERSON>Mrs. Gandhi</PERSON>'s memorial. He placed similar floral tributes
at memorials to her father and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s first prime minister,
<PERSON>Jawaharlal Nehru</PERSON>, and to <PERSON>Mohandas K. Gandhi</PERSON>, the hero of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s
freedom movement.
   An estimated 7,000 Afghan refugees, many of them opposed to
Soviet military involvement in their homeland, were confined to
their homes in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> under police order for a second day. One
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any
embarrassment to the Soviet leader.
   The order asked Afghans not to ``move out of your residence till
21.11.88. ... Non-compliance of the order will render you liable for
prosecution.''
   The Afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations
every morning for a head count, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> has sought to dispel any doubts about the future of
Soviet-Indian relations. In an apparent reference to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> said ``the development of relations with third countries''
would not affect the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>'s friendly ties with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>.
   Both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> have showed signs of easing
long-standing strains in relations with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>, prompting concerns
expressed by some Indian newspapers and some Indian officials about
shifts in the political balances in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.

short of a majority, with a final total of about 220 seats. And several
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> leaders have made clear that, while picking a leader behind closed

political defection or horse-trading, that would break the parliamentary
deadlock and give <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> sufficient strength to rule.;    The process may
last for several days, deepening the concern of an already cynical electorate.

<FÊP=106> [By <PERSON>Suman Chattopadhya</PERSON>] </F>
  [Text] The Rao-Clinton joint news conference just 
concluded. When all of us were coming down the stairs of the 
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> after the conference, a young journalist from 
<LOCATION>Gujarat</LOCATION>, who was a member of the prime minister's entourage, 
loudly told a senior journalist from THE <LOCATION>WASHINGTON POST</LOCATION>, "Had 
this been our country then at least for the sake of courtesy, we 
would have asked your president some questions, but you have 
insulted our prime minister by not asking him any questions." 
The American journalist was not at all offended by this remark. 
He smiled and softly told the youth to come with his prime 
minister when he visits the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> after five years. He 
then added that at that time, you will not find us as 
indifferent. 
  This spontaneous anger of the unexperienced Indian 
journalist 
was 100 percent genuine. It is really difficult for 
professional Indian journalists to tolerate the disregard shown 
toward their prime minister by American journalists. This 
proves that American journalists do not give any importance to 
the country where about one sixth of the total world population 
lives. 
  <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> was able to create a lot of enthusiasm in the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media during his first visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1985</DATE>, 
but <ORGANIZATION>Narasimha Rao</ORGANIZATION> failed to generate even a fraction of that 
enthusiasm. The major <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> newspapers gave wide coverage to the 
press conference which was addressed by <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> at the 
<ORGANIZATION>National Press Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. This time, the newspapers 
thought it a waste to spare space to cover Rao. During <PERSON>Rajiv 
Gandhi</PERSON>'s visit, THE <LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> TIMES criticized the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> 
administration for trying to impress Gandhi by showing robots to 
him. The newspaper said "<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> must be reckoned with in deeper 
terms than by displaying robots or space capsules to as 
sophisticated a man as <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>." This time, due to the 
request made by the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>, only THE <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> POST 
agreed to write a short report on <PERSON>Rao</PERSON>'s visit. It wrote: "A 
small bald figure in a <ORGANIZATION>Congress Party</ORGANIZATION> grey suit, a man with a 
shy manner and a low voice, a man who is a total stranger to the 
(?sound bite) [as published], the Indian prime minister is not 
easily recognizable as a politician." It is unfortunate for the 
senior, learned, and experienced prime minister of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> that 
popular television networks like <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> did not feel it 
necessary to give even one minute's coverage to him. 
  Did Rao really deserve the neglect which was shown him by 
the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media? <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON> was able to attract American 
journalists due to his amiable disposition, westernized outlook, 
and alluring personality. Rao had something valuable in his 
pocket which the Americans should have been attracted to, that 
is, a market economy. The media did not give much importance to 
<ORGANIZATION>Narasimha Rao</ORGANIZATION> this time as they are not very aware of the 
developments which are taking place in the Indian subcontinent. 
Despite this, there is no denying the fact that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will soon 
become very important to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media just as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has 
become. The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration was reluctant to give most 
favored nation treatment to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> as its human rights record 
was not satisfactory. This enraged the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media. The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
media is of the opinion that nothing should be done which would 
hamper bilateral trade ties with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>. 
  Americans continuously shed tears for the cause of 
democracy, 
but why is the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media so keen to keep the communist 
dictators of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> happy. This is so because their only 
objective is trade. If <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> does not get most favored nation 
status due to the rashness of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, then <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> industrialists 
will be affected and the interests of the country will be 
hampered. Their main objective is to protect the economic 
interests of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It should be achieved at any 
cost even if it is necessary to renounce the country's policies. 
It has been observed that <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> did not make any special 
efforts to secure most favored nation status. The industrial 
corporations and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media are working together to protect 
the interests of the Chinese leaders, <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON> and <PERSON>Li Peng</PERSON>. 
  <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will also be able to acquire this importance after 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> becomes involved in its market. The first and 
foremost requirement is to attract <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> capital. During his 
visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, to some extent <ORGANIZATION>Narasimha Rao</ORGANIZATION> has 
been able to attract <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> businessmen to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. This is the 
most significant aspect of his visit to that country. These 
people were able to realize the amount of profit they can make 
by investing in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. It is true they have been impressed by 
the reform measures initiated by <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Manmohan</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
businessmen have started realizing that this country of hermits 
and snake charmers have a middle class population of about 200 
million people, who have great purchasing power. There was no 
one in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to speak in favor of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> in the past. 
At present, a lobby of industrialists has been formed in favor 
of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>. Some key persons of giant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporations have also 
joined this group. A new horizon of prospects has been created 
in front of their eyes -- the largest free market of the 21st 
century. 
  Their eagerness towards this country is new and it must be 
admitted that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will gain from it. The first benefit is 
economic. This is because <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is desperately in need of 
foreign capital, particularly in the sphere of infrastructure. 
The second gain is political. Due to growing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interests in 
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, other sensitive political issues like <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> and the 
nonproliferation issue will gradually lose significance. 
President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and his colleagues did not make any attempt 
to embarrass Rao on these issues during his recent visit. The 
main reason behind this is pressure from industrialists. If the 
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> remains passive on these issues, then <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> 
will have to suffer. In fact, it is the intention of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to 
blunt the sharp mouth of <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION>. 
  To sum up, it may be said that in this post Cold War era, it 
is essential to improve ties with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. It is 
necessary to play the economic card well to establish this 
relationship. <ORGANIZATION>Narasimha Rao</ORGANIZATION>'s visit has created prospects for 
the establishment of friendly relations between the two 
countries. This relationship will be further strengthened if 
the pledges given by <PERSON>Rao</PERSON> and Manmohan regarding economic reforms 
are speedily implemented. Once capital is invested in this 
country, then it is bound to influence the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and the 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> media. After this, if the Indian prime minister goes to 
address a joint news conference with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president, then 
all cameras will be focussed on the Indian prime minister. This 
will fulfill the predictions made by the American journalist to 
the Gujarati youth.
