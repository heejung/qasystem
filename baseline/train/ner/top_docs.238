<HEAD>OAS Foreign Ministers Meeting in Washington</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> prepares
to call for a decisive hemispheric stand against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s Gen.
<PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> as foreign ministers from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization
of American States</ORGANIZATION> gather here today.
   A highlight of the meeting is expected to be the admission of
<LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> as the 32nd <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> member, effective <DATE>Jan. 1</DATE>. There also is some
sentiment in support of readmitting <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> expelled the government of president <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> in
<DATE>1962</DATE> on grounds that the country's Marxist-Leninist philosophy is
incompatible with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> principles.
   <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers usually convene only once a year, but the
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> crisis has prompted four special <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> sessions since <DATE>May</DATE>. An
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> commission appointed in <DATE>May</DATE> was unable to fulfill its mandate
of arranging a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was expected to deliver a tough speech
condemning the Panamanian government, but it was not clear whether
he would make specific proposals.
   The inaugural session was scheduled for <TIME>this morning</TIME>, and
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s remarks were to be delivered in <TIME>late afternoon</TIME>.
   The <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> crisis arose six months ago when Panamanian
authorities threw out the returns from national elections amid
widespread allegations of fraud. A <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> crony, <PERSON>Francisco
Rodriguez</PERSON>, was sworn in <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> as the unelected president.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been the strongest proponent of decisive
action against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, but other <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> countries maintain that the
group should stay out of what is an essentially internal Panamanian
matter.
   Also on the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> agenda is <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s scheduled <DATE>Feb. 25</DATE>
presidential election. The meeting is expected to produce numerous
calls for a free and fair election process.
   <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> has been sharply critical of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> over the years,
looking on the organization as an instrument of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign
policy. But seven leading Latin American democracies called last
month for <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmission to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> has said it's
ready to accept.
   <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> has far more diplomatic support in the hemisphere than at
any time since it was expelled from the <DATE>OAS 27 years ago</DATE>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has lobbied hard against <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmission,
citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in Central American and
reported human rights abuses.
   <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmission would require a two-thirds vote of member
nations in attendance.

   Broke, demoralized and ignored, the
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> needed a spirit-nourishing issue.
<PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> may have provided it.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has been unable to accomplish much of anything this
decade. One of the organization's principal aims is to keep the
peace, but it has been on the periphery of the continuing bloodshed
in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> and was irrelevant at the time of the
British-Argentine war in <DATE>1982</DATE> over the <LOCATION>Falkland Islands</LOCATION> and the
U.S.-led invasion of <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> a year later.
   At one point several years ago, an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> official said the
organization was so feckless that it was unable to agree on a
resolution commemorating the upcoming 500th anniversary of the
discovery of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.
   But for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has been heaven-sent. The organization,
which seemed paralyzed by factionalism, was able to close ranks
against the Panamanian leader <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   With only <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> dissenting, <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers
agreed to blame <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> for ``the grave events and abuses'' that
have occurred since the <DATE>May 7</DATE> national elections in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   International organizations normally are loathe to single out
leaders of member states for criticism but the scenes of opposition
candidates and ordinary citizens being bludgeoned by government
agents turned stomachs from one end of the hemisphere to the other.
It was time for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to drop its genteel guard.
   The foreign ministers approved a resolution which not only held
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> personally responsible for the bloodshed, but also
appointed a mediating team to take steps aimed at ensuring a
``transfer of power'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   That is quite a departure for an organization which normally has
as its highest principle the right of member states to be spared
outside intervention.
   Noriega, of course, will put his own spin on the resolution. He
is expected to tell the mediators that he is a soldier for
democracy who wanted nothing more than to see a ``transfer of
power'' resulting from the <DATE>May 7</DATE> elections. On that basis,
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s foreign minister was able to go along with the resolution
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> has shown interest in
reviving the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. He is planning to appoint one of the <ORGANIZATION>State
Department</ORGANIZATION>'s most accomplished Latin American hands, <PERSON>Luigi Einaudi</PERSON>,
as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   But <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> didn't take office soon enough to head off the layoffs
earlier this year of 300 <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> employees, about <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the
total. That step was largely brought on by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arrearages
amounting to more than <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY>. More layoffs are expected next
month.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> heyday was the <DATE>1960s</DATE>. It was the Cold War era and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
administrations were able to forge an anti-communist consensus with
rightist dictators and hawkish democratic governments which
dominated the hemisphere at the time.
   Cuban President <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> was everybody's villain. The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
expelled him from its ranks a few years after his revolution and,
25 <DATE>summers ago</DATE>, the organization slapped a mandatory economic and
diplomatic embargo against <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>.
   In <DATE>1965</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>, a
seeming violation of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter. But <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> nations, albeit
reluctantly, gave their blessing to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> action rather than
siding with the target of the invasion.
   With the demise of rightist dictatorships in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and
their replacement by elected governments, the anti-communist
consensus in the hemisphere has unraveled.
   Never has <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> been more democratic or less willing to
go along with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s policies. Support for President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> policies in the hemisphere was virtually invisible.
   The special session on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> recalled the time 10 years when
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> decided to move against <ORGANIZATION>Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza</ORGANIZATION>. A month after the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers called for <ORGANIZATION>Somoza</ORGANIZATION>'s
resignation, he fled to <LOCATION>Paraguay</LOCATION>.
   Now the question is whether the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> stand against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> will
contribute to a similar result.
   One of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators who will sit down with <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> next
week is Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>, the principal
architect of the agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> starting a year ago.
   If <PERSON>Cordovez</PERSON> was able to get more than 100,000 Russian troops
out, surely he can do the same with one Panamanian. Or can he?

<TEXT>
   Organization of <ORGANIZATION>American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers assembled here today for a historic debate on the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
crisis, with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> prepared to ask for a resolution
demanding that Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> step aside.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s Press Secretary <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>White
House</ORGANIZATION> was ``confident there will be general hemispheric
condemnation of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s actions'' at the session.
   ``We hope and expect the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> will take a strong stand on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
and against the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime,'' <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said, adding the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> would let other countries ``take the lead'' in proposing
specific motions. He said <ORGANIZATION>Secretary of State James A Baker III</ORGANIZATION>
would ``speak up forcefully regarding our views.''
   In <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, opponents to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> called for a one-day general
strike today to protest the voided elections and the beating by the
general's supporters of political opposition leaders. But many
factories, stores and street stands were open, although commuter
traffic was lighter than normal.
   As the delegates prepared for their opening session, the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> was emerging as perhaps the most militant of the 31 nations
represented here for the first special <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers
meeting in seven years.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration was ready to
ask the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to demand that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> step down following an election
10 days ago that the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> claimed was rigged initially
and then voided when the fraud could not be concealed.
   But the preliminary signs for the administration were not
encouraging because two of the countries thought to be most
sympathetic to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> view, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, were proposing
resolutions that fell far short of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> objectives.
   Neither mentions Noriega by name nor recommends that he step
down.
   At his daily <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> briefing for reporters, <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said
the administration was not seeking a country where <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> could
find exile.
   ``There have been a number of countries that have said they
would accept Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,'' he added. ``At least some of them are
countries that don't have extradition treaties with the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> session evoked memories of one 10 years ago when <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
foreign ministers, including then-U.S. Secretary of State <PERSON>Cyrus
Vance</PERSON>, demanded the resignation of Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Anastasio
Somoza</PERSON>. He fled less than a month later.
   This year, the delegates seem somewhat reluctant to interfere in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s internal affairs to the degree that they did a decade ago
in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>.
   The Venezuelan draft calls for the ``immediate recognition'' of
the <DATE>May 7</DATE> electoral returns in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> while asserting that the
solution to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s crisis rests exclusively with the Panamanian
people.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official said the Venezuelan proposal is not plausible
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since
most of the ballots have been destroyed.
   The Peruvian draft calls on the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general to
facilitate a dialogue between the Panamanian government and
opposition, leading to the election of new authorities.
   Alternatively, other mechanisms would be agreed to that would
ensure ``the transfer of power'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   While <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials consider both drafts to be
tepid, the decision to raise the events surrounding the Panamanian
election to the highest hemispheric tribunal is seen as a plus for
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policy.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been attempting to topple <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> for more
than a year, a policy that Panamanian delegates at today's meeting
are expected to seize on.
   Based on official statements in recent days, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> was
preparing to accuse the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at today's meeting of
systematic violation of Panamanian sovereignty in violation of the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter.
   As examples, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> was intent on highlighting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic
sanctions imposed 14 months ago and the reported <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government donation to opposition forces in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> during the
election campaign.
   <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> requested the meeting after international observers
contended that the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election was marked by massive fraud
committed by the pro-Noriega coalition.
   Subsequently, the results were tossed out after a bloody
confrontation between armed supporters of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and opposition
demonstrators, including presidential candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>
and a vice presidential running mate, <ORGANIZATION>Guillermo Ford</ORGANIZATION>.
   Scenes of the bloodshed were widely disseminated outside <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
and had a major impact on hemispheric public opinion.
   The dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting
provisions in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter. One paragraph calls representative
democracy an ``indispensible condition'' for stability in the
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to
outside intervention ``for any reason whatsoever.''
   <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
the administration looks forward to working with governments
throughout the hemisphere to develop ``action in support of
democracy'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Indicating that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> plans a circumspect role at
the meeting, <PERSON>Boucher</PERSON> said, ``This is a meeting called by Latins,
led by Latins, and we expect the result to reflect Latin interest
in democracy.''

<HEAD>OAS Mediators Will Try To Solve Panama's Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 8th graf pvs to say mission leaving Monday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a diplomatic compromise accepted by both
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>
called for a transfer of power through democratic means in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
while leaving the details to a team of mediators.
   The plan was unanimously authorized late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
foreign ministers in a resolution that condemns the ``grave events
and abuses'' by Panamanian leader Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> but
which also stops short of criticizing his government.
   The resolution, approved in an unusually efficient manner by the
29 delegates present, was sufficiently ambiguous to win the
approval of the two biggest antagonists at the session: Secretary
of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> and Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge
Ritter</PERSON>.
   Baker pronounced himself ``very pleased'' with the outcome.
<PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> said, ``I feel fully satisfied.''
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>, responding to a question shouted by a reporter
as he headed from the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> to a helicopter <TIME>this morning</TIME>,
called the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> action a ``good resolution.'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> left for a
four-day trip to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.
   The president's spokesman, <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON>, later told
journalists on <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> One that the resolution ``constitutes a
condemnation of Noriega by name for his abuses of the electoral
process.'' He added: ``We're gratified that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> countries
shared the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' position.''
   The key provision empowers the foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> to try to promote a ``national accord,
within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest period possible,
to ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign
will of Panamanian people.''
   OAS Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> was asked to assist the
delegation that will travel to the Central American nation. The
organization issued a statement this afternoon saying the envoys
will depart <DATE>Monday</DATE>. They were asked to report back by <DATE>June 5</DATE>, and
the resolution said unspecified ``subsequent measures'' may be
needed after <DATE>June 5</DATE>.
   Venezuelan President <PERSON>Carlos Andres Perez</PERSON>, speaking today from
<LOCATION>Caracas</LOCATION> on ``CBS This Morning,'' called the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting ``the
inauguration of new relations between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the
rest of the hemisphere because we have all agreed on a declaration
defending democracy for <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and we have all condemned the
abuses commited in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>....''
   <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is expected to tell the envoys that he never has opposed
the fundamental purpose of the resolution _ a transfer of power
through democratic means. He is likely to claim the <DATE>May 7</DATE>
presidential elections, which he later ordered voided, were
designed to achieve that very goal.
   The most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a
direct reference to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was appropriate.
   The initial draft of the resolution, prepared by a 10-nation
delegation, omitted any reference to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
and other countries strongly opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> reversed that
omission during a closed session of more than two hours, paving the
way for final approval.
   The new language warned that the ``grave events and abuses'' by
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> ``could unleash an escalation of violence'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The decision to include the reference to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was approved by
a 20-2 vote with seven delegates abstaining. The Panamanian and
Nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording while the
abstainers were from <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> and five <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> countries.
   The Nicaraguan delegate failed in two efforts to win approval of
amendments assailing President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s decision last week to send
2,000 more <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s stated purpose was to
protect American lives.
   Ritter expressed satisfaction with the final resolution, saying
it fell far short of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demand for a condemnation of the
Panamanian government. He promised that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation would be
welcomed by Panamanian authorities.
   Noriega's critics have maintained he first tried to rig the
outcome of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election in support of his candidate, <PERSON>Carlos
Duque</PERSON>, then ordered the returns voided when he could no longer
conceal the fraud. Government agents severely beat at least two
opposition candidates, a point noted in the resolution.
   <PERSON>Sen. Connie Mack</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Republican who went to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as
an observer for the election, attended the meeting at <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
headquarters and termed the final resolution ``very positive'' but
said he would have preferred an explicit demand that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> step
down.
   The resolution marks a return to a key diplomatic assignment for
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>, a member of the
mediating team. Cordovez was the principal negotiator for the
agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet forces from
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.
   In contrast to other <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meetings, this one
was short on rhetoric and stressed substantive give-and-take.
   <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON> had predicted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> the session could
drag on until <DATE>Friday</DATE> but the resolution was in its final form and
approved by consensus at <TIME>11:50 p.m.</TIME>, barely six hours after the
formal proceeding had got under way.

succeed in arranging a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, but
Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> remained publicly optimistic
today.
   One official dismissed the mediation as a ``corpse'' and said
alternative ideas must be pursued for pressuring Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio
Noriega</PERSON> to step down.
   Three <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators, aided by Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena
Soares</PERSON>, have made two visits to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> over the past month to
attempt to seek a solution to the country's political crisis.
   On their last visit, the mediators left some ideas with the two
most powerful political blocs in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and with the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>
on how to promote a dialogue.
   <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON> is ``neither optimistic nor pessimistic'' about the
prospects for success but believes the progress achieved to date has
been satisfactory, according to an aide.
   But a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official criticized the effort, saying ``the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has
fallen on its face on this.''
   The official, asking not to be identified, said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomats
from around the hemisphere have been trying to enlist governments
from <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> to support the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> position.
   Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION>House Foreign Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION> this
morning, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said <DATE>today</DATE> he remains ``very hopeful'' that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
mediators will be successful.
   He reaffirmed the longstanding <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> view that there can be no
normalization of relations with <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> so long as <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> remains in
power.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been attempting to force <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> out of
office since he was indicted by two <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> grand juries on drug
smuggling charges in <DATE>February 1988</DATE>.
   But few, if any, governments in the hemisphere are as
unswervingly opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Many are
reluctant to intervene in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s internal affairs, while others
see the issue as a U.S.-Panamanian problem that should be dealt with
as such, the officials said.
   The official <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> position is that the mediation
effort should not be judged until <DATE>July 19</DATE>, the deadline for the
mediators to submit a report on their activities to <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers.
   The administration believes the only acceptable solution is for
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to agree to step down as <ORGANIZATION>Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> commander before the
deadline. Privately, officials say there is no sign that will occur.
   The crisis arose last month when <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s electoral tribunal,
dominated by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s allies, tossed out the returns from the <DATE>May 7</DATE>
presidential elections. Independent observers said the opposition
slate had won by a landslide.
   There was indignation throughout the hemisphere when, three days
after the election, opposition candidates were beaten by government
security agents. A week later, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediating team was set up.
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers blamed <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> for the ``grave events and
abuses'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   But much of the anti-Noriega sentiment has dissipated over the
past six weeks, generating pessimism here that the mediators will be
able to fulfill their mandate.
   The officials said the administration is weighing a series of
options for bringing additional pressure to bear on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,
including the seizure of his overseas assets, believed to number in
the hundreds of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY>.

   Three Latin American foreign ministers,
fulfilling a mandate from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>,
headed to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> today to promote a democratic transfer of power.
   Panamanian authorities have promised to cooperate with the
mediators but <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials said initial comments
by Panamanian authorities have not been encouraging.
   A pro-government party in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> it wants the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to
focus on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ``aggression'' against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The foreign minister of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sahadeo Basdeo</PERSON>,
arrived <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and said the delegation is ``not here to
interfere with the internal affairs of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. We came as friends
and neighbors.''
   The other two, from <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, were to fly
separately to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and planned to join <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao
Baena Soares</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers last week blamed Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio
Noriega</PERSON> for ``the grave events and abuses'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> following the
failed election process in that country earlier this month.
   After a vote count that international observers said was marred
by massive fraud, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s electoral tribunal threw out the
results. The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has maintained that the opposition
slate, based on an independent count, won the election by a 3-1
margin.
   Opposition candidates subsequently were beaten and bloodied by
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> supporters during a post-election demonstration.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> claims that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has disrupted
constitutional processes on two occasions in 15 months. The first
was the ouster of then-President <PERSON>Eric Arturo Delvalle</PERSON> in <DATE>February
1988</DATE> and the second was what the administration says was the theft
and subsequent annulment of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election.
   In addition to <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>, the delegation is made up of the
foreign minister of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>; of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sahadeo
Basdeo</PERSON>; and of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mario Palencia</PERSON>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution calls for the mediators to ``secure a
national accord, within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest
time possible, to ensure the transfer of power with full respect
for the sovereign will of the Panamanian people.''
   The tentative plan is for the ministers to report back to their
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> colleagues on <DATE>June 6</DATE>. If Panamanian authorities show no
interest in complying with the spirit of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution, the
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration is expected to support an escalation of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
pressure against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official, insisting on anonymity, said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has raised the possibility of resolving the crisis by
inviting opposition presidential candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> to join
a three-member junta. The other members would be Noriega allies.
   ``Noriega is proposing one of you and two of us,'' said the
official, suggesting that any such proposal would not be acceptable
to <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> ministers.
   The opposition's three top candidates, seeking recognition of
their victory claim in the election, shook hands and passed out
leaflets in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> welcoming the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> will not solve all our problems, but it will create
the environment. They have come to investigate,'' said <PERSON>Endara</PERSON>.
   A pro-government party <DATE>Monday</DATE> criticized the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> for condemning
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and said its delegation could not mediate among Panamanians.
   ``We call on the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to adopt a virile attitude toward
aggression against our people by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' said a
statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, the largest
pro-government group.
   Noriega and his allies have consistently maintained that
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s problems stem from a systematic <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> effort to subvert the
country's democratic process, citing accounts of a <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION>
contribution to the opposition coalition.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Rio de Janeiro</LOCATION>, 7 Jun (PL) -- The 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS General 
Assembly</ORGANIZATION> continued today receiving new requests urging the 
readmittance of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, from which it was removed in 
<DATE>1962</DATE> due to its political disagreement with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
  During the second day of talks in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Para State</ORGANIZATION>, 
Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON> reintroduced the topic 
of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmittance before the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting and reiterated the 
need for "reviewing the Cuban situation within the hemispheric 
community." 
  During the inauguration of the 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Assembly on <DATE>Monday</DATE>, 
outgoing <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> as well as 
Brazilian President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> recommended that <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s 
readmittance be considered, although this topic is not part of 
the agenda to be discussed at the meeting which will conclude 
<DATE>Friday</DATE>. 
  In his speech to the foreign ministers and representatives 
of 
the 34 OAS-member countries, Amorim recalled that his country 
"maintains friendly relations and has significant cultural links 
with <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>." 
  "Despite everything, we do not believe that economic and 
political isolation is the best way to contribute to a 
transition that is already in the making in that country," 
Amorim added. 
  <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>, who will conclude almost a decade as head of 
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> on 20 <DATE>June</DATE>, made similar statements yesterday. 
  "As everyone knows, I have been inquiring whether this is 
the 
right moment for <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> members to review the measure adopted over 
30 years ago when the Cuban Government was suspended ... the 
90's are not the 60's," he stated. 
  According to diplomatic sources, this was the first time the 
outgoing <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> head has dealt with this topic officially before a 
regular <ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>. 
  "<LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s removal is not in keeping with the political 
revolution the world has faced in the past years," he added. 
  Meanwhile, President <PERSON>Franco</PERSON> supports that <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> be readmitted 
and the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> reassess its position regarding <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. "<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 
favors a harmonious dialogue among all nations, without 
exceptions," he added. 
  In statements to the media in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, Bolivian Foreign 
Minister <PERSON>Antonio Aranibar</PERSON> expressed his support for <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s 
readmittance into the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> while his Costa Rican counterpart 
<PERSON>Fernando Naranjo</PERSON> proposed that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> establish channels of 
communication with the <ORGANIZATION>Cuban Government</ORGANIZATION>.

  [Text] <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, 8 Jun (EFE) -- OAS Assistant Secretary 
General <PERSON>Christopher Thomas</PERSON> stated here today that so far none of 
the 34 <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> member countries have formally proposed <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s 
readmission into the organization. 
  Thomas, who represents <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> 
Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> had proposed that <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s 
return to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> be discussed. He noted, however, that so far 
no country has made a formal request to this effect. 
  In accordance with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> regulations, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said, the 
readmission of a member country into the organization must first 
be formally proposed by one member country, and then consulted 
with the other members attending the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>. 
  Thomas is actively participating in the 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS General 
Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, which opened on 6 <DATE>June</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, in 
northern <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. He said: "As <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON> said, circumstances 
today are conducive to reexamining <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmission to the 
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, but so far I am unaware of any country having made such a 
proposal." 
  As assistant secretary general, <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> will replace <PERSON>Baena 
Soares</PERSON> -- whose term expires this month, after having served 10 
years in office -- during the two-month period preceding the 
installation of the new secretary general-elect, Colombian 
President <PERSON>Cesar Gaviria</PERSON>. 
  Although some Latin American foreign ministers have timidly 
defended <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>'s proposal that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> member countries 
discuss the possibility of readmitting <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, only <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> has 
formally stated its position on the issue; that is, its 
opposition to the proposal. 
  During a news conference <ORGANIZATION>Argentine OAS</ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Hernan 
Patino Meyer</PERSON> said flatly: "The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> consists of democratic 
states, and as soon as <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> takes steps toward its 
democratization it will be possible to readmit it into the 
organization." 
  Asked why <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> had, then, continued as <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> 
member states under the military regimes, <PERSON>Patino Meyer</PERSON> said that 
at that time the <DATE>1992</DATE> clause that provides for the separation 
from the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> of nondemocratic states had not yet been approved. 
"Had I been the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general at that time, I would 
have expelled <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> from the organization," 
<PERSON>Patino Mayer</PERSON> said. 
  In his opening speech at the 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>Baena 
Soares</PERSON> said: "I have been asking for some time whether it is 
the right moment for the member countries to reexamine the 
decision they made more than 30 years ago to suspend the <ORGANIZATION>Cuban 
Government</ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> activities. The nineties are different from 
the sixties." 
  <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>' proposal was not immediately discussed by the 
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers because they were more interested in 
discussing the Haitian crisis. 
  Although President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> did not discuss the Cuban 
issue in his speech at the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Assembly, he stated shortly 
before returning to <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> that "the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must look at the 
Cuban position." 
  <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> was separated from the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1962</DATE>, three years after 
the victory of the Cuban Revolution led by President <PERSON>Fidel 
Castro</PERSON>.

   Acting President <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>
met with military strongman Gen. <PERSON>Antonio Manuel Noriega</PERSON> <DATE>Monday</DATE> after
he conferred with an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission trying to mediate <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s election
deadlock.
   On its second trip to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>
mission met separately <DATE>Monday</DATE> with <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON> and opposition party
members.
   Immediatedly after his one-hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON>Solis
Palma</PERSON> met for another hour with <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>. The general was seen
entering the governmental palace in civilian clothing with <PERSON>Carlos
Duque</PERSON>, the government's candidate in the <DATE>May</DATE> election that was
annulled.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> told reporters later
that Panamanian officials and the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> representatives were trying to
find ``an acceptable formula'' for a dialogue between the government
and opposition.
   ``This mechanism even though it obviously doesn't exist yet .. .
this is what we are searching for,'' <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> did not speak with reporters.
   One <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegate, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>,
said earlier he is confident the government and opposition have the
political will to settle their differences.
   He said it is up to the Panamanians to resolve the dispute.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> only can ``promote a dialogue and perhaps give ideas
based on our national experience based on similar situation,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, and the foreign
ministers of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> are the other members
of the mission.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s political crisis began with the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election, which
international observers said the opposition won by at least a 2-1
margin. The government controlled by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> annulled the election
and opposition candidates were attacked and beaten by his supporters.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> then agreed to send the mission to negotiate a national
dialogue on the transfer of power on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, as required by the
constitution.
   On their first visit to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> at the end of <DATE>May</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
diplomats could not persuade the opposition and government to hold
direct talks. Opposition leaders said they would talk only with
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, and he refused.
   Cordovez, a former <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> official who negotiated the Soviet
withdrawal from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, was optimistic <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   ``I think there is a political will in the government and the
opposition that has to be translated into specific steps,'' he said.
``It seems to me that it is most urgent to establish mechanisms that
allow Panamanians to talk and negotiate.''
   Noriega and government officials blame <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s problems on the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, which they say wants to renege on <DATE>1977</DATE> treaties that
turn over the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> at the end of the century.
   Noriega, commander of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, was indicted on
drug trafficking charges last year in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He denies
the charges and has refused <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demands he resign.

   Foreign Ministers of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to send
mediators to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in an effort to end that country's political
crisis through a ``transfer of power.''
   The resolution also held Panamanian leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio
Noriega</PERSON> responsible for the ``grave events and abuses'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
in recent days.
   The mediators were ordered to report back by <DATE>June 5</DATE> on their
mission in order to determine whether any subsequent measures are
appropriate to resolve <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s crisis.
   The resolution asked the foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>, assisted by <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>,
to undertake the mission in order to secure a ``national accord''
in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> within ``democratic mechanisms.''
   The accord is to be reached in the ``shortest period possible to
ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign
will of the Panamanian people,'' the resolution said.
   The most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a
direct reference to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was appropriate.
   The initial draft resolution, prepared by a 10-nation
delegation, omitted all references to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, but the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> and other countries strongly opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> reversed
that omission during a closed session of more than two hours,
paving the way for final approval.
   The new language warned that the ``grave events and abuses'' by
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> ``could unleash an escalation of violence'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The decision to include the reference to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was approved by
a 20-2 vote with seven delegates abstaining. The Panamanian and
Nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording.
   Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON>, after
opposing the any change in the initial resolution, said he was
pleased with the overall result. Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker
III</PERSON> also said he was pleased.
   The delegates reassembled in public session after their private
meeting late <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to give the resolution final approval, but
that was considered a mere formality.
   The resolution was seen as a compromise between <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> factions
which had been advocating markedly different approaches to the
Panamanian crisis. One faction had advocated a hands-off policy
toward <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, citing <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> principles of non-intervention, and a
hard-line faction which had demanded the removal of <ORGANIZATION>Noriega</ORGANIZATION> from
power. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was in the latter category.
   Critics of the resolution argued that the call for a transfer of
power is largely meaningless because <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> himself backed the
country's recent election process.
   But backers of the draft pointed out that the proposal calls for
an end to the crisis through democratic procedures.
   Noriega's candidate in the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election, <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>, claimed
victory, but the results subsequently were voided by the <ORGANIZATION>Panamanian
Electoral Tribunal</ORGANIZATION> after widespread allegations of vote-rigging.
There also were brutal attacks by government agents on several of
the candidates in the election, a point noted in the draft
resolution.
   Noriega sees himself as no more than the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> commander
who serves at the pleasure of a president who is the product of a
constitutional process. The first test of the resolution is whether
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> demonstrates a willingness to cooperate with the mediators.
   The proposal was presented by the delegations of <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dominican
Republic</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>.
   At the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>, 57 members of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> encouraged <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>, in a
letter, to press hard for <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> action.
   ``We urge the members of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to pass a resolution calling
for the immediate replacement of the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime and
installation of a democratic government in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> which reflects
the free will of the people of that country.'' the letter said.
   Ritter argued in closed session that <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s problems are the
product of a systematic campaign of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interventionism, including
a series of economic sanctions and what he says was a <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government contribution to the opposition campaign.
   As the meeting started, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was aligned with the
Central American countries and some <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> islands in calling
for a strong stand against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   At the other end of the spectrum, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> were
believed to be encouraging a more cautious approach, one that takes
into account <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> principles requiring respect for the sovereignty
of member nations.

election said he told of massive fraud by both pro- and
anti-government parties today during a meeting with a delegation
from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>.
   The Panamanian government presented its case against the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> during a meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation, sent in
the wake of the nullified election.
   ``The Panamanian government took the opportunity to present a
series of documents and actions that contributed to invalidate the
elections of <DATE>1989</DATE>,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON>Jose Hernandez</PERSON> said.
   An <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> source who refused to be named said the meeting was
``difficult,'' but he did not go into detail.
   Sources said the delegation was attempting to arrange a meeting
with Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> chief and de
facto ruler of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation said they had come to facilitate a
search for solutions to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s political troubles.
   Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> and his two
vice presidential candidates were scheduled to meet with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
delegation. They contend they won the <DATE>May 7</DATE> vote by about 3-to-1
over <LOCATION>Noriega</LOCATION>'s hand-picked candidate.
   The government, however, nullified the vote, and blamed
opposition fraud and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interference in the election.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> group met <TIME>this morning</TIME> with <LOCATION>Hildebrando Nicosia</LOCATION>, the
<ORGANIZATION>Authentic Panamanian Party</ORGANIZATION>'s presidential candidate. He received
only a small percentage of the vote.
   <LOCATION>Nicosia</LOCATION> said he described ``massive fraud committed by both
sides.'' He added, ``People are tired of instransigence on both
sides. The solution is for negotiations without prior conditions.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution last week criticizing <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and
calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
It sent a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of
<LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>.
   Acting president <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>'s government said it hoped
the mission would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict
between <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>,'' and it cited <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sanctions
as proof of malice.
   The government has proclaimed it will accept no interference in
internal Panamanian affairs and said some aspects of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
resolution violate the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> ``expounded its points of view about the events that
began 24 months ago,'' said <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> in a statement after <PERSON>Solis
Palma</PERSON> and members of his cabinet met with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation.
   The first street demonstrations against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s rule began in
<DATE>June of 1987</DATE>. Since then, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has been indicted on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> drug
charges, charges he says are part of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plot to renege on its
commitment to give up the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> at the end of <DATE>1999</DATE>.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation made no comment on the meeting
except for Ecuadorean Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>, who said
only, ``We have formed no impression.''
   At the airport after arriving <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Cordovez</PERSON> had said the
idea was to assist Panamanians in finding their own solutions and
to convey Latin American concern about the situation.
   Meanwhile, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops staged an amphibious landing exercise and
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said armed convoys of troops were being dispatched
over Panamanian roads with instructions not to stop.
   Several times in the past Panamanian police have stopped <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
convoys, which they have no right to do, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said.

   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s foreign minister said top
officials held a ``positive, amicable'' meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with a
Latin American mission to reconcile the military-controlled
government and the opposition.
   The delegation from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> arrived
earlier to mixed reactions and took a conciliatory tone.
   ``We are going to try to facilitate dialogue among Panamanians.
This is a situation that only Panamanians can resolve,'' said
Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, one of four <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
delegates.
   They are investigating charges that <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto ruler,
Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, nullified national elections to
prevent an opposition victory.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, defense officials said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was
sending armed military convoys on trips across <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to ``flex our
muscles'' and draw a line against Panamanian harassment.
   Two convoys of 10 or so vehicles carrying armed soldiers have
crossed without incident in either directions under escort by
Panamanian soldiers, as provided in the canal treaties, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   <PERSON>Rafael Vargas Santos</PERSON>, ambassador to <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, said in
<LOCATION>Port-au-Prince</LOCATION> the government would destroy the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Canal in the
event of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion.
   ``We will not be taken by surprise because we are already
prepared,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION>Radio Haiti Inter</ORGANIZATION>. ``The first thing we will
do is blow up the canal.''
   Cordovez, <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> and foreign
ministers <PERSON>Sahadeo Basdeo</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Mario Palencia</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> met with acting president <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON> and several
Cabinet members for two hours but issued no statement.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> said he could not say
what was discussed but said the meeting was ``positive, amicable.
... I think it was a very cordial, wide-ranging and positive
climate.''
   The group will meet with other ``political figures'' over the
next 10 days, <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON> said. No plans for a meeting with
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> were mentioned.
   Opposition leaders, who want their <DATE>May 7</DATE> presidential election
victory recognized, had welcomed the delegation and said the
Pan-American organization ``has understood the urgent need to act.''
   But the government proclaimed earlier it would not accept any
interference in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Government-controlled
media accused the organization of prejudging the case.
   ``They'll come, they won't see _ and they'll leave,'' said a
headline in Matutino newspaper.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> last week denounced <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and called for a swift
transfer of power.
   <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON>'s government issued a proclamation <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
saying parts of the organization's resolution violate its charter,
including the ``ill-willed'' mention of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   The government proclamation, however, welcomed the mission and
said it hoped it would ``establish the truth of the crisis as a
conflict between <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.'' It cited <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
sanctions against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as proof of malice.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> newspapers accused the organization of being led by the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Cordovez</PERSON> described its resolution as ``a Latin
American effort based on principles that we all respect _ the
principle of non-intervention.''
   In his arrival statement, <PERSON>Cordovez</PERSON> said Latin Americans are
concerned about <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and the mission is a ``gesture of good will,
a gesture of friendship and solidarity that should not be
misinterpreted.''
   The opposition has called for a demonstration at noon <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
in defiance of a government ban on demonstrations that lasts until
<DATE>June 5</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> mission is to file
its report.
   Noriega, who commands <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, was indicted on
drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>February 1988</DATE>. He
denies the charges and says they are part of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plot to renege
on its commitment to hand over the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> at the end of <DATE>1999</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   The government and opposition
appeared no closer to resolving the presidential election crisis
after a visit by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American
States</ORGANIZATION>.
   The opposition said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, must be a party to any negotiations.
Noriega, however, insisted the opposition must negotiate with
pro-government parties.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission, scheduled to leave today, had hoped to help
resolve an impasse that arose when the government nullified the <DATE>May
7</DATE> presidential elections. International observers said the
opposition won by a 3-1 margin.
   ``At this time what we hoped for has not been achieved, an
agreement among Panamanians to resolve the crisis that bedevils
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>,'' opposition candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> after
meeting with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation.
   A member of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation, Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>
of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, said the opposition and government ``understand each
other better, but it will require an enormous effort from the
Panamanian people because they have to develop the formulas to
solve the problem.''
   The other members of the mission were the foreign ministers of
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao
Baena Soares</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. The delegation must file a report the day
before the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meet on <DATE>June 6</DATE> to consider the
organization's next step.
   Endara said he would not accept the presidency on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, even
if <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> allowed it but remained commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Panamanian
Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I would just be a puppet,'' <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> said.
   The opposition has said repeatedly that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Forces</ORGANIZATION> hold real power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and therefore must be a part of
any talks.
   Noriega, at a news conference after his own meeting with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
delegation, said: ``The key to the problem lies with the contending
political parties ... If the opposition remains intransigent, the
<ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> are not going to slip on a banana peel'' and be
drawn into the dispute.
   ``The two sides have to start talking,'' he said. ``They both
claim they won.''
   He said questions about the possibility of his own resignation
were ``stupid.''
   <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who was indicted in <DATE>February 1988</DATE> on drug charges in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said he told the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s problems were
caused by ``interfering hands.''
   He cited the drug charges, which he denies, and economic
sanctions as proof that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was plotting to keep the
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Canal despite treaties that call for the canal to be turned
over at the end of <DATE>1999</DATE>.

   Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> accused
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> of supporting ``violence, destruction
and war'' in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> and he said these activities are the
biggest obstacle to genuine superpower accommodation.
   In a speech to foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American
States</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> also said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will never accommodate
itself to the ``outlaw regime'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and he called for the
international community to isolate that country.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Leonardo Kam</PERSON> responded immediately,
calling <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policies toward his country ``fascist.''
   Baker's remarks on the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> reinforced the notion that
<LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> may be the most divisive issue when President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
and Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> have their <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>
summit in three weeks.
   ``The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> bears a special responsibility because its
arms and money, moving through <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, continue to
support violence, destruction and war,'' <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said.
   He said shipments of Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in <LOCATION>El
Salvador</LOCATION> are incompatible with the ``new thinking'' in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> _ the
term <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> uses to describe his break with past policy.
   ``Soviet behavior toward <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> remains the
biggest obstacle to a full across-the-board improvement with the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.''
   <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would be pleased to have normal
relations with a democratic <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. But, he said, ``there is a
dictator, and his name is (Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio</PERSON>) <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.'' He added
that after the release <DATE>Monday</DATE> of an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> report critical of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>,
no ``self respecting democracy'' should make an accommodation with
that country.
   After <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s remarks, <PERSON>Kam</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomat was resorting
``to a very old formula _ a fascist one _ of repeating time and
again false words so that they could ring true.'' He said <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
was a victim of ``relentless <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aggression.''
   Until <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> spoke, the mood at the meeting was upbeat, with
speaker after speaker hailing the entry of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> as the 32nd
member of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. About 25 foreign ministers were on hand for the
opening day deliberations.
   Costa Rica introduced a resolution calling on all <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> member
states to withraw their ambassadors from <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> until a process is
under way there to restore democracy.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> agency,
said in its report on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> that the Panamanian government
routinely violates the rights of its citizens to, among other
things, life, humane treatment, personal liberty and judicial
guarantees.
   The commission called on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to take ``immediate steps to
control the excessive violence that the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> police and
paramilitary groups employ against the civilian population.''
   These forces, the report said, must end the ``mistreatment,
torture and other cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment that
the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> inflict upon individuals deprived of their
freedom.''
   An <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> effort to try to arrange a democratic transfer of power
in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> was suspended in late <DATE>August</DATE> after it became apparent
that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was not interested in surrendering power.
   A separate <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> report on <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> demands the release of all
political prisoners and says that there are no guarantees the <DATE>Feb.
25</DATE> national elections there will be free and fair because of
built-in advantages enjoyed by the incumbent Sandinistas.
   The renewed fighting in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> prompted Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister <PERSON>Miguel D'Escoto</PERSON> to introduce a resolution calling on the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to make an urgent appeal to the government of <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> ``to
cease immediately the bombing of the civilian population.''
   Shortly before the afternoon session was convened, a delegation
of Sandinista and <ORGANIZATION>Nicaraguan Contra</ORGANIZATION> officials met at an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> annex
several blocks away. The talks are a continuation of discussions
begun <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>.
   The objective is to reach agreement restoring the cease fire and
to lay the groundwork for the demobilization of the Contras.
   A number of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> countries have expressed support for the
readmission of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> after a 27-year absence.
   <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> has said it is ready to accept an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> invitation but
diplomats said that issue was not likely to come up at this year's
meeting.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has lobbied hard against <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmission,
citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> and
reported human rights abuses.

<TEXT>
   Organization of <ORGANIZATION>American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers are asking Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> to arrange a
transfer of power over the next six weeks as part of a plan to
restore democratic rule in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   A declaration approved by the ministers <DATE>Thursday</DATE> was a
masterpiece of diplomatic evenhandedness, earning the support of
both the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegate and <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s representative.
   Specifically, the declaration said the proposed transfer of
power on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> and subsequent free elections are to be carried
out through ``democratic means and in conformity with existing
internal Panamanian procedures.''
   The declaration lacks an enforcement mechanism and does not
specifically ask for <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to step down. Advocates of a stronger
statement expressed concern that he might try to rig the process in
a way that enables him to maintain control from his power base as
commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Panamanian Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>.
   Privately, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials expressed dismay with the outcome but
<ORGANIZATION>Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger</ORGANIZATION> indicated in brief
remarks that the declaration has enough teeth to warrant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
backing.
   Addressing delegates from the 31-member body assembled at the
ornate <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON> said the transfer of power
envisioned in the declaration ``must reflect the will of the
Panamanian people.''
   In addition, the new democratic elections called for must not be
held in ``one, two or three years but as soon as possible,''
consistent with the wording of the declaration, he said.
   ``General <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> must go,'' <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON> added.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has called for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to exert maximum
pressure on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who has been accused by two <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> grand
juries of drug smuggling activities.
   The ministers also extendeduntil <DATE>Aug. 23</DATE> the mandate of an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
mediating team which has been trying to facilitate an end to the
two-month old political crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> pledged his
government's full cooperation with the mediating team, which is
comprised of the foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and which has received the cooperation of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary
General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>.
   According to the Panamanian constitution, a new president is to
be installed <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>. The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration had hoped the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
would push for the installation as president of the opposition
candidate in the <DATE>May 7</DATE> national elections.
   The results of that balloting were thrown out by <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
electoral tribunal amid widespread claims that <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>,
the candidate opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, had won in a landslide.
   By calling for another round of elections after <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, in effect, accepted as permanent the annulment of the <DATE>May 7</DATE>
balloting.
   The reference to the need to abide by ``existing internal
Panamanian procedures'' also was seen as a concession to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.

   A delegation from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION> arrived here today to investigate charges that Gen.
<PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> scrapped the results of national elections
to prevent an opposition victory.
   ``We will organize our work and seek meetings with government
and political figures so we can return to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to present a
report filling the mandate of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao
Baena Soares</PERSON> said in a statement after arriving at the airport.
   The organization last week condemned <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, the nation's
military chief and de factor ruler, and called for a transfer of
power.
   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> said the mission
would ``tell all Panamanian sectors that there is concern in <LOCATION>Latin
America</LOCATION> about <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s crisis.''
   The delegation is being welcomed by <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s opposition, which
wants the organization to recognize its victory in <DATE>May 7</DATE>
presidential elections. International observers say the opposition
won the elections by a 3-1 margin. Noriega nullified the vote after
it was apparent his candidates were losing.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s government has warned the mission should not be turned
into ``an international vote tabulation board or an international
court of appeal.''
   Noriega holds real power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> because he commands the
<ORGANIZATION>Panamanian Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>. He has been indicted on drug charges in
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, charges he says are part of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plot to
renege on its commitment to give up the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> at the end of
<DATE>1999</DATE>.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Group Not Sufficiently Pressuring Nicaragua On Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Addressing the annual meeting of
the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON>George P.
Shultz</PERSON> criticized its members for not doing more to pressure
<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> into democratic reforms.
   ``This organization has not always been out front on issues
concerning democracy,'' he said in the meetings' keynote speech.
   <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government had
promised the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> it would maintain a ``pluralistic'' political
system, but that member states had not held the Nicaraguans to their
commitment.
   <PERSON>Victor Hugo Tinoco</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s vice-minister of foreign affairs,
disagreed.
   ``The general movement is towards discussion, towards
negotiation,'' he said during an informal press conference. ``The
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has started to take a political role in ending the Central
American crisis.''
   Tinoco noted that Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> has agreed
to a direct role in monitoring a now-stalled peace agreement between
the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The meeting took place under strict security despite a unilateral
truce declared for the duration of the session by leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas opposed to the government of President <PERSON>Jose Napoleon
Duarte</PERSON>.
   Duarte, in welcoming the delegates, condemned the guerrillas and
called for support for the overall Central American peace process,
   Other topics discussed at the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> included Latin
American debt, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concern with drug trafficking and the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>'s
own financial straits.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are behind
on their dues. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, which provides the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
headquarters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, owes <MONEY>$41 million</MONEY>.
   ``The member governments must decide what they want to do with
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> at this critical juncture in the life of the Americas,''
said <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>, lamenting the organization's ``critical economic
condition.''
   The Brazilian was re-elected by acclamation to a second five-year
term as <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary-general.
   An <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> commission has recommended that the group cut its <MONEY>$66
million</MONEY> annual budget by <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> and fire a fourth of about 1,000
staff members.
   Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> will decide whether to accept
that recommendation this week.
   <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON>, who will be replaced by <PERSON>James A. Baker</PERSON> when
President-elect <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> takes office in <DATE>January</DATE>, said he would
press for full funding by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> failure to pay its full contribution has been
interpreted by some Latin nations as an effort to reassert its
dominance over the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>'s original sin is that it was founded to further <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
aims in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Tinoco</PERSON> said. ``But other countries are
trying to contribute a little more.''
   <PERSON>Bosco Matamoros</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Contra</ORGANIZATION> spokesman who came to <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> to
press the rebels' case, questioned <PERSON>Tinoco</PERSON>'s motives.
   ``They want negotiations on a biblical time scale _ to last a
thousand years,'' he told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION>. ``They only want to
stretch things out to reinforce their grip.''
   At a news conference after his speech, <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON> pointed to the
exclusion of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> from a meeting of Latin American nations last
month as an example of the kind of diplomatic sanction that could be
taken by <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> nations.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON> noted pointedly, was excluded from the ``Group of
Eight'' because it was no longer a democracy while under Gen. <PERSON>Manuel
Antonio Noriega</PERSON>'s thumb.
   In another speech to the assembly, <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>'s foreign minister
<PERSON>Felipe Errazuriz</PERSON> reiterated the intention of Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON>'s
government to hold elections in <DATE>1989</DATE>. However, he said, terrorism
was the major menace to the democratic process in <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>.

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said they were displeased with
the wording of preliminary draft resolutions intended for
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s emergency session of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American
States</ORGANIZATION> to discuss the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> crisis.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> one
of their main objections to the draft resolutions by <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> was that neither mentioned Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> by name.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is expected to push hard for a resolution
demanding that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s military leader and de facto ruler
of the country, step down.
   The Venezuelan draft calls for the ``immediate recognition'' of
the <DATE>May 7</DATE> electoral returns in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> while asserting that the
solution to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s crisis rests exclusively with the Panamanian
people.
   A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official said the Venezuelan proposal is not plausible
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since
most of the ballots have been destroyed.
   The Peruvian draft calls on the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general to
facilitate a dialogue between the Panamanian government and
opposition, leading to the election of new authorities.
   Alternatively, other mechanisms would be agreed to that would
ensure ``the transfer of power'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Among the 31 <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> members, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is aligned with a
cluster of democratic countries in Central and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> while
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> are proponents of a less activist policy, citing
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> provisions guaranteeing respect for the principle of
non-intervention.
   The meeting is being convened at the request of Venezuelan
President <PERSON>Carlos Andres Perez</PERSON>, who reportedly favors a resolution
calling on Noriega to step down.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration position favors the recognition of the
opposition candidate in the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election, <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>, as
the legitimate authority in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. Four days after the election,
the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> began referring to <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
``president-elect.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted 413-0 on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to approve a resolution
condemning <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s ``reprehensible actions'' in thwarting the
election, and calling on him and the Panamanian military to
recognize <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> as president.
   ``Despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people, all credible Panamanian and international
observers have recognized <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> as the indisputable
winner of the election,'' stated the non-binding resolution which
was sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.
   It also endorsed the ``careful and prudent policy steps'' taken
by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ``as an appropriate and measured response to the
crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.''
   ``We have a better indication of positive results than we have
come to expect in the past,'' <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> press secretary <PERSON>Marlin
Fitzwater</PERSON> said of the reaction by Latin countries to the
administration's call for solidarity against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   There is hope that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> will take a strong position, he said.
``On the other hand, we don't have any specific indication of what
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> might do,'' he said.
   He said he was unaware of an effort reported from diplomatic
sources in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is engaged in a petition
effort to get other countries to recall their ambassadors from
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has done.
   As to whether the administration wants <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to accept an
offer of refuge in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Fitzwater</PERSON> said, the president's
feeling is that, ``he ought to take any offer he could get.''
   <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
the administration looks forward to working with governments
throughout the hemisphere to develop ``action in support of
democracy'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Indicating that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> plans a circumspect role at
the meeting, <PERSON>Boucher</PERSON> said, ``This is a meeting called by Latins,
led by Latins, and we expect the result to reflect Latin interests
in democracy.''
   Meanwhile, Panamanian diplomats are expected to try to convince
their hemispheric colleagues that <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s problems are the product
of a systematic campaign of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interventionism, including a
series of economic sanctions and a widely reported <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government contribution to the opposition campaign.
   The dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting
provisions in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter. One paragraph calls representative
democracy an ``indispensible condition'' for stability in the
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to
outside intervention ``for any reason whatsoever.''
   With a large majority of hemispheric countries headed by elected
governments, some delegates are expected to push hard for an
anti-Noriega resolution because to do otherwise might encourage
restive military officers to displace civilian presidents.
   But others are likely to be reluctant to push <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> too hard,
particularly concerning allegations that he attempted to rig the
elections. These delegates may be wary about setting a precedent in
the event that the election processes in their own countries face
similar criticism.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, seemed guardedly
optimistic on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that a consensus existed for an anti-Noriega
resolution.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> is on the ropes,'' one official said, noting that the
organization is plagued by declining prestige and onrous financial
problems. About 300 <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> employees were laid off earlier this year.
   The official said it would make no sense for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to ``create
a cloud of dust'' by convening a foreign ministers meeting and then
do nothing.
   A large turnout of foreign ministers will be on hand for the
special session, the first of its kind for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1982</DATE> when
<LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> went to war over their conflicting claims to
the Falkland-Malvinas Islands.
   Among the handful of foreign ministers not expected to attend
are the ones from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>. They will be represented by
subordinates.
   <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Roman Popadiuk</PERSON> said that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> called
presidential <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> ``to express sympathy over the
assault which <PERSON>Mr. Endara</PERSON> and his fellow leaders of the democratic
forces in <LOCATION>Panamna</LOCATION> suffered at the hands of the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime.''
   ``The president noted the wave of outrage which has swept the
hemisphere in the wake of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s effort to steal the election by
force and fraud,'' he said.
   Popadiuk said he had no further information on the call.

<HEAD>Noriega Tells OAS That U.S. Responsible For Panamanian Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> met with
an <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> delegation and told them it
would be a dangerous precedent for them to interfere in a country's
internal affairs.
   Noriega also blamed the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and its history of
intervention in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> for the country's political crisis.
   ``Today it's <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, tomorrow it could be any other country,''
the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> chief told journalists <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after meeting
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegates.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission was sent in response to the Noriega-controlled
government's voiding of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> presidential vote and the beating
of the top three opposition candidates by pro-Noriega thugs.
International observers say the opposition won the balloting by a
3-1 margin.
   Opposition leaders also met with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
and said they want their election victory recognized and <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
retired.
   About 300 marchers accompanied opposition presidential candidate
<PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> and his running mates <PERSON>Ricardo Arias Calderon</PERSON> and
<ORGANIZATION>Guillermo Ford</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation's hotel.
   The demonstration, in defiance of a government ban, was broken
up peacefully by about 25 riot police wielding bullhorns. <PERSON>Arias
Calderon</PERSON> said two opposition workers were arrested.
   Maj. <PERSON>Edgardo Lopez</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Noriega</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that when the
issue of retiring <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was raised, staff officers expressed
loyalty to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and told the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegates the matter was solely
up to the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>.
   When asked directly what he planned to do, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> thought a
second and said, ``That's the million-dollar question.''
   <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Edgardo Costa</PERSON> called the 2{-hour discussion with
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and his staff ``very informative.'' The visiting delegation
comprises the foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>.
   ``We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive
foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ...
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> joked.
   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has been working for <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s ouster since the
general was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> last
year.
   After the opposition candidates were beaten, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> sent
1,900 extra troops to augment security at <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Panama Canal</ORGANIZATION>
installations.
   The troops have conducted exercises and run armed convoys along
Panamanian roads, as permitted by the <DATE>1977</DATE> treaties under which the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> must turn the canal over to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in <DATE>1999</DATE>.
   Noriega, who denies the drug charges, claims the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
is trying to oust him because it does not want to give up the canal
it built and protected for so long.
   ``<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has a historical perspective on the issues,'' said
<PERSON>Costa</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s talk went back to how
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> _ wanting a canal _ helped found <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in <DATE>1903</DATE>
by aiding its secession from <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution last week criticizing <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and
calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
   The Panamanian government said some aspects of the resolution,
including the mention of <LOCATION>Noriega</LOCATION>, violate the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter. It said
it would accept no interference in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s internal affairs.
   Noriega holds power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> through his command of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Forces</ORGANIZATION>, which have so far remained loyal despite <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and
opposition calls for a coup.
   Acting President <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON> told an open meeting of
government bureaucrats on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that no new elections are
possible before <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, when his term as ``minister in charge of
the presidency'' ends.
   Solis Palma replaced <PERSON>Eric Arturo Delvalle</PERSON> in the presidency
after <PERSON>Delvalle</PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> in <DATE>February 1988</DATE> following
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s indictment on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> drug-trafficking and money laundering
charges.
   Noriega denies the charges.
   The meeting with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> was pointedly held in a building in the
Panamanian section of <LOCATION>Fort Amador</LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> installation at
the edge of <LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION>.
   The fence that surrounds the building abuts a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> naval
station, and even <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> must pass a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military policeman to
enter the area.

<HEAD>OAS Meets to Discuss Panama Situation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organization of <ORGANIZATION>American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers are meeting again with deep divisions remaining over how
much pressure they should bring to bear on Panamanian leader <PERSON>Manuel
Antonio Noriega</PERSON> to surrender power.
   As the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> prepared to meet <DATE>today</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> was
expressing deep disappointment over the lack of enthusiasm among
many delegates for taking decisive action against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   These delegates, led by <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, cite provisions protecting member
nations against outside intervention. They also see the problem
concerning <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> as essentially a U.S.-Panamanian issue, not one
which should involve the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   But the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has become increasingly impatient
with what it regards as foot dragging by the 31-member <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials, insisting on anonymity, said early drafts of a speech
prepared for Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> for today's
meeting were sharply worded.
   <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was returning to his office today after his two-week trip
to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and it was not clear beforehand
whether he or a subordinate would represent the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at the
meeting.
   As <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> sees it, the administration bowed to Latin wishes by
assuming a low profile in the Panamanian situation and giving the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> a chance to forge a solution, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said.
   The Latin Americans had contended the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration too
often had acted unilaterally in confronting hemispheric problems and
that a multi-lateral approach was far preferable.
   But <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials complain the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has shown no stomach for
acting decisively against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who is under indictment in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> on drug smuggling charges.
   Anti-Noriega sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> grew <DATE>last May</DATE> after Panamanian
authorities threw out the results of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> national elections
amid widespread allegations that the candidate opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
was the landslide winner. The opposition presidential and vice
presidential candidate were beaten by pro-Noriega forces when they
tried to stage a public rally.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> met in emergency session <DATE>May 17</DATE> and appointed a team of
mediators to go to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> with a mandate to achieve a democratic
``transfer of power'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   One deadline for achieving that objective passed on <DATE>June 6</DATE> and a
second deadline was set for today.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators are more optimistic than the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>
about a settlement, pointing to two meetings in recent days between
Panamanian opposition and government leaders.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials viewed those meetings as an attempt by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to
dampen still further whatever desire the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> may still have for
involvement in the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> question.
   The Panamanian government hoped today's meeting would end with no
extension of the mediators' mandate.
   Expressions of impatience with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> already are being heard
from lawmakers as ideologically diverse as <PERSON>Sen. Jesse Helms</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.C.</LOCATION>,
and <PERSON>Sen. Christopher Dodd</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Conn</LOCATION>. There is even a movement in the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> to leave vacant for an extended period the post of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   Meetings among the Latin delegates were held <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at the
<ORGANIZATION>Colombian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere in an attempt to reach a consensus
on the Panamanian problem.
   With the results of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election nullified and with no
announced winner, it is not clear what will happen in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on
<DATE>September 1</DATE>, the date on which the Panamanian constitution says a
new president is to take office.

   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration is prepared to urge an
escalation of pressure on Panamanian leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>
if he ignores an Organization of American States call for a
transfer of power, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   After <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers approved a resolution on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, senior <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials met with Latin American diplomats
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> to discuss strategy for dealing with <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> in the event
he refuses to cooperate with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators.
   The key provision of the resolution empowers the mediators to
try to promote a ``national accord, within democratic mechanisms
and in the shortest period possible, to ensure the transfer of
power with full respect for the sovereign will of Panamanian
people.''
   The resolution also blames <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> for ``grave events and
abuses'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> since national elections were held on <DATE>May 7</DATE>. The
election returns were tossed out amid allegations of widespread
fraud.
   One of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, commenting on condition he not be
named, said there was a simple reason why the ministers overcame an
initial reluctance to criticize <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> by name in their resolution.
   ``Nobody there disagreed with the proposition that we ought to
try to get rid of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,'' he said.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> promised his government
will cooperate fully with the mediators, but there was little
expectation here that the negotiation will go smoothly.
   If it becomes apparent that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is intent on clinging to
power, the resolution allows for ``subsequent measures'' to be
taken against him.
   The officials pointed out that, a decade ago, it took three <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
foreign ministers meetings to win approval of a resolution calling
for the resignation of then-Nicaraguan President <PERSON>Anastasio Somoza</PERSON>.
   They suggested that if <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> responds to the <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
resolution by digging in his heels, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> could take the same
action against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> that it did against <ORGANIZATION>Somoza</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>.
   The officials said <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> will have difficulty attempting to
portray his government's problems as U.S.-inspired because the
resolution was a Latin American initiative.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> has said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> systematically sought to
subvert the election process there and has committed economic
aggression against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> through sanctions.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and his
spokesman, <PERSON>Marlin Fitzwater</PERSON> said, ``We're gratified that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
countries shared the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' position.''
   At the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, deputy spokesman <PERSON>Richard Boucher</PERSON> said,
``Noriega should listen to the clear message from his people and
from his neighbors. It's time for him to leave.''
   Appointed as <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators were the foreign ministers of
<LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>. They will fly to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>
for consultations with Panamanian authorities.
   The mediators are assigned to report back to their fellow
hemispheric foreign ministers after <DATE>June 5</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   An <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>
mission has arrived in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> for a third attempt to find a solution
to the country's electoral crisis.
   ``We came here to get a clear view of the situation,'' <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> said <DATE>late Thursday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission arrived only hours after the opposition rejected
the latest government proposal for a junta to take over on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>,
the constitutional inauguration day.
   International observers say the opposition led by presidential
candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> won the <DATE>May 7</DATE> national elections by a 3-1
margin. The opposition wants its victory recognized.
   The government controlled by Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, head of
the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, annulled the
election on <DATE>May 10</DATE>.
   In addition to having its victory recognized, the opposition
wants <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to resign, something the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has sought
since last year.
   ``We feel that our proposal for a three-way negotiation involving
the government, the opposition and the military has been accepted,''
another member of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission, Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego
Cordovez</PERSON>, said. ``The important thing is to clear up details for a
negotiation.''
   The mission is to meet with government officials and opposition
leaders and then submit a report to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 19</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> said last week that he has been disappointed with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
efforts so far.
   The opposition had expected the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> negotiators to put more
pressure the government to enter negotiations that include <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, which says <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is a drug-trafficking
dictator, has thrown its support behind the opposition by imposing
economic sanctions on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Noriega says the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, which indicted him last year on
drug-trafficking charges, is trying to set the stage to renege on
the <DATE>1977</DATE> treaties that hand the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> over to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> at the
<DATE>end of the century</DATE>.

<TEXT>
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration is preparing to lobby
hard for a tough resolution denouncing Panamanian leader <PERSON>Manuel
Antonio Noriega</PERSON> when <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers meet next week to discuss the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> crisis.
   But Panamanian authorities are expected to blame the upheaval in
their country on what they regard as systematic <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intervention
in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s internal affairs.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> permanent council on <DATE>Friday</DATE> approved a Venezuelan
proposal for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers to meet next <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to
discuss the ``serious crisis'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   While many delegates expressed concern about the interruption of
the election process and the violence directed against some
Panamanian opposition leaders, others argued against interfering in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s internal affairs.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s representative, <PERSON>Carlos Russell</PERSON>, used the occasion to
blast <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> actions, saying, ``We will not bow to the colossus of
the north.''
   He cited reports alleging that the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration donated
<MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> to the opposition candidate's campaign. He also said
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government had funded a clandestine anti-government radio
operation, that preparations were being made to scuttle the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
Canal treaties and that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> are engaged
in hostile military maneuvers.
   But the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON>William Pryce</PERSON>, said that in the interest
of the people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must raise its collective voice
``against the dictator <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and demand that he respect the will
of the courageous people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.''
   On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> began referring to the
opposition candidate, <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>, as the president-elect of
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, based on exit polls showing he had a sizeable lead over the
pro-Noriega candidate, <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, said there
seemed to be little likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers would
designate Endara as the winner. There also was some doubt that the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> would approve a resolution condemning <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, the officials
said.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was expected to fight hard for a toughly
worded resolution, but strong resistance was anticipated from a
number of countries, especially <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, both of which
attach high priority to the principle of non-interference.
   Even <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, which initiated the call for a foreign ministers
meeting, was restrained in outlining its reasons.
   Ambassador <PERSON>Edilberto Moreno</PERSON> made no direct reference to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,
saying only that ``the popular will'' of hemispheric nations must
be respected and that a meeting of foreign ministers at this time
is appropriate given the ``grave crisis'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The strongest anti-Noriega statement during the meeting was
delivered by Jamaican Ambassador <PERSON>Keith Johnson</PERSON>, who denounced
``this blatant rape of democracy'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>OAS Mission Leaves Panama After Failing to Bring About Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION> left <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> after four days of futile
talks aimed at finding a solution to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s political crisis.
   The delegates indicated they would ask that another <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission
travel to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> soon for additional talks with Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio
Noriega</PERSON> and the political forces trying to oust him.
   Noriega, who blames the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s troubles,
told the mission it was up to the political parties to sit down and
negotiate. Opposition leaders insisted <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> must negotiate
because he is the real power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   ``There are complex problems and deep emotions involved in the
Panamanian situation,'' said <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>, Ecuadoran foreign
minister and member of the four-man delegation.
   ``We have promoted communication between the different political
sectors,'' <PERSON>Cordovez</PERSON> said. ``We have fullfilled our mandate.''
   He said the mission met with government and opposition leaders
as well as <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> officials and other groups and
made them all aware of the different points of view.
   ``Unfortunately, there has been no progress for the good of
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>, the opposition's presidential
candidate in <DATE>May 7</DATE> elections.
   ``The two sides have to start talking,'' <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> said. ``They
both claim they won.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> sent the mission, headed by Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena
Soares</PERSON>, to seek a solution to the impasse created by the annullment
of the elections. International observers say <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s hand-picked
candidate, <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>, lost to <PERSON>Endara</PERSON>.
   The Panamanian government claimed the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> interfered
openly in favor of the opposition by providing financial assistance
and by repeatedly calling for the ouster of <LOCATION>Noriega</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Forces</ORGANIZATION> chief and the power behind the government.
   <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> obtained a public condemnation of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> from the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, which also blamed <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> for post-election violence,
including attacks on the opposition candidates.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegates will submit a full report on their mission to
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, which must decide what to do next.
   Noriega has been indicted in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on drug
trafficking charges, but he denies the allegations and says
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> wants him out of power so it can renege on the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
Canal treaties.
   Under those treaties, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> must hand over control
of the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Canal by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>.

<HEAD>Anti-Noriega Resolution Pleases OAS</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> praised an
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for early
elections in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and condemning the ``serious violations'' of
human rights occurring there.
   The resolution was approved 25 to 2 shortly before <TIME>midnight</TIME>
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>. Only <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>
voted in opposition.
   <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Margaret Tutwiler</PERSON> said the
resolution ``repudiates and isolates'' the government of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> and is the strongest <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> statement to
date on that issue.
   At a separate news conference, the new <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Luigi Einaudi</PERSON>, expressed regret that the resolution did not
mention <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> by name but added that the isolation of the
Panamanian leader is ``now visible for everyone to see.''
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, which considers the Noriega-led
government to be illigitimate, was pleased that at no point in the
resolution was there any reference to the ``Panamanian government.''
   <PERSON>Ms. Tutwiler</PERSON> said the resolution ``deprives <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> of any
pretext of legitimacy. We applaud the firm stand taken by the
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>, which can only serve to encourage
a return to democracy for the people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, support for human
rights and an end to the brutal <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> dictatorship.''

<TEXT>
   The government today prohibited
street demonstrations in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> until at least <DATE>June 5</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Government and Justice</ORGANIZATION> issued a communique
saying the prohibition was imposed in response to the visit next
week by delegates from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   The move came after <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> of
involvement in post-election violence <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> that left
three opposition leaders injured and one of their bodyguards dead.
   The foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>, are
due in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. They will try to promote resolution of
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s 15-month-old crisis.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> approved a resolution critical of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
de facto leader, Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, whom it held
responsible for ``abuses.''
   International observers say opposition candidates were winning
the national election on <DATE>May 7</DATE> when the government annulled the
results. Since then, there has been no decision on how to select a
replacement for acting President <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>, whose term
ends <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>.
   The government said the prohibition of marches, rallies and
demonstrations is in response to the clause in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution
calling on ``the authorities and all political forces in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to
abstain from any measure or action that could aggravate the
crisis.''
   The government communique said the prohibition will remain in
effect until the three foreign ministers present their report on
the Panamanian situation at <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
gave them until <DATE>June 5</DATE> to do so.
   Late <DATE>Friday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Terry Kneebone</PERSON>, responding
to a government communique, said the attempt to link the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government to the election-related violence was ``propaganda
foolishness.''
   Police arrested 17 Panamanians who provide security at <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Embassy</ORGANIZATION> offices, the embassy reported <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Fifteen were quickly
released, embassy officials said.
   The government said the guards were questioned as part of an
investigation into violence <DATE>May 10</DATE>, three days after the national
election.
   The 17 work for the same private security company that employed
an opposition politician's bodyguard who was killed and another who
was wounded when <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> supporters attacked members of the
opposition with sticks, pipes and rubber whips.
   The government claimed the bodyguards were trained by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
military, whose presence was bolstered when President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> recently
sent in nearly 1,900 troops to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bases to protect American
nationals in the country.
   Also <DATE>Friday</DATE>, the pro-Noriega news media attacked the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, saying
it had prostituted itself in approving a resolution critical of
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The newspaper Critica printed a half-page cartoon on <DATE>Friday</DATE>
showing a naked <PERSON>Oscar Arias</PERSON>, president of <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> and winner of
the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION>, licking the feet of a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> general.
Venezuelan President <PERSON>Carlos Andres Perez</PERSON> was shown waiting his turn
to do the same.
   The governments of Arias and <PERSON>Perez</PERSON> promoted the resolution
adopted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> that criticized <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who also is
head of the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>.
   The 17 Panamanians who were detained work for <ORGANIZATION>Tesna Protective
Services</ORGANIZATION>, an American company that operates in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> under the
name <ORGANIZATION>Minsa</ORGANIZATION>. The company provides by contract 87 employees who serve
as security personnel for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomatic offices. They are not
employees of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>.
   The bodyguard killed in the <DATE>May 10</DATE> violence was <PERSON>Alexis Guerra</PERSON>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Minsa</ORGANIZATION> employee who was on leave from the company while he protected
opposition vice presidential candidate <ORGANIZATION>Guillermo Ford</ORGANIZATION>. Among the
wounded was another bodyguard, <PERSON>Humberto Montenegro</PERSON>, who had been
employed by <ORGANIZATION>Minsa</ORGANIZATION> until early this year when he resigned to work as
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s bodyguard. The government has said five <ORGANIZATION>Defense Force</ORGANIZATION>
soldiers were injured in the melee.
   A communique issued <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> by the attorney general's
office accused the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> of lying to the media about the
detention of the 17 <ORGANIZATION>Minsa</ORGANIZATION> employees and claimed the embassy
presented the detentions as harassment.
   The statement also said ``high authorities'' of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION>
assigned Guerra and <LOCATION>Montenegro</LOCATION> to guard <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>. It claimed the two
men and other <ORGANIZATION>Minsa</ORGANIZATION> guards were trained in the use of arms and
explosives by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military units stationed in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Kneebone</PERSON> said both allegations were false. He said the embassy
conferred with the 15 who were released.

   Organization of <ORGANIZATION>American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers tentatively agreed to grant <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators an additional
month to help promote a solution to the political crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
but deferred until <DATE>Thursday</DATE> a decision on other key aspects of a
formal declaration.
   The deliberations adjourned at <TIME>1:02 a.m. EDT</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> after
negotiations that began <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> at the <ORGANIZATION>Colombian Embassy</ORGANIZATION>.
   A draft proposal calls for a transfer of power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept.
1, 1989</DATE>, and the holding of free elections in the briefest period
possible. These steps are to be carried out through ``democratic
means and in conformity with existing internal Panamanian
procedures.''
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Panamanian opposition representatives attending the
meeting expressed disappointment with the proposal, contending that
it could be interpreted by Panamanian leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>
to his advantage.
   Their comments indicated that efforts to toughen the language
would be made at the <DATE>Thursday</DATE> session to bring additional pressure
to bear on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   Addressing the meeting at <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <TIME>early evening</TIME>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON>Lawrence Eagleburger</PERSON> issued a forceful
appeal for decisive <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> action to ensure the restoration of
democratic rule in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   ``It is time to end the crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and the suffering of the
Panamanian people,'' <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON> said.
   OAS inaction would invite military leaders elsewhere in the
hemisphere to oust elected governments, he added.
   He said that drug traffickers also would be encouraged if the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
refuses to meet the challenge in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON>, a member of the
mediating team, said he believes two months of efforts by him and
his colleagues have raised the possibility of a ``national accord''
leading to a restoration of democratic rule in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   He said the basis for his hope was the contacts in recent days
between government and opposition leaders in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> aimed at
reaching a solution.
   Cordovez was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a
democratic outcome by <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>. According to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s constitution, a
new president must be sworn in by that date.
   The possibility of a national accord was alluded to in a report
the mediators submitted to the meeting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, the deadline for
the mediation team.
   Some delegates felt that the discussions in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> could lead to
a government of national reconciliation and most foreign ministers
felt there was no alterative but to extend the deadline.
   Delegates were expected to extend the mandate of the mediating
team until late <DATE>August</DATE> but there was disagreement over the precise
date and other aspects of the final declaration.
   Opposition leaders in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> they would not agree
to any such proposal for a government of national reconciliation.
   ``We are not going to betray the Panamanian people. We are not
going to accept that junta even if they give it the name of National
Reconstruction,'' said <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>, the opposition presidential
candidate in <DATE>May 7</DATE> elections.
   Intense give-and-take behind closed doors delayed the official
opening of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s meeting by about four hours. After a public
session lasting less than an hour, the meeting was recessed as
delegates continued behind-the-scenes efforts to reach a compromise
on the wording of an official declaration.
   The crisis was precipitated by the decision of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s electoral
authorities to annul the outcome of presidential elections <DATE>May 7</DATE>.
   Independent observers said the candidate opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, the
head of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, had won a landslide victory.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>May 17</DATE> appointed its mediating team to promote a
democratic ``transfer of power'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. It also blamed <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
for the ``grave events'' that occurred in connection with the
elections _ a reference to bloody attacks on opposition candidates
by government security forces.
   There was strong sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, particularly among some
South American governments, not to bring too much pressure to bear
on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter forbids interference in the internal affairs of
member countries.
   But the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, which has been a strong advocate of
using maximum pressure to force <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> out, has been saying the
charter also lists democracy as the system of government that all
member states should adhere to.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> opposition to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> also was based on drug smuggling
indictments handed down last year against him by two <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> grand
juries.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials also argued that <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> credibility in the hemisphere
could be preserved only by a strong stand against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   Opposition to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> to state <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, in
a provision added to a <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> bill, that it would not
accept any nominee for administrator of the <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal</ORGANIZATION> selected by
him.
   The treaty under which the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will turn over the canal
to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> calls for a Panamanian administrator acceptable to the
<ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> to be appointed next year by <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and confirmed by the
<ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.

   Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> told an
international delegation <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is to
blame for <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s political crisis.
   ``We told them our truth,'' the general, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto
leader, said in a brief statement after meeting with <ORGANIZATION>Organization
of American States</ORGANIZATION> delegates for 2{ hours.
   Noriega, commander of the armed forces, told a news conference
the three-hour meeting had been ``postive'' and gave the <ORGANIZATION>Defense
Forces</ORGANIZATION> ``an opportunity to express their idea about the economic
aggression .... and the foreign intervention that caused the
deterioration'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   ``Each officer spoke of his concept of this reality,'' he went
on. ``We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive
foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ....
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' he joked.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> sent about 2,000 extra <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
after the government nullified the <DATE>May 7</DATE> presidential election and
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> supporters beat up opposition candidates.
   When he was asked what he planned to do, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> thought a
second and said, ``That's the million dollar question.''
   An aide said <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> told the delegation his resignation is an
issue that would be decided by the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, not by an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
request.
   International observers say the election was won by opposition
candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> over <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s candidate, <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>.
The government said Duque won.
   The delegation, led by <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>,
included foreign ministers <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mario
Palencia</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Sahadeo Basdeo</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>.
   Earlier, the delegates met with leaders of the opposition and
the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>. Opposition leaders told the delegation
they wanted their election victory recognized and <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> retired.
   ``We want democracy and justice for the people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Endara</PERSON> said after meeting with the delegation.
   Endara and his two vice-presidential candidates, <PERSON>Ricardo Arias
Calderon</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Guillermo Ford</ORGANIZATION>, were accompanied by 300 cheering
supporters as they marched several blocks from a church to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
delegation's hotel.
   About 25 riot police wielding bullhorns peacefully dispersed the
crowd. Opposition spokesmen said one bodyguard and an <PERSON>Arias
Calderon</PERSON> aide were arrested.
   Acting president <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON> said no new elections were
possible before <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, when his term as ``minister in charge of
the presidency'' is supposed to end.
   <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON> told a meeting of bureaucrats that new balloting
could not be held because of the expense and ``because of the
psychological condition of the Panmanian people after the trauma of
the elections.''
   He suggested he would continue in office, citing an
administrative code that says a person must serve until he is
replaced.
   ``Juridically, there is no problem, but politically we will have
to define a transfer of power,'' he said, adding, ``It could
possibly be the succession of one person by another of the same
group.''
   After the nullification, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution criticizing
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest
possible time.''
   ``We want recognition of our electoral victory and the
retirement of General <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Arias Calderon</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   ``We will not betray the people. The <DATE>May 7</DATE> vote is a mandate
from God,'' said <PERSON>Endara</PERSON>. ``The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> listened but didn't want to
comment. They said they would like to meet again.''
   The march <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> marked the fourth time the opposition has
defied a government ban on demonstrations in effect until <DATE>June 5</DATE>,
when the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> commission is due to file its report.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, the Panamanian government presented its case
against the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> during a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation.
   <PERSON>Solis Palma</PERSON>'s government has said it hoped the mission would
``establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict between <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>'' and cited <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic sanctions as proof
of malice.
   The government also has proclaimed it will accept no
interference in internal Panamanian affairs and that some aspects
of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution violate the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter.
   The first street demonstrations against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s rule began in
<DATE>June of 1987</DATE>.
   Since then <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> has been indicted on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> drug charges,
charges he says are part of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plot to renege on its commitment
to give up the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> at the end of <DATE>1999</DATE>.

   A senior <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> official left <DATE>Friday</DATE>
on a four-nation visit to <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> for talks expected to
focus on the situation in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said.
   <PERSON>Bernard Aronson</PERSON>, the newly installed assistant secretary of state
for inter-American affairs, planned to visit <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>El
Salvador</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON>Aronson</PERSON> would
discuss preparations in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> for national elections next <DATE>Feb.
25</DATE>. The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has accused the Sandinista government of
trying to rig the process in its favor.
   But <PERSON>Sen. Chris Dodd</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Conn.</LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign
Relations</ORGANIZATION> subcommitttee on <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> he expects
the Nicaraguan elections will be free and fair and that the
Sandinista goverment deserves some credit from the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration.
   The consultations on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> are expected to center on next
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The ministers are scheduled to receive a report from a team of
mediators who have been trying to achieve a democratic transfer of
power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in accordance with an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mandate.
   According to the officials, <PERSON>Aronson</PERSON> briefed a number of Latin
American ambassadors on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> about the situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Aronson told the envoys that the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, consistent
with Latin American wishes, has adopted a low profile on the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
situation in the interest of seeking a resolution of the problem
through hemispheric consensus, the officials said.
   Aronson also said it would be unfortunate for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> if the
mediators failed to achieve a solution in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> that would result
in the transfer of power from Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, the
commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, to an elected civilian government,
the officials said.
   At his news conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Dodd</PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> for what
he said was its ineffective response to the situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   If the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> cannot deal with the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> problem, ``I don't think
we can get together on anything,'' he said. ``They might as well
close down the (OAS) building.''
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> has faced an uncertain political future since the results
of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> national elections were thrown out by Panamanian
authorities. Independent observers had maintained that the
presidential candidate opposed to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> scored a landslide victory.

THERE'S SOLID PRECEDENT IN SEEKING OAS CONSENSUS ON ISOLATING NORIEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANTINE C. MENGES, Constantine C. Menges, resident scholar at the 
American Enterprise Institute, was responsible for Latin America as a former 
special assistant to President Ronald Reagan. His latest book is Inside the 
National Security Council (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In <DATE>1984</DATE>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> joined the many other Latin American countries that made the 
transition from military rule to constitutional democracy during the <PERSON>Ronald 
Reagan</PERSON> years. 
</P>
<P>
But in <DATE>September, 1985</DATE>, Gen. <PERSON>Manuel A. Noriega</PERSON> forced his country's elected 
president to resign -- the first step back from the movement toward democracy 
in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>. As a member of the national security staff in the <ORGANIZATION>Reagan 
White House</ORGANIZATION>, I was unsuccessful in efforts to bring this issue before the 
President. Yet I believed then, as I do today, that the failure to help the 
people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> restore democracy would cause ever graver crises involving 
larger human and strategic costs in the future. 
</P>
<P>
After this month's fraudulent elections and the accompanying violence against 
opposition leaders, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> should use the full resources of the <LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> to help the people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> restore democracy. He has a bipartisan 
consensus about the facts in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in support of his initial diplomatic and 
military steps. 
</P>
<P>
The objective now should be the removal of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and his clique of 
collaborators with the installation of the newly elected government of the 
Panamanian democratic opposition. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should take the lead to 
accomplish this through the collective security instruments of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization 
of American States</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The first step would be a quiet process of briefing and persuasion in order to 
build a consensus among a two-thirds majority of the 32 <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> members. After that 
consensus has been obtained informally -- and with competent diplomacy this can 
be done quickly -- the issues should be presented for formal action by the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There is an important precedent, which was undertaken by the <ORGANIZATION>Jimmy Carter 
Administration</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE>. At that time, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> decided that due to the "conduct 
of the dictatorial regime governing the country . . . the spirit of hemispheric 
solidarity . . . places an unavoidable obligation on the American countries to 
. . . bring about the immediate and definitive replacement of the . . . regime 
(with the) installation . . . of a democratic government . . ." Those words 
resulted in the total isolation of the Anastasio Somoza regime in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>. 
They should be applied to the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> dictatorship today. And, also following 
the <DATE>1979</DATE> precedent, <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> diplomatic recognition should be conferred on a 
Panamanian government that represents the democratic aspirations of the people. 
</P>
<P>
With those steps having been taken and virtually all <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> member states having 
isolated <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> diplomatically and economically, efforts should then be made 
to persuade our allies in the <LOCATION>Atlantic Alliance</LOCATION> and other key Free World 
countries to do the same. With some creativity, it is possible to find ways of 
channeling economic help through the Panamanian liberation government to the 
people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> -- especially the poorest -- so that it is the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime 
that bears the principal weight of this political and economic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
With these first collective security measures in place, there should be a final 
offer to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and his clique. In the interest of avoiding further disruption 
and possible violence, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and his faction could resign with the promise 
that there would be no retribution, prosecution or confiscation of their 
current property holdings now or at any time in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If that last offer is rejected, then the <ORGANIZATION>Bush Administration</ORGANIZATION> must be prepared 
to take all necessary means to help the people of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> -- including the 
sensible majority of the Panamanian military -- accomplish the objectives of 
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution and restore democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to act until democracy is restored will consign the courageous people 
of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to servitude under a <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime that month by month has been 
moving closer into the Cuban orbit. Already <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> provides bodyguards, secret 
police and military personnel who have been training a new, more politically 
reliable (though still small) military force and have been helping <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> in 
his campaign of repression, harassment of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military personnel and with drug 
smuggling. Unless <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> acts effectively, he risks the chance of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> 
becoming the <PERSON>Moammar Kadafi</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> -- a setback for the cause of 
democracy in this hemisphere and a growing risk to the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Canal.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of eight Latin
American countries opened a conference <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at which they will
consider calling for the readmission of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION>.
   The foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> are scheduled to meet for three
days in the Colombian port city of <LOCATION>Cartagena</LOCATION>.
   Also on the agenda are peace efforts in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, British
naval drills near the <LOCATION>Falklands</LOCATION>, the region's <MONEY>$400 billion</MONEY> foreign
debt and increased policing of drug trafficking, said <PERSON>Esther Lozano
de Rey</PERSON>, chief secretary for the <ORGANIZATION>Colombian Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION>.
   The ministers make up what is called the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Eight</ORGANIZATION>,
organized last year mainly to monitor the situation in <LOCATION>Central
America</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Lozano de Rey</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> that a preliminary
agenda for the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Eight</ORGANIZATION> meeting, drawn up by assistants to
the foreign ministers, included a proposal to support <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s
re-entry into the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> was expelled from the organization in <DATE>1962</DATE>, three years
after <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> came to power.
   In a meeting of the eight Latin American countries' presidents
last <DATE>November</DATE> in <LOCATION>Acapulco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, President <PERSON>Jose Sarney</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>
told reporters that the leaders had agreed that the communist
nation should be readmitted to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. However, such a statement
was not included in a final document from the meeting.
   The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> has said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> can not
support the readmission of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> until that country stops
trying to subvert democratic rule in the hemisphere.
   At the <LOCATION>Cartagena</LOCATION> meeting, the Latin American ministers are
considering calling for an end to the British naval maneuvers that
have taken place around the <LOCATION>Falklands Islands</LOCATION> in the south <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>
since the <DATE>1982</DATE> war between <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION>Ms.
Lozano de Rey</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> invaded the islands, which it calls the <LOCATION>Malvinas</LOCATION>, but
later surrendered to the British.
   The ministers planned to discuss a statement urging wealthy
countries to fight consumption of cocaine and calling on the eight
Latin American countries to work to cut production of the drug.
   <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> are <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>'s three biggest
cocaine-producing countries.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON>Jorge Abadia</PERSON>, said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> his
government is not discounting the possibility of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military
intervention in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> because of the indictment on drug
trafficking charges of Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, head of
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s armed forces.
   If there is an invasion, ``we won't have the capacity to stop
it,'' <PERSON>Abadia</PERSON> said.
   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration publicly called for <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to step
down following his indictment this month by a federal grand jury in
<LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Abadia</PERSON> said the charges do not constitute an attack on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
but on the Panamanian military. He claimed the charges are an
attempt to break the treaty under which the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has
promised to turn the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Canal to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> by the year <DATE>2000</DATE>.
   When the meeting ends, the eight foreign ministers will head for
<LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> for a series of meetings with Central
American officials on the situation in their region.

   On the eve of a major international conference
on the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> crisis, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials believe the position of
military leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> has been severely weakened.
   ``He's in trouble,'' said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON>Arthur Davis</PERSON>, who
returned home <DATE>Monday</DATE> for an indefinite stay as part of a series of
measures taken by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in response to fraud allegations
and violence surrounding last week's Panamanian election.
   Organization of <ORGANIZATION>American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meet here on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to determine whether a common stand is possible on the
Panamanian situation.
   It will be the first special meeting of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers
since the Falkland-Malvinas crisis of <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION>House Foreign Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION> today approved on
a voice vote a resolution condemning <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s ``reprehensible
actions'' in thwarting the election and calling on him and the
Panamanian military to recognize <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> as president.
   ``Despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the
Panamanian people, all credible Panamanian and international
observers have recognized <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> as the indisputable
winner of the election,'' stated the non-binding resolution, which
was expected to be approved later in the day by the full <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION>.
   The statement also endorsed the ``careful and prudent policy
steps'' taken by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ``as an appropriate and measured response to
the crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.''
   Given the international outcry against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s actions, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
officials were cautiously optimistic that a strong stand in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
will be taken.
   Panamanian officials already have indicated that they plan to
try to portray the situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as the product of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
interventionism. A Noriega-controlled tribunal annulled the
election results <DATE>last week</DATE>, claiming outsiders had compromised the
balloting.
   A Panamanian envoy, <PERSON>Carlos Russell</PERSON>, has alleged that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
government has engaged in economic aggression against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and
spent <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY> in support of opposition candidates during the
presidential campaign.
   Davis refused to comment <DATE>Monday</DATE> when asked about the allegations.
   At least two dozen countries have spoken out against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
since the returns from the <DATE>May 7</DATE> elections were tossed out amid
charges of fraud and the beating of opposition candidates during an
anti-government demonstration.
   There is no possibility of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> but
nonetheless, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials believe an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> statement condemning
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, combined with his weakened position domestically, could
hasten his eventual departure.
   Davis spoke to reporters at <ORGANIZATION>Andrews Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE>
after a flight from <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. He said there are increasing signs that
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s situation is becoming untenable.
   One is that the government appears to lack the resources to pay
civil service employees, he said. Another is that the nominal head
of government, President <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>, has disappeared from
public view since the election.
   Before departing from <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> of directing
an attack on the life of <ORGANIZATION>Guillermo Ford</ORGANIZATION>, a vice presidential
candidate in the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election.
   After his arrival here, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> elaborated on his allegation.
   With <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> prostrate on the floor of an automobile and a
bodyguard lying on top of him for protection, a member of an armed
pro-government force known as the <ORGANIZATION>Dignity Battalion</ORGANIZATION> opened fire
into the vehicle, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. The bodyguard was killed.
   ``You don't put a gun into the side of an automobile and fire at
the people in it unless you're planning to kill somebody,'' <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>
said.
   Asked about the link to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> replied, ``Well, they're
his men. Nobody else ordered it except <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION>Dignity
Battalions</ORGANIZATION> are under his control.''
   The Dignity Battalions, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said, ``have about as much dignity
as a rat.''
   The battalions have been widely portrayed as young unemployed
thugs hired by the Panamanian government but <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said some were
<ORGANIZATION>Panamanian Defense Force</ORGANIZATION> personnel in disguise.
   <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials have photographs showing PDF personnel
changing into <ORGANIZATION>Dignity Battalion</ORGANIZATION> garb on the day <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> and other
opposition candidates were attacked.

<FP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Maria Elena Barrios</PERSON> on an interview with </F>
Panamanian President <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> by an unidentified 
reporter on the 27 <DATE>March</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general elections; in 
<LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION> on 27 <DATE>March</DATE>; from the "RPC News" newscast] 
  [Text] With 20 votes in his favor, Colombian President 
<PERSON>Cesar Gaviria</PERSON> today was elected to replace Brazilian <PERSON>Joao 
Clemente Baena Soares</PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general. Despite 
diplomatic efforts by <LOCATION>Costa Rican</LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Bernd Niehaus</PERSON> 
to secure the post for <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Niehaus</PERSON> obtained only 14 
votes, including one from <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. For our country, however, 
this was a very difficult decision, because both candidates 
hailed from neighboring countries with which we maintain good 
relations -- <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. 
  In statements to <ORGANIZATION>RPC Radio</ORGANIZATION>, Panamanian President <PERSON>Guillermo 
Endara</PERSON> voiced his belief that <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> will do a good job and 
that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> will assume a new role under his leadership. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] Although we were committed to 
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, I am certain President <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> will prove to be a 
historic <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general. I think the time during which 
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> was a dormant, inactive organization has ended. We will 
now see a new <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> as secretary general. We will 
see a dynamic <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> -- an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> that will promote democracy in the 
hemisphere, one that will promote liberty. 
  [Reporter] <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, as for <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, what expectations 
does the Panamanian Government have in the wake of the Colombian 
President's election? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Endara</ORGANIZATION>] President <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> reiterated to me -- in fact, he 
has told me repeatedly since he began his bid for the post of 
secretary general -- that regardless of how <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> voted, he 
wanted to have <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s support, much like <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> would want to 
have his support. I told him that if he was indeed elected, 
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> would support him not only during my presidency, but that 
I am certain any and all of the seven presidential candidates 
will also support him. I told him I could guarantee this 
support, because we will have a four-month transition period 
during which I hope to maintain good relations with the winner 
of the Panamanian elections. I also told him I am sure we will 
agree that the new president should support <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. 
  [Reporter] <PERSON>Mr. President</PERSON>, do you think the support the 
<LOCATION>United 
States</LOCATION> gave the Colombian president's candidacy was the decisive 
factor in today's vote? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Endara</ORGANIZATION>] No, no, no. I honestly do not think so. Our vote 
is an example. Although the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> lobbied strongly 
through diplomatic channels, I think President <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> has 
merits of his own and qualities that make him an excellent 
candidate. Gaviria, in my opinion, would have won even without 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> backing. [end recording] 
  Colombian President <PERSON>Cesar Gaviria</PERSON>, 47, will probably assume 
the post of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general in <DATE>August</DATE>.

<HEAD>OAS Makes Second Visit To Try To End Election Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mission from the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION> arrived <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for its second try at mediating the
month-old election crisis, and the legislature's speaker urged the
group to focus on what he called <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> meddling.
   The four-man delegation includes <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena
Soares</PERSON> and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission failed on its trip in <DATE>May</DATE> to negotiate an end to
the crisis, touched off when the government led by Gen. <PERSON>Manuel
Antonio Noriega</PERSON> annulled results of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> presidential election.
   International observers say that when the counting was halted the
opposition candidate had a 3-to-1 margin of victory over the one
backed by the Noriega-controlled government.
   The opposition insists <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, must
resign and that its victory be recognized. The government says
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s status is not negotiable and has proposed that a
provisional junta take power <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>, the constitutional
inauguration date.
   The speaker of the Noriega-dominated Legislative Assembly on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> made public an open letter to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> asking it to focus its
efforts on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> actions, not those of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   ``The fundamental reasons for the Panamanian crisis are rooted in
the open <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intervention in our internal affairs aimed at
maintaining hegemony in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and the region,'' <PERSON>Celso Carrizo</PERSON> said
in the letter.
   ``This intervention is carried through slander, disinformation,
economic aggression, psychological war, constant violations of the
Torrijos-Carter treaties and the threat of military attack.''
   The treaties signed in <DATE>1977</DATE> by then-presidents <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> and
<PERSON>Omar Torrijos</PERSON> cede control of the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> at the end
of the century. Noriega has long maintained the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wants
to renege on the pacts.
   The falling out between <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> began last
year when he was indicted in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on drug trafficking
charges. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> threw its support against the
anti-Noriega movement that has so far failed to budge the strongman.

<HEAD>OAS Gives Panama Mediators More Time; Panama Blames US for Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> gave a team
of mediators an additional six weeks to work out a democratic
transition in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> but a top Panamanian official said no solution
is possible so long as his country is ``permanently threatened'' by
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers met <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night to review the situation
in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> three weeks after they authorized envoys from <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> to try to work out a democratic ``transfer of
power'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   During almost four hours of debate <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, there was
little sign that the mediators had come close to fulfilling that
goal. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was their original target date and their new deadline
under the extension is <DATE>July 19</DATE>.
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON>, told reporters after the
session that his government had no intention of moving toward a
solution so long as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> maintained economic sanctions
and continually threatened <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> with the use of force.
   ``There can be no normal political process under the current
circumstances in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>,'' he said.
   The crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> grew out of the decision by authorities
there to declare national elections null and void three days after
they were held on <DATE>May 7</DATE>.
   International observers claimed that the government committed
fraud on a massive scale, depriving opponents of the
military-dominated government of a 3-1 victory at the polls. Some of
the opposition candidates were brutally beaten.
   With the scrapping of the election returns, a crisis of
legitimacy has been created, which the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has been attempting to
address. But with the passing of almost a month since the crisis
reached a peak, some of the hemispheric indignation over the
continued rule of Panamanian military leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>
has dissipated.
   <PERSON>Lawrence Eagleburger</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> undersecretary of state for
political affairs, said the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must take account of charter
provisions calling for the establishment of representative democracy
as a guiding hemispheric principle.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must show that the charter ``is not mere words,'' he said.
   Eagleburger assailed <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> and said that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must consider
``further action'' against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> if progress toward democracy is
not achieved quickly.
   ``<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is the problem,'' he said.
   <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> has become a ``guidepost'' for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators because
that is the day on which the Panamanian constitution says a new
president must take office.
   The current president is <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>, a <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> ally, but
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> recognizes the president ousted 15 months ago by
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s supporters in the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Eric Arturo Delvalle</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> recounted what he described as the series of abuses
committed by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> since <PERSON>Delvalle</PERSON>'s ouster. These
include the freezing of Panamanian assets abroad and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> refusal to
pay <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> ``a single cent'' on operations relating to the <LOCATION>Panama
Canal</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has contributed to the destruction of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
economy, <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> said.
   He noted that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> authorized the dispatch of an
additional 2,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> combat troops to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> after the
elections and said one consequence is that the ``civilian population
lives in fear'' of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military attack.
   <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> did not oppose the extension of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mandate. The only
opposition came from Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON>Miguel D'Escoto</PERSON>,
who said no extension was appropriate without the explicit support
of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended.
   The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline
but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other delegates argued that an open-ended
mission would ease pressure on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.

   When <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> foreign
ministers were scouting around last month for a date to meet in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, they settled on <DATE>July 19</DATE>, partly because Secretary of
State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> would be in town.
   But when the delegates convened here <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to talk about the
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> situation, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was occupied by other matters and stayed
away.
   Other foreign ministers from the hemisphere had traveled up to
6,000 miles to attend the meeting, but <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> didn't make the
five-block trip over to <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> headquarters from the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   The story was much the same in <DATE>June</DATE>. Ministers from around the

<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> had other issues on his agenda and sent subordinates over to
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   This does not go unnoticed by other governments, which have the
clear impression <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> is much more oriented toward <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>
than he is toward <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>.
   Indeed, just two weeks before <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> was a no-show at <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>

to attend a meeting of the six-member <ORGANIZATION>Association of Southeast
Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has 31 members.
   Shortly after taking office in <DATE>January</DATE>, he took off on a visit
to each of the European members of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and has been back to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
several times since then.
   Baker's aides acknowledge he may be gravitating toward <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> because the economic and political changes there are
generally favorable to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, especially in contrast to
<LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>, where the outlook is far bleaker.
   While the democratic trend in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> is a source of
encouragement to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, the economic situation in many
countries is disastrous and the problem of coping with drug flows
from south of the border seems insurmountable.
   Beyond that, as this week's <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> demonstrated
once again, Americans and Latin Americans just don't see things the
same way.
   A comparison between that meeting and an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting on <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> <DATE>25
years ago this week</DATE> offers convincing evidence of just how far <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
influence in the hemisphere has declined over the past generation.
   Prodded by the <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> administration a quarter-century ago, the
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic sanctions against
<LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> after concluding that <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> was responsible for fomenting

   Those were the days when anti-communist military dictators
dominated Latin American political life; they were only too willing

the Nicaraguan Contras but almost always came up empty-handed.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration is somewhat isolated on what to do about
the situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> is not a popular
figure in the hemisphere but only <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> seems to have any

   The disappointment among <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials was palpable <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
<TIME>night</TIME> when the best the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> could do on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> was a declaration

<HEAD>Military Agrees on Talks to End Political Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military has agreed to participate
in talks toward ending the political crisis involving <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>
chief Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, the government said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The military will be included in the government delegation,
Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON>Jorge Baena
Soares</PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>.
   The talks among the government, military and opposition were
proposed last week by an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission, which has made two trips to
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> since the government annulled a <DATE>May</DATE> election that foreign
observers said the opposition won handily. The government had
insisted that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, the country's de facto leader, was ``not
negotiable.'' But <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> statement, which
included excerpts from <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON>'s letter, made no mention of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON>'s letter was apparently an effort to circumvent a deadlock
caused by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>' insistence the military had nothing to do with
politics. Noriega had said talks to resolve the crisis should be
between the government and the opposition.
   Acting President <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>'s government reiterates ``its
decision to take part in a dialogue between Panamanians to try
overcome the grave problems confronting'' the nation, <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON>'s
letter said.
   The government will be represented by ``the executive branch,
which includes the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>,'' it added.
   In the letter, <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> should help draw up an
agenda for the talks ``on the basis of a concensus among those
taking part ... to serve as a basis for discussion of the Panamanian
nation's problems.''
   Opposition groups demanding that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> step down said last week
they were willing to take part in the talks.
   Noriega was indicted in <DATE>1988</DATE> by federal grand juries in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Efforts by the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to oust him, including economic sanctions against
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, have failed.
   Noriega had the legislature, which he controlled, fire President
<PERSON>Eric Arturo Delvalle</PERSON> in <DATE>February 1988</DATE>, a day after <PERSON>Delvalle</PERSON> tried to
fire <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>. The legislature then named Education Minister <PERSON>Solis
Palma</PERSON> acting president, but the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has insisted on recognizing
<PERSON>Delvalle</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s legitimate president.
   The crisis deepened when the government claimed its candidate
<PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>National Liberation Coalition</ORGANIZATION> won the
presidential election <DATE>May 7</DATE>.
   Opposition groups and foreign observers including several from
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, said there was widespread fraud in the election
and that the opposition candidate, <PERSON>Guillermo Andara</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Democratic Civilian Alliance</ORGANIZATION>, won by a 3-to-1 margin.
   As the crisis grew, a government-controlled election board
annulled the election. The government had planned to install the new
president on <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, called in to try solve the crisis, sent a delegation of
top diplomats late in <DATE>May</DATE>, then a second one <DATE>last week</DATE>, to try and
get the government, the military and the opposition to negotiate.
   The delegation, headed by <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>, included foreign
ministers <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mario Palencia</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and
<ORGANIZATION>Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad-Tobago</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>OAS Gives Six-Week Extension to Panama Mediators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION> agreed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night to give a six-week extension to
a team of mediators assigned to achieve a democratic transfer of
power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   The mediators are to report back to the foreign ministers before
<DATE>July 19</DATE>.
   <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> had been their deadline for a three-week effort to work
out a ``national accord'' in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> that would lead to a ``transfer
of power in the shortest possible time.'' Their was no indication,
though, that the mediators had made much progress.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON>Miguel D'Escoto</PERSON> opposed the extension
on grounds that it did not have the explicit support of the
Panamanian government.
   Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> raised no
objection to the proposal, under which the foreign ministers of
<LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> will undertake a return mission to
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in a bid to carry out the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mandate.
   The agreement was reached in early evening after closed-door
talks at the <ORGANIZATION>Colombian Embassy</ORGANIZATION> where delegates spent much of the day
attempting to find common ground.
   After the extension was approved, <PERSON>D'Escoto</PERSON> delivered a lengthy
speech strongly criticizing the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as an ``imperial
superpower'' which has systematically thwarted the
non-interventionist principles of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Lawrence
Eagleburger</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must take account of charter provisions
calling for the establishment of representative democracy as a
guiding hemispheric principle.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must show that the charter ``is not mere words,'' he said.
   Eagleburger assailed Panamanian leader <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> and
said that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> must consider ``further action'' against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> if
progress toward democracy is not achieved quickly.
   ``<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is the problem,'' he said.
   But <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> maintained that a ``durable solution'' to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
crisis was not possible as long as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops remain in the country
and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> does not lift the sanctions it imposed against
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> <DATE>15 months ago</DATE>.
   ``There can be no normal political process under the current
circumstances in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>,'' he told reporters after the four-hour <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
meeting, elaborating on an earlier speech he made to the gathering.
   Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended.
   The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline
but the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other delegates argued that an open-ended
mission would ease pressure on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegation, led by <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON>, had lobbied during the
closed-door consultations for the mediators to report in 15 days but
settled on six weeks.
   In a report on their initial mission to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, the mediators
contended that an extension of their <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mandate would be ``very
advisable.''
   There was no indication in the report that the mediators came
close to achieving the goals of a resolution approved by the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
mission on <DATE>May 17</DATE>. Much of the five-page report was devoted to
listing the names of Panamanians with whom the mediators met.
   The <DATE>May 17</DATE> resolution criticized <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> for the ``grave events
and abuses'' which occurred during and after the <DATE>May 7</DATE> national
elections in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Amid widespread allegations of fraud by forces loyal to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,
the government threw out the election returns, creating the crisis
of legitimacy that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has been attempting to resolve. There
also were brutal attacks on some opposition candidates by government
forces.
   One <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official said <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> is being viewed as a ``guidepost''
for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators because <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> is scheduled, under its
constitution, to change presidents that day.
   Just who the new president would be is unclear because of the
scrapping of the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election returns.
   Opposition candidate <PERSON>Guillemo Endara</PERSON> is widely believed by
international observers to have won the election. But <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s
hand-picked candidate, <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>, also claimed victory.
   <PERSON>Ricardo Arias Calderon</PERSON>, an opposition vice presidential candidate
who is in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he believes
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> should approve a resolution that shows ``respect'' for what
he claimed was the 3-1 margin of victory by the opposition.
   ``We beat the dictator at his own game,'' <PERSON>Arias Calderon</PERSON> said.

NATIONS OF THE HEMISPHERE FIND COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY TESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L. RONALD SCHEMAN, L. Ronald Scheman, former assistant secretary of the 
Organization of American States, practices law in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the tragic events in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> move the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> toward a historic 
confrontation, the moment has arrived for the nations of the Americas to act 
through the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
There is no ambiguity about the current issues. Gen. <PERSON>Manuel A. Noriega</PERSON> tried to 
use the instruments of democracy to mock democracy. He failed. His failure has 
been witnessed by the entire world. Exit polls conducted under the auspices of 
the Roman Catholic church have affirmed the will of the Panamanian people in 
favor of the opposition candidate, <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>. Two former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
Presidents, Republican <PERSON>Gerald R. Ford</PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON>, have confirmed 
the observations of all election observers that a clumsy election fraud was 
perpetrated. The outrageous brutality of last week, attacking the opposition 
leaders and other people with steel rods and iron pipes, demonstrates that the 
Panamanian military, led by <PERSON>Gen. Noriega</PERSON>, is at war with its own people. The 
aggression is as real as the more traditional aggressions by other states, only 
in this case it is by another, more insidious foe, an international drug <LOCATION>Mafia</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The nations of the Americas know that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has vital national 
interests in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. They are real and deeply felt. But it is no longer only 
the <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal</ORGANIZATION>. Two other issues give the tragedy its full meaning: drugs and 
democracy. Given the circumstances, President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has done well with his 
measured response in order to give the nations of the hemisphere time to accept 
regional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Democracies in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> are especially vulnerable to armies with guns. 
Unless they show resolve, no democracy is safe. In this case, we are in direct 
confrontation with one of the major drug criminals in the world who holds an 
entire nation hostage. Past Latin American hesitancy to countenance 
intervention in internal matters meets a severe test in the unique 
circumstances in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. A coherent hemispheric policy in favor of democracy in 
which all of the nations participate is the best protection that <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> 
could have against unilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
This is the role for the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>. Unless it stands for 
hemispheric cooperation in defense of freedom and democracy, it stands for 
nothing. The words of its charter couldn't be clearer. "The true significance 
of American solidarity . . . can only mean the consolidation on this continent 
. . . of democratic institutions, of a system of individual liberty and social 
justice based on respect for the essential rights of man . . . The solidarity 
of the American States and the high aims which are sought through it require 
the political organization of those States on the basis of representative 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Rio Treaty</ORGANIZATION> is equally unequivocal. It states that "the American regional 
community affirms . . . that peace is founded on . . . the international 
recognition and protection of human rights and freedoms . . . and on the 
effectiveness of democracy for the international realization of justice and 
security." It adds that "the obligation of mutual assistance . . . is 
essentially related to their democratic ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular mythology, the nations of the hemisphere have repeatedly 
taken firm action for democracy when faced with blatant abuse of power. Ten 
years ago, through the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, they took the courageous step to condemn the 
dictatorship of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>'s Anastasio Somoza by clearly asking him to step 
down. They did the same in the case of the military coup in <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION> <DATE>a year 
later</DATE>. Throughout the <DATE>1970s</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> was the major force to focus attention on 
human rights abuses in the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as President <PERSON>Carlos Andres Perez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> has recognized in his call 
for hemispheric action, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has been given another chance. All the rules 
and the precedents are in place. It is the nations of the hemisphere that bear 
a heavy responsibility. The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> is but an euphemism. It is the American 
governments themselves, nothing more, nothing less. The challenge is whether 
they are prepared to deal with serious issues on a multilateral basis. Will 
they move to affirm their commitment to democracy in substance as well as in 
rhetoric? From the Latin American point of view, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> could not 
have adopted a better stance to give them time to do what they have always 
claimed they were ready to do. 
</P>
<P>
A wide range of measures -- diplomatic, economic and political -- are available 
to help force Noriega from power. It would be difficult for anyone to criticize 
action to fulfill the will of the Panamanian people and place in power the 
president they have honestly elected. In recent years, the people of all the 
nations of the Americas have repeatedly staked their lives to affirm their 
commitment to democracy. The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> will not get a better second chance.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s three top opposition leaders
drew cheers from hundreds of workers as they toured a dozen
factories today, rallying supporters in defiance of a government
ban on demonstrations.
   ``We're going to visit all <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> of our supporters, one by
one,'' said <PERSON>Guillermo Ford</PERSON>, the candidate for second vice president
in the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election.
   The opposition, which international observers say won the
election by a 3-1 margin, has been rallying support in this nation
of 2.5 million to gain recognition of its claimed victory.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> last week approved a
resolution critical of Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, who as head of
the <ORGANIZATION>Panamanian Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> holds real power in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, and
called for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
   The Noriega-controlled government nullified the elections. The
opposition has asked the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to help reverse that order, and the
organization is sending a delegation to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to
investigate.
   Ford; <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON>, the opposition presidential candidate;
and vice presidential candidate <PERSON>Ricardo Arias Calderon</PERSON> were greeted
enthusiastically today at each stop in one of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s largest
industrial parks.
   Today was the third consecutive day the candidates rallied the
opposition without interference from the government despite its ban
on ``marches, meetings, public demonstrations or caravans of
vehicles.''
   The ban lasts until <DATE>June 5</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> delegation is due to
report back to the organization's headquarters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the candidates received raucous applause from 1,000
worshipers at a church 20 miles west of <LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, the three made their first campaign-style
appearances since they were assaulted by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s paramilitary
forces on <DATE>May 10</DATE>, touring a series of marketplaces in and near the
capital.
   That tour was the opposition's first attempt to rally against
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> since <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, when a general strike fizzled.
   The foreign ministers of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>, are due
in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to try to promote a resolution of the crisis.
   The candidates on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> met with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON>John Murtha</PERSON>, D-Pa.
   <PERSON>Murtha</PERSON>, leader of a team of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> observers appointed by
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> that declared the election fraudulent and <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> the
winner, was in town to visit <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops and confer with officials.
   Murtha issued another in a series of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and opposition signals
to the <ORGANIZATION>Panamanian Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> that a coup against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> would
be welcome.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ``is not interested in punishing the PDF,'' <PERSON>Murtha</PERSON> said.
``He is interested in dealing with the PDF. The target of our
dismay is the leader of the PDF.''
   Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION> in <DATE>February 1988</DATE> but has withstood all efforts by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>
to have him removed.
   He denies the charges and says they are part of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> plot to
renege on its treaty to turn the <LOCATION>Panama Canal</LOCATION> over to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> at the
end of <DATE>1999</DATE>.

   Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON>Lawrence Eagleburger</PERSON>
was preparing to present new drug charges against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> at a
special meeting <DATE>Thursday</DATE> of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said.
   The 31-nation session was set at <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> request after <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> <DATE>last
week</DATE> challenged the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration for evidence of its charges
of drug involvement against Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>.
   The 18-month unsuccessful <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> campaign to oust <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> as the
behind-the-scenes ruler in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> is getting only lukewarm support
from the hemisphere group.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers last week adopted a bland statement
expressing concern about the situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. But the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration is hoping <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON>'s response to the challenge
will put more zip in the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> approach.
   Two <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> grand juries have already indicted <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> on drug
smuggling charges. This week <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials have hinted to reporters
there is more evidence against him.
   It is not clear how far <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON> will go in documenting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
allegations since prosecutors would not want any court case
jeopardized.
   In requesting the meeting, <PERSON>William Price</PERSON>, the acting permanent
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> representative, said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> wanted to present ``a
summary of the evidence and elaboration of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
position on the critical situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.''
   Noriega attorney <PERSON>Raymond Takiff</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> demanded in a letter to
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> the right to cross-examine witnesses who were to appear
before the organization.
   The letter also asked for the ``opportunity to prove ... that the
indictments against General <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> are motivated politically
representing nothing more than `indictment dipolomacy.'''
   <PERSON>Margaret Tutwiler</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, confirmed on
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON> would focus on narcotics, but she
declined to offer any details in order ``not to pre-empt what the
Deputy Secretary will be saying tomorrow.''
   The term of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s provisional president, <PERSON>Manuel Solis Palma</PERSON>,
who was hand-picked by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, expires on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>. The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
administration and Panamanian opponents of the general are concerned
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> will name a puppet government and not hold free elections.
   With tempers rising, <PERSON>Eagleburger</PERSON> last week compared <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> to
<PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON> and derided <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> as an ``outlaw regime'' that
deserves the censure of all <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> states.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> walked out, and in a
vitriolic 2-hour rebuttal, Panamanian delegate <PERSON>Romulo Escobar
Betancourt</PERSON> blamed the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for lack of progress toward a
political solution.
   ``If you have any evidence to show Gen. <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> is involved in
drug trafficking, bring it here to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON>Escobar</PERSON> said.
   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>British Foreign</ORGANIZATION> office on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> urged <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>
to step down and ``open the way to a peaceful, democratic resolution
of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s problems.''

   One of the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>'s most experienced
<LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> hands is in line to become ambassador to the
<ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION> as part of an administration effort
to revitalize that institution, according to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials.
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is expected to appoint <PERSON>Luigi Einaudi</PERSON>, 52, a
right-hand man to the last six assistant secretaries of state for
inter-American affairs, to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> post, succeeding former
Ambassador <PERSON>Richard McCormack</PERSON>. The officials who confirmed <ORGANIZATION>Einaudi</ORGANIZATION>'s
prospective appointment asked not to be identified.
   One of a handful of intellectuals at the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>,
<PERSON>Einaudi</PERSON> has a doctorate in political science from <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION> and is a
recipient of the highest award in the career public service.
   He was once called by former Secretary of State <PERSON>George P. Shultz</PERSON>
``the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>'s leading expert on U.S.-Latin American
relations.''
   Because of budgetary constraints partly brought on by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
failure to meet its quota commitments, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has been forced to
negotiate early retirement for about 300 of its estimated 1,000
employees over the past several weeks.
   The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has promised to seek full funding for
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1990</DATE> and is showing support in other ways.
   As an example, Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> had a
private meeting recently with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena
Soares</PERSON>. Officials said they could not recall <PERSON>Shultz</PERSON> ever having had
such a meeting during his seven years as secretary of state.
   The administration also has been looking to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to play an
active role in monitoring the political process under way in
<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> that is scheduled to result in national elections next
<DATE>February</DATE>.
   A generation ago, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> was at the center of political debate
in the hemisphere. It imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic
sanctions against <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> in <DATE>1964</DATE> for attempting to promote revolution
in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. It also was deeply involved in the diplomatic process
that followed the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion of the <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION> the
following year.
   However, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has been at the periphery of events for much of
this decade, playing little or no role in such issues as the
Malvinas-Falklands War of <DATE>1982</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> invasion of <DATE>1983</DATE> and
the conflicts in <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials said <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> envisions a stronger role for the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
under <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> as part of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> shift in emphasis toward multi-lateral
diplomacy.

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has been drifting away from the
go-it-alone Latin American policies favored by the previous
administration and his cautious approach was underscored in
addressing the crisis in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker</PERSON> appear to have
concluded that the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration failed to achieve its
goals in the region because it refused to take into account the
wishes of either the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> or of hemispheric countries.
   So the emphasis has been on working with both in the hopes of
coming up with more effective policies. A bipartisan agreement with
the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> already is in place on <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> consulted
closely with lawmakers this past week after the situation in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
became tumultuous.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the will of the Panamanian people was thwarted by
``massive fraud'' in the immediate aftermath of <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s election
and by the subsequent decision of Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> to
throw out the returns. He also condemned the violence directed at
opposition leaders on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   In support of the American ``commitment to democracy'' in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> announced a seven-step plan the following day which
won plaudits from both the Democratic and Republican leadership of
both houses of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   But little of what <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> did seemed to pose a threat to <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>.
Some of the measures will have no effect at all, including the
president's recall of Ambassador <PERSON>Arthur Davis</PERSON>.
   A recall of an ambassador is often used in diplomacy to register
displeasure with the country in question but <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> has had no
contact at all with the Noriega-led government in more than 14
months.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, however, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> seemed to be trying to turn up the
heat on Noriega by <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, saying, ``The Panamanian people should
do everything to get him out of office.''
   Speaking with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> One, the president
declined to back away from his words when reporters raised
questions about the strength of his language.
   ``No, I would add no words of caution,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> replied. ``The
will of the people should be implemented.''
   At another point, the president said: ``I would love to see him
out of there, we'd like to see him out. The will of the people
should not be thwarted by this man and his ... thugs.''
   He said he was making the statement to make clear to the
Panamanian people that they still had the affection of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>.
   He said sending additional <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military personnel into <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
should not be viewed as outside intervention and said ``we would
have good relations with the Panamanian people and the PDF'' _ the
military _ if <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> were thrown from office.
   The most controversial measure announced by <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was the
dispatch of a brigade of American military personnel but he linked
that move to the need to protect American citizens in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, not
to promote democracy there.
   No new economic sanctions were announced against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>
merely said existing sanctions will continue in force.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> ruled out a more heavy-handed approach, realizing there are
few issues around which Latin Americans rally more quickly than
opposition to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interventionism. Thus, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> rejected use of
force against <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> as well as the scrapping of the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> Canal
treaties.
   There was little support in the administration for a total trade
embargo against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. That approach would set back <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s
economy for years _ damaging <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investment in the process _ with
no guarantee <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> would be forced out,
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> appeared to place his strongest hopes for a democratic
outcome in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on diplomacy but made it clear the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>
will leave it to other countries to take the lead.
   ``The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> strongly supports, and will cooperate with
initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address the
crisis,'' <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said.
   Less than 24 hours after <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> spoke, the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of
American States</ORGANIZATION> permanent council convened to take up a Venezuelan
proposal to hold an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meeting on the <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>
situation.
   At the conclusion of the two-hour session, the 31 delegates
unanimously approved a meeting for this coming <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>. This will
be perhaps the first major test for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s stated
preference for diplomatic approaches.
   In a speech two weeks ago, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> alluded to the widespread
desire for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to forgo unilateral measures but
cautioned alternative approaches may have drawbacks as well.
   ``All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to
the region's conflicts now have a responsibility to prove this is
the best and the surest route to achieve our common goals,'' he
said.
   Privately, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials are skeptical that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting
will conclude with an unambiguous condemnation of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s rule in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   Although the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> charter calls representative democracy ``an
indispensable condition'' for peace in the hemisphere, it also
stresses that the principle of non-intervention must be respected
as well.
   This latter point was emphasized repeatedly during <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s
permanent council meeting, with countries as diverse as <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> alluding to it.
   In the days prior to the meeting, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> delegates will be
lobbying hard for a resolution which, at a minimum, denounces
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, while other delegates will be attempting to promote as
bland a declaration as possible.
   It is generally agreed that failure by the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to confront
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> squarely on the events of this past week could lead to a
reassessment of the administration's goal of governing on the basis
of broad consensus rather than unilateral action.

<FP=106> [Report by <PERSON>Rafael Candanedo</PERSON>] </F>
  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, 10 Jun (EFE) -- <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s readmission into 
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> is no longer viewed as a taboo issue within the 
organization, but its debate will be delayed and may be included 
in the agenda of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> general assembly in <DATE>1995</DATE>. 
  The 34 delegates to the 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> -- the 
main 
forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which 
will close on 10 <DATE>June</DATE> -- have addressed the possibility of 
readmitting <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> with a businesslike approach, 
although without much enthusiasm. 
  The 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, which is hosted by the city 
of 
<LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Para State</ORGANIZATION>, is chaired by Brazilian Foreign Minister 
<PERSON>Celso Amorim</PERSON>. It is in its final stage and is now being 
attended by second level delegates because most of the 
respective foreign ministers have already returned home. 
  Considering <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> is the only Latin American country excluded 
from the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, Amorim viewed as significant the fact that the 
Cuban issue is no longer viewed as taboo and that it may be 
included in the agenda of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. 
  A senior <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official of one Andean country 
rhetorically asked: "Why is it that the Cold War has ended and 
yet <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> continues to be excluded from the Inter-American 
political system, which is regarded as universal and 
pluralistic"? [passage omitted] 
  OAS Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON>, whose 10-year 
tenure 
will conclude on 20 <DATE>June</DATE> when he will be replaced by Colombian 
President <PERSON>Cesar Gaviria</PERSON>, told reporters that a slight majority 
of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> member states favor a debate on the "Cuban issue." 
  Brazilian President <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON> immediately endorsed the 
initiative. The foreign ministers and delegates of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>, 
<LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Bolivia</LOCATION>, among others, followed suit. 
[passage omitted] 
  <LOCATION>Costa Rican</LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Fernando Naranjo</PERSON> went as far as 
to announce at a plenary session that he is willing to negotiate 
among the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, some Latin American countries, the 
<ORGANIZATION>Havana Government</ORGANIZATION>, and the Cuban opposition in exile, seeking to 
promote the democratization of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. 
  One South American diplomat said the situation is 
complicated 
because of the extreme polarization of positions and of the 
radical stance of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, which does not conceal its 
interest in having President <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> step down. 
  Three positions can be identified among Latin American 
countries: First, a pro-U.S. position, which is endorsed by 
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION>, and other Central American countries; 
second, a current -- which includes the <ORGANIZATION>Caribbean Community</ORGANIZATION> 
(<ORGANIZATION>Caricom</ORGANIZATION>) -- that promotes peaceful coexistence with <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and 
its readmission into the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>; and third, a current that respects 
Cuban self-determination, as advocated by the <ORGANIZATION>Group of Three</ORGANIZATION> 
(<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>). 
  The Brazilian position, which is close to that of the <ORGANIZATION>Group 
of Three</ORGANIZATION>, watches with satisfaction Cuban economic reform, the 
opening toward the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>, the renovation of the 
<ORGANIZATION>Communist Party of Cuba</ORGANIZATION>'s cadres that has been implemented in 
recent months by <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>, and the talks held in <DATE>April</DATE> by 
<PERSON>Castro</PERSON>'s government with opposition groups in exile. 
  Amorim said that these moves may promote democratization, 
which could be jeopardized if <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> remains isolated. 
  He added: "Perhaps <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> should make more significant 
gestures. It is more significant to stretch out one's hand than 
to slam the door in someone's face."

<FP=106> [By <PERSON>Luis Enrique Vasquez</PERSON>] </F>
  [Excerpts] <LOCATION>Panama City</LOCATION>, 27 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Panamanian 
President <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> said here today that, with his 
Colombian colleague <PERSON>Cesar Gaviria</PERSON> in the post of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary 
general, the organization will wake up and become more dynamic 
for the benefit of all people on the continent. 
  "Under the leadership of President <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON>, we will have a 
new <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> -- one as dynamic as its new secretary general," <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> 
told <ORGANIZATION>NOTIMEX</ORGANIZATION> in an interview. Endara added that the people of 
the continent will have "a great servant" in <LOCATION>Gaviria</LOCATION>, who is 
known for his great abilities and charm. 
  <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> said: "The days of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> being a somewhat sleepy 
organization have ended. We will truly see a new <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>. I 
congratulate President <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> and offer him <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s full 
support during his tenure." 
  In the past, Panamanian politicians and journalists have 
criticized the American organization for having maintained "an 
extremely submissive" position toward the regime of General 
<PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>. In <DATE>1989</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Civic Democratic 
Opposition Alliance</ORGANIZATION> (ADOC) asked the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> to issue a resolution 
condemning the <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> regime and recognizing <PERSON>Endara</PERSON>'s triumph 
in the <DATE>May</DATE> general elections; this, however, never occurred. 
[passage omitted on <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON>'s biographical data, background 
material on the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> election] 
  Although <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s vote was committed to <PERSON>Niehaus</PERSON> last year, 
<PERSON>Endara</PERSON> said <PERSON>Gavira</PERSON> was a "great candidate" to occupy the post. 
"President <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON> is very suitable for this post," the 
Panamanian president told <ORGANIZATION>NOTIMEX</ORGANIZATION> over the telephone from his 
presidential residence, where he is resting today. 
  <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> said he urged <PERSON>Niehaus</PERSON> to not feel discouraged by his 
failure to win the post of <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general, and he also 
urged him to offer his support to <PERSON>Gaviria</PERSON>. 
  "I hope this defeat will not discourage him from continuing 
his great efforts for the sake of the entire continent," <PERSON>Endara</PERSON> 
added.

<FP=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] OAS Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> called for 
<LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s full reinstatement to the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> during a speech he 
delivered at the inaugural session of the 24th <ORGANIZATION>OAS Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, 
which began today and concludes <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Belem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>. 
  The nineties are not the sixties, <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON> said in 
reference to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s suspension from the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1962</DATE>, when the 
<ORGANIZATION>East-West</ORGANIZATION> conflict was raging. He also recalled the efforts he 
made a long time ago in favor of having the measure reexamined. 
  After serving two consecutive mandates for a total of 10 
years as the regional organization's general secretary, <PERSON>Baena 
Soares</PERSON> stressed that during his tenure, peace was restored in 
the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, and yet, at the same time, there was growing 
dissatisfaction over persistent difficulties and increasing 
poverty. 
  <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON> also spoke of his failed efforts to restore 
<LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>'s constitutional President <PERSON>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</PERSON> to 
power, but he admitted the organization had not exhausted every 
peaceful means to try to force the aggressors against democracy 
and against the Haitian people to give up power. The outgoing 
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general expressed his resolve to continue 
supporting efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the 
Haitian crisis. 
  Meanwhile, <PERSON>Itamar Franco</PERSON>, president of the host country 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, addressed the foreign ministers and representatives of 
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>' 34 member-countries. He praised <PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>' efforts 
and predicted that new Secretary General <PERSON>Cesar Gaviria</PERSON> will also 
derive positive results from equally hard work.

<FP=106> [Interview with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> by </F>
<PERSON>Carlos Banales Marino</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO</ORGANIZATION> correspondent in 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>; date not given] 
  [Text] [<PERSON>Banales Marino</PERSON>] What are the differences between 
the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> you encountered 10 years ago and the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> you are leaving 
now? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Baena Soares</ORGANIZATION>] I am very pleased with the fact that I was 
able to be present at the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> during a period of reaffirmation 
and modernization of our organization. I am leaving an 
organization that is prominent; able to meet new challenges; has 
been strengthened by member countries' political will; is able 
to react to attacks on democratic processes; and is prepared to 
cope with serious problems involving trade, environment, illegal 
drug abuse, and all those issues currently worrying the modern 
world. All the governments represented at the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> have been 
elected in free elections and this represents a huge difference 
from the situation 10 years ago. 
  [<PERSON>Banales Marino</PERSON>] Are we entitled to say that the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has 
matured as an international organization throughout these 10 
years? 
  [<PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>] I believe it has improved. This organization 
was established in <DATE>1889</DATE>. Afterward, our countries met 
periodically until the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Charter was voted on in <DATE>1948</DATE>. And 
this may be the date when the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> was formally established. It 
is not possible to say that an organization established more 
than 100 years ago is not mature. I would prefer to say that 
this was a period of reaffirmation of our organization as a 
mechanism for dialogue among countries in our hemisphere. 
  [<PERSON>Banales Marino</PERSON>] At this moment and with the current <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> 
structure, do you believe the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> has more mechanisms available 
to improve <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION>'s political and social perspectives? 
  [<ORGANIZATION>Baena Soares</ORGANIZATION>] No doubt. I believe these mechanisms involve 
the three reforms of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Charter and the approval of such a 
new idea as integral development. 
  [<PERSON>Banales Marino</PERSON>] During your tenure as <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> secretary general 
there were a number of crises in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> in which the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> 
became strongly involved. In your opinion, which one was the 
most delicate? 
  [<PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>] I believe the entire peace process in <LOCATION>Central 
America</LOCATION> represented a very significant participation effort by 
our organization. We are involved in various stages of a process 
in <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>. Understandably, this is 
absolutely necessary from a humanitarian viewpoint--in the first 
place--and considering a country's economic interests, job 
openings, and the use of land. 
  When democracy was under attack, we created a favorable 
atmosphere with our participation, but I am aware of the fact 
that the decisions to restore democracy are made by the people. 
It is not the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> but the people who guarantee democracy. The 
inter-American community, through the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>, may actually 
cooperate, assist, and create a favorable atmosphere. In <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, 
we still have problems. I am used to saying that the mere fact 
that there still are problems is something essential because, if 
you look back, 15 years ago there were people like <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> and 
<ORGANIZATION>Generals Nanfir</ORGANIZATION> and Avril. There was a different reaction, one 
of approval. Now there is one of rejection. Not a single 
American country has recognized the de facto authorities in 
three years. Moreover, there has always been an adverse 
reaction, seeking a solution. What are the roots, the profound 
reasons for this crisis? 
  The links between entrepreneurs and the military are at the 
root of the crisis because the entrepreneurs never accepted the 
elections, never accepted the presence of President <PERSON>Aristide</PERSON>. 
And as long as we do not tackle the cause of an illness, it 
cannot be cured. 
  [<PERSON>Banales Marino</PERSON>] Do you believe the embargo on <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>, the 
way 
it is currently being implemented, represents a final solution? 
  [<PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>] As long as some entrepreneurs are allowed to 
travel abroad, do business, and carry out transactions with 
their foreign accounts, we will be doing something that does not 
directly affect the people responsible. Therefore, I am saying 
that not all our organization's and its member countries' 
resources have been exhausted. Attempts already have been made 
to achieve an agreement. We already have four agreements signed. 
These agreements have not been respected at either the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> or 
the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>. Therefore, solutions may not be invented. In 
my opinion, a military intervention does not represent a 
solution. We must not forget that in the past <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> was occupied 
for 19 years. Duvalier's period, and not democracy, followed 
this occupation. The consequences of the <PERSON>Duvalier</PERSON> period still 
can be seen. 
  [<PERSON>Banales Marino</PERSON>] What about <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>? 
  [<PERSON>Baena Soares</PERSON>] <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> is a country that belongs to this 
hemisphere. The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> is this hemisphere's international 
organization that may not ignore any situation prevailing in 
this hemisphere. We currently are experiencing many changes in 
the international system. There are transformations that must be 
taken into account. All this represents a clue for discussion of 
this issue. I cannot anticipate the stances to be taken by the 
governments, but I can actually point out that it is necessary 
to hold this discussion. This issue has not been included on the 
<ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>'s agenda but it obviously is present.

<TEXT>
   Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON>, who has
been out of public view since the <DATE>May 7</DATE> elections and resulting
violence led to international calls for his ouster, appeared before
about 1,000 chanting supporters <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   But the beaming <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> chief, wearing a white
``guayabera'' tropical shirt and gray pants, did not respond to
calls by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>
for him to give up his control of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s government.
   He did not address the gathering. When reporters asked how many
years he could continue in power, he laughed and said, ``That's a
good question.''
   Noriega appeared at a rally called ``In support of the <ORGANIZATION>National
Liberation Project</ORGANIZATION>'' at the government's Atlapa Convention center.
   ``The people united shall never be defeated!'' and ``<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>,
for sure, hit the Yankees hard!'' chanted the general's admirers as
he waved.
   The government nullified the presidential elections, which the
opposition and government candidates both claimed to have won,
after <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> supporters beat up the opposition candidates.
   Official media said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>
has neither the right nor authority to negotiate a change in
<LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s government or <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s departure.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration is
prepared to urge stepped-up pressure on <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> if he ignores an
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> call to give up power.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> applauded the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> call.
   ``This is a great step forward,'' said Panamanian Archbishop
<PERSON>Marcos McGrath</PERSON>. ``I'm gratified that the organization has taken
this seriously and that it is bringing to bear its influence,
counsel, exhortations and, to a certain extent, threats.''
   Also <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <PERSON>Luis Anderson</PERSON>, a member of the nine-member
directorate of the <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal Commission</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1983</DATE>, resigned to
protest what he said was government brutality and violations of
civil rights.
   In his resignation letter to acting President <PERSON>Manuel Solis
Palma</PERSON>, he condemned ``the actions of your government against
civilians and opposition leaders, whose peaceful protests were met
with savage and bestial use of force.''
   <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> was the second Panamanian member to resign this year.
The directorate comprises five <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens and four Panamanians.
   At a special meeting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION>
foreign ministers said power should be transferred through
democratic means in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. They left the details to a mediation
team consisting of the foriegn ministers of <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>.
   Senior <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials met with Latin American diplomats <DATE>Thursday</DATE>
to discuss strategy for dealing with <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> if he refuses to
cooperate with <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mediators.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Jorge Ritter</PERSON> promised on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>
that his government will cooperate fully with the mediators, but
there was little expectation in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that negotiations will
go smoothly.
   Opposition leaders interpreted the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution as a demand
for the departure of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, who has commanded the 15,000-member
<ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1983</DATE> and is de facto ruler of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.
   ``It is important to note that the resolution speaks of a
transfer of power and that it insists that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> must retire,''
said <PERSON>Ricardo Arias Calderon</PERSON>, opposition candidate for first vice
president in the <DATE>May 7</DATE> election, which the government annulled.
   On the government's <ORGANIZATION>Radio Nacional</ORGANIZATION>, commentator <PERSON>Rigoberto
Paredes</PERSON> countered that the ministers ``must not come with the
proposal that <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> leave, because that is an internal Panamanian
affair.''
   He rejected installation of ``a puppet government of the <LOCATION>United
States</LOCATION>,'' a reference to the opposition coalition, which claims its
candidate <PERSON>Guillermo Endara</PERSON> won the presidential election 3-1.
   Paredes is an influential member of the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> and
former secretary-general of the government <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Revolutionary
Party</ORGANIZATION>.
   If the foreign ministers visit <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, he said, their purpose
should be to discuss ``the war of aggression the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is
waging against us'' and the freeing of Panamanian funds frozen in
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> banks since <DATE>last year</DATE>.
   Arias Calderon noted that the three-member commission has until
<DATE>June 6</DATE> to file a report. If <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> does not accept the report, he
said, the stage will be set for more sanctions against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> by
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> members.
   Those who oppose <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> have been unable to keep
sustained pressure on him and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sanctions have not driven him
out. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> began trying get rid of Noriega after he was
indicted last year on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> drug charges he denies.
   The <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> resolution calls for ``full respect for the sovereign
will of the Panamanian people.'' Over objections by <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, language was added blaming <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> by name for ``grave
events and abuses.''
   The government newspaper La Critica implied the resolution only
passed because the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> promised to pay the <MONEY>$51 million</MONEY> it
owes the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> before the <DATE>end of 1989</DATE>.
   Panamanian opposition leaders had hoped the <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> would impose
sanctions amounting to a diplomatic and political quarantine unless
the government recognized the opposition candidates as winners of
the election.
   The government claimed its candidate, <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>, had a 2-1
lead over <LOCATION>Endara</LOCATION> when it stopped the vote count <DATE>May 10</DATE> and
nullified the election.

   The government insisted <DATE>Monday</DATE> that
Gen. <PERSON>Manuel Antonio Noriega</PERSON> would not step down as <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s de facto
leader, complicating talks with the opposition on resolving the
nation's political crisis.
   Earlier, government representatives had said they were willing to
listen to a proposal for <ORGANIZATION>Noriega</ORGANIZATION>'s departure. The negotiations began
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> under sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION>Organization of American States</ORGANIZATION>.
   The discussions mark the first time since the annulled <DATE>May 7</DATE>
elections that the opposition has met with representatives of
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>, pro-government parties and the executive branch.
   Despite disagreements the groups agreed on an agenda in the talks
mediated by <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> diplomats.
   A government representative said negotiations will resume when
the opposition delegates return from an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> meeting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   The items listed on the agenda by the opposition include the
removal of <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> as chief of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, defining
what is meant by transfer of power, the elections that international
observers said the opposition won by a 3-1 margin, and human rights
violations.
   Government and military representatives listed as their agenda
items an end to what they called <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agression and military threats
against <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>; withdrawal of additional <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops sent to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>;
the return of Panamanian funds being held by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>;
strict compliance with the <DATE>1977</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal Treaties</ORGANIZATION> that provide
for <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to gain full control over the canal at the end of <DATE>1999</DATE>,
and no <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s political affairs.
   ``The main differences are over fundamental issues,'' said
<PERSON>Ricardo Arias Calderon</PERSON> during a break in the second day of talks.
Calderon was an opposition vice presidential candidate in the <DATE>May</DATE>
vote.
   <PERSON>Carlos Duque</PERSON>, the government party candidate, said during the
break: ``Noriega is not negotiable.''
   Before the session began, <PERSON>Duque</PERSON> said government representatives
would consider <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s departure but they also want two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
generals to leave and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> sanctions to end.
   ``We will bring the evidence to defend <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s case,'' <PERSON>Duque</PERSON>
said. ``They can bring it up as we could bring up the departure of
Gen. (<PERSON>Marc</PERSON>) <PERSON>Cisneros</PERSON> and Gen. (Fred) <PERSON>Woerner</PERSON>, and an end to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
economic aggressions and the withdrawal of the additional <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
troops sent to <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>.''
   Woerner heads the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Command</ORGANIZATION>, which includes all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
military installations in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>. Cisneros is commander of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
troops charged with the defense of the <ORGANIZATION>Canal</ORGANIZATION>.
   Cisneros often is criticized locally for his anti-Noriega
statements and the military maneuvers and exercises his forces
conduct.
   The opposition had refused to take part in talks unless
representatives of the military also took part; <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s position
was that the problem was one for politicians to solve and that he
would remain as head of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Forces</ORGANIZATION>, come what may.
   The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government also is opposed to <LOCATION>Noriega</LOCATION>, whom it has
indicted on drug-related charges and accused of domestic repression.
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> to force
<PERSON>Noriega</PERSON>'s ouster and has increased its military forces for
protection of the <ORGANIZATION>Panama Canal</ORGANIZATION>.
   The meeting was arranged by an <ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> mission led by foreign
minister <PERSON>Diego Cordovez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>. Other members of the mission are
<ORGANIZATION>OAS</ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON>Joao Baena Soares</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>, Guatemalan
Foreign Minister <PERSON>Mario Palencia</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Sahadeo Basdeo</PERSON>, Foreign
Minister of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION>.
   The group said it would leave for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to submit
a report to the organization the following day.
   While <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s meeting was in progress, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> attended a
session of the <ORGANIZATION>State Council</ORGANIZATION>, which is studying a proposal for
forming a junta after <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> when the current government's term
ends.
   As he left the meeting, <PERSON>Noriega</PERSON> was asked about the country's
political situation. He said nothing but reached into the seat of
his car and, smiling, took out a police club and waved it at
journalists.
