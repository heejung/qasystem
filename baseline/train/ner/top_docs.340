CLIMB PIKES PEAK FOR FAMOUS VIEW OF A STUNNING AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt you know that it bears the best-known name of any mountain in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
What you probably don't know, unless you've made the spectacular, winding trip 
to the top, is that the snow-capped massif called Pikes Peak also offers the 
most famous vista to be seen from any American mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Looking eastward from the summit of Pikes Peak, 14,110 feet above sea level, 
you see an endless expanse of spacious skies stretching over amber waves of 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
When you turn around and gaze west, you see purple mountain majesties above the 
fruited plain. And as you look over this scenic splendor, you know for certain 
that you have found <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> the beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
If those descriptive phrases sound familiar, they should. For it was here on 
the summit of Pikes Peak, in the Front Range of the <ORGANIZATION>Colorado Rockies</ORGANIZATION> just 20 
miles west of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, that a <ORGANIZATION>Wellesley College</ORGANIZATION> professor named 
<PERSON>Katharine Lee Bates</PERSON> was moved to write the poem that has become the national 
anthem of our nation's physical grandeur: "America the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed about <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> since the <DATE>July day in 1893</DATE> when <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> traveled 
to the summit and was instantly inspired to create her moving hymn. Happily, 
though, the view from atop <LOCATION>Pikes Peak</LOCATION> has not changed much at all. 
</P>
<P>
All the wonders that sent <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> scrambling for pen and paper are still here to 
see. The rolling waves of grain fields to the east still glisten a deep amber 
beneath a mid-summer sun. And the imposing mountain majesties off to the west 
-- ridge after ridge of snowcapped ranges -- really do look purple against the 
dark blue <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain</ORGANIZATION> sky. 
</P>
<P>
Thus if you're searching for a travel destination that will prove -- either to 
yourself or to your kids -- that this country is still <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> the beautiful, 
you can't go wrong by planning a trip to southern <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and a trek to the 
top of Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
There were three ways to get to the top of the Peak when <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> made the trip: 
by foot, by train and by carriage. The same three ways are available today, 
except that the horse-drawn carriage that took <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> and her party up the Pikes 
Peak Highway has been replaced by the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you choose to hike, the trip today is quick and relatively easy. A round 
trip on the Cog Railway that chugs up the mountain's east face takes three 
hours and 10 minutes, including a little less than an hour at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Driving the steep, winding 20-mile highway takes about an hour each way. Which 
means you will probably spend just half a day visiting <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most famous 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it hadn't been lucky enough to be given a memorably alliterative name, 
Pikes Peak would almost certainly have become a famous natural feature. This is 
a simple fact of geography. 
</P>
<P>
Pikes Peak is the easternmost of the "fourteeners" -- the elite category of 
American mountains reaching higher than 14,000 feet. As such, it was the first 
to be "discovered" when the white man began exploring the mountain west nearly 
two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, <PERSON>Zebulon Montgomery Pike</PERSON>, was dispatched in <DATE>1806</DATE> to head 
an exploratory troop mapping the lower reaches of the <LOCATION>Louisiana Purchase</LOCATION> -- 
sort of a southern version of the <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Following the <LOCATION>Arkansas River</LOCATION> west from the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> and his men spent 
week after redundant week traversing the empty flatlands of the high plains. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on <DATE>Nov. 16, 1806</DATE>, on an eastern <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> meadow about 120 miles from the 
present city of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pike</LOCATION> looked up to the west and saw "a small 
blue cloud." 
</P>
<P>
As they came closer, the soldiers gradually realized that this spot on the sky 
was really a massive, snow-draped mountain. Thanks to the prerogatives of rank, 
the peak was eventually named for the commanding officer of the troop that 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
That enormous mountain marks an abrupt shift in the topography of the 
continent. Here the flat, featureless meadowland of middle <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> gives way to 
the wrinkled spine of <LOCATION>Rocky Mountains</LOCATION> that make up the <ORGANIZATION>Continental Divide</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
And the change occurs with dramatic suddenness. With just a few low foothills 
before it, Pikes Peak juts up abruptly from the plains to scratch the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the nation's easternmost alp quickly became a powerful symbol of 
the rugged West -- "the most celebrated peak in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," as the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION> 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
When the gold seekers of <DATE>1859</DATE> set out from <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, their wagons were 
emblazoned with the famous slogan, "Pikes Peak or Bust." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, railroad interests created a resort city, <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, at the 
base of the mountain to help draw tourists. Hiking trails, the cog railroad and 
a narrow carriage road were constructed on the mountain to carry visitors to 
the peak of the Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was only natural when <PERSON>Katharine Lee Bates</PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION>Springs</LOCATION> to 
teach a <DATE>summer</DATE> school course at <ORGANIZATION>Colorado College</ORGANIZATION> -- one of her faculty 
colleagues that <DATE>summer</DATE> of '93 was a political scientist from <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> named 
<PERSON>Woodrow Wilson</PERSON> -- that she should set aside a day to travel to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
When she alighted from her carriage at the top, <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> wrote later, she stood 
still for "an ecstatic moment" drinking in "the most glorious scenery I ever 
beheld." 
</P>
<P>
"As I was looking out over the sealike expanse of fertile country spreading 
away so far under those ample skies," <PERSON>Bates</PERSON> recalled afterward, "the opening 
lines of the hymn floated into my mind . . . Oh beautiful for spacious skies, 
for amber waves of grain. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Today, <PERSON>Katharine Lee Bates</PERSON> (1859-1929) is well remembered in the environs of 
<LOCATION>Pikes Peak</LOCATION>. If you stop to visit the campus of <ORGANIZATION>Colorado College</ORGANIZATION>, a lovely green 
oasis near the heart of downtown <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, you can see a mural honoring 
her poem in the school's Shove Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
And in the small gift shop/rest house at the top of the mountain, there's an 
author's holograph of "America the Beautiful" in <PERSON>Bates</PERSON>'s own hand. 
</P>
<P>
If you're traveling from the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> to Pikes Peak, you'll probably stop in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> 
and then drive the 70 miles to <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>. If the sky is clear -- a rare 
occurrence in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> these days -- you'll see the Peak poking its snowy face 
skyward due south of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> airport as your plane comes in to land. 
</P>
<P>
Driving south along Interstate 25, you'll begin to get marvelous vistas of the 
majestic mountain about 20 miles out of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. For my money, the view from the 
north is the most dramatic way to see Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
The great white mountain (it is snow-covered about 42 weeks of the year) 
hunkers there on the horizon like a great white whale, its long ridge rising 
gradually to the sharp peak. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, I-25 skirts the campus of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force 
Academy</ORGANIZATION>, nestled in against the jagged hills of the <ORGANIZATION>Rampart Range</ORGANIZATION> on the 
eastern slope of the <ORGANIZATION>Rockies</ORGANIZATION>. There's a well-marked overlook here that offers a 
stunning view of the eastern face of the Peak, the face that <PERSON>Zebulon Pike</PERSON> first 
saw from his vantage point out on the plains. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, it's a 10-minute drive westward on Route 24 to 
the little tourist town of <LOCATION>Manitou Springs</LOCATION>, where most of the routes up Pikes 
Peak begin. 
</P>
<P>
Intrepid hikers might choose to trek to the top on the <ORGANIZATION>Barr Trail</ORGANIZATION>, a 
well-marked but extremely demanding hiking route laid out by <PERSON>Fred Barr</PERSON> from 
<DATE>1914</DATE> to <DATE>1918</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Forest Service</ORGANIZATION>, thousands of people start the trip every year 
and a few hundred finish it. It's roughly 12 miles of hiking -- no technical 
climbing required -- with some incredibly steep sections and scores of 
switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people turn back early, because the first four miles are quite tough, 
and down there below timberline there's not much view of the peak. Those hikers 
who make it all the way generally plan on a two-day round trip, with a stopover 
at <ORGANIZATION>Barr Camp</ORGANIZATION>, four miles and 4,000 feet below the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regular hikers are the members of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>' Ad-Am-An (i.e., 
"add a man") Club. This fraternal organization adds one member each year. The 
neophyte must pass initiation by climbing to the top on New Year's Eve, when 
the club sets off an annual fireworks display that can be seen for 50 miles in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>Manitou Springs</LOCATION> is the boarding point for the <ORGANIZATION>Pikes Peak Cog Railway</ORGANIZATION>, an 
electric train with two bright red cars that follow a surprisingly straight 
track to the top. Round-trip fare is <MONEY>$17</MONEY> for adults, <MONEY>$8</MONEY> for people between 5 
and 11 years old; preschoolers ride free. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular means of ascent these days is the Pikes Peak Highway, a 
serpentine 20-mile toll road that is paved for the first seven miles and then 
becomes reasonably smooth gravel. This is a steep and occasionally terrifying 
driving experience, but most two-wheel-drive family cars can make it. It's open 
from <DATE>May</DATE> to <DATE>October</DATE> each year. 
</P>
<P>
At the toll gate, you'll be charged <MONEY>$14</MONEY> for a family of four. The rangers there 
offer driving tips: Don't use your air conditioning; it will make hard-working 
engines overheat. Stop now and then on the way down to let your brakes cool 
off. 
</P>
<P>
To enforce that last rule, there is frequently a policeman stationed about five 
miles below the summit to feel each car's wheels and warn motorists whose 
brakes are overheated. The best time to go is in the <TIME>morning</TIME>, because the 
summit can be hazy or completely fogged in on <DATE>summer</DATE> afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The drive up <LOCATION>Pikes Peak</LOCATION> is one of the loveliest auto trips you can imagine, 
particularly above timberline (11,500 feet in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>), where the views seem 
to spread out forever and the mountainside becomes a vast white sea of snow. 
</P>
<P>
And then you reach the summit, bundle up against the nippy <DATE>summer</DATE> breeze, throw 
snowballs until your hands freeze solid and soak in the 360-degree splendor of 
the mountain view that you've been singing about since your school days. 
</P>
<P>
America! America! From this unequaled vantage point at the very roof of the 
Rockies, it is clear that God really has shed His grace on thee. 
</P>
<P>

Visitors Bureau</ORGANIZATION> at (800) 888-4748, <DATE>Ext. 20</DATE> or 22.

<LEADPARA>  THIS turn-of-the-century Rocky Mountain town offers tourists easy access to an
extraordinary collection of natural wonders -- red rock formations, caverns,
mountains and mineral springs.;    Centuries ago, Ute, Arapahoe, Cheyenne and
other American Indian tribes considered the area sacred. Here, they laid down
their weapons and abandoned thoughts of war for religious ceremonies and
meditation -- and to drink and bathe in the waters flowing from the area's
dozen mineral springs.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Destination: Colorado  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The town was founded during the late 1800s, when Victorian-era tourists
were partial to "taking the waters." The enterprising <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON>William J.
Palmer</PERSON>, founder of neighboring <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, developed the region as a
health resort and spa.;    <LOCATION>Manitou Springs</LOCATION> has attracted a brisk tourist
business ever since.;    There are still 10 freely flowing mineral springs
within the town's borders -- each with its unique taste, particular mineral
content and attributed healing properties. Individual springs, it is said,
cure everything from arthritis to rheumatism, from dyspepsia to constipation.;
   The waters are free. Just go up to the tap with a cup or jug and fill 'er
up.;    Better yet, arrange with the local <ORGANIZATION>Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> for a free
one-hour tasting tour of the springs. While you stroll the quaint streets and
drink of the waters at <LOCATION>Cheyenne</LOCATION>, Twin, <PERSON>Wheeler</PERSON>, Soda and other springs, the
guide will regale you with local history and colorful anecdotes about the
town's founders and early residents.;    Be sure to visit Soda <DATE>Spring</DATE>, flowing
from a calcium-encrusted fountain in the center of the lobby of the town's spa
building at 934 <LOCATION>Manitou Ave.</LOCATION> The water is clear, cold and pleasantly bubbly,
with sodium, potassium, calcium and lithium among its contents.;    The
Spanish-style stucco spa, built as the <ORGANIZATION>Manitou Bath House</ORGANIZATION> at the turn of the
century, is now a hotel, where guests may spend the night and bathe in <ORGANIZATION>Soda
Spring</ORGANIZATION>'s waters. The cost is <MONEY>$35</MONEY> per night for two people, including

Spring</ORGANIZATION>, with its tap outside a shop at 121 <LOCATION>Ruxton Ave.</LOCATION>, is the preferred water
for lemonade.;    Of the natural wonders surrounding <LOCATION>Manitou Springs</LOCATION>, the most
famous is Pike's Peak, rising 14,110 feet on the eastern horizon.;    Although
this ranks only as the 32nd highest summit in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, the ascent is
staggeringly steep. In <DATE>1808</DATE>, explorer <ORGANIZATION>Zebulon Pike</ORGANIZATION> declared the peak
unclimbable. In <DATE>1820</DATE>, <PERSON>Edwin James</PERSON>, set foot on the summit and proved him
wrong.;    Relatively few tourists managed to struggle up the mountain until
<PERSON>Zalmon Simmons</PERSON>, of <PERSON>Simmons</PERSON> mattress fame, built a railway to the summit. The
<ORGANIZATION>Manitou &amp; Pikes Peak Railway</ORGANIZATION> was completed in <DATE>October 1890.</DATE>;    West of town
is the Garden of the Gods, a splendid outcropping of gigantic red rock
formations. Manitou means "Great Spirit," and Native Americans believed this
place was created and inhabited by gods. Garden of the <ORGANIZATION>Gods Trading Post</ORGANIZATION>,
established 100 years ago, still sells authentic American Indian crafts.; If

<HEAD>Dropping Water Table Means Long-term Changes in Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was part of what explorer <PERSON>Zebulon Pike</PERSON> in
<DATE>1806</DATE> called the <ORGANIZATION>Great American Desert</ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION>High Plains</LOCATION> where grass
was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide.
   Pike's adventures along the <LOCATION>Arkansas River</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Rocky
Mountains</LOCATION> gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of
low rainfall, short grass and few natural water holes was a natural
barrier that would limit <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> westward expansion.
   Farmers tried to tame it with the plow, but often drought and
crop failure dominated the huge region, generally west of the 100th
meridian. Dryland farming, the settlers found, was a precarious
business in the <ORGANIZATION>Great American Desert</ORGANIZATION>.
   It began to change after enterprising farmers tapped underground
water supplies for large-scale irrigation. A huge, invisible lake _
the Ogallala Aquifer _ was a gold mine for parts of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>.
   But for years the underground water level has been receding,
forcing deeper drilling and greater pumping costs. Already
irrigation has become uneconomical for many.
   ``In order to maintain a viable agricultural economy, this area
must return to a dryland type of production,'' says <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture
Department</ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON>Wendell Holmes</PERSON> in the current issue of
Farmline magazine. ``How soon the transition will be made depends
somewhat on how willing farmers are to change their irrigation
practices.''
   <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said ``it seems reasonable to assume'' that some
irrigation will continue for a number of years. New technologies
and more drought-tolerant plants may help for a time.
   ``Whatever the time, though, adjustments must be made in order
to be ready when the wells run dry,'' he said.
   Holmes and a colleague, <PERSON>Mindy Petrulis</PERSON>, in the department's
<ORGANIZATION>Economic Research Service</ORGANIZATION> studied an area of the high plains in
<LOCATION>West Texas</LOCATION>, which included seven irrigated counties and eight
neighboring dryland counties.
   The irrigated counties included <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>, <PERSON>Crosby</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Floyd</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hale</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Lamb</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Parmer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Swisher</PERSON>, while the dryland counties were <LOCATION>Baylor</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Cottle</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Foard</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Haskell</LOCATION>, <PERSON>King</PERSON>, <PERSON>Knox</PERSON>, <PERSON>Stonewall</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Throckmorton</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said the irrigated counties enjoyed an economic boom in
the <DATE>1940s</DATE> and <DATE>1950s</DATE> as irrigation became widespread. A move to
``center pivot'' systems made it possible to nearly triple yields
of cotton, wheat and corn on land previously farmed without
irrigation.
   By <DATE>1960</DATE>, the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> high plains had become one of the most
irrigation-dependent areas of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   But the nearby dryland counties, which lie just to the east of
the Ogallala Aquifer, have never had enough water from surface or
below-ground sources to develop agriculture based on irrigation.
<PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said that has been apparent from their economic performance
beginning in the <DATE>1940s</DATE>.
   ``The economy of the dryland farming area continued to stagnate
and periodically worsen, because of the lack of water for crops,''
<PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said. ``One effect has been a continued heavy outmigration
of rural people.''
   For example, between <DATE>1940</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, the total population of the
dryland counties was cut in half and employment was reduced by a
fourth.
   In contrast, <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said, the irrigated counties experienced
rapid economic growth and development during most of the 1940-84
period. Despite a small decline in the last few decades, total
population in the mid-1980s exceeded 100,000 people, a <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT>
increase from <DATE>1940</DATE>, and employment at about 41,000 was up nearly <PERCENT>80
percent</PERCENT>.
   Meanwhile, in the dryland counties that weren't blessed with an
abundance of water, farms grew larger and fewer in order to
maintain their incomes, and population dropped by <PERCENT>32 percent</PERCENT> from
<DATE>1940</DATE> to <DATE>1959</DATE>.
   ``Dryland farming does not require a large labor force, nor can
it support a large rural or urban population,'' <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said.
``Thus, there was little inducement for people to move into the
area or, having been born there, to stay. More and more people
found employment elsewhere.''
   But by <DATE>1960</DATE>, the fast-track development of the irrigated
counties slowed down. From <DATE>1959</DATE> to <DATE>1978</DATE>, he said, the value of farm
products sold increased about <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT>, compared with a tenfold
increase in the previous 19 years.
   And by <DATE>1978</DATE>, almost 2,400 irrigation farmers had gone out of
business and 140,000 acres of cropland had been taken out of
irrigation. Rising costs of energy took a toll.
   The tough times continued among dryland farmers, too. Population
in those counties dropped by more than a fourth from <DATE>1959</DATE> to <DATE>1978</DATE>,
total employment was down more than a tenth, and <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> of the
farm operators went out of business, <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said.
   In the <DATE>1980s</DATE>, the financial situation for farmers across the
nation deepened as debt piled up, land values declined and interest
rates edged higher.
   Between <DATE>1978</DATE> and <DATE>1984</DATE>, the total value of farm products sold
dropped <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> in the irrigated counties, while they increased
about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> in the dryland area.
   <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said the population of the irrigated counties in <DATE>1978-84</DATE>
declined about <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT>, and total employment decreased for the
first time since the Great Depression of the <DATE>1930s</DATE>.
   The trends were much different in the dryland counties. Farm
income rose <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT>, compared with an <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT> decline in the
irrigated counties.
   <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said that was because the proportion of total farm sales
from wheat in the dryland areas tripled from <DATE>1978</DATE> to <DATE>1984</DATE> because
of government price support programs. And dryland farm operations
cost much less.
   In fact, he said, per capita income in the dryland counties in
<DATE>1984</DATE> was higher than it had ever been in the irrigated counties.
Unfortunately, the long decades of decline in the dryland counties
had resulted in a grim bottoming out.
   ``So many people have left that the economy has finally
stabilized, and most of those who remain are those with the jobs
that are still available,'' <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dubuque Wants Riverboat Gambling License; So Does Tiny McGregor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Heartland Gambling</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>McGREGOR, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This town, population 945, will try for a
riverboat gambling license. So will <LOCATION>Dubuque</LOCATION>, with more than 60 times
as many people.
   ``I think there's a possibility of us getting a license, but I
think it's an uphill battle,'' said <ORGANIZATION>McGregor Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION>
official <PERSON>Charlie Zahn</PERSON>. ``Personally speaking, I think it stinks.''
   The northeast <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> communities, about 60 miles apart on the
<LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>, are two of the <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> towns that plan to apply for
licenses from the state Racing and <ORGANIZATION>Gaming Commission</ORGANIZATION> following
approval of riverboat gambling in local referendums last week.
   There is no limit on the number of licenses that could be issued,
but observers expect no more than three _ some say only one _ will
be issued for the first year.
   On paper, <LOCATION>Dubuque</LOCATION> would appear to have an overwhelming edge. The
city boasts many tourism attractions, highlighted by <LOCATION>Mississippi
River</LOCATION> boat tours and the first dog track granted a parimutuel
license when gambling was legalized in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> four years ago.
   But McGregor officials concede nothing.
   Their own attractions include a 970-acre park named for <PERSON>Zebulon
Pike</PERSON>, a series of 191 preserved prehistoric Indian burial grounds,
and thousands of acres for hunting and camping. Officials felt
confident enough of obtaining a riverboat gambling license to hire a
contractor to build a boat dock for about <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>.
   McGregor is a half-mile stretch of restaurants, antique shops,
taverns and other stores nestled between forested bluffs overlooking
the river.
   ``Being a smaller community, I think it's only fair that we
should have an opportunity like this, rather than everything going
to the big urban areas,'' said <ORGANIZATION>McGregor City Clerk Norm Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>.
   Dubuque has a different argument for the gaming commission.
   ``There is a point that's reached where there's too many people
in too small a geographic region all trying to do the same thing. I
think a full-fledged operation like we plan in <LOCATION>Dubuque</LOCATION> and a
full-bore operation very close to us, such as <PERSON>McGregor</PERSON>, might be a
little bit much,'' said <PERSON>Don Hess</PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Dubuque Racing
Association</ORGANIZATION>, the non-profit group seeking a license.
   <PERSON>Hess</PERSON>, also director of marketing and communications at <LOCATION>Dubuque
Greyhound Park</LOCATION>, said five dog tracks are due to open in neighboring
<LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, potentially cutting attendance and revenue in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>.
   ``We're hoping to secure a riverboat gambling license to get a
floating casino out on the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> so we can have two major
tourism draws that will allow us to bring back some of these people
that we'll be losing to <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>.''
   A floating casino could mean 300 jobs and an extra <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY> a
year to the local economy, <PERSON>Hess</PERSON> said.
   In <PERSON>McGregor</PERSON>, officials feel the state almost owes them a license
to compensate for lost taxes on thousand of acres around town
purchased by the <ORGANIZATION>Iowa Department of Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``McGregor's never going to land the big industry, and the
economics are such that we'll probably never see a dog track or
horse track,'' Mayor <PERSON>Robyn Denning</PERSON> said. ``We just never seem to get

   Lear in Iowa: Family Farm, Family Trouble
   ----
   By Julia Just
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14
</SO>
<LP>
   Jane Smiley's latest novel, "A Thousand Acres" (Knopf, 352
pages, $23), is set in Zebulon County, Iowa, where the
farmland is "thicker, richer, more alive with a past and
future than any soil anywhere." The land is also layered with
long-festering intrigues among jealous neighbors, and poisons
blamed for miscarriages and cancer. This is the novel's
overriding metaphor -- a rich but deceptive topsoil yielding
up secrets of the buried past.
   Initially, the story's calm, inviting surface recalls Joan
Chase's lyrical portrait of a family farm in "During the
Reign of the Queen of Persia," as well as Ms. Smiley's own
previous works of fiction, with their almost uncannily
precise depictions of daily life. In her widely praised books
"The Age of Grief" and "The Greenlanders," Ms. Smiley made
the very ordinariness of things the most compelling substance
of her narratives. But "A Thousand Acres" turns out to be
closer in spirit to her ambitious recent novella, "Good
Will," in which seemingly innocent beginnings lead to dark
revelations and unexpected violence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The novel, set in the late <DATE>1970s</DATE>, is narrated by <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON>,
whose father, <PERSON>Larry Cook</PERSON>, owns the biggest and most
profitable farm around -- a thousand acres. Ginny is an
accommodating, even malleable, sort, although at 36 she has
been bitterly disappointed by a series of miscarriages with
her husband, Ty. She's appealingly levelheaded, but not
immune to deeper impulses; she confesses to harboring vague
desires, "secret, passionate wishes."
   While the youngest sister, <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON>, went to college and
became a tough-talking lawyer in <LOCATION>Des Moines</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON> and her
sister Rose stayed behind on the farm. It is soon apparent
why. After their mother died, when they were teenagers, their
father became an abusive tyrant who kept the entire family
under his thumb. Later, <PERSON>Rose</PERSON> will force <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON> to remember
just how abusive "Daddy" was; as time goes on, that word
comes to have chilling, Sylvia Plath-like overtones.
   When the father suddenly decides to cede the farm to his
three daughters, it brings the hidden past to the surface and
winds up setting each family member against the other,
irrevocably. Another catalyst is <PERSON>Jess Clark</PERSON>, a neighbor's
prodigal son, back from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, where he had been since
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. For a while, he's the answer to <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON>'s "passionate
wishes" -- and he convinces her that the farm's runoff in the
groundwater is to blame for her miscarriages.
   <PERSON>Ms. Smiley</PERSON> can describe compounding strains in a marriage
better than anybody, and the confrontations between <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON> and
Ty -- quiet but devastating -- are among the best scenes in
the book. She's superb at depicting the surface effects of
feelings "too complicated . . . to name," the way trust can
"disappear into formality," and she plays off this life of
the emotions beautifully against the daily necessities of the
farm.
   Wonderfully evoked, too, are the pressures of keeping up
appearances in a small town. Ultimately, <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON> concludes,
putting the best face on things in front of the neighbors is
the "broken plank you are left with after the ship has gone
down." Still, as the sisters confront their old father and
his tainted bequest, the unending string of disasters that
follows seems more than strictly necessary, while the
characters' motivations sometimes hover on the outer edges of
plausibility.
   It's pretty clear early on to the reader, for example,
that the erratic old farmer is in the initial stages of
Alzheimer's disease, but <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> never seems to figure it
out. This is overly convenient, since it's essential to the
story that she blame the rest of the family for everything
that happens. As for <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON>, our sympathetic companion, the
ever-present litany of her household chores ("I spent the
morning shampooing the carpet . . .") will eventually include
preparing a jar of poisoned sausage. We've come a long way
from the stewed pork chops and kitchen-table confidences that
open this book.
   Still, the novel's center holds firm. Its narrative
momentum is undeniable, as is the psychological truth (with
its deliberate nod to "Lear") underlying the mortal combat
between <PERSON>Larry Cook</PERSON> and his daughters, and among the newly
estranged sisters. Indeed, if the grim patriarch dominates
the first half of the book, Rose -- grabby and manipulative
and iron-willed -- dominates the second. Of all the other
illusions of past and future, <PERSON>Ginny</PERSON>'s adoring love for Rose,
her conviction that they were a team "united" against their
father, proves the most traumatic to give up. It is a point
of no return, but also exhilarating:
   "The strongest feeling was that now I knew them all,"
<PERSON>Ginny</PERSON> says of her divided family. "Rather than feeling `not
myself,' I felt intensely, newly, more myself than ever
before." It is the beginning of a new life, far from the old
"ordered, hard-working world."
   As for the thousand-acre farm in <LOCATION>Zebulon County</LOCATION>, one
notices right away that <PERSON>Ms. Smiley</PERSON>'s novel begins in <DATE>1979</DATE> --
on the brink of the <LOCATION>Midwestern</LOCATION> farm crisis, with its falling
land values and rising suicide rates. The timing is an apt
and melancholy touch -- as though <PERSON>Larry Cook</PERSON> foresaw it all,
and wanted no part of it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <PERSON>Francis Pike</PERSON> dropped in for a board meeting of <ORGANIZATION>Drayton Far
Eastern Trust</ORGANIZATION>, before heading to <LOCATION>Chelsea</LOCATION> register office to wed Lady <PERSON>Annabel
Goldsmith</PERSON>'s daughter, India-Jane Birley. Pike's new boss, <PERSON>Philip Tose</PERSON>,
chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank <ORGANIZATION>Peregrine Securities</ORGANIZATION>, flew in
for the day to be best man.
Without further ado, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> left for <LOCATION>Bombay</LOCATION>, where he has 10 weeks before
opening the doors of a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION>Peregrine</ORGANIZATION> and Indian tobacco
company <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION>.
Pike had spent the <DATE>last 14 years</DATE> at fund managers <ORGANIZATION>Invesco</ORGANIZATION>, 24 per cent of
which is now held by <ORGANIZATION>Peregrine</ORGANIZATION>. When management upheavals at <ORGANIZATION>Invesco</ORGANIZATION> a year
ago made his position uncomfortable, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>, who has spent much of his time in
the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION>, took a call from his old friend <PERSON>Tose</PERSON>.
Having created <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s largest independent merchant banking group in
under five years, <PERSON>Tose</PERSON>'s ambitions now stretch to repeating the success
story throughout <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>.
With the help of close associate <PERSON>Li Ka-Shing</PERSON>, lack of capital is not one of
<PERSON>Tose</PERSON>'s problems. Peregrine last year sunk Dollars 30m into <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> in
another joint venture, with commodities giant Dongbang.
<ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, rejected several British merchant banks in favour of the
Asian partner for its foray into financial services.
An adaptable sort, 39-year-old <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> spent his first three months in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>
living in a Zen Buddhist temple before getting stuck into what he calls the
'gaijin ghetto'. But he is far from unworldly, as his blue <ORGANIZATION>Ferrari</ORGANIZATION>, fondly
remembered by Japanese friends, demonstrated.
In taking on the still formidable difficulties of the Indian market, he will
not be stuck for more ways to make his mark.

<HEAD>State Takes Control of Debt-Ridden Pike County Schools' Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state took control of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>'s
third-largest school district's finances <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, citing a budget
deficit estimated by consultants to have been as high as <MONEY>$3.3
million</MONEY>.
   The action by the <ORGANIZATION>State Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> means state
Superintendent <PERSON>John Brock</PERSON>'s written approval will be needed for all
hiring and purchases by the <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> district, which has 15,250
students in 30 schools.
   The board acted after two consultants it sent into the
mountainous eastern <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> district reported dozens of management
problems.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> at the present time,'' <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said.
   ``I think the (state board) would have to take some
extraordinary action at this time. ... I think they need some
help,'' <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said.
   He said the state veto over local hiring would relieve the local
board of some political pressure to dole out school jobs _ pressure
that has increased as layoffs increase in the coal industry,
according to the report by consultants <PERSON>Arnold Oaken</PERSON> and <PERSON>James
Melton</PERSON>.
   Brock also said it ``would remove that temptation'' for school
board candidates to promise jobs for votes. Three of the board's
five members are up for re-election in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   The chief reason for the state board's action, however, was <ORGANIZATION>Pike
County</ORGANIZATION>'s third straight year of running a deficit budget.
   On paper, it has been cut from <MONEY>$3.3 million</MONEY> to about <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY>,
but that is illusory, <PERSON>Melton</PERSON> and Oaken told the board.
   The district soon will have to borrow <MONEY>$600,000</MONEY> to keep
operating, increasing the debt to near <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> again, and the
purchase of new school buses can be delayed no longer, they said.
   The local board has voted to close one elementary school, but
the report by Oaken and <PERSON>Melton</PERSON> said five should be closed, with 780
pupils redistributed. In the past, when the county has built new
schools, it has declined to close old ones, <PERSON>Melton</PERSON> said.
   It was not immediately known how long the state would manage
<LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> schools' finances under the seldom-used statute it
invoked. The action is less severe than a declaration of ``academic
bankruptcy,'' by which the state would take over actual management
of the school system.
   <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said he would place a lieutenant in <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> to oversee
the school system's finances. <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said he had a former school
superintendent, whom he would not identify, in mind for the job.
   In <LOCATION>Pikeville</LOCATION>, school board Chairman <PERSON>Alvin Newsome</PERSON> said he
welcomed the state takeover, and 18-year board veteran <PERSON>Gifford
Varney</PERSON> said he hoped the action marked a turning point for the
district. But two other members said they believed the takeover had
been unnecessary.
   If <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> voters were unhappy with board members, they
could elect someone else to do the job, said board member <PERSON>Carl
Biliter</PERSON>. He said the state action surprised him, but added, ``We
don't have no say over it because we were in debt.''

   While a nearly all-male club is
making its annual New Year's Eve trek up 14,110-foot <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>'s Peak, a
group of women will be making a 1,000-foot ascent of a nearby
mountain in jest of the traditional event.
   This year's climb will mark the 66th annual climb of <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION>'s Peak
by the AdAmAn club, which plans to set off fireworks at the summit.
The group adds a climber each year.
   AdaWoman, a band founded in <DATE>1982</DATE>, will make an ascent on <ORGANIZATION>Pyramid
Mountain</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Ute Pass</LOCATION> west of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, light sparklers, play
<PERSON>Helen Reddy</PERSON>'s song ``I Am Woman,'' down champagne and head home for
the night, organizers said.
   It will be the seventh climb for the AdaWoman club, which was
founded almost as a lark by <PERSON>Rita Randolph</PERSON> and several other woman
who train on <ORGANIZATION>Pyramid Mountain</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It's really beautiful up there, and one morning we had run the
mountain and decided this was the way we should start out the new
year together,'' she said.
   The women also were prodded that year because AdAmAn, for the
first time in its history, was inviting a female guest, veteran
climber Sue <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>.
   ``One of the AdAmAn members said that the reason they hadn't done
it before was they didn't know any women who could make it,'' said
<PERSON>Randolph</PERSON>. ``Well, I and another of our members ran the Pikes Peak
Marathon, so I think we can make it.''
   AdAmAn historian <PERSON>Jim Bates</PERSON> said <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>, still the only woman
invited, will make her fourth climb with the club this year.
   ``Of course, when we started this climb in <DATE>1922</DATE>, you couldn't
have hired a woman to go with us. It wasn't until a few years ago
that women got so they were into this type of thing,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Randolph</PERSON> said AdaWoman may add a man in 50 or 60 years, if one is
found worthy.

<TEXT>
   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the <DATE>weekend</DATE>, and one
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication
satellites into orbit.
   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME>, said <ORGANIZATION>Air
Force</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>John Sullivan</PERSON>, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenberg
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   As usual for military space flights, the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> didn't
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.
   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or
KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said <PERSON>John Pike</PERSON>, a space policy
expert for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American Scientists</ORGANIZATION>.
   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said <DATE>Friday</DATE> the data
system satellites are used for military communications.
   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touch
with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crews
operating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he
said.
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said two <ORGANIZATION>SDS</ORGANIZATION> satellites were ``launched five years ago.
They're due for replacement.''
   <ORGANIZATION>SDS</ORGANIZATION> and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from
<LOCATION>Vandenberg</LOCATION> on Titan 34Ds, he said.
   ``The reason I think it's <ORGANIZATION>SDS</ORGANIZATION> is I don't think the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> has
any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said.
   The Titan 34D, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most powerful space booster, will be
supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from
<LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept.
2</DATE>, but sources told <ORGANIZATION>The Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> it failed to place its
payload in orbit.
   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor
Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other
electronic communications.
   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late <DATE>1987</DATE>. Before
then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during
launches on <DATE>Aug. 28, 1985</DATE>, and <DATE>April 18, 1986</DATE>, destroying a KH-11
and a KH-9.

<P>
Each year, 1.5 million visitors view the bronze and marble statues that stand 
throughout the Capitol waiting to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Some are well-known. Many are not. 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>1864</DATE>, each state has been entitled to donate statues of two of its most 
distinguished deceased citizens for permanent exhibit in the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state legislature decides who is to be honored, a statue is created and 
accepted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for a place in the <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION> -- <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always anxious to see the statues from their state. But often 
they're surprised and disappointed because they have no idea who (the people) 
depicted in the statues are," said <PERSON>Barbara Wolanin</PERSON>, 46, curator of <ORGANIZATION>Statuary 
Hall</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1978</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s statues, both dedicated on <DATE>March 1, 1930</DATE>, are of a minister and a 
priest. It is the only state with two statues of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors recognize Father <PERSON>Junipero Serra</PERSON>, the Franciscan priest who 
established nine <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> missions before he died in <DATE>1784</DATE>. Father <PERSON>Serra</PERSON>'s 
bronze likeness holds a little mission in his left hand, and in the right, a 
cross, held high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas Starr King</PERSON> is not so familiar. "What did he do?" Californians typically 
ask when they see the statue. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Unitarian minister, came to <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in <DATE>1860</DATE> from <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to serve as 
pastor of the <ORGANIZATION>First Unitarian Church of San Francisco</ORGANIZATION>. It was during the Civil 
War and many Californians favored the Confederacy. Of the more than 100 
newspapers in the state, only 24 supported <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
"King traveled throughout <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> championing the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> cause. He is 
remembered as the man whose matchless oratory kept <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> in the union," 
curator <PERSON>Wolanin</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
King lived in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> only four years before dying at age 40 in <DATE>1864</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95 statues from 50 states, 14 are of religious leaders, including Father 
<PERSON>Damien</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), who devoted his life to lepers on <LOCATION>Molokai</LOCATION>; Father <ORGANIZATION>Kino</ORGANIZATION> 
(<LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>), a Jesuit missionary, and <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>), the <ORGANIZATION>Mormon Church</ORGANIZATION> 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Five states -- <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> -- have 
contributed only one statue each. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>May 2</DATE>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> became the latest state to present its second statue, a 7-foot-7 
bronze likeness of lanky <PERSON>Philo T. Farnsworth</PERSON> (1906-1971), known as the "Father 
of Television." The statue shows <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> holding one of his first 
cathode-ray tubes. He transmitted his first electronic TV picture in <DATE>1927</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Students at <ORGANIZATION>Ridgecrest Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION>, under the guidance of 
Principal <PERSON>Bruce Barnson</PERSON>, led the effort to put the <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> statue in the 
<LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll conducted by students, residents favored <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON> over 20 
other Utahans, including <PERSON>Eliza Snow</PERSON>, a poet and wife of <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young; Mormon 
Church</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Ezra Taft Benson</PERSON>; hotelier <PERSON>J. Willard Marriott</PERSON>, and heavyweight 
boxing champion <PERSON>Jack Dempsey</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present for <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Norman Bangerter</PERSON>'s unveiling of the statue 
was the inventor's 81-year-old widow, <PERSON>Elma</PERSON> (Pem) <PERSON>Farnsworth</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Three statues are of Presidents: <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>James A. Garfield</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>). Four are of vice presidents, 36 of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 
senators, 23 of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members, 30 of governors and 32 of military heroes. (Some 
held more than one of these titles.) Six statues honor women: <PERSON>Dr. Florence 
Sabin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Colo.</LOCATION>), author of the "Sabin Health Laws" that modernized <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>'s 
public health system; <PERSON>Frances Willard</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>), founder of the Women's <ORGANIZATION>Christian 
Temperance Union</ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON>Marie Sanford</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION>), educator and champion of women's 
rights; <PERSON>Jeannette Rankin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>), the nation's first congresswoman; Mother 
<PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION>), a Catholic nun who contributed to the fields of health care, 
education and social work, and <PERSON>Esther Hobart Morris</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Wyo.</LOCATION>), the first woman to 
hold judicial office in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of four signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of 
six physicians. A king is here -- Kamehameha (<LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>), and a famed cowboy 
artist -- <PERSON>Charley Russell</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mont.</LOCATION>). Oklahoma honors two American Indians: 
Sequoya, inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and <PERSON>Will Rogers</PERSON>, humorist, 
newspaper columnist and movie star. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON>' famous advice to "Always keep an eye on <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to see 
what they're up to," his statue is the only one facing the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The feet of many of the statues gleam from constant rubbing, "for good luck," 
by visitors. Will <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> has the shiniest feet of all. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of the president and vice president of the <LOCATION>Confederacy</LOCATION>, 
<PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Miss.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Alexander Hamilton Stephens</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>), respectively, as 
well as of "Father of Refrigeration" <PERSON>John Gorrie</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>), and steamboat inventor 
<PERSON>Robert Fulton</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
America's best-known historic figures are here as well: Henry Clay (<LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Huey 
Long</PERSON> (<LOCATION>La.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>William Jennings Bryan</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Daniel Webster</PERSON> (<LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Samuel Adams</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Roger Williams</PERSON> (<LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>John C. Calhoun</PERSON> (<LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Sam 
Houston</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Stephen Austin</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>), and <PERSON>Ethan Allen</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Vt.</LOCATION>). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lesser known include <PERSON>Jabez Curry</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ala.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Uriah Rose</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Edmund 
K. Smith</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>George Shoup</PERSON> (Ida.), <PERSON>Samuel Kirkwood</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>), <PERSON>George Glick</PERSON> 
(<LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Zachariah Chandler</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION>), <PERSON>Zebulon Vance</PERSON> (<LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>) and <PERSON>Jason Lee</PERSON> (<LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION>). 
Most visitors to <PERSON>Statuary Hall</PERSON> have no idea who they were, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people pass away who are much more famous than many in Statuary Hall, 
but the states are stuck with those selected at an earlier time," longtime 
Capitol guide <PERSON>Madeline Allen</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Statuary Hall is in a part of the Capitol completed in <DATE>1807</DATE>, a domed 
semicircular room with sandstone walls and breccia marble columns, a room that 
housed the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>1857</DATE>, when the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> moved to its 
present, larger chamber. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passed a bill in <DATE>1864</DATE> to create the <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION> to house 
two marble or bronze statues from each state "of deceased persons illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services." 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1870</DATE>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> contributed the first statue, Revolutionary War hero 
<PERSON>Nathaniel Greene</PERSON>. By the <DATE>turn of the century</DATE>, 23 were on exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
By <DATE>1933</DATE>, there were 65 statues crowded into <PERSON>Statuary Hall</PERSON>, and it became clear 
that the floor would not support any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was then decided to keep most of the collection in the hall and place the 
others in prominent sites throughout the <LOCATION>Capitol</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statues no longer stand in the same room, this gathering of heroes 
-- famous or not -- continues to be called <ORGANIZATION>National Statuary Hall</ORGANIZATION>.

   Firefighters mopped up a series of forest and
brush fires <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, but the danger of more blazes remained high
through a third straight day of record high temperatures and gusty
wind.
   Since <DATE>Friday</DATE>, six fires have broken out in the region from <LOCATION>Pikes
Peak</LOCATION> west of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Boulder County</LOCATION> northwest of
<LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>. They were reported contained or near containment <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
and had caused no injuries or structural damage.
   ``People haven't caught up with how tinder-dry things are,''
said <PERSON>Charlie Knight</PERSON>, fire information officer for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Forest
Service</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Pike</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>San Isabel</LOCATION> forest districts.
   Denver warmed to a record high again <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at 82 degrees. The
<ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> said the heat, coupled with strong
southwesterly wind and low humidity, made fire danger across the
state high to extreme.
   A blaze scorched about 20 acres just southwest of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, and
officials said visitors to nearby <ORGANIZATION>Mount Falcon State Park</ORGANIZATION> had been
asked to leave.
   An air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the blaze, said
<PERSON>Charlie Knight</PERSON>, fire information officer for the <ORGANIZATION>Pike National
Forest</ORGANIZATION>.
   Authorities said one fire _ a 600-acre brush fire in <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> that
was put out <DATE>Saturday</DATE> _ may have been caused by arson. The other
fires may have been caused by humans unintentionally, they said.
   The largest blaze, an 872-acre forest fire west of <ORGANIZATION>Monument</ORGANIZATION>,
broke out <DATE>Friday</DATE> and was 100 percent contained <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Knight</PERSON> said.
   ``There is not even a wisp of smoke coming up now,'' he said.
   Some firefighters from that blaze were released to fight a
150-acre fire near <LOCATION>Deckers</LOCATION>. That fire began <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> and
was <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> contained <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, forest service officials said.
   Smaller fires were reported in <LOCATION>Mueller State Park</LOCATION>, about 45
miles west of <LOCATION>Colorado Springs</LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION>Boulder County</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Left Hand
Canyon</LOCATION>.

<ORGANIZATION>TURNER Broadcasting System</ORGANIZATION> (TBS), the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> cable television group that owns
<ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION>, is forming a joint venture in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to seek what it claims will be the
first independent television station in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
A memorandum of understanding has been signed by <ORGANIZATION>TBS</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow
Independent Broadcasting Company</ORGANIZATION>, (MIBC), a private Russian company.
<PERSON>Mr Sidney Pike</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>CNN International</ORGANIZATION>'s special projects division,
is in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to represent Turner interests in the 50-50 project, which will
be broadcast free over the air. Revenues will come from advertising.
<PERSON>Mr Pike</PERSON> said yesterday the plan depended on obtaining local government
approval for a broadcasting licence to use Channel 6, an existing VHF
frequency. Russian authorities have indicated they plan to award the licence
within the next four months, <PERSON>Mr Pike</PERSON> added.
Under an interim licence MIBC and <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> have been broadcasting two hours of
<ORGANIZATION>CNN International</ORGANIZATION>, translated into Russian, every day on Channel 6 since
<DATE>May</DATE>. <PERSON>Mr Pike</PERSON> said the joint venture channel would include CNN news, classic
films, sport, entertainment and children's programmes, broadcast mostly in
Russian.
Channel 6 is the last VHF frequency available in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. A formal contest
will be held to decide who should be given the licence. <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION>, the German
engineering group, and Russian partners are jointly developing plans to
equip nuclear reactors in the former Soviet bloc with western monitoring
technology for added safety, <ORGANIZATION>Reuter</ORGANIZATION> reports from <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION>.
The aim is to improve the safety of 1,000-megawatt VVER pressurised water
reactors, the most modern reactors produced in the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. The
technology would be based on existing Russian systems and advances under way
in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and be enriched with <ORGANIZATION>Siemens</ORGANIZATION> knowhow.

   At a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> church this <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, that
commemorated Christmas pair, <PERSON>Mary and Joseph</PERSON>, will be portrayed in a
modern mode _ a homeless couple hunting for shelter.
   This has become the plight of hundreds of thousands of people
across <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> today, just as it was the plight of <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON>
2,000 years ago in <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION>.
   ``They also were homeless,'' says the Rev. <PERSON>Thomas F. Pike</PERSON> of
Calvary-St. George's <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> whose annual candlelight
service is presenting their situation as current rather than past.
   They, like many nowadays, ``had no place to stay,'' adds <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>,
who also heads the board of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s interfaith Partnership
for the Homeless. ``That family also was wandering the streets.
   ``They had to deliver the child in a backyard stable, a cave.
Then they faced persecution and had to flee. They had to leave for
another country. They were refugees.''
   In a similar way, he says the growing multitude of homeless
Americans is a ``crisis not just in the lives of individual victims,
but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation.''
   As chairman of an organization described as the nation's largest
private local program providing the homeless with food, shelter and
some permanent housing, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> added in an interview:
   ``The growing callousness and willingness of people to live
side-by_side with this tragedy affects everyone. What we see is the
erosion of the worth of life, of the dignity of the human person.
   ``We see more and more tolerance of violence, a depreciation of
life. Our nation is really at a crossroads. If we don't resolve the
issue of homelessness, every cherished institution in American life
will be affected by cynicism and doubt.''
   Estimates have placed the number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> homeless at up to <MONEY>3
million</MONEY>, wandering the streets and byways of cities across the
country, crowding soup lines, hunting temporary shelter by night.
   Pike said President-Elect <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s expressed hopes for a ``gentler,
quieter'' nation aren't likely ``if he doesn't listen to the cries
in the streets of the homeless.
   ``There's no way American society can be deaf and blind to this
crisis. Most people are hoping <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> provides leadership in dealing
with it.''
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said that while the spreading severity of the problem may
represent the ``dark side'' of the picture, the massive volunteer
response to it represents the ``brighter side.''
   ``An incredible number of institutions are working on this
crisis,'' he said. ``Millions of volunteers of religious,
educational and philanthropic institutions are involved. It's a real
sign of hope.
   ``Literally every community and town on the face of this nation,
through individuals and groups, has mobilized support for hungry and
homeless people. If the President builds on that, we can have hope
that this terrible tragedy will be alleviated.''
   Pike, who estimates <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s homeless at about 50,000,
said the inter-organizational partnership here has become a ``model
for places all over the country. Hundreds of them have picked it
up.''
   He said the ``the key to it is partnership,'' not only among
religious congregations, Protestant, <PERSON>Roman Catholic</PERSON> and Jewish, but
also with civic, labor and other organizations as well as city and
state agencies.
   ``We present a united response, cooperative and not
confrontational, that maximizes communication in dealing with the
system,'' he said.
   Pike, 51, who twice has been nominated unsuccessfully for
diocesan bishop _in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> _ said that 400 <LOCATION>New
York City</LOCATION> churches and synagogues are involved in providing food and
shelter to the homeless.
   The congregations run 130 shelters that house about 2,000 people
per night _totalling 400,000 <DATE>last winter</DATE> with more than a million
meals served. About 24,000 volunteers have served in the program
since it began in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   It started then with only two churches _ <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>St. Joseph's
Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> and Calvary-St. George's <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION>, but
has since spread to a wide inter-religious network.
   Besides the sheltering and feeding program, the partnership also
runs a permanent housing operation, <ORGANIZATION>Project Domicile</ORGANIZATION>, which has
helped relocate 3,700 homeless people from shelters and welfare
hotels to permanent apartments.
   Pike, also a director of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Landmarks Conservancy that
helps fund restoration of historic sites, said a criticial need in
reducing homelessness is reform of the welfare system.
   It ``is not supportive of family life,'' he said. ``It ought to
support and encourage families to stay together and encourage
stability.''
   Under the circumstances, he said, ``Some of the most heroic
people in the country are women raising children.''
   Describing a sick, young woman with an eight-months-old infant
who fell into the subway tracks at <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Union Square</LOCATION> and who
was lifted out just before a train roared in, he said:
   ``That's the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Madonna.''

<TEXT>
   More than 1,300 people swarmed into a hotel
to apply for about two dozen jobs at a coal mine this week, a
turnout a company official <DATE>Thursday</DATE> called a sad statement about
eastern <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>'s economy.
   ``I'm pleased on one hand but it's kind of depressing on the
other,'' said <PERSON>Ed Stone</PERSON>, personnel director for <ORGANIZATION>Sidney Coal Co</ORGANIZATION>.
   Some applicants drove more than 100 miles to apply for the 19 to
25 jobs that should be available when <PERSON>Sidney Coal</PERSON>'s mine in <LOCATION>Pike
County</LOCATION> reopens early next year, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Most of the applicants were unemployed miners from <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION>
and surrounding areas in <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said.
   The new hires would help during a yearlong renovation of the
mine, which eventually might employ about 100 people, he said.
   The volume of applications was the largest for such a small
number of jobs <ORGANIZATION>Stone</ORGANIZATION> said he had seen in 19 years of work in the
coal industry. The positions pay a minimum of <MONEY>$11</MONEY> per hour and
include full benefits.
   Stone said he had begun sorting through the stacks of
applications filled out <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>. ``I'm going to have a
very short holiday,'' he said of the task.
   <PERSON>Sidney Coal</PERSON> was a focus of a bitter three-year selective strike
by the <ORGANIZATION>United Mine Workers</ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION>A.T. Massey Coal Co.</ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION>Sidney
Coal</ORGANIZATION>, agreed in <DATE>May</DATE> to pay <MONEY>$4.47 million</MONEY> to settle a lawsuit with
the <ORGANIZATION>UMW</ORGANIZATION>.
   The settlement called for 35 union miners to go back to work for
a contractor. The strike began when two mines owned by <PERSON>Sidney Coal</PERSON>
were sold to <ORGANIZATION>Massey</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1984</DATE> and <PERSON>Massey</PERSON> announced the mines would
become non-union.
   Despite the past union problems, a number of the people who
showed up to apply for the openings were past or present <ORGANIZATION>UMW</ORGANIZATION>
members, including union workers laid off this year from the <LOCATION>Scotts
Branch Mine</LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION>.
   The unemployment rate for <ORGANIZATION>Pike County</ORGANIZATION> was <PERCENT>12.1 percent</PERCENT> in
<DATE>October</DATE>, according to the latest figures available.
   ``I wish we could help everybody, but unfortunately we can't,''
Stone said.

'BREAKING POINT' THRILLS IN HITCHCOCKIAN VEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American intelligence officer, carrying vital knowledge about the Allies' 
planned invasion of <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>, is captured and tortured by the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>. He wakes 
up in an American military hospital in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and learns the war has been over 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Or has it? 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> cable movie "Breaking Point," at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> and again at 7, 9 and <TIME>11 
p.m.</TIME>, is an abundantly stylish remake of "36 Hours," the <DATE>1964</DATE> film with <PERSON>James 
Garner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eva Marie Saint</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rod Taylor</PERSON>. Directed by <PERSON>Peter Markle</PERSON> and written by 
<PERSON>Stanley Greenberg</PERSON>, this suspense thriller in the Hitchcockian vein entangles 
both hero and audience in an intricate web of deception. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Markle</PERSON> has cast his principal cast with care. <PERSON>Corbin Bernsen</PERSON> ("<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Law") is 
the bothered and bewildered amnesia victim, Maj. <PERSON>Jefferson Pike</PERSON>. His wife <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> 
is dead, he's told, but nurse <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>, a former inmate of <LOCATION>Dachau</LOCATION> -- or is she? -- 
hauntingly resembles her (exquisite <PERSON>Joanna Pacula</PERSON> plays both roles). Dr. <PERSON>Walter 
Gerber</PERSON> (<PERSON>John Glover</PERSON>), who seems to take <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>'s case to heart, encourages <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> 
to cross the "psychological chasm" that blocks his memory by talking about what 
he last remembers: The plans for D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
Director of photography <PERSON>Don Burgess</PERSON>' moody lighting makes a major contribution 
to the film's pervasive, vaguely threatening atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
There are some lapses. The physical evidence offered to <LOCATION>Pike</LOCATION> as proof of the 
postwar date is too slight. It was more substantial in the original film. And 
just as the original's finale bogged down, <PERSON>Greenberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Markle</PERSON> and the fine cast 
don't altogether carry it off here either, despite fundamental script changes. 
The climactic chase scene is wildly self-indulgent; it could have been lifted 
from countless action films. 
</P>
<P>
Still, getting there is delicious, beginning with the opening credits, which 
roll over stark, black-and-white World War II newsreel footage as <ORGANIZATION>Billie 
Holiday</ORGANIZATION>'s sweet, mournful voice is heard singing in the background.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> movie ``Breaking Point'' is a remake
of the <DATE>1964</DATE> film ``36 Hours,'' starring <PERSON>James Garner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eva Marie
Saint</PERSON>.
   The question is, why?
   Granted, the premise of the World War II thriller is intriguing _
the Nazis capture a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence officer and try to trick him
into thinking he's in a hospital suffering amnesia and the war is
over, so he'll reveal when and where the Allied invasion of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>
is to take place.
   But it is certainly dated. And no matter how interesting the
premise, the story doesn't work if the viewers don't care what
happens to the characters. As weakly written as they are, they
aren't helped by a cast list that is an eery vision of
weeknight-on-the-dinner-theater-circuit.
   ``Breaking Point'' premieres tonight and is repeated <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Corbin Bernsen</PERSON>, who does an admirable job of playing a crass,
shallow divorce lawyer on ``<LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> Law,'' would have been more
convincing as one of the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>. His Maj. <PERSON>Jefferson Pike</PERSON> comes off as
a vacuous dilettante who looks like he'd be much more comfortable
shopping for sweaters at <ORGANIZATION>Saks</ORGANIZATION> than plotting some nasty old invasion
of <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>.
   The grinding wheels of the plot are set in motion when <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> goes
to an unexplained meeting with a unsavory character at a <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> bar,
drinks spiked espresso and is plucked off the sidewalk by the <LOCATION>Nazis</LOCATION>,
allowing director <PERSON>Peter Markle</PERSON> to ignore the plodding script for a
while and engage in some arty slo-mo and black-and-white photography.
   After a wee bit of electro-shock torture, which causes <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION> to
grimace and perspire, he wakes up in a pleasant rest home surrounded
by seeming Yanks. The date on the newspaper is convincing enough,
but <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION> is suspicious when everyone is vague on the identity of the
mayor of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and who won the World Series.
   <PERSON>Joanna Pacula</PERSON>, who is making a career of TV World War II dramas
(``Crossings,'' ``Escape from <LOCATION>Sobibor</LOCATION>''), plays <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>, the German
nurse enlisted to entice Pike into spilling the beans, because she
looks exactly like the wife the Nazis have told him is dead. No
wonder she and his wife look alike. She plays both of them. If not
for this amazing circumstance, the rest of the story would have been
tragically lost to posterity.
   Pike, aided by the miracle of flashbacks, figures out the <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION>
game. He confirms his suspicions by tripping <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> up with a bit of
clever dialogue, something about a paper cut received recently in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> _ A-ha! We're supposed to be in occupied <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>! Understand,
this not exactly a battle of wits between two mental giants.
   Only the stalwart <PERSON>John Glover</PERSON> (``David'') inspires any interest,
playing <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON>, the Nazi doctor who hatches the brainwashing plot.
   As a potential footnote for the annals of bizarre casting, the
preppy-looking <PERSON>David Marshall Grant</PERSON> (``thirtysomething'') plays a
Nazi commandant. His presence must satisfy some behind-the-scenes
debt we aren't aware of. His only plot purpose seems to be to menace
the proceedings by expressing whining doubts about the validity of
<PERSON>Dr. Gerber</PERSON>'s experiment. Not exactly the stuff of razor-edged
suspense.
   Unlike the <DATE>1964</DATE> film, ``Breaking Point'' ends with a cynical
twist, which might have played on a work of contemporary fiction,
but isn't particularly compelling as part of a historical drama.
Most viewers do know we won the war, don't they?
   Despite some wonderfully inane dialogue _ eg., <PERSON>Dr. Gerber</PERSON>: ``You
won't have to sleep with Major Pike again.'' Nurse <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>, with
straight face: ``Thank you, sir.'' _ the breaking point for most
viewers will come about 10 minutes into the film.

for this amazing circumstance, the rest of the story would have been
tragically lost to posterity.
   Pike, aided by the miracle of flashbacks, figures out the <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION>
game. He confirms his suspicions by tripping <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> up with a bit of
clever dialogue, something about a paper cut received recently in
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> _ A-ha! We're supposed to be in occupied <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>! Understand,
this not exactly a battle of wits between two mental giants.
   Only the stalwart <PERSON>John Glover</PERSON> (``David'') inspires any interest,
playing <PERSON>Gerber</PERSON>, the Nazi doctor who hatches the brainwashing plot.
   As a potential footnote for the annals of bizarre casting, the
preppy-looking <PERSON>David Marshall Grant</PERSON> (``thirtysomething'') plays a
Nazi commandant. His presence must satisfy some behind-the-scenes
debt we aren't aware of. His only plot purpose seems to be to menace
the proceedings by expressing whining doubts about the validity of
<PERSON>Dr. Gerber</PERSON>'s experiment. Not exactly the stuff of razor-edged
suspense.
   Unlike the <DATE>1964</DATE> film, ``Breaking Point'' ends with a cynical
twist, which might have played on a work of contemporary fiction,
but isn't particularly compelling as part of a historical drama.
Most viewers do know we won the war, don't they?
   Despite some wonderfully inane dialogue _ eg., <PERSON>Dr. Gerber</PERSON>: ``You
won't have to sleep with Major Pike again.'' Nurse <PERSON>Anna</PERSON>, with
straight face: ``Thank you, sir.'' _ the breaking point for most
viewers will come about 10 minutes into the film.

<HEAD>Age of Designer Onions Has Industry All But Crying</HEAD>

   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower <LOCATION>Rio Grande Valley</LOCATION>'s grapefruit-size variety
known as the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them <ORGANIZATION>UPS</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service</ORGANIZATION>),'' said <PERSON>Dr. Leonard Pike</PERSON>,
a <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> horticultural scientist who developed the
<DATE>1015</DATE>.
   Since <DATE>1974</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Valley</ORGANIZATION> growers have helped fund <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in
research grants for the continuing project that Pike leads in the
quest for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his round, yellow <PERSON>Texas Grano</PERSON> 1015 _ named for the
optimum planting date of <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> _ in <DATE>1983</DATE>, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Maui Maui</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Valley</ORGANIZATION>.
``Grano'' in the <DATE>1015</DATE>'s name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' <PERSON>Dale DeBerry</PERSON>, owner of
<ORGANIZATION>Progreso Produce Co.</ORGANIZATION>, said of the trend. ``You can see that by the
number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   The sweet <DATE>spring</DATE> onions are available only for a six-week period
beginning in <DATE>mid-April</DATE>. DeBerry's company and others have started
labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who
ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said <PERSON>Paula Fouchek</PERSON>, executive director
of the Harlingen-based <ORGANIZATION>Texas Fresh Promotional Board</ORGANIZATION>, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>' onion crop is the sweet <DATE>spring</DATE>
variety, said <PERSON>Erv Sandlin</PERSON>, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>.
   Texas onion growers got <MONEY>$77.8 million</MONEY> for their crop last year,
making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said <PERSON>Doug
Bierstedt</PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Agricultural Statistics Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the <DATE>spring</DATE> crop, <PERSON>Bierstedt</PERSON> said. About 3,500
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> acres are planted in the <DATE>1015</DATE>.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its <LOCATION>South Texas</LOCATION>
spring crop hits the market early, growers say. Until the <DATE>spring</DATE>
onions hit the market, consumers are eating the more pungent winter
storage variety grown in many states.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and <DATE>spring</DATE> begins,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Othal Brand Sr.</ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION>McAllen-based
Griffin &amp; Brand Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is the largest onion producer in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   On an early <DATE>spring</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, Brand, who is mayor of <LOCATION>McAllen</LOCATION>,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the <DATE>spring</DATE> crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said he is working on ways to store the <DATE>spring</DATE> onions
longer. He also is researching the source of the <DATE>1015</DATE>'s mildness,
which he said stems mainly from a low level of pyruvic acid, which
reacts with sulfur compounds to produce some of the unsavory
qualities in a more typical onion.
   ``Very rarely will you get one (<DATE>1015</DATE>) that will bring tears to
your eyes,'' <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said.
   The <DATE>1015</DATE> also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
<PERSON>Pike</PERSON>, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the <DATE>spring</DATE> season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Four Navy Spy Satellites Said To Soar Aboard Refurbished ICBM</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 2 rocket that
once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into
space <DATE>Monday</DATE>, carrying a secret <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> payload believed to be
four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships.
   The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles
had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second
time <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a
week.
   ``It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as
expected,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Norma Payne</PERSON>.
   But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two
to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended
polar orbit circling the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> from North to <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> poles.
   The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition to
the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System</ORGANIZATION>, an
electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Soviet
and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, space
policy analyst <PERSON>John Pike</PERSON> said before the launch.
   ``The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> really likes them,'' said <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>, of the
Washington-based <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American Scientists</ORGANIZATION>. ``They are very
important for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.''
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION>White Cloud</ORGANIZATION> launch ``consists of one mother
satellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit is
reached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so
all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in
polar orbit.
   The <MONEY>$37.5 million</MONEY> Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 West
and into fog-shrouded skies at <TIME>2:25 a.m. PDT</TIME>, <PERSON>Ms. Payne</PERSON> said at
this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.
   The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town of
<LOCATION>Lompoc</LOCATION>, where police said they received a half-dozen calls from
residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch.
   The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capable
of lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit.
   Starting in the <DATE>1960s</DATE>, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in
<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, where they served as intercontinental
ballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead.
   But the missiles were removed from service ``because the
propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had
a tendency to blow up,'' <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a <MONEY>$528.9 million</MONEY> contract with <ORGANIZATION>Martin Marietta Corp</ORGANIZATION>.
<ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officials have said more are likely to be refurbished
because recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building new
rockets.
   Last <DATE>Friday</DATE>, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a <MONEY>$65 million</MONEY> Titan 34D
rocket from <LOCATION>Cape Canaveral</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla</LOCATION>. But a source close to the project,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the
upper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there was
little hope of salvaging that mission.
   Despite that failure, <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Edward C.</PERSON> ``Pete''
<PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON> issued a prepared statement after <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s launch,
declaring, ``This is the year of space launch recovery.''
   ``Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three new
boosters the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> will launch in the coming year,'' <PERSON>Aldridge</PERSON>
said. ``The Titan 2, Titan 4 and the <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> 2 ... will ensure this
nation's access to space for many years to come.''
   The launch had been expected <DATE>a week earlier</DATE>, but apparently was
delayed by a fuel leak that the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> said spurred evacuation
of the launch pad <DATE>Aug. 28</DATE>. No one was hurt in that incident,
officials said.
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost into
orbit from <LOCATION>Vandenberg</LOCATION> was a <ORGANIZATION>Defense Meteorological Support Program</ORGANIZATION>
satellite. But he called that unlikely.
   A Titan 2 exploded in its <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> silo on <DATE>Sept. 19, 1980</DATE>,
killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-wide
crater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet
from the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo
evacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have been
replaced by <ORGANIZATION>Minuteman</ORGANIZATION>, Midgetman and MX missiles.
   Pike said <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officials have testified before <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
that the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for one
launch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launches
of DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a
classified program.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE>, he said.
   Pike compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or <ORGANIZATION>Radar Ocean
Reconaissance Satellites</ORGANIZATION>, which monitor <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ship movements.

Despite the state attorney general's sudden leap into a yearlong legal fight to 
block a complex at the former site of the Pike amusement park, developers are 
vowing to go "right straight ahead" with work on one of the nation's largest 
renewal endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin by the end of next year on the oceanfront 
3-million-acre, <MONEY>$900-million</MONEY> "city-within-a-city," described by <PERSON>City Hall</PERSON> as 
the centerpiece of a downtown renaissance -- and by critics as an assault on 
the local environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going right straight ahead with the project," said <PERSON>Wayne Ratkovich</PERSON>, one 
of several influential developers for the Pike project. "We are not hesitating 
for a moment. We have a very low regard for the attorney general's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ratkovich</PERSON> was responding to a friend-of-the-court opinion filed last week by 
Atty. Gen. <PERSON>John K. Van de Kamp</PERSON>, who said the city violated in environmental 
laws when it approved the <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION> plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
The brief was a boost to 800 members of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved and 
other area watchdog groups that have sued to stop the project, which would 
include 250 condominium units, a 300-suite hotel and 200,000 square feet of 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the project and other downtown developments will attract 
thousands of cars, pollute the air and turn surrounding neighborhoods into 
"freeway off-ramps." 
</P>
<P>
The critics lost in a trial earlier this year, then turned to the state Court 
of Appeal, where Van de Kamp's opinion will be considered along with volumes of 
evidence. A hearing date is pending. 
</P>
<P>
But <PERSON>Ratkovich</PERSON> -- an influential businessman known for restoring the Wiltern 
Theatre complex and other historic buildings in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> -- said he is 
confident that the lawsuit will ultimately fail and that <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> will see 
the completion of a development that has been likened to <ORGANIZATION>Embarcadero Center</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine," <PERSON>Ratkovich</PERSON> said, "that an attorney general of any state is so 
wise and so all-seeing and all-knowing that he has . . . greater wisdom than 
the citizens of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, the (city) <ORGANIZATION>Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Redevelopment 
Agency</ORGANIZATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION>Coastal Commission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say a nest of downtown buildings already approved by the city would 
bring 114,000 more cars into town daily -- more than one-third of them 
generated by the Pike project. (That figure does not take into account the 
resort and theme park proposal that was recently unveiled by <ORGANIZATION>Walt Disney Co.</ORGANIZATION>, 
which could attract 13 million tourists a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Area Citizens Involved and others argue that the city broke the law 
by failing to consider the total of environmental damage that mammoth 
development could bring -- further stressing <LOCATION>Ocean Boulevard</LOCATION>, 7th Street, 
Broadway and other beleaguered east-west corridors. 
</P>
<P>
"Those streets are already crowded," Long Beach Area Citizens Involved attorney 
<PERSON>Marc Allen Coleman</PERSON> said. "Where are they going to put 114,000 more cars? The 
law says you cannot approve a project until these kinds of problems are 
mitigated. I can't believe they are planning a city this way." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and developers contend that environmental problems have been 
considered and that steps have been taken to make sure <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> can absorb 
such impacts, not to mention the wealth of tax revenue new development would 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager <PERSON>John Shirey</PERSON> said: "We recognize that whether it be 
Disney or the Pike project or somebody who wants to expand a hot dog stand, 
there will be traffic issues. But we think people underestimate the ability of 
the current transportation system to handle traffic in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> . . . and 
they underestimate our resolve to make sure those problems are worked out." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are confident that the Pike project will ultimately go forward. 
But, they wonder, when? 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION> were unveiled with great fanfare two years ago. But the land 
south of <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> between <ORGANIZATION>Magnolia</ORGANIZATION> and Pine avenues remains an ugly 
patchwork of vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for downtown," Community Development Director <PERSON>Susan Shick</PERSON> 
said, "so we would like to see it started. A major project is always better 
under construction than simply talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Shick and others looked to the slumping economy, the savings and loan crisis 
and a general "real estate trough" to explain the apparent delay. 
</P>
<P>
But developers said the project is not behind schedule at all, just moving 
steadily through a maze of conditions to put together a virtually 
self-contained community of homes, shops, hotel rooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ratkovich</PERSON> said: "The architects are hard at work, and there are armies of 
engineers gathering in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> as we speak. There is an enormous amount of 
work to do on a project this size." 
</P>
<P>
After the project won full approval last year, developers retained New 
York-based <LOCATION>Salomon Bros</LOCATION>. Inc. to help them market the idea in what is now a 
global search for investors. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bruce Hart</PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION>Pike Properties Associates</ORGANIZATION>, would not discuss financing 
details, other than to say it is going "very well." <ORGANIZATION>Pike Properties</ORGANIZATION> -- a 
partnership of the <ORGANIZATION>Ratkovich Co.</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Enterprise Development Co.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, 
and <ORGANIZATION>Copley Real Estate Advisers</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> -- bought the site in <DATE>1986</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said the real estate slump would not affect a project of this size, which 
would be built over 15 years and through two or three real estate cycles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking with investors who have the capacity to invest in a <MONEY>$900-million</MONEY> 
project," <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said. "These are people with a very long-term view. We're not 
selling a building that will be occupied tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the project's four phases will be decided according to the demands of 
the market of the day, <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Official Sees Shift of Research and Development Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> research official said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> defense industrial base is being hurt by American
companies' increasing shift of research and development activities
overseas.
   ``I'm very concerned about the movement of research and
development offshore,'' said <PERSON>Craig I. Fields</PERSON>, deputy director for
research of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</ORGANIZATION>.
   Fields said that while companies may have made the ``right
business decision'' in the short run, such a trend is likely to
have an adverse impact on this country's long-term military and
economic capabilities.
   He also expressed concern about the ``increasing dependency of
the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> on foreign components and technologies.''
   <ORGANIZATION>DARPA</ORGANIZATION> has sought to bolster <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> capabilities by channeling
research funds into key technologies _ including advanced
semiconductors, supercomputers and so-called artificial
intelligence _ with both military and civilian applications.
   Fields, speaking at a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>American
Association</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Science</ORGANIZATION>, said much more needs to
be done to coordinate <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> longer-term defense research aims with
programs of civilian agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``It has to be a government-wide posture, not a defense posture
alone,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Jacques Gansler</PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> official, called for the
formulation of an overall ``defense industrial technology
strategy'' to guide military research and development efforts.
   Currently <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> weapons ``are being designed so that they are
incredibly expensive and so complex that they won't work,'' said
<PERSON>Gansler</PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Analytic Sciences Corp.</ORGANIZATION>, a
research company in suburban <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
   He said that with greater emphasis on manufacturing process
technology, the nation's defense industries should be able to
achieve higher quality production at lower cost.
   Also speaking at the conference was <PERSON>John Pike</PERSON>, associate
director for space policy of the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American Scientists</ORGANIZATION>,
a Washington-based public interest group.
   Pike, a long-time critic of the <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> missile defense
effort, said that the program _ formally called the <ORGANIZATION>Strategic
Defense Initiative</ORGANIZATION> _ now appears to be firmly entrenched and on the
verge of demonstrating ``real technological results.''
   With the scaling-down of <ORGANIZATION>Star Wars</ORGANIZATION> goals from a complete nuclear
shield to defense of selected <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military targets, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said,
``at least we're dealing with a system whose cost and performance
goals are not obviously absurd.''
   Reagan announced the research effort in a televised speech in
<DATE>March 1983</DATE>. For the current fiscal year, <MONEY>$4.1 billion</MONEY> is provided
for SDI. <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s last budget requested an increase to <MONEY>$5.9 billion</MONEY>
for the <DATE>1990</DATE> fiscal year.
   ``Beginning this year we are going to start seeing real tests of
real hardware,'' including high-powered lasers, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said.

   Higher prices are cropping up in
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> restaurants, especially those offering vegetarian fare, in
the wake of the Christmas freeze that wiped out much of the state's
winter farms.
   A few restaurant owners say they've had to raise prices just to

   ``I'm a vegetarian restaurant, so I'm feeling more than a

   <PERSON>McKenna</PERSON> said a few weeks ago he was buying tomatoes for <MONEY>$8.50</MONEY> a
case, but now he is paying <MONEY>$23</MONEY>. As a result, he raised the price of
the meal-sized salads at his cafe by <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Taurus Steak House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>'s Coconut Grove section has been
adding a <MONEY>$1.75</MONEY> surcharge for their salad bar since the day after
<DATE>Christmas</DATE> because fo the higher vegetable prices, said <PERSON>Dave Hill
Jr.</PERSON>, the restaurant's manager.
   At Ruby <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> chain restaurants, the prices have not changed,
but some days they've left cherry tomatoes and green peppers off
salads.
   ``We have not increased our prices, but we've had to delete a
few items,'' said <PERSON>Craig Marcy</PERSON>, a senior assistant at <ORGANIZATION>Ruby</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>
in <LOCATION>Fort Lauderdale</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Broward Mall</ORGANIZATION>.
   Most big restaurant chains are bearing the cost without changes.
   ``We're just absorbing the extra cost,'' said <PERSON>Cheri Grey</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Steak &amp; Ale</ORGANIZATION> regional headquarters in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION>. ``This is just short
term.''
   Prices fluctuate in any market and effect the restaurant
industry, said <PERSON>Frank Pike</PERSON>, chairman of the board of the <ORGANIZATION>Palm Beach
County Chapter of the Florida Restaurant Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This happens in a multitude of categories _ beef, stone
crabs,'' <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said. ``They can't change their prices every time the
market fluctuates.''
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said it is too early to assess the impact of increased
vegetable costs on the restaurant industry as a whole.

<HEAD>Age of Designer Onions Has Industry All But Crying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower <LOCATION>Rio Grande Valley</LOCATION>'s grapefruit-size variety
known as the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them <ORGANIZATION>UPS</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>United Parcel Service</ORGANIZATION>),'' said <PERSON>Dr. Leonard Pike</PERSON>,
a <ORGANIZATION>Texas A&amp;M University</ORGANIZATION> horticultural scientist who developed the
<DATE>1015</DATE>.
   Since <DATE>1974</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Valley</ORGANIZATION> growers have helped fund <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY> in
research grants for the continuing project Pike leads in the quest
for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his <ORGANIZATION>Texas Grano</ORGANIZATION> 1015 _ named for the optimum
planting date of <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> _ in <DATE>1983</DATE>, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Maui Maui</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Imperial Valley</ORGANIZATION>.
``Grano'' in the <DATE>1015</DATE>'s name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' said <PERSON>Dale DeBerry</PERSON>, owner of
<ORGANIZATION>Progreso Produce Co.</ORGANIZATION> ``You can see that by the number of tourists
who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   On a recent afternoon, a steady stream of winter Texans drove up
to his company near the border town of Progreso, but the round,
yellow 1015s weren't in yet.
   The sweet <DATE>spring</DATE> onions are only available for a six-week period
beginning in <DATE>mid-April</DATE>.
   DeBerry's company and others have started labeling the 1015s
with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said <PERSON>Paula Fouchek</PERSON>, executive director
of the Harlingen-based <ORGANIZATION>Texas Fresh Promotional Board</ORGANIZATION>, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>' onion crop is the sweet <DATE>spring</DATE>
variety, said <PERSON>Erv Sandlin</PERSON>, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION>.
   Onions last year brought <MONEY>$77.8 million</MONEY> to onion producers in
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said
<PERSON>Doug Bierstedt</PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Agricultural Statistics Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the <DATE>spring</DATE> crop, <PERSON>Bierstedt</PERSON> said. About 3,500
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> acres are planted in the <DATE>1015</DATE>.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its <LOCATION>South Texas</LOCATION>
spring crop hits the market early, growers say.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and <DATE>spring</DATE> begins,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Othal Brand Sr.</ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION>McAllen-based
Griffin &amp; Brand Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is the largest onion producer in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>.
   Until the <DATE>spring</DATE> onions hit the market, consumers are eating the
more pungent winter storage onions grown in many states.
   On an early <DATE>spring</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, Brand, who is mayor of <LOCATION>McAllen</LOCATION>,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the <DATE>spring</DATE> crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said he is working on ways to store the <DATE>spring</DATE> onions
longer.
   He also is researching just what makes the <DATE>1015</DATE> mild, and said
it mainly is because of a low level of a substance known as pyruvic
acid, which reacts with sulfur compounds to cause the things that
give the vegetable a bad image.
   ``Very rarely will you get one that will bring tears to your
eyes,'' <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said.
   The <DATE>1015</DATE> also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
<PERSON>Pike</PERSON>, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the <DATE>spring</DATE> season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Bob Scarborough</PERSON>, who manages gift packages for <ORGANIZATION>Bartlett Groves</ORGANIZATION>
in <LOCATION>McAllen</LOCATION>, said his company started shipping the special boxes of
onions last year after shipping the more conventional gift citrus
for several years.
   ``As a matter of fact, I still have a little trouble with it
when you equate a package of onions with a gift package of oranges
or grapefruits,'' <PERSON>Scarborough</PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police Officers Guilty in Queens Stun Gun Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police sergeant and a suspended officer
were convicted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> of torturing a drug suspect with an
electric stun gun three years ago.
   In addition, a former officer was convicted of beating of the
man at his home, and a suspended lieutenant was found guilty of
abetting the beating.
   The defendants were among several police officers from the same
<LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION> precinct implicated in <DATE>1985</DATE> in the alleged torture of drug
suspects with the stun gun, which delivers a powerful, temporarily
disabling jolt of up to 40,000 volts.
   Everton <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON> had testified that four officers beat him in his
home in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and that two of them had later used a stun gun on him
at the station, holding him down and giving him shocks from the
hand-held device.
   The 34-year-old taxi driver testified that the stun gun was used
on his abdomen seven to 10 times for five seconds at a time. He has
also filed a <MONEY>$50 million</MONEY> lawsuit against the city and the <ORGANIZATION>Police
Department</ORGANIZATION>.
   Former Sgt. <PERSON>Richard Pike</PERSON> and suspended Officer <PERSON>Loren MacCary</PERSON>
were convicted of assault, official misconduct and coercion and
could receive up to seven years in prison.
   <PERSON>Jeffrey Gilbert</PERSON>, a former officer, was convicted of the same
charges in the beating. Suspended Lt. <PERSON>Steven Cheswick</PERSON>, who
supervised the other three, was convicted of official misconduct
and faces up to a year in jail.
   The jury had begun deliberating <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>.
   Pike was found guilty in both the beating and the stun gun
attack; MacCary was convicted in the stun gun attack; and <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON>
was found guilty in the beating.
   Cheswick, prosecutors said, had blocked <PERSON>Evelyn</PERSON>'s wife from
aiding her husband during the beating and had not tried to stop the
beating.
   The four defendants will be sentenced <DATE>March 29</DATE>.
   The trial was the second of four scheduled for officers of the
106th precinct who allegedly tortured suspects with stun guns in
<DATE>1985</DATE>. Pike and <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> already are serving two to six years for
their convictions in the first trial, in <DATE>1986</DATE>.

Corona del Mar Coach <PERSON>John Vargas</PERSON> was overcome with emotion after his <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> 
had defeated <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION>, 7-6, on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to reach the Southern Section 4-A 
water polo final. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best possible feeling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best? 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . if you want to get technical, the second best," said <PERSON>Vargas</PERSON>, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
The best would come on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, if the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> can beat Villa Park in the 
final. But for now, <PERSON>Vargas</PERSON> will be happy with what he's got. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sixth consecutive season that the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> have reached the final. 
They have won two consecutive championships and three of the past four. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, getting there was a problem. Corona del Mar (27-3) had lost 
twice to <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION> during the regular season, including the final of the 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> state tournament at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
In both of those games, <ORGANIZATION>Corona del Mar</ORGANIZATION> had opportunities and had failed to 
capitalize. This time, it was El Dorado (25-4), the No. 1 seeded team, which 
let chances get away. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> rallied from a 2-0 deficit to take a 4-2 halftime lead. But in 
the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>, the Golden Hawks put on the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Matt Maclear</PERSON> scored with less than a minute gone in the second half to cut the 
<ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION>' lead to 4-3. <ORGANIZATION>El Dorado</ORGANIZATION> then had three chances to score, but came 
away with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
With a man advantage, the Golden Hawks worked the ball in close to <PERSON>Larry Felix</PERSON>, 
but his shot was blocked by goalie <PERSON>Rob Pike</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks were again on the attack with a man advantage. This time, 
however, bad luck denied them. 
</P>
<P>
First, <PERSON>Kyle Utsumi</PERSON> beat <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> to the left, but his shot hit the post. El Dorado 
got the rebound and worked the ball around to the left wing, but <PERSON>Jim Leonard</PERSON>'s 
shot hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON> hit the post with another shot. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> weathered the attacks and then scored two goals to take a 6-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances, we just didn't cash them in," <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION> Coach <PERSON>John Bowman</PERSON> 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Hawks</ORGANIZATION> would keep getting them. In the <DATE>fourth quarter</DATE>, <PERSON>Utsumi</PERSON> 
scored two goals in 23 seconds to get <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION> within 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks had two chances to tie. The first shot, by <PERSON>Greg Milton</PERSON>, hit 
the post, and the second, by <PERSON>Maclear</PERSON>, was blocked by <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Pike finished with 10 saves, seven in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a perfect example of team defense," <PERSON>Vargas</PERSON> said. "Everybody worked 
together and helped each other." 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' first two encounters, the <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> had trouble holding onto the 
ball against the Golden Hawk defense. Corona del Mar turned the ball over five 
times in the <DATE>first quarter</DATE> and only took one shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, <LOCATION>El Dorado</LOCATION> led only 1-0 after the <DATE>first quarter</DATE>, on a goal by <PERSON>Maclear</PERSON>. 
The Golden Hawks missed three open shots and three others were blocked by <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Being down only one goal was a blessing," <PERSON>Vargas</PERSON> said. "I think we were too up 
for this game. I told the kids to move around more, and that helped settle them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar did, scoring four goals in the <DATE>second quarter</DATE>. <PERSON>Ryan Weir</PERSON>, who 
had four goals in the game, and <PERSON>Gunnar Gustafson</PERSON> each scored two in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>Sea Kings</ORGANIZATION> then turned away the Golden Hawks in the <DATE>second half</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," <PERSON>Vargas</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
But not the best, technically. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the other 4-A semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 8, Sunny Hills 5 -- The Spartans (25-4) reached the final for the 
first time in six years with a victory at <ORGANIZATION>Newport Harbor High School</ORGANIZATION>. Villa 
Park had been eliminated in the quarterfinals every year since reaching the 3-A 
championship game in <DATE>1982</DATE>. <PERSON>Gavin Arroyo</PERSON> scored four goals, including one with 
3:14 left, to give the Spartans a 7-4 lead. Villa Park led, 4-1, at halftime, 
but Sunny Hills (20-9) got within 4-3 in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. <PERSON>Gary Larson</PERSON> and 
<PERSON>Neal Brockmeier</PERSON> each had two goals for <LOCATION>Villa Park</LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pi Kappa Alpha Kicked Out Of Stetson University</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hazing incident has led to the banishment
of a <ORGANIZATION>Stetson University</ORGANIZATION> fraternity that got into trouble over rape
allegations against several members last year.
   The Baptist-affiliated school announced <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that it had
withdrawn recognition of Pi <PERSON>Kappa Alpha</PERSON> as a result of an
investigation that found members had degraded pledges, conducted a
public stunt and inflicted mental abuse.
   A <DATE>Nov. 9</DATE> incident involving frat members, known as ``Pikes,'' in
the <ORGANIZATION>Ocala National Forest</ORGANIZATION> reflected poorly on the campus'
fraternith and sorority system, the university said in a statement.
It did not give details of the hazing.
   As a result of <ORGANIZATION>Stetson</ORGANIZATION>'s action, <LOCATION>Pi Kappa Alpha</LOCATION>'s national
office suspended the fraternity's charter, and the organization's
executive director said he will try to have the chapter kicked out.
   A fraternity member, the Stetson chapter, the national
organization and the university have been sued by a woman who told
investigators she was raped during a night of heavy drinking and
dancing at the <LOCATION>Pike</LOCATION> house in <DATE>April 1988</DATE>.
   The state attorney's office investigated the rape complaint
against two fraternity brothers. It found that they did have sexual
contact with the woman but said rape could not be proved.
   The woman's attorney, <PERSON>Sheldon Stevens</PERSON>, said additional
fraternity members would be added to the lawsuit before it goes to
trial.
   Four Pikes were suspended for one semester as a result of that
incident, and the fraternity was prohibited from participating in
social activities or sporting events.
   <PERSON>Steve Cox</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Pi Kappa Alpha</ORGANIZATION>'s national executive director, said
the Stetson chapter had been one category below a fully accredited
chapter since last <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   University officials will not elaborate on the school's actions
or make public the results of the investigation, said college
spokeswoman <PERSON>Jacqueline D. Kersh</PERSON>.
   The university defines hazing as ``any action taken or situation
created by the members of a fraternity intentionally, whether on or
off fraternity premises, to produce any physical or psychological
harm to the individual.''

   Gnarlatious Novels: Lurid Thrillers for the Teen Set

<LP>
   Christopher Pike is understandably edgy about seeing his
real name in print. When his true identity was revealed in a
trade magazine article several years ago, the results were
disastrous.
   "A bunch of kids found out where I lived and I had to
move," said Mr. Pike, the pseudonymous author of some 20
thrillers for teens. "It spread like a rumor where I was . .
. It got weird. I have very intense fans."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to novels such as "Slumber Party" and "Scavenger
Hunt," <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON>, a 35-year-old former computer programmer who
took his nom de plume from the first captain of the <ORGANIZATION>Starship
Enterprise</ORGANIZATION>, has a cult following that would do any <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> rocker
or sitcom star proud. Some 100 fan letters choke his mailbox
each week.
   <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> is one of the unsung, un-Pulitzered celebrities
of today's literary scene, one of a handful of writers who
churn out wildly popular spooky tales and murder mysteries
tailored for teenagers.
   Teen thrillers are the biggest thing to happen to the
young-adult book market since <PERSON>Nancy Drew</PERSON> drove on the scene
in her blue roadster.
   Publishers are tight-lipped on the subject of sales. <PERSON>Mr.
Pike</PERSON>'s publisher, Pocket Books, would reveal only that more
than two million copies of the highly popular writer's
paperbacks would be shipped to bookstores this year.
Apparently, a lot of them will sell: Teen thrillers make
regular appearances on the weekly best-seller lists
circulated by trade bookstores.
   Head for the young-adult section of any chain bookstore
and you'll see them: rows of luridly jacketed paperbacks with
titles such as "The Cheerleader" ("She would do anything to
be popular"), "Blind Date" ("It wasn't a date. It was a
nightmare"), and "Final Exam" ("If you fail . . . you'll just
die"). No teen-related stone is left unturned. "Prom Dress,"
reads the jagged orange title on one <PERSON>Lael Littke</PERSON> book, over
an eerily glowing white gown. "It's a dress to die for . . ."
   These books aren't Newbery Award contenders, but even
librarians find them hard to dismiss. "Well, my personal
philosophy is, if they're reading anything at all that's
wonderful," said <PERSON>Molly Kinney</PERSON>, a librarian with the
<ORGANIZATION>Miami-Dade Public Library</ORGANIZATION> system, who reviews young adult
thrillers for <ORGANIZATION>School Library Journal</ORGANIZATION>. "They're also a way to
get involved with something . . . evil without ever acting on
it."
   Certainly they don't get much more evil than <PERSON>Christopher
Pike</PERSON>, who is hailed as the <PERSON>Stephen King</PERSON> of teen fiction. <PERSON>Mr.
Pike</PERSON>'s novels feature an assortment of stalkers, psychos and
killer co-eds that would make <PERSON>Nancy Drew</PERSON>'s pageboy flip stand
on end. Take <PERSON>Alexa</PERSON>, the homicidal cheerleader and cocaine
fiend of "Die Softly":
   "She just knelt right in front of me, kind of like a
sacrifice," <PERSON>Alexa</PERSON> says, describing how she offed her ex-best
friend <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON>. "I brought the bat down on her head quickly. The
wood cracked -- so did her skull . . . The blood gushed over
her blond hair. It was much darker than I thought it would
be."
   If <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON>'s novels are gorier than most, they also boast
some of the more inventively sexy plots. In "Die Softly," an
amateur photographer sets up a camera in the girls' showers
to get shots of naked cheerleaders, only to end up with
photos of a murder. In "Remember Me," a vapid high school
co-ed returns from the dead to find out who pushed her off a
balcony at a party -- taking time out to spy on her boyfriend
with his new squeeze.
   "Teenagers are very fascinated by the subject of life
after death," <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> said. "I got very beautiful letters
from kids who say they were going to kill themselves before
they read that book."
   Despite his apparent hot line to the teen psyche, <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON>
never set out to write for young adults. A college dropout,
he spent years writing science fiction that no one would
publish. Then his agent suggested he try his hand at a teen
thriller. "Slumber Party" -- about a group of girls stalked
by a killer on a ski weekend -- came out in <DATE>1985</DATE>, and he
hasn't stopped writing thrillers since.
   "They kept offering me more money," <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> explained.
"But I enjoy it . . . teenage characters are so extreme."
   Nightmare-prone readers may find <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON>'s characters a
little too extreme: The evil <PERSON>Alexa</PERSON> kills the photographer
hero of "Die Softly" by forcing him to snort a lethal amount
of cocaine.
   Not all publishers permit this kind of brutality. "Nobody
actually dies in Scholastic thrillers," said <PERSON>Lenora Todaro</PERSON>, a
senior publicist for <ORGANIZATION>Scholastic</ORGANIZATION>. "People appear murdered, but
they usually show up at the end."
   Safe scares are part of the appeal of <PERSON>R.L. Stine</PERSON>. He draws
the 10-to-12-year-old crowd with his popular "Fear Street"
series -- set in the creepy town of <LOCATION>Shadyside</LOCATION> -- and with
novels such as "The Baby-Sitter" and "Beach Party." Although
they have their share of spooks and stalkers, these stories
are as safe as a roller-coaster ride in a kiddie amusement
park -- with more false alarms than a semester's worth of
fire drills.
   "With a hideous ear-shattering screech, something leaped
out of the darkness at them," ends one chapter of <PERSON>Mr. Stine</PERSON>'s
"Party Summer," in which four teens are stranded in the
lonely <ORGANIZATION>Howling Wolf Inn</ORGANIZATION>. Scared? Don't worry. It's only a
bat.
   "Kids love the cliffhanger chapter endings," <PERSON>Mr. Stine</PERSON>
explained.
   Although he has written nearly 100 books for children --
including many joke books under the moniker <PERSON>Jovial Bob Stine</PERSON>
-- the 47-year-old author seems a little mystified by the
popularity of his 20-odd thrillers, which he now turns out
about once a month.
   "It's creepy," he said. "I ask kids all the time, `Why do
you read this stuff?' . . . I get letters saying, `I was
screaming so loud my parents came running into the room.' I
love that. It's being scared and being safe at the same
time."
   <PERSON>Mr. Stine</PERSON>'s books are particularly teen-friendly because
he makes a serious effort to pepper them with current
Teenspeak gleaned from <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> and his 10-year-old son, <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON>.
   "For sure, dude. Gnarly," observes one of the characters
in "Party Summer." "Gnarlatious]" her ponytailed male admirer
responds.
   If <PERSON>Mr. Stine</PERSON> does firsthand linguistic research, at least
one teen thriller author claims to base her stories on
firsthand experience with the supernatural. "I had a haunted
childhood," said <PERSON>Richie Tankersley Cusick</PERSON>, author of seven
thrillers. "We did have a ghost in our house. He was there
for years. He was very mischievous . . . he would throw all
the Christmas ornaments in the middle of the floor."
   The evil-doers who haunt <PERSON>Ms. Cusick</PERSON>'s fiction do more
damage than that. "Don't call for help," a blurb on the cover
of "The Lifeguard" warns. "He may just kill you." In fact,
this psycho in swim trunks just about ruins <ORGANIZATION>Kelsey</ORGANIZATION>'s
vacation, leaving clumps of seaweed in her bedroom and the
odd dead body on the beach.
   But that's nothing next to the nasty surprise that the
heroine of "April Fools" finds in her mailbox: "The scream
she'd been holding back rose into her throat and stuck there,
the awful hideous thing in her hand looking back at her
beneath a smeared coating of mashed entrails. It was a head."
A doll's head, that is.
   In order to write such scary prose, it helps to be a
little bit spooked yourself. To get herself in the mood, <PERSON>Ms.
Cusick</PERSON> works at an antique rolltop desk that once belonged to
a funeral director (she thinks it may be haunted), as
soundtracks from horror movies play in the background.
   They help ward off the biggest nightmare of all. "When you
have writer's block it's good to put them on," <PERSON>Ms. Cusick</PERSON>
said. "I use them for inspiration."

<HEAD>Tornado Hits Georgia; High Winds and Rain Across Alabama</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A violent storm front packing tornado-like winds and at least
one confirmed tornado racked parts of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> <TIME>this
morning</TIME>, flipping trailer homes and downing trees and power lines
and critically injuring three people.
   Initial damage reports from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, where the tornado
touchdown was confirmed, were sketchy. In <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, authorities
reported serious damage and injuries near Opp, which was hit by
tornado-like winds shortly before dawn, and to the northeast in
<LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION>,.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said <PERSON>Robert Booth</PERSON>, a radio reporter with
station WOPP in Opp, a town of 7,000 about 60 miles north of the
<LOCATION>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION>.
   The storm hit the town at about <TIME>5:50 a.m.</TIME>, knocking out power
and covering streets with the mangled remains of trees. Witnesses
said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some
neighborhoods showed widespread damage.
   At least 15 injures were reported in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>. Six people
required hospitalization, including three who were critically
injured in <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> when a twister or tornado-force winds
demolished trailer homes. The entire state remained under a flash
flood watch.
   The storm system coursed into <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> from the southwest,
sending a tornado spinning into <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> at about <TIME>9:15 a.m.</TIME>
   ``We have no severe damage that we know about,'' said <PERSON>Joy
Burnham</PERSON>, the city's emergency management director. She said some
damage was reported at a car dealership, and some roofs and trees
were blown down.
   Phone lines were down in the downtown <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> area, according
to <ORGANIZATION>Southern Bell</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Lynne Bress</PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Power Co.</ORGANIZATION>
spokeswoman <PERSON>Meg Reggie</PERSON> said only a few hundred customers were
without power.
   It was the second tornado in downtown <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> this month. On
<DATE>Feb. 10</DATE>, the city was hit by one of several twisters that touched
down in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> during a storm.
   In northern <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, where 10 inches or more of rain fell on
some sections last week, the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> predicted up
to 2 inches of rain <DATE>today</DATE> as the storms moved through.
   ``Everybody up here's praying for good things to happen,'' said
<ORGANIZATION>Trion</ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON>Hoyt Williams</PERSON>, whose town was one of the worst hit by
the earlier rain. ``I don't know what protective measures to take.
Do you?''
   <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Joe Frank Harris</PERSON> has asked for <MONEY>$15.7 million</MONEY> in
federal disaster aid for nine counties _ <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Chattooga</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cobb</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Fannin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gilmer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gordon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Murray</PERSON> and <PERSON>Walker</PERSON> _ because of
recent floods and tornadoes.
   A flash flood watch issued by the <ORGANIZATION>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION> for
today covered an area that included <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Athens</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>.
   Harris estimated <DATE>Monday</DATE> that storms since <DATE>Feb. 10</DATE> have killed
six people and injured 32 in the state. He said 39 homes were
destroyed, while 470 houses and 129 businesses were damaged.
   In <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>, the most severe damage today appeared to follow a
northeast path from Opp through <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Barbour County</LOCATION>. In
<LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION>, officials said four people were injured in mobile
homes and a pickup truck was blown into a tree; in <LOCATION>Barbour County</LOCATION>,
sheriff's deputy <PERSON>R.H. Johnson</PERSON> said four house trailers were damaged.
   Trees and power lines also were snapped off in <LOCATION>Chambers</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Tallapoosa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Bullock</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> counties, and the wind was clocked
at 76 mph in <LOCATION>Dothan</LOCATION>.
   An elementary school in <LOCATION>Auburn</LOCATION> was closed after high winds sent
two trees crashing into the building. No injuries were reported. A
middle school at <ORGANIZATION>Auburn</ORGANIZATION> also was closed by a power outage.

<HEAD>Anniversary Rekindles Interest in Hatfiled-McCoy Feud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years after the Hatfield-McCoy
feud ended, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> is embroiled in a polite debate on the
propriety of cashing in on the bloodshed.
   Guides at <LOCATION>Chief Logan State Park</LOCATION> led three-hour tours of <ORGANIZATION>Feudin</ORGANIZATION>'
Country during a weeklong festival that ended <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. The show
included films, slide shows, music and souvenirs.
   ``This part of the state doesn't have high mountains and
waterfalls, but we do have the most interesting history,'' said
<PERSON>Alvin Gale</PERSON>, a park ranger who leads the tours. ``It's not something
to be proud of, but it is history.''
   ``I guess things had to be settled one way or another,'' said
<PERSON>Liz Clay</PERSON>, 66, who went on one of the tours last week. ``That's
life, honey. To know what went on years ago.''
   At least 14 people died in the feud that pitted the McCoy clan
of <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION>, against the <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> clan of <LOCATION>Logan County</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION>, part of which is now <LOCATION>Mingo County</LOCATION>.
   No one knows what prompted the bloodshed. Speculation centers on
a stolen hog and a Romeo-and-Juliet romance between two members of
the families. Whatever set it off, it took the intervention of the
governors of two states to bring peace in <DATE>1888</DATE>.
   The tour covers five cemeteries, two dilapidated houses, one
battle site and some papaw bushes at the site where three McCoy
brothers were slain by the <LOCATION>Hatfields</LOCATION>.
   Only one <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> cemetery is included, and some Kentuckians
have half-jokingly accused the guides of slanting the tour toward
<LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>. State officials say they left out <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> sites
because they were too far away.
   While many revel in the homespun notoriety, some historians
contend that reviving the Hatfield-McCoy feud perpetuates ugly
stereotypes of Appalachians.
   ``To me, it's very sad for this to be a commercial thing. It's
playing on a stereotype which I don't like,'' said <PERSON>Altina L.
Waller</PERSON>, a former history professor at <ORGANIZATION>West Virginia University</ORGANIZATION>
whose book, ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
<LOCATION>Appalachia</LOCATION>, 1860-1900,'' recently was published by the <ORGANIZATION>University
of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> press.
   ``On the other hand, it's sort of coming to terms with
history,'' <PERSON>Waller</PERSON> said.
   The publicity, which pops up frequently in national magazines
and newspapers, may hurt the area more than help it, said <PERSON>Ron
Eller</PERSON>, director of the Appalachian Center at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Kentucky</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``There's probably been few other things in Appalachian history
that have reflected more of the negative stereotype as the
Hatfield-McCoy feud,'' <PERSON>Eller</PERSON> said. ``The national imagery is that
they were backwoods, isolated mountain farmers. In reality, they
were very important families who competed for land access that
would lead to economic development.''
   The tours in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> are spurring some interest in <LOCATION>Pike
County</LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION>Preservation Council of Pike County</ORGANIZATION> wants to
arrange similar tours. Sites would include the remnants of the
house where the stolen hog trial was held; the place where a
Hatfield supporter was hanged; and the grave of <PERSON>Randolph McCoy</PERSON>,
patriarch of the McCoy clan.
   ``Since it is an internationally known part of our heritage, we
need to capitalize on it,'' said <PERSON>Betsy Venters</PERSON>, the council's
president. ``It's something that the present generation wants to
know more about.''
   Pike County Judge-Executive <PERSON>Paul Patton</PERSON> isn't so sure.
   ``The Hatfield-McCoy feud is one thing that most people are
aware of. I guess people hold on to that as one thing that might
grow into a significant tourist industry,'' he said. But ``it
certainly might not promote the type of image we want.''

   Japan Can Expect Little Help With Yen
   From Its Partners in G-7, Analysts Say
   ----

<LP>
   TOKYO -- The need for Bank of Japan to raise interest
rates could increase if the meeting by the Group of Seven
industrialized nations this weekend offers little help in
supporting the yen, analysts say.
   They say Japan can expect little succor from the U.S. and
other major partners. So Bank of Japan may have to gradually
start tightening in the money market as a prelude to boosting
the official discount rate for the fifth time in a row since
last May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That may be harder this time around as interest rates are
now at the level where further increases could seriously hurt
the economy, some analysts caution. Bank of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s
tightening this past year has only reversed the easing over
the previous few years.
   What <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> needs from the <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> among
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>U.K.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>
is some coordinated interest rate action with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>,where
the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> eased rates as <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> raised them.
This would repay the easing that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> pursued for several
years after the Plaza Accord <DATE>1985</DATE> to support the dollar. The
accord was the first agreement by the G-7 for coordinated
attempts to keep the dollar within certain ranges.
   But "what they'll get is probably little but warm words
about coordinated policy," says <PERSON>David Pike</PERSON>, chief economist
at <ORGANIZATION>UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International Ltd</ORGANIZATION>. As a result, there
will be "a shift of focus back onto the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> and a
fifth hike in the <ORGANIZATION>ODR</ORGANIZATION> {official discount rate}."
   The Japanese believe that now "it is time for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> to
play its international role and help us out of our trouble,"
<PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> says. "They helped the Americans . . . with a
relatively lax monetary policy. Now they are counting the
costs."
   But the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hasn't shown much willingness to help.
   "Domestic considerations will continue to dictate <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
{monetary} policy," which is concerned more about inflation
than the yen, <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> says.
   "Unless the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> eases monetary policy, we can't expect
much appreciation in the Japanese yen," says <PERSON>Susumu Kato</PERSON>,
senior economist at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp</ORGANIZATION>. But he said
he doesn't expect any immediate policy change by the <ORGANIZATION>Fed</ORGANIZATION>.
   "To stabilize foreign exchange, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> doesn't want to have
to raise interest rates but instead wants other countries to
lower their interest rates," says <PERSON>Takashi Tsuchiya</PERSON>, economist
at <ORGANIZATION>Tokai Bank</ORGANIZATION>. "But the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> probably won't lower interest
rates, and <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> probably won't either. If this
happens, then the yen will weaken further."
   <PERSON>Mr. Kato</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> says it is likely that the yen
will be traded around 155 to the dollar even after the <ORGANIZATION>G-7</ORGANIZATION>
meeting. The dollar was trading in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at around <MONEY>157.45
yen</MONEY> <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, down from <MONEY>158.95 yen</MONEY> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> late
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   However, the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> stock market's prolonged decline and
the slowing of the economy may make <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> even more
wary of acting suddenly and severely than in the past, some
analysts say.
   Any tightening is likely to be gradual and well advertised
to avoid spooking the Japanese financial markets further, the
analysts contend. "It is very difficult to expect any
monetary policy change given the very fragile financial
markets," says <PERSON>Mr. Kato</PERSON>.
   "The <ORGANIZATION>BOJ</ORGANIZATION> is going to be fairly reluctant and the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry
of Finance</ORGANIZATION> will be out-and-out against" boosting the discount
rate again, says <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UBS</ORGANIZATION>. So "it is likely to be
fairly well sign-posted."
   Yet market participants contend that, by delaying a boost
in <DATE>March</DATE>, the ministry's reluctance prevented any impact on
the dollar's upward momentum and further eroded <ORGANIZATION>Bank of
Japan</ORGANIZATION>'s credibility. With Japanese interest rates starting to
attract the interest of investors in the yen, their
confidence that <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> has the freedom to do what is
needed to defend the currency and fight inflation is more
crucial than ever.
   <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION> has to make definite moves that reassure
investors, says <PERSON>Mr. Pike</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>UBS</ORGANIZATION>. But if the central bank does
want to take the public step of raising the discount rate
again, he says, "we will get the usual bickering" with the
<ORGANIZATION>Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION>.
   Expecting a boost of 0.75 to one percentage point in <DATE>June</DATE>
or <DATE>July</DATE>, <PERSON>Takahide Furuhashi</PERSON>, head of research at <ORGANIZATION>DB Capital
Markets Asia Ltd.</ORGANIZATION>, says the way it is carried out will
determine its impact. "If they are forced to raise the <ORGANIZATION>ODR</ORGANIZATION>
hike like the one we had before, it will have no effect at
all," <PERSON>Mr. Furuhashi</PERSON> says.

AS SPACE STATION PREPARES TO GO UP, FEARS GROW ABOUT IT COMING DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
NASA: THE AGENCY SAYS FAILURE IS 'HIGHLY UNLIKELY.' BUT ENGINEERS ARE STUDYING 
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 'UNPLANNED RE-ENTRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When things go <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s way, what goes up doesn't necessarily come back down. 
</P>
<P>
With scores of satellites uneventfully orbiting Earth, the space agency's track 
record is hard to assail. Yet when things go wrong, the failures can be 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
During the 77-ton <ORGANIZATION>Skylab</ORGANIZATION>'s fiery plunge in <DATE>1979</DATE>, there was massive 
hand-wringing around the world. Luckily, the debris fell harmlessly into the 
<LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>'s outback. 
</P>
<P>
But what if something three times the size of Skylab -- or roughly the size of 
the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Capitol building -- were to experience, in <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s words, an 
"accidental inadvertent re-entry"? 
</P>
<P>
That the much-touted space station, scheduled to be completed within 10 years, 
could fall from the sky, damaging property and taking lives, has largely been 
obscured by the public fascination with its futuristic design and unquestioned 
central role in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Now two recent reports have served to spotlight that scenario, one that <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> 
says is utterly remote. 
</P>
<P>
But one prominent space scientist says that simple arithmetic -- based on 
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s own numbers -- shows that there is a strong likelihood, not just a 
possibility, that the 500-foot, 290-ton space station could run out of the fuel 
it needs to maintain orbit, thus falling back to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>, in a recently released draft environmental impact statement on the space 
station, said specifically that the chances of the facility ever falling are 
"highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
It nevertheless candidly acknowledged that there could be two types of 
"unplanned re-entries" -- controlled and uncontrolled. 
</P>
<P>
In a controlled re-entry, <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said, the space station could be steered on a 
course of descent that would minimize any "resulting footprint" -- in other 
words, away from population centers. 
</P>
<P>
But an out-of-control space station "could produce a debris footprint at a 
random location," <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> conceded. Its environmental impact statement left the 
rest to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The <MONEY>$30-billion</MONEY> project is considered the steppingstone to the exploration of 
the moon, <PERSON>Mars</PERSON>, the rest of the solar system and beyond. Its construction, not 
yet under way, is expected to take about five years. It will be <DATE>1995</DATE> at the 
earliest before the first components are launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom -- the largest spacecraft ever assembled -- is being designed to 
spend no less than 30 years in orbit 150 to 270 miles above <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> at 18,000 
m.p.h., circumnavigating it every 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the current designs are to be thoroughly re-examined because of emerging 
concerns among some <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineers, expressed in a recent interim report, that 
the space station's intricate components may require extensive repair and 
maintenance in outer space long before astronauts have it fully assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers said the space station could be only <PERCENT>60%</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>70%</PERCENT> complete before 
space-walking astronauts may have to turn from assembling it to performing 
inspections, maintenance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"With any long, strung-out process of assembly, you're running a risk of 
components breaking down," said <PERSON>Charles R. Price</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> engineer the <ORGANIZATION>Johnson 
Space Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult problems is to establish failure rate of components; 
that's predicting the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The potential flaws, involving solar power panels, various electronic devices 
and assorted structural components, also could require astronauts to spend 
dangerously large amounts of time working outside the space station, thus 
exposing themselves to excessive radiation and debris. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s environmental impact statement identified several possible causes for 
the space station or some of its components to plunge to <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>: 
</P>
<P>
* Failure of multiple and major on-board systems. 
</P>
<P>
* Collision with natural debris or with the space shuttle, which will ferry 
construction materials, astronauts and propellant fuel to the station. 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of sufficient propellant to stay in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Each scenario is "highly unlikely," <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from any structural damage or mechanical failures, the most likely 
cause of a space station plunge would be that it will run out of propellant, 
causing it to fall out of orbit, said <PERSON>John Pike</PERSON>, associate director for space 
policy at the <ORGANIZATION>Washington-based Federation of American Scientists</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The space station is supposed to have sufficient fuel to maintain orbit for 180 
days, although current plans call for refueling every 73 days or so. 
</P>
<P>
But given such a large number of shuttle flights during the 30-year lifespan of 
the space station, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> reasoned, another catastrophe like the <DATE>1986</DATE> Challenger 
explosion is inevitable -- a calculation based on <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION>'s own odds of such a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Another Challenger-like disaster, in turn, would lead to a prolonged grounding 
of all shuttles, thus making the refueling of the space station impossible, 
<PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said. He noted that on each of four occasions when the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or 
the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> lost astronauts, manned spacecraft were grounded for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Challenger tragedy, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> to 
assess the odds of a recurrence, and the space agency came up with a worst-case 
scenario of one explosion in every 78 launches and a best-case scenario of one 
in 200. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those projections, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said, "that would put it (the next accident) 
in the early next century." 
</P>
<P>
It would take 28 shuttle flights just to lift into orbit all the components of 
the space station. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple math is going to tell you that -- rather than extremely unlikely, as 
they describe it -- one would be surprisingly lucky if it didn't happen," <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> 
said.

<P>
An ambitious plan to build a mini-city on the old <ORGANIZATION>Pike Amusement Park</ORGANIZATION> site 
picked up another important approval this week with the ease of a 
roller-coaster car sliding downhill. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> noted concerns about traffic congestion associated with the 
<MONEY>$1-billion</MONEY> development, expressed confidence that gridlock could be avoided and 
unanimously approved local coastal plan changes so the huge project can move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acted with enthusiasm, heaping praise on a development that is 
bigger and denser than anything ever built in this city of historically 
suburban sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Their comments were glowing as they approved changes that would more the double 
the site's maximum density and allow buildings up to 600 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a golden opportunity for this city," <PERSON>Councilwoman Jan C. Hall</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ol' days are about to come back," <PERSON>Councilman Les Robbins</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted," <PERSON>Councilman Clarence Smith</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor <PERSON>Ernie E. Kell</PERSON> said the project is exciting; Councilman <PERSON>Evan Anderson 
Braude</PERSON> called the development a big boost for downtown, and Councilman <PERSON>Jeffrey 
A. Kellogg</PERSON> repeated several times that he is very proud to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-building project of offices, residences, hotels and shops -- one of the 
largest urban coastal developments in the country -- still has several hurdles 
to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Plans must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION>California Coastal Commission</ORGANIZATION>. Then the city must 
approve a master site plan that spells out details of the development, which is 
be to built over 13 years, beginning in <DATE>1990</DATE>, on acreage near the <LOCATION>Hyatt Regency</LOCATION> 
hotel and the <ORGANIZATION>Long Beach Convention Center</ORGANIZATION>, bounded by <ORGANIZATION>Shoreline Drive</ORGANIZATION>, Seaside 
Way, <LOCATION>Pine Avenue</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Queens Way</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13-Acre Development 
</P>
<P>
While mentioning the possibility of traffic jams associated with the 13-acre 
development, the council seemed assured that city planners and developers would 
devise ways to handle the cars traveling to and from the seaside complex, which 
is expected to employ 8,000 people and generate 27,500 to 36,000 car trips a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Wayne Ratkovich</PERSON> -- whose <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> company is developing the site in 
conjunction with a <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> subsidiary of a company owned by developer <PERSON>James 
W. Rouse</PERSON>, who is known nationally for his shoreline developments -- said the 
project's traffic studies indicate that of 12 surrounding intersections, two 
would be pushed to unacceptable levels of congestion by the project. 
</P>
<P>
And those two, Alamitos Avenue and <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> and Alamitos and 7th Street, 
are already backed up at peak commuting hours, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ratkovich</PERSON> also emphasized that the nature of the mixed-use project would cut 
down on car use, because people could walk from hotels and residences to shops 
and offices. 
</P>
<P>
"For <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>, it is bold and unprecedented," <PERSON>Ratkovich</PERSON> said. "But 
it is a necessary step away from dependency on the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director <PERSON>Robert Paternoster</PERSON> pointed out that the developers would 
be required to make traffic improvements, including installing traffic signals, 
upgrading intersections, extending some streets on the site, installing bus 
shelters and drawing up plans to encourage car-pooling and use of mass transit 
by office workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Firm Hired 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers have agreed to whatever transportation-related development 
fees are imposed by the city when the transportation section of the General 
Plan is finished. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, <PERSON>Paternoster</PERSON> said, city planners have hired a private 
consulting firm to design a computer model that will allow the city to simulate 
traffic problems associated with <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> and 11 other downtown developments that 
are under way or have been approved. The model will be used to find ways of 
routing the traffic to avoid traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for several organizations that had previously complained to the 
<ORGANIZATION>Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> about future traffic nightmares downtown repeated their 
concerns to the <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the Pike project, city officials should have a much better 
idea of how they are going to handle the thousands of extra cars that the 
complex will draw, argued <PERSON>Marc Coleman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> Area Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Support Density 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to forecast there may be a solution in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Robert Lamond</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION> also said that while 
the project is in many ways admirable, his group cannot support the increased 
height and density limits, which would spawn a development that would 
contribute to air pollution and traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Others criticized the project for not including housing for low- or 
moderate-income residents. In response, the developers said they want to design 
the 1,000 planned residences for a range of incomes. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that, of the <MONEY>$13 million</MONEY> a year the fully completed project is 
expected to generate in sales-tax revenue to the city, <MONEY>$1.8 million</MONEY> a year will 
be set aside for low-cost housing.

   The state <ORGANIZATION>Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> today voted
to take control of the finances of the debt-ridden <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION>
school system, citing widespread nepotism in <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>'s
third-largest district.
   The action means that the 15,250-student school system cannot
make purchases or hire anyone without written approval from state
school Superintendent <PERSON>John Brock</PERSON>.
   The board acted after receiving a consultants' report detailing
dozens of management problems within the state's easternmost
county, a coal-mining area with 87,000 residents.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in <LOCATION>Pike County</LOCATION> at the present time,'' <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> said.
   The requirement that <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> approve all personnel actions will
relieve the five-member local board of political pressure to hire
friends and relatives of influential county residents, the state
superintendent said.
   Increased layoffs in the coal industry, the consultants said,
had resulted in greater pressure on local board members to hire
more people in the schools.
   In some schools, two-thirds to three-quarters of employees are
related by blood or marriage.
   The consultants' report said the district would begin a third
straight school year with a deficit budget. The district's debt,
which was about <MONEY>$2,000,000</MONEY>, is now about <MONEY>$500,000</MONEY>.
   The report said the district needs to control spending, close
several schools, reduce non-teaching staff and make an effort to
collect delinquent taxes.
   In <DATE>May</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>New Jersey</ORGANIZATION> education commissioner announced the
state intends to take over <LOCATION>Jersey City</LOCATION>'s 32,000-student district,
under fire for a high dropout rate, political hiring and firing and
questionable finances.
   Besides <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New
Mexico</LOCATION> have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school
districts.
   Laws in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> let the state eliminate deficient
districts. An <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> law allows the state to revoke a troubled
district's charter. Georgia officials may impose heavy financial
penalties on such districts.

<HEAD>Treaty Questions Raised by Planned Anti-Missile Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics say a planned Star Wars test in the
<LOCATION>South Pacific</LOCATION> comes close to violating a <DATE>1972</DATE> treaty outlawing
major missile defenses.
   Near the middle of the month, a <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 767 equipped with a 3-ton
infrared sensor will make its first attempt to track a mock warhead
on an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from <ORGANIZATION>Vandenberg Air
Force Base</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   The plane is scheduled to depart <ORGANIZATION>Boeing Field</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> on
<DATE>Monday</DATE> for a two-day trip to <ORGANIZATION>Kwajalein Atoll</ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> missile test
range in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   Anti-ballistic missile radar is prohibited by the <DATE>1972</DATE> ABM
Treaty between the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>John Pike</PERSON>, head of space policy at the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of American
Scientists</ORGANIZATION> and a Star Wars critic, said the aircraft ``appears to
be the functional equivalent of an ABM radar.''
   Pike said the Soviets may be justified in questioning whether
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation.
   ``If we saw the Russians doing this kind of thing, we would be
pretty bent out of shape about it, and if the Russians were giving
the explanation we are, we wouldn't believe them,'' <PERSON>Pike</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an

not substitute for an ABM radar because of technical limitations in
its infrared sensor and its on-board computers.

PIKE PROJECT BRINGS WORRY ABOUT FUTURE TRAFFIC WOES 
</P>

<P>
As officials eagerly embrace a massive proposal to turn the old Pike Amusement 
Park site into the biggest single development ever built in this city, 
questions are emerging about the dramatic traffic increases that will accompany 
<PERSON>Pike</PERSON> and other planned downtown projects. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about future traffic woes proved the major reservation when the 
<ORGANIZATION>Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> recently gave an impressively credentialed development team 
one of several key approvals needed to erect a mini-city by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most heated criticism cast on a development that has attracted 
profuse praise, a member of a citywide citizens' group warned planning 
commissioners last month that they were propelling the city into a traffic 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Problems Unclear 
</P>
<P>
"As things currently stand, the foreseeable impact of traffic over the next 10 
years in the downtown area is gridlock," contended <PERSON>Marc Coleman</PERSON> of Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved. "I firmly believe that when the citizens of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> 
understand the blank check that is being given to the Pike project through the 
lack of effective planning, a widespread outcry will develop." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic officials concede downtown developments are being built before 
the city fully knows what new traffic problems they will breed or how to solve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a good handle on the ultimate consequences of all the 
development that has been approved or is in the approval process," <PERSON>Richard 
Backus</PERSON>, the city traffic engineer, noted. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that their blueprints for turning <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>'s sleepy 
downtown into a bustling urban center will bring thousands of additional cars 
to local streets, city officials say they are studying ways of coping with the 
traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a problem, there will be a crisis if we don't do something about 
it now," acknowledged <PERSON>Robert Paternoster</PERSON>, the city's planning and building 
director, who said the city is by no means ignoring the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of escalating traffic, the city has hired a consulting firm to 
design a computer model to predict traffic tie-ups associated with new 
development throughout the city and to indicate ways of averting them. City 
planners are also requiring the Pike developers to devise programs encouraging 
car-pooling and use of mass transit by the 8,000 employees eventually expected 
to work in the project's office buildings, shops and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's <ORGANIZATION>Densest Development 
</P>
<P>
Designed</ORGANIZATION> as the densest development in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, the 13-acre Pike complex of 
mid- and high-rises is characterized by large dimensions. More than 3 million 
square feet of office, residential and commercial space would be constructed in 
11 buildings lining the shore on what is now a largely empty expanse of asphalt 
south of <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be built over a 13-year period, represents <PERCENT>22%</PERCENT> of the total 
office space planned for downtown, <PERCENT>19%</PERCENT> of the hotel space, <PERCENT>8%</PERCENT> of the 
residential space and <PERCENT>16%</PERCENT> of the retail space. A quarter of downtown's ultimate 
work force would be employed there. 
</P>
<P>
Three garages would contain nearly 6,000 parking spaces. Drivers traveling to 
and from the Pike complex could make as many as 36,000 car trips a day, 
according to the proposal's environmental impact report, which predicted 
significant increases in auto-related air pollution and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the <ORGANIZATION>Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> by a 6-1 vote on <DATE>March 30</DATE> approved zoning 
and local coastal plan changes that more than double the site's allowable 
density and increase the maximum building height by nearly 200 feet, to 600 
feet. Only Commissioner <PERSON>Elbert Segelhorst</PERSON> voted against the proposal, 
explaining that he liked the project but could not approve it before traffic 
concerns were dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
The <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION>Coastal Commission</ORGANIZATION> must still review the 
proposal, a venture of the <ORGANIZATION>Ratkovich Co. of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Enterprise 
Development West</ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of a company established by <PERSON>James Rouse</PERSON>, who is 
known for developing <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, and popular waterfront complexes in 
<LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Bruce Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Pike</PERSON>'s project manager, said the environmental report's estimate of 
36,000 car trips a day "is truly a worse case analysis . . . and it is a scary 
number." The estimate exaggerates the amount of traffic that will likely be 
generated by the new community, he said, adding that his planners are trying to 
come up with a more realistic figure. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said, such a naked statistic ignores the economic and social 
benefits of creating a new urban hub in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
City traffic engineers say a more probable traffic figure for the Pike 
development is 27,500 car trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the <LOCATION>Pike</LOCATION> traffic count, it is only a part of downtown's long-term 
traffic picture. Another 11 developments have been approved or are under way in 
the downtown area, including the World Trade Center, Landmark Square and the 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell Douglas</ORGANIZATION> office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1986</DATE>, the city's Strategic Plan for the year <DATE>2000</DATE> predicted that if all the 
development plans for the port, downtown and the airport come to fruition, 
traffic leading to those areas would more than double. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what the solutions are," said Planning Commissioner <PERSON>Patricia 
Schauer</PERSON>, who prefaced her vote for the Pike project with complaints that the 
city should have had a transportation plan in place before moving ahead with 
such a massive development scheme. "I don't even know if there are solutions 
that are economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush-Hour Bottlenecks 
</P>
<P>
Even now, <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON>, of Citizens Involved, said, there are rush-hour bottlenecks 
leading to downtown, such as at the intersection of <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> and 
<LOCATION>Alamitos Avenue</LOCATION>, "where I can state from personal observation, that many 
mornings, traffic is backed up . . . for eight-tenths of a mile all the way to 
Cherry Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The city's <DATE>2000</DATE> plan noted several other congested areas in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, a 
number of them along <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast Highway</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Paternoster, who said he has long advocated a traffic study but could not halt 
development until one is in place, said the computer traffic report should be 
completed in the <DATE>fall</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city gets a clearer idea of <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>'s emerging traffic scenario, 
<PERSON>Backus</PERSON> said, the door is being left open to require developers to adopt traffic 
control measures once the full impact of their projects is gauged. 
</P>
<P>
While the light-rail system under construction between <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Long 
Beach</LOCATION> will take autos off <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION> streets, <PERSON>Backus</PERSON> said, it probably will not 
improve the overall traffic situation in the city because the street-level rail 
line will slow the flow of cars. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-congestion measures thus far asked of the Pike developers -- 
subsidized mass transit passes, ride-sharing programs and the like -- are 
"nothing real innovative," Backus acknowledged, but, he said, such practices 
are not yet in widespread use in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will also be required to install traffic signals and add turn 
lanes on some streets adjacent to the project, which will stretch from <LOCATION>Pine 
Avenue</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Queensway Bridge</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Hart mentioned other possibilities as well, such as establishing remote parking 
lots from which downtown employees could be shuttled, and starting some sort of 
a shuttle system along <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Hart dismissed complaints that the city has been too slow to plan for the 
anticipated jumps in traffic volume. But the <ORGANIZATION>Pike</ORGANIZATION> team several months ago 
joined other developers in launching their own study of how best to transport 
workers and visitors along <ORGANIZATION>Ocean Boulevard</ORGANIZATION> and across the bay to the <ORGANIZATION>Queen 
Mary</ORGANIZATION>, near which the <ORGANIZATION>Disney Co.</ORGANIZATION> is considering developing a major resort hotel. 
The developers have even talked of building a privately financed monorail.
