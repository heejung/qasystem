   Brother fought brother and the North won
again <DATE>Sunday</DATE> as more than 8,000 uniformed men re-enacted the final
charge of the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> to commemorate its 125th
anniversary.
   <PERSON>Griff King</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>2nd Virginia Regiment</ORGANIZATION> planned to participate
in <LOCATION>Pickett</LOCATION>'s charge against a line of Union troops, where his
brother would defend a ridge with the <ORGANIZATION>93rd Pennsylvania Regiment</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We don't agree on anything anyway,'' said <PERSON>King</PERSON>, a 35-year-old
machine operator from <LOCATION>Weston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va</LOCATION>.
   About 12,500 mock soldiers and civilians in period garb took
part in the three-day re-enactment billed as the largest ever,
organizers said.
   Some 140,000 people witnessed the event over three days,
according to organizers with <ORGANIZATION>Napoleonic Tactics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which staged
the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the actual
battlefield.
   Following a series of cannon blasts by both sides, a 200-yard
line of Confederate troops gave a rebel yell and marched
shoulder-to-shoulder up to a wall defended by <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> troops.
   Troops for the <ORGANIZATION>North and South</ORGANIZATION> traded volley after volley in an
engagement staged at one-third its original scale.
   ``It was a great battle,'' said <PERSON>John McQueen</PERSON>, a 37-year-old
marketing manager from <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> who repeatedly fired for the <ORGANIZATION>52nd
Ohio Regiment</ORGANIZATION> as soldiers for both sides fell around him.
   ``The rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldn't touch
them,'' he said.
   Confederate troops fell back after an hour of fighting in the
re-enactment.
   The event ended with soldiers standing in silence for an
invocation to those who died in the actual battle. A bugler played
taps while 75 cannons fired one after another.
   As more than 60,000 people massed along a hillside <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to
witness the mock charge, a woman stood in <DATE>19th-century</DATE> black
mourning dress to remind them of the consequences of war.
   ``Mourning is appropriate for battle because men die ... women
had to carry on,'' said <PERSON>Lanie Alligood</PERSON>, whose beau ``died'' during
fighting <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Ms. Alligood</PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION>, said she traveled with a group of
about 15 women from <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, most of whom dressed in black.
   The Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> occurred <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>. Some 50,000
Union and Confederate troops were killed or wounded over the course
of the battle.
   Major Gen. <PERSON>George E. Pickett</PERSON>'s unsuccessful charge with more
than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the
<ORGANIZATION>Confederate</ORGANIZATION>'s final offensive push of the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   ``If the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> was the turning point of the Civil
War, then <PERSON>Pickett</PERSON>'s charge was the turning point of the Battle of
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Kim Holien</PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army
Center of Military History</ORGANIZATION>.
   King said he decided to join the Confederate army because he
believes in states' rights over the encroachment by the federal
government, a battle he said continues.
   ``The battlefield is the courtroom now,'' said <PERSON>King</PERSON>, as he
packed up his tent before the final charge.

   Americans will gather to remember the
greatest battle of the Civil War, where thousands of men in blue
and gray ``gave the last full measure of devotion'' 125 years ago
this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   A 4{-month commemoration of the 125th anniversary of the Battle
of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> begins <DATE>Monday</DATE> with a Memorial Day parade and a
ceremony in the national cemetery.
   Gen. <PERSON>William Westmoreland</PERSON>, who commanded <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>,
will speak at the cemetery services following the parade.
   Other highlights of the anniversary include a re-enactment of
key clashes in the three-day battle, set for <DATE>June 24-26</DATE>; a <DATE>July 2</DATE>
exchange of battle flags by governors of some states that
participated in the fighting; relighting of the <ORGANIZATION>Eternal Peace Light
Memorial</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>July 3</DATE>; and re-creation of President <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'s
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> Address on the 125th anniversary of the speech, <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE>.
   <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> officials expect the events will draw
record-breaking crowds to the south-central <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>
battlefield, now a national park, where Union troops forced the
<ORGANIZATION>Confederate Army</ORGANIZATION> to retreat from northern soil after three days of
bitter, bloody fighting <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>.
   Many historians view the battle as the decisive event in the
war. In all, nearly 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed
or wounded after Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> invaded the North.
   After clashing with <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chambersburg</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s troops met Union forces under Gen. <PERSON>George G. Meade</PERSON> west of
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 1</DATE>. The climax of the battle came <DATE>July 3</DATE> when Lee
ordered Gen. <PERSON>George E. Pickett</PERSON>'s division forward. ``<PERSON>Pickett</PERSON>'s
Charge'' proved to be a disaster, and Lee withdrew.
   That <DATE>November</DATE>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> made his celebrated speech when he came
to <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> to help dedicate the cemetery there.
   ``Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought fourth on
this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition tha all men are created equal,'' <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> said.
   He called on his listeners to rededicate themselves to the cause
for which the soldiers gave their lives _ ``the last full measure
of devotion'' _ so that ``government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.''
   In an average year, 1.4 million visitors tour the battlefield.
This year, officials say, 2 million or more could come to town.
   ``It's going to be a little problem, but we've handled this
before,'' said Mayor <PERSON>Frank Linn</PERSON>.
   During the re-enactment, thousands of Civil War buffs will
participate in a scaled-down version of the fighting at a farm
outside of town. Park <ORGANIZATION>Service</ORGANIZATION> rules prohibit a re-enactment on the
actual battlefield.
   The peace light memorial that is to be rededicated <DATE>July 3</DATE> was
dedicated in <DATE>1938</DATE> by President <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>. Members of the
anniversary commission hope to relight a natural-gas flame that
burned at the monument until <DATE>1975</DATE>, when rising oil prices prompted
federal officials to convert the flame to an electric light. Money
from private donors was raised to pay for the fuel and to repair
the gas lines.
   Astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> is scheduled to speak at the relighting
ceremony. President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has also been invited, but has not yet
said if he will attend.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Chief Justice <PERSON>William Rehnquist</PERSON> is scheduled to be keynote
speaker at the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> Address re-enactment in <DATE>November</DATE>. A man
dressed as <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> will re-create the actual speech.

   After three days of wool uniforms and no
showers, thousands of men helping reenact the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>
have forsaken the life of a Civil War soldier to the <DATE>20th century</DATE>.
   ``I'd like to stay longer, but you have to make a living,'' said
<PERSON>Griff King</PERSON>, a 35-year-old machine operator from <LOCATION>Weston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va.</LOCATION> and a
member of the <ORGANIZATION>2nd Virginia Regiment</ORGANIZATION>.
   More than 8,000 uniformed men concluded a commemoration of the
battle's 125th anniversary <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by staging the final charge of
the war's bloodiest confrontation.
   Organizers billed the event as the largest Civil War reenactment
ever.
   Some 140,000 people witnessed the reenectment over three days,
said <PERSON>Paul Baebler</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Napoleonic Tactics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which
staged the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the
actual battlefield.
   After the last shots were fired, participants from <LOCATION>North and
South</LOCATION> stood in silence as a bugler played taps and cannons fired
one after another in a 21-gun salute to honor those who died in the
actual battle.
   Close to 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed or
wounded at the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>, when the
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> of the Potomac turned back the <ORGANIZATION>Army of Northern Virginia</ORGANIZATION>'s
attempt to invade the North.
   A series of cannon blasts by both sides opened the fighting
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Then Confederates gave out a rebel yell and marched
shoulder-to-shoulder 200 yards across and several men deep across a
field and up a ridge, where Union troops waited.
   Major Gen. <PERSON>George E. Pickett</PERSON>'s unsuccessful charge with more
than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the
<ORGANIZATION>Confederate</ORGANIZATION>'s final offensive push at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.

   ``The rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldn't touch
them,'' he said.
   Confederate troops fell back after an hour of battle.
   Five ersatz troops required hospitalization for injuries
suffered during the three days of soldiering, said <PERSON>Dr. Bill
Steinour</PERSON>, director of the emergency room at <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   He said there were two serious leg injuries, a skull fracture, a
man suffering chest pain and another with a kidney stone ailment.
   ``All in all, we were lucky,'' <PERSON>Steinour</PERSON> said.
   The weather, too, held for the event. It was hot and dry all
three days.
   ``Mother Nature and God were looking out for us,'' <PERSON>Ms. Niero</PERSON>
said.

   Amid shouts of ``Fire!'' and the thunder
of cannon, thousands of men in blue and gray stormed each other to
re-enact the opening of the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, 125 years after
the Civil War's bloodiest confrontation.
   A total of about 8,000 men representing <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and Confederate
troops traded mock rifle volleys and cannon bursts <DATE>Friday</DATE>, ripping
open paper gunpowder cartridges with their teeth while enemy lines
closed in.
   The Confederate troops pushed back the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>'s black-hatted
``Iron Brigade,'' as scores of men on both sides feigned death in
the tall grass and spectators watched from a hill overlooking the
field.
   ``When it gets to firing, you're not in <DATE>1988</DATE> anymore, you're in
<DATE>1863</DATE>,'' said <PERSON>Jeff Douthit</PERSON>, a 28-year-old farmer from <LOCATION>Unionville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
   The participants, among them teachers, engineers, artists and
soldiers, had invested <MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> to outfit themselves with the
uniform, gear and guns needed to become Civil War soldiers, if only
for a day or two.
   Soldiers in the <ORGANIZATION>23rd New York Regiment</ORGANIZATION>, played by a group from
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, went so far as to follow Union recipes down to ``hard
tack,'' hard, flat squares of bread.
   ``You might think it was made 125 years ago. It's that
indigestable,'' said <PERSON>Ed Gouvier</PERSON>, a 37-year-old engineer from
<LOCATION>Phoenix</LOCATION>.
   Mentioning anything modern by members of the 23rd <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
resulted in punishment: standing on a wooden crate at the end of
one of the rows of white, canvas tents.
   Gouvier said people joined the outfit for a chance to relive
history, for the camaraderie, or to take part in the battles.
   ``I've always been a history fanatic,'' he said.
   Others had more personal reasons for joining one of the ersatz
armies.
   <PERSON>Steve DiCarlo</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Owings</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, said he became a member of the
<ORGANIZATION>18th Virginia Regiment</ORGANIZATION> in part because his
great-great-great-grandfather was a captain in the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate Army</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``My wife thinks I'm crazy,'' he said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Napoleonic Tactics Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which sold tickets to cover its
<MONEY>$450,000</MONEY> budget for staging three days of ersatz warfare, has
billed the event as the largest Civil War re-enactment ever. The
consulting company was hired by the event's sponor, the <ORGANIZATION>American
Civil War Commemorative Committee Inc</ORGANIZATION>.
   A total of 75,000 spectators were expected to attend the
re-enactment on farmland five miles south of the actual
battlefield. The event ends <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with the restaging of <ORGANIZATION>Pickett</ORGANIZATION>'s
Charge.
   The Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> took place from <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>, and
resulted in a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded.
   Confederate Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> was moving from the north toward
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> to get shoes for his troops and secure the roads running
through the southern <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> town, said <PERSON>Kim Bernard Holien</PERSON>, a
historian for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Center of Military History</ORGANIZATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION> was moving north when the chance
encounter at <ORGANIZATION>McPherson's Ridge</ORGANIZATION> touched off the bloody battle, he
said.
   Many of the current ``soldiers'' said they prepared for the
battle for months because its size set it apart.
   Tactical commanders for both sides met <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to map out
the next day's skirmish.
   ``Supposedly everything's supposed to happen according to the
script,'' said <PERSON>Paul Baebler</PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Napoleonic Tactics</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The people who won the first time will win again.'' he said.
   Organizers had said the number of troops falling ``dead'' in
<DATE>Friday</DATE>'s skirmish would be proportionate to actual losses.
   But <PERSON>Michael Kraus</PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> forces, said troops
often improvise on the field.
   ``It's an individual thing,'' said <PERSON>Kraus</PERSON>, a 34-year-old artist
from <LOCATION>Creston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>.
   The largest previous Civil War re-enactment was the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of
First Manassas</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July 1986</DATE>, involving 6,000 re-enactors, according
to <ORGANIZATION>Napoleonic Tactics</ORGANIZATION>.

   ``<DATE>Wednesday 3 June 1863</DATE>.
   ``Cloudy weather dominated the skies along the <LOCATION>Rappahannock
River</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. It rained somewhat in the morning.''
   It was on that day that the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> campaign of the Civil War
began with the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate Army of Northern Virginia</ORGANIZATION> starting its
march toward <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, as Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> ``commenced to
draw the army from the vicinity of <LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>.'' Lee realized
some of his army's deficiencies, yet wrote to his wife: ``I trust
that a kind <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> will watch over us, and notwithstanding our
weakness and sins will yet give us a name and place among the
nations of the earth.''
   The excerpts are from a <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> daybook of the
campaign, part of the national commemoration of the 125th
anniversary of the key battle at the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National
Military Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   The commemoration begins Memorial Day, <DATE>May 30</DATE>. A ``Living
History Encampment'' starts <DATE>June 18</DATE> on a farm outside <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>,
when more than 1,000 re-enactors will organize an encampment and
simulate the battle, firing blanks from original and
authentic-looking Civil War guns and cannons.
   It will culminate in three days in <DATE>July</DATE> with a re-creation of
the conflict that became the ``high water mark of the
Confederacy.'' On <DATE>July 1, 1863</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate Army of Northern
Virgina</ORGANIZATION> pushed the <ORGANIZATION>Union Army</ORGANIZATION> of the Potomac from its positions
north and west of the town to its final defense line, to sites like
Little Round Top, <ORGANIZATION>Cemetery Hill</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Devil</ORGANIZATION>'s Den, <PERSON>Culp</PERSON>'s Hill,
<PERSON>Spangler</PERSON>'s <DATE>Spring</DATE>.
   Col. <PERSON>George Pickett</PERSON>'s charge, a frontal assault on <DATE>July 3</DATE>, sent
12,000 Confederate soldiers toward the Union line. Less than 4,000
returned. On <DATE>July 4</DATE>, <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s army withdrew, never to return to the
North.
   Some 160,000 soldiers took part in that battle 125 years ago;
there were some 50,000 casualties.
   A few months later, a national cemetery was dedicated at the
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> battlefield. President <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> gave a brief speech.
   On <DATE>Nov. 19 this year</DATE>, the now-famous <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION> will be
re-enacted with an actor portraying Lincoln leading the procession

   Amid flashing sabers and swirling dust,
about 380 men on horseback staged a Civil War cavalry skirmish
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> as part of a three-day reenactment of the Battle of
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> on its 125th anniversary.
   It was the largest Civil War cavalry reenactment ever staged,
said <PERSON>Kim Holien</PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Center of Military
History</ORGANIZATION>. Previously, no more than 100 horses took part in a mock
engagement, he said.
   ``Cavalry outfits don't get a chance to show their stuff very
often,'' said <PERSON>Nancy Niero</PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION>Napoleonic Tactics
Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, which organized the event on 700 acres of farmland five miles
south of the actual battlefield.
   ``All you see is soldiers and dust and sabres,'' said <PERSON>Steve
Hopkins</PERSON>, a 27-year-old copy machine technician from <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>,
who took part in the action.
   Hopkins rode with the 1st Platoon of the <ORGANIZATION>7th Illinois Cavalry</ORGANIZATION>, a
unit he said played Afghani freedom fighters in <PERSON>Sylvester
Stallone</PERSON>'s ``Rambo III.''
   Close to 9,000 men in uniform and more than 75,000 spectators
were expected for the three days of reenactments ending <DATE>Sunday</DATE> with
a restaging of <ORGANIZATION>Pickett</ORGANIZATION>'s charge.
   Cannons boomed, bugles sounded and pistols crackled as horses
charged and withdrew several times in <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s portrayal of a
cavalry skirmish on the third day of the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   At one point, a Confederate soldier grabbed the Union flag and
headed back toward his line. He was chased by several ``blue
coats,'' who retrieved the standard.
   ``When you go up and grab somebody else's flag, you're asking
for trouble. Some of the people get their adrenaline going a little
too high and are a little too eager to get into hand-to-hand
combat,'' said <PERSON>Holien</PERSON>, who announced the action for a local radio
station.
   One Confederate ``soldier'' who didn't give his name said men in
<LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> uniforms were a little rough with their sabers.
   At least two riders required hospitalization after falling from
their mounts during the fray, authorities said.
   One suffered a fractured skull and another had a leg injury,
said <PERSON>Roseann McGlade</PERSON>, nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.
   She said the hospital treated about 24 other reenactors <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
<TIME>morning</TIME> with problems ranging from heat stroke to eye injuries from
the dust to stomach pains from eating genuine Civil War food.
   <PERSON>Tom McCutcheon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kennesaw</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, said the danger of riding a
horse in a battle reenactment is worth the enjoyment.
   <PERSON>McCutcheon</PERSON>, another member of the <ORGANIZATION>7th Illinois</ORGANIZATION>, said he has
served in the infantry and as an artillery unit. Neither compared
to the cavalry, he said.
   ``The exhilaration of the charge. They're the biggest crowd
pleasers. We can ride the wrong way and the crowd will applaud,''
said <PERSON>McCutcheon</PERSON>, a 42-year-old saddle maker and antique dealer.
   The Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> took place from <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>, and
cost a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded.
   On <DATE>July 3, 1863</DATE>, Confederate General <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> ordered Major
Gen. J.E.B. <PERSON>Stuart</PERSON>'s cavalry to try to break through the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>'s
line.
   Stuart came up against several <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> cavalry units including one
led by Brig. Gen. <PERSON>George A. Custer</PERSON>, three miles east of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   A total of 11,000 cavalry soldiers took part in the actual
engagement, <PERSON>Holien</PERSON> said.

   History buffs organizing re-enactments
of major Civil War battles this <DATE>summer</DATE> are running into the same
problem <PERSON>Gens</PERSON>. <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> faced 125 years
ago _ not enough <PERSON>Billy Yanks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnny Rebs</PERSON> to go around.
   ``There are so many re-enactments planned that you could stay
busy just about every weekend,'' said <PERSON>Charles Sullivan</PERSON>, a member of
``Stanford's <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Battery.''
   But the Civil War fanatics who dress up in blue or gray to camp
out and charge through fields in battlefield re-enactments have a
manpower solution that was not available in the Civil War _ fight
for both sides.
   ``Sometimes you have to hastily reorganize your loyalties if you
want to be part of something,'' said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>, who in more sedate
moments is chairman of the social studies department at <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi
Gulf Coast Junior College</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``This <DATE>summer</DATE> is an especially busy period because two of the
key battles of the Civil War _ <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> _ occurred
at virtually the same time,'' he said.
   Gettysburg activities will take place in the weeks leading up to
the 125th anniversary of the battle, which was fought <DATE>July 1-3,
1863</DATE>, while the <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> re-enactment is planned for the <DATE>July
Fourth weekend</DATE>, when that Rebel stronghold on the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION>
fell to <ORGANIZATION>Grant</ORGANIZATION>'s army.
   Last year more than 40,000 people watched as 6,000 buffs
recreated the bloody battle of <LOCATION>Shiloh</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, where
Confederate troops surprised Grant's troops on <DATE>April 6, 1862</DATE>. The
Rebels were defeated in a two-day battle.
   Thousands of re-enactors belong to groups of Civil War buffs,
but demand has been so intense that several events, including an
annual re-creation of the Battle of Champion Hill, have had to be
rescheduled.
   Champion Hill was fought on <DATE>May 16, 1863</DATE>, and paved the way to
<LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> for Union troops. It will be observed in <DATE>March this year</DATE>
because it would have conflicted with preparations for the
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> event.
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said that to deal with changing demands, many
re-enactors carry two sets of uniforms so that at a moment's notice
they can march as either a Rebel or a Yankee.
   Leyland French, operator of an antebellum tour home here, said
that by staging <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> activities immediately after those at
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, ``It may be possible for more people to make both
events.''
   ``We've talked with representives of <ORGANIZATION>41st Illinois Infantry</ORGANIZATION> who
plan a weekend encampment and we had a call this week from a
gentleman in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> who wants to bring a group,'' said <PERSON>Lenore
Barkley</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Vicksburg Convention and
Visitors' Bureau</ORGANIZATION>.
   While <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> is perhaps the best-remembered clash of the
Civil War, the fall of <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> on <DATE>July 4, 1863</DATE>, was a vital
strategic loss to the South, leaving the Confederacy almost cut in
two and giving control of the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> to the North.
   The siege began <DATE>May 18, 1863</DATE>, and ended when Confederate Gen.
<PERSON>John C. Pemberton</PERSON>, out of food and water, surrendered on <ORGANIZATION>July
Fourth</ORGANIZATION>.
   The battle, fought in trenches, enventually involved 100,000
men, some 50,000 fewer than marched into battle at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>,
where Lee's invasion of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> was turned back.
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said that despite the expense of uniforms, equipment
and the time and travel, most re-enactors were anxious to
participate in as many events as possible.
   ``We are talking about salesmen, bookkeepers, teachers, truck
drivers, doctors, and lawyers _ all united by a common love of
history,'' <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said.
   ``It's like a time machine, providing a feeling of history you
can't get any other way,'' he said.
   He said many buffs, both from <LOCATION>North and South</LOCATION>, preferred to
march as Confederates, perhaps because of the romance of the Lost
Cause.
   ``Re-enactors were used when they made the television movie
North and South, and just about everyone wanted to be a
Confederate, including most of the Yankees,'' he said. ``In the
end, they had to make our group go in as <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> troops.''

   The kickoff <DATE>Friday</DATE> of the 125th
anniversary observance of the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> thrilled <PERSON>Allen
Nelson</PERSON> for a very personal reason: His father fought in it.
   Nelson, 70, a retired career <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officer, drove in from
<LOCATION>Sanford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, for the ceremonies. He wore the uniform of a Union
colonel as he watched mock soldiers pass in review to mark the
start of the battle, which was fought here <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>.
   His father, Pvt. <PERSON>George H. Nelson</PERSON>, fought with the <ORGANIZATION>2nd Vermont
Volunteers</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> and later was wounded in the Battle of the
Wilderness in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Nelson, whose father was in his 70s when he was born, was the
only known first-generation descendant at the national park, where
what many historians view as the central battle of the Civil War
took place.
   The opening event drew only about 1,000 spectators, well below
park officials' estimates that 20,000 or more visitors would be at
the battlefield for each day of the anniversary.
   Last <DATE>weekend</DATE>, more than 100,000 visitors attended a three-day
re-enactment of the battle on private property several miles from
this <LOCATION>Adams County</LOCATION> community.
   ``I do think that a lot of people think last week was the actual
anniversary,'' said <PERSON>Bob Moore</PERSON>, the battlefield park's media
director. ``I think some people mistakenly thought that once the
events of last week were over, that that was the end of it.''
   The first day's schedule mirrored the first day of the battle.
Not much happened.
   But just as the fighting intensified on the second day and
reached its climax with the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> victory on the third, the pace of
events will pick up <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, with a symbolic exchange
of battle flags, a dedication of the newest monument at the
battlefield and a relighting of the <ORGANIZATION>Eternal Peace Light Memorial</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Obviously, <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE> are when the people are
hopefully going to be here,'' <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said.
   The last time there were overflow crowds in <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> was <DATE>1938</DATE>,
the 75th anniversary of the clash between <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and Confederate
troops. That was the last major reunion of soldiers who fought here.
   Nelson was here then with his father, who was in his mid-90s. He
remembers touring the battlefield and being able to envision what
happened.
   But he said he didn't hear much about the battle from his father
or the other veterans.
   ``He didn't talk too much about it,'' said <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON>. ``Most of the
veterans wouldn't talk too much about it. I guess they wanted to
forget.''
   Those who turned out <DATE>Friday</DATE> were quickly gripped by the
fascination of the once bloody ground, later the scene of <PERSON>Abraham
Lincoln</PERSON>'s famous <ORGANIZATION>Gettsyburg Address</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``We've come a long way to see this,'' said <PERSON>Londoner John
Funnell</PERSON>. ``It's fantastic.''
   His wife, <PERSON>Betty</PERSON>, agreed, but said she was still hoping for one
more thrill at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   ``I would like to see something like <PERSON>Rhett Butler</PERSON>,'' she said,
referring to the dashing character in ``Gone With The Wind.''

<HEAD>Access Roads: A New Battle at Gettysburg</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the battle of <ORGANIZATION>Devil</ORGANIZATION>'s Den, pitting
tourist convenience against the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>'s desire to
curtail traffic through the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> battlefield.
   The park service has proposed eliminating two access roads, as
well as part of a third, to the historic Devil's Den area of the
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> battlefield.
   The idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original
appearance and to halt an erosion problem at <ORGANIZATION>Devil</ORGANIZATION>'s Den, an area
of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot, <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>
spokesman <PERSON>Robert Davidson</PERSON> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   The debate moved here last week when Rep. <PERSON>Bill Goodling</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Pa.</LOCATION>,
presented to park service Director <PERSON>William Penn Mott</PERSON> a petition
containing signatures of more than 11,000 people who oppose the
plan.
   Mott has agreed to personally inspect the site as part of a
review of the plan, according to park service spokesman <PERSON>George
Berklacy</PERSON>.
   ``There was a road constructed in about <DATE>1904</DATE> during a period
when people were visiting on horses and buggies,'' <PERSON>Davidson</PERSON> said.
``Since then, the response to more and larger vehicles has been
more pavement, and we just feel that the time has come to take a
new direction.''
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Devil's Den Access Committee</ORGANIZATION> brought maps and a slide
show last week to document their concerns to the park service that
the plan would be counterproductive.
   <PERSON>Phil Cole</PERSON>, a battlefield guide who heads the citizen protest,
said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that he fears people would have to walk to <ORGANIZATION>Devil</ORGANIZATION>'s
Den from a planned new parking lot that may be too small to
accommodate visitors.
   The walk is three-quarters of a mile, round trip.
   ``People are not all joggers or athletic. Plus, there is
inclement weather, and hot days,'' he said.
   Traffic, he said, will be diverted to other roads that will
become more congested.
   An access road would be made available so that the disabled
could be driven to the site, the park service said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National Military Battlefield</ORGANIZATION> has been holding
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the bloody Civil War battle
on <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>. Some 50,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were
killed or wounded on the battlefield, later the scene of <PERSON>Abraham
Lincoln</PERSON>'s famous <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION>.

<LEADPARA>  GETTYSBURG is under siege, and the struggle is as much over fallow fields as
hallowed ground.;    Spurred by the widening of a nearby highway and the
opening of a Wal-Mart to call its own, this historic town is witnessing
unprecedented pressure from developers, one of whom is proposing a
320,000-square-foot shopping center that would abut the Civil War battlefield.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BATTLE CRIES HEARD AGAIN AT GETTYSBURG
DEVELOPERS WANT TO BUILD BUT PRESERVATIONISTS
RESIST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The plan has loosed volleys of displeasure not heard since the
Erector-set-like, 330-foot-tall <ORGANIZATION>National Tower</ORGANIZATION> observation platform was raised
nearly a score of years ago.;    <LOCATION>Gettysburg Borough</LOCATION> and the surrounding
townships have long been at odds over the nature and amount of development
that should be permitted, with some municipal officials contending that the
economy has suffered by attempts to keep the park setting pristine.;   
"There's an attitude toward the park here that's very negative -- even
defiant," said <PERSON>Richard H. Schmoyer</PERSON>, planning director for <ORGANIZATION>Adams County.</ORGANIZATION>;   
Proposed for a 75-acre site in adjacent Straban Township, <ORGANIZATION>Mark Development
Co.</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Gettysburg Commons</LOCATION> features 25 to 30 stores, a cinema and 1,900 parking
spaces. It also falls partly within the 12,000-acre federally protected
<ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District</ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses the 6,000-acre
<ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National Military</ORGANIZATION> Park.;    As a result, Civil War buffs and
preservationists are left wondering whether Gen. <PERSON>George Pickett</PERSON>'s charge will
be remembered as the final, bloodiest confrontation of the Civil War battle,
or thought of as a method of payment at the new department store.;    "We
cannot permit the visual desecration of one of the most hallowed sites in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>," said Rep. <PERSON>Peter Kostmayer</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Pa.</LOCATION>, co-sponsor of <DATE>1990</DATE> legislation
that significantly expanded the boundaries of the military park. "There are
plenty of places in which to build shopping centers, but allowing one to be
built within sight of the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> battlefield would be a tragic mistake."; 
  At issue is the view of the battlefield and the town from <PERSON>Benner</PERSON>'s Hill, a
crown of land that, while not a major overlook, affords a vista that hasn't
changed much in 118 years. In the fields below, <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> forces won a decisive
victory over Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s Confederates in a series of battles <DATE>July
1-4</DATE>, 1863.;    "If they build where they say," said Assistant Park
Superintendent <PERSON>Robert E. Davidson</PERSON>, "the shopping center would come into view
very dramatically.";    Keep view open;  <PERSON>Walter L. Powell</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Gettysburg
Borough</LOCATION>'s preservation officer, said: "That view is critical. It is part of
the historic view shed that should be kept as open as possible.";    Others
see the proposal differently, including county planning director <PERSON>Schmoyer</PERSON>, who
has said the shopping center "would not be the worst thing that could happen
there.";    "There is a history of discouraging growth here, and a price has
been paid for it," he said.;    In <DATE>1989</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Adams County</ORGANIZATION> ranked 59th out of
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>'s 67 counties in average annual wages, far below the other
counties in the eastern half of the state. Many service workers live in mobile
home parks surrounding the borough.;    <DATE>Three years ago</DATE>, when <PERSON>Schmoyer</PERSON>
arrived, he warned that when widening of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Route 15 near <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> was
completed, there would be massive development pressure at the four local
interchanges.;    Taken seriously now;  "Few took him seriously then,"
preservation officer <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said. "They do now.";    Now, with Route 15
serving as a major four-lane highway between <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Frederick</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>,
the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> area has become attractive as a bedroom community for those
cities, as well as <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and even <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, 90 driving minutes away.;   
<ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>, the mammoth discount chain, cited the highway and proximity to
<LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>'s market among reasons for building in Straban Township.;    Now
property owners are keen with anticipation over <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION>'s legendary drawing
power for shoppers -- and developers.;    Mother of all museums;  <PERSON>Dusan
Bratic</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Carlisle</ORGANIZATION> lawyer who owns 105 acres at a Route 15 interchange, has
proposed building a kind of mother of all war museums, honoring Americans who
have fought in conflicts beginning with World War I.;    Bratic would not
reveal other plans he might have for his property, except to say he was
bullish on something being done to help the local economy.;    "People these
days are looking for more than <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> has to offer," he said. "The
historic stuff is fine, but people want something to do at night.";   
Although <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> County last year imposed an interchange zoning ordinance along
the three Straban interchanges, it was too late to prevent Route 30, a key
entryway to the borough and battlefield, from becoming a homogenized,
stripped-out melange of 20th-century motel and fast-food culture.;    Are we
in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>?; "The real tragedy of that strip is that you could be in <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, as easily as <LOCATION>Adams County</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said.;    Preservationists are still
smarting over the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> site, parking for which required knocking down a
two-story Greek Revival-style brick farmhouse, circa <DATE>1840</DATE>, that was used as a
field hospital during the battle.;    The farmhouse was supplanted, circa
<DATE>1991</DATE>, by <ORGANIZATION>Wendy's</ORGANIZATION>.;    "We don't want the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> to come off as
being anti-development; that's not a realistic stand to take," <PERSON>Davidson</PERSON> said
in his office across from the <ORGANIZATION>National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>. "We'd like to play a role in
seeing that the development is sensitive to the historical resources."  </TEXT>

   Re-enactments staged on the great
battlefields of the Civil War usually end the same way _ with boys
in blue routing the Confederate gray.
   But not so in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   At <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION>, cannons will boom and muskets flash over the Fourth
of <DATE>July weekend</DATE> to commemorate a clear-cut Confederate victory over
Yankee troops when Gen. <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON> made his first major
attempt to silence the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> fortress 126 years ago.
   And at <ORGANIZATION>Brice's Cross Roads</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lee County</LOCATION>, scene of a textbook
attack by <ORGANIZATION>Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest</ORGANIZATION>'s cavalry,
historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown Southern dead
with 102 stones bearing the names of Rebel soldiers known to have
been killed in the <DATE>June 10, 1864</DATE>, battle.
   The <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> artillery demonstrations and engagements by several
hundred re-enactors will take place <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on private
land in <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> where the actual engagement being commemorated
occurred on <DATE>May 22, 1863</DATE>.
   Grant's all-out attack was beaten back by the <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> garrison
during a one-day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killed
or wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties.
   Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, Grant encircled
the city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender <DATE>47
days later</DATE> on <DATE>July 4, 1863</DATE>.
   ``Last year was the first year we had a re-enactment at <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION>
and, since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege, we felt it
only appropriate to do the last few days of it, including the
surrender,'' said <PERSON>Gordon Cotton</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Old Court House
Museum</ORGANIZATION> and organizer of the ``<LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> Civil War Re-enactment.''
   ``We did not realize when we planned last year's event that
re-living those days would be so emotionally straining on everyone
here,'' said Cotton.
   ``This year, the re-enactors wanted to do something different,
something very dramatic and we didn't want to go through another
defeat,'' he said. ``So this battle was the obvious choice.''
   Across the state in <LOCATION>Lee County</LOCATION>, history buff <PERSON>Charles Sullivan</PERSON> and
his associates found another way to remember a Confederate victory.
   ``Up to this point, all the battlefields I have marked were of
Confederate defeats,'' said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>, a department head at
<ORGANIZATION>Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College</ORGANIZATION>'s Perkinston campus and
<ORGANIZATION>Confederate</ORGANIZATION> graves registrar in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Sons of
Confederate Veterans</ORGANIZATION>. ``This time it was different.''
   At the <ORGANIZATION>Brice's Cross Roads</ORGANIZATION> battlefield, about six miles west of
<LOCATION>Baldwyn</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> won a major tactical victory over Gen. <PERSON>S.D.
Sturgis</PERSON>' larger Union force. When the fighting ended, over 1,500
Union soldiers had been captured.
   ``For Forrest, it was a textbook battle that has been studied at
war colleges around the world,'' said <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON>, who will participate
in the re-enactment at <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION>. ``Many believe this was his
greatest victory for, heavily outnumbered, he was able to destroy
the federal cavalry first and then the infantry.''
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at the
battle site sometime after <DATE>1930</DATE>, following passage of a federal law
allowing military stones for fallen Confederates.
   ``Thanks to the research of a friend named <PERSON>Roger Hansen</PERSON>, who has
a network of colleagues throughout the country who trade information
on Confederate dead, we were able to identify 102 men killed at the
crossroads on the Confederate side.''
   <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order
``because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do not
know exactly where each body was situated.''

<LEADPARA>  When Lauren Cook dons her Confederate soldier's uniform and lines up for
battle, she sometimes almost feels she has traveled back to the Civil War.;   
But while many U.S. women are serving in the Persian Gulf, Cook says some
national parks won't let her join "living history" portrayals of Civil War
battles because she is female.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WOMAN FILES SUIT OVER MEN-ONLY WAR RE-ENACTMENTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It's illegal, and it's a matter of principle," said <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>, who filed a
federal lawsuit this month asking that the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> be ordered to
let women join Civil War events at national parks.;    It's exciting to carry
a musket and simulate Civil War battles, said <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>, who works as a spokeswoman
for the <ORGANIZATION>George Mason University</ORGANIZATION> law school in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>;    "You get what
we call a 'period rush,' " she said. "There are times . . . when you
absolutely feel like you're time-traveling -- when you're actually out there
marching along and there are no 20th-century intrusions at all.";    <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> and
her husband, <PERSON>Fred Burgess</PERSON>, spend most weekends involved in Civil War events.
They even had a Civil War-era wedding last fall at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, asking all
guests to dress in period costume.;    <ORGANIZATION>The National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> doesn't allow
actual battle re-enactments, instead holding "living history" portrayals such
as camp-outs and marching and firing drills, where the public can talk to the
"soldiers." Battle re-enactments are held on state and private land.;   
Although <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> works hard to impersonate a man -- binding her chest, wearing
her hair short and talking with a husky voice -- one park official says that
isn't good enough.;    The programs at <ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, are intended to reflect what actually happened during the
<DATE>Sept. 17, 1862</DATE>, battle, park Superintendent <PERSON>Richard Rambur</PERSON> said.;    "If
you're going to portray anything here at <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>, you have to portray an
accurate picture," he said.;    The park also restricts children from
portraying soldiers, he said, adding that while some children may have fought
at <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>, "it does not portray the norm, and that's what we do here.";   
More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded or
reported missing at <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>. The park holds about a dozen weekend events a
year to portray different facets of the battle.;    But those aren't the roles
<ORGANIZATION>Cook</ORGANIZATION> has trained to portray. As a member of the 21st <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> volunteer
infantry and two other Civil War organizations, she's learned to play the fife
and has studied military tactics.;    "I think I do a far better job than a
lot of the men out there," she said.;    Some national parks have allowed <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>
and other women to march and join firing drills as male soldiers. But she was
barred from participating at <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>, and stayed away from an event at
<ORGANIZATION>Harpers Ferry National Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> after being told she wouldn't be
included.;    At a re-enactment last year of the surrender at <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>, she
successfully passed herself off as a man.;    Her lawyer, <PERSON>Clint Bolick</PERSON>,
describes the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> lawsuit as "a straightforward sex
discrimination case." No hearing date has been set for the suit.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Black `Soldiers' Re-Enact Their Civil War Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN STRAUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No black soldiers fought at the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of
Franklin</ORGANIZATION>, but 125 years later black Civil War re-enactors are
reminding their fellow history buffs of the contributions
African-Americans made in the war.
   A re-enactment of the <DATE>1864</DATE> battle <DATE>Sunday</DATE> capped a weekend of
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the fight. In it
<ORGANIZATION>Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood</ORGANIZATION> lost more than 6,000 soldiers,
crippling the <ORGANIZATION>South</ORGANIZATION>'s second-biggest force, the <ORGANIZATION>Army of Tennessee</ORGANIZATION>.
   The recreation attracted an estimated 4,000 re-enactors from
around the country. Similar battles will lead up to the 125th
anniversary of the surrender at <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 9</DATE>.
   The recreations feature lines of ``soldiers'' firing replica
weapons, booming cannon and cavalry charges. ``Casualties'' fall to
the ground, though there are rules: Don't fall with a loaded weapon
or with a bayonet.
   In one of the few deviations allowed from the historical record,
the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> forces at a field about 20 miles south of <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> <DATE>this
weekend</DATE> included about two dozen black re-enactors representing the
<ORGANIZATION>54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Gregory Urwin</PERSON>, a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Central
Arkansas</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Conway</PERSON> and leader of the 54th, said about 180,000 black
soldiers fought in the Civil War.
   They were allowed to join in <DATE>1863</DATE> after the Emancipation
Proclamation and eventually made up <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> army.
   ``There was an initial reluctance, a fear of a backlash, that
white Northerners would fight to preserve the union but not to end
slavery,'' said <PERSON>Urwin</PERSON>. ``And there was a fear that Southerners
would fight twice as hard if blacks were armed against them.''
   Black soldiers served with distinction in the Battle of
<LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, where they helped lead one of the attacks that allowed
Union troops to turn the Confederates back. They were also active
in the siege of <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, and several divisions were among
the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> units that helped stop Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s retreat at
<LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>.
   ``The first black units that were raised performed well in
combat. And by that point in the war, heavy losses and frequent
defeats made more Northerners willing to accept any kind of extra
manpower,'' <PERSON>Urwin</PERSON> said.
   Black participation in the war was used to justify the passage
of the 14th Amendment, making them citizens, and the 15th, which
gave them the right to vote.
   ``Without those Constitutional weapons there would have been no
civil rights movement in our own time,'' said <PERSON>Urwin</PERSON>. ``So, in a
sense, the black troops of the Civil War were the pioneers in the
revolution in race relations that we've lived through the <DATE>past 25</DATE>
or 30 years.''
   <PERSON>Urwin</PERSON> said the <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> recreation is a good chance for his
group to remind history buffs of the contribution of black soldiers.
   ``It's a chance, finally, 125 years after, for black and white
Americans to get together and celebrate their common heritage of
valor.''
   The re-enactors have a passion for accuracy in their portrayals,
wearing authentic wool uniforms and camping out without sleeping
bags, as did soldiers of the period.
   <PERSON>Urwin</PERSON>, 34, had no ancestors in the war but has an interest that
goes beyond the scholarship of his military history interest.
   ``I get the chill like everybody else,'' he said. ``There are
certain moments, like when twilight is falling over the camp and
the spectators have departed.
   ``You look and all you see is the <DATE>19th century</DATE>: sentinels are
marching their beats, people are beginning to light their
campfires. That's one moment when you can almost fool yourself into
thinking that you're back in time.''

<DATELINE>GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wounds from the Civil War have not
yet healed, according to retired Gen. <PERSON>William C. Westmoreland</PERSON>, who
commanded <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and whose relatives fought for the
<ORGANIZATION>Confederate Army</ORGANIZATION>.
   <LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION>, speaking <DATE>Monday</DATE> in a Memorial Day ceremony at
<ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>, said the three-day Battle of
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> and other confrontations in the Civil War played a
crucial role in the evolution of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.
   ``A nation is never fully formed,'' <PERSON>Westmoreland</PERSON> told about
1,000 spectators in the cemetery where President <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>
delivered his famed ``Gettysburg Address'' in <DATE>1863</DATE>.
   Lincoln sought unity and equality, <PERSON>Westmoreland</PERSON> said. He added
that while the states remain united, ``We have not made a
completely equal opportunity available to all.''
   ``Perhaps the most serious failure in our nation-building effort
has been the fate of our land's original inhabitants, the
Indians,'' he said.
   But, he said, many wounds have healed since <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and
Confederate troops fought here in what many historians consider the
decisive battle of the Civil War.
   ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, as we know it today, is a vibrant national entity ...
I believe <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> would be pleased with the American nation of
<DATE>1988</DATE>,'' <PERSON>Westmoreland</PERSON> said, standing near a monument marking the
spot where Lincoln dedicated the cemetery nearly five months after
the fighting ended with Confederate troops retreating from northern
soil.

<HEAD>AMERICANS KILL AMERICANS: The 5{-Year Odyssey of Ken Burns</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   <PERSON>Ken Burns</PERSON> sprinted up a <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> slope in
the footsteps of Gen. <PERSON>Pickett</PERSON>'s screaming Confederates and burst
into tears after climbing the hilltop wall that was the high-water
mark of the Confederacy.
   He mourned the deaths of ``friends'' ranging from <PERSON>Abraham
Lincoln</PERSON> to ordinary soldiers who dropped on battlefields 125 years
ago. And he was kept awake by the deafening sounds and vivid images
of Americans killing Americans.
   After 5{ years of work, the award-winning filmmaker is bringing
the sights, sounds, words and emotions of the Civil War into
millions of living rooms in a landmark public television
miniseries.
   ``We've made a film that has attempted to tell the whole story
and acknowledge that it is as dramatic as Hollywood or anyone could
dream up,'' <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said. ``The Civil War,'' an 11-hour documentary,
will be broadcast on five nights beginning <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The boyish-looking 37-year-old said emotions are the key to his
work and to seeing the war, in which 620,000 Americans died, in a
new light.
   ``We were constantly made aware of how poignant this story was,
how tragic it was,'' he said in his hilltop editing studio in
southwestern <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION>. ``The depth and profundity of that
emotion is what affected me more than anything else.''
   Burns tapped the emotions by peering into the innermost thoughts
of his subjects, from Presidents Lincoln and <PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON> to
ordinary soldiers who died in the mud. Their diaries and letters to
loved ones are the script.
   ``We get to know two dozen people so intimately that we had to
take one of the final half hours of the film to consider their
fates,'' he said.
   ``To have met this man, <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>, and gotten to know him,
I consider one of the great honors of my life. To have met <PERSON>Robert
E. Lee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON> and countless minor soldiers who could
write and speak and fight - and kill and die - has been the
greatest thing.''
   Burns traversed the country seeking information. For
authenticity, he filmed at battlefields on the anniversaries of the
fighting.
   At times he had to stop.
   ``I would dream so vividly about the battles, that it was too
much,'' he said.
   At <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, where Lee brought his army as far north as it
would get, and where <PERSON>George Pickett</PERSON> led his doomed charge, emotions
overcame him.
   ``I ran the last several hundred yards of <ORGANIZATION>Pickett</ORGANIZATION>'s charge and
went up and over the wall and burst into tears with the sense of
this being the most important moment,'' he said.
   Burns hopes his series will strip away the ``gallant, bloodless
myth'' of the Civil War and show that television can entertain and
inform at the same time.
   His cinematography brings still photographs alive, dragging
viewers along as frightened soldiers feel their way forward looking
for the enemy. In <LOCATION>Gettsyburg</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Antietam</ORGANIZATION> battle scenes, his
zooming, cutting and panning move viewers through a kaleidoscope of
sights toward victory, death or panicked retreat.
   Burns studied and recorded sounds of the birds and insects the
soldiers would have heard, and just how it sounded when 200 cannons
fired at the same time.
   If the images are powerful, the words cut even more deeply.
Rather than use actors, as most documentary filmmakers do, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>
uses only their voices.
   Here is part of a soldier's letter home after the second battle
of Bull Run: ``<DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a soldier in Company A died and was buried.
Everything went on as if nothing had happened, for death is so
common that little sentiment is wasted. It is not like death at
home.''
   History has long been a fascination for <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> in his filmmaking.
His first two documentaries, ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' (<DATE>1981</DATE>) and
``Statue of Liberty'' (<DATE>1985</DATE>), were both nominated for <ORGANIZATION>Academy
Awards</ORGANIZATION>. ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' and <DATE>1985</DATE>'s ``Huey Long'' won the
<PERSON>Eric Barnouw</PERSON> Prize for historical films.
   The American Film Festival awarded its Blue Ribbon to ``The
Statue of Liberty,'' ``<PERSON>Thomas Hart Benton</PERSON>'' (<DATE>1988</DATE>), ``The Brooklyn
Bridge'' and <DATE>1984</DATE>'s ``The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God.''
   <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, who studied at <ORGANIZATION>Hampshire College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, also
did the documentary ``The <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.''
   The filmmaker is overwhelmed that PBS, for the first time, is
pitting a miniseries against the commercial networks' new fall
shows. The decision is more remarkable because television
essentially abandoned documentaries 20 years ago, he said.
   The commitment to a lengthy and complex prime-time documentary
is particularly rewarding when much of television has been reduced
to 30-second glimpses and rock videos.
   ``We have to first admit that television is where our children
are getting most of their information,'' he said. ``If you lament
this and merely abdicate it to those who promote its baser
instincts, we've lost the battle.''
   The battle metaphor is no accident.
   ``We are in the front lines attempting to remind people that
television can be used in an honorable, as well as entertaining and
nutritional way, and that's what this series is,'' <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> said.

<LEADPARA>  When Lauren Cook dons her Confederate soldier's uniform and lines up for
battle, she sometimes almost feels she has traveled back to the Civil War.;   
But while many U.S. women are serving in the Persian Gulf, Cook says some
national parks won't let her join "living history" portrayals of Civil War
battles because she is female.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's illegal, and it's a matter of principle," said <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>, who filed a
federal lawsuit this month asking that the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> be ordered to
let women join Civil War events at national parks.;    It's exciting to carry
a musket and simulate Civil War battles, said <PERSON>Cook</PERSON>, who works as a spokeswoman
for the <ORGANIZATION>George Mason University</ORGANIZATION> law school in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>;    "You get what
we call a 'period rush,' " she said. "There are times . . . when you
absolutely feel like you're time-traveling -- when you're actually out there
marching along and there are no 20th-century intrusions at all.";    <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> and
her husband, <PERSON>Fred Burgess</PERSON>, spend most weekends involved in Civil War events.
They even had a Civil War-era wedding last fall at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, asking all
guests to dress in period costume.;    <ORGANIZATION>The National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> doesn't allow
actual battle re-enactments, instead holding "living history" portrayals such
as camp-outs and marching and firing drills, where the public can talk to the
"soldiers." Battle re-enactments are held on state and private land.;   
Although <PERSON>Cook</PERSON> works hard to impersonate a man -- binding her chest, wearing
her hair short and talking with a husky voice -- one park official says that
isn't good enough.;    The programs at <ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, are intended to reflect what actually happened during the
<DATE>Sept. 17, 1862</DATE>, battle, park Superintendent <PERSON>Richard Rambur</PERSON> said.;    "If
you're going to portray anything here at <ORGANIZATION>Antietam</ORGANIZATION> you have to portray an
accurate picture," he said.  </TEXT>

HOWARD ROSENBERG: WAR IS HELL, BUT 'CIVIL WAR' IS SPLENDID; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ON SUNDAY, PBS FIRES THE FIRST SALVO OF ITS 11-HOUR MINISERIES, A 
SCINTILLATING MASTERPIECE NOT TO BE MISSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern novelist <PERSON>Robert Penn Warren</PERSON> tells us in "All the Kings Men" that no 
one is truly innocent, that even high-minded actions can result in evil. 
</P>
<P>
Probably no television program in recent times echoes this more than "The Civil 
War" on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Ken Burns</PERSON>' 11-hour account of the War Between the States is an 
ironic masterpiece. It's as scintillating and utterly seductive as television 
gets, a <ORGANIZATION>Yankee Doodle Dandy</ORGANIZATION> of a historical extravanganza from a man who 
combines a scholar's appreciation of fact with a filmmaker's eye and 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
The miniseries will be broadcast <DATE>Sunday</DATE> through <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> on Channels 
28, 15 and 24, and at <TIME>9 p.m.</TIME> on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
If quality triumphs, "The Civil War" will march through five nights of prime 
time the way <PERSON>William Tecumseh Sherman</PERSON> marched to the sea, leveling everything 
in its path. It is that good. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civil War" is a chronological narrative that unfurls simply yet creatively 
and artfully. There are sound effects, but only one major re-creation: Unseen 
actors read lines from the comedy that <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> was watching at <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s 
Theater when he was mortally wounded by <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON>. As laughter in the 
theater swells, a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, history springs to vibrant life here from thousands of photographs 
-- armies of photographers followed the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and Confederate armies -- 
enhanced by approximately 900 first-person quotes from war letters, diaries and 
memoirs. The unseen readers range from <PERSON>Sam Waterston</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Jason 
Robards</PERSON> as <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>, from <PERSON>Julie Harris</PERSON> as <PERSON>Mary Chestnut</PERSON> to <PERSON>Morgan 
Freeman</PERSON> as <PERSON>Frederick Douglass</PERSON>, from <PERSON>Jody Powell</PERSON> as <PERSON>Stonewall Jackson</PERSON> to <PERSON>Studs 
Terkel</PERSON> as <PERSON>Benjamin F. Butler</PERSON>. 
</P>
<P>
Although drawing from numerous consultants for his research, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> disdains 
talking heads and uses only a few authorities as on-camera commentators, 
principally historian <PERSON>Shelby Foote</PERSON>, whose soft Southernese becomes almost a 
secondary narration. 
</P>
<P>
There is no finer historical documentary maker in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> than <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>, whose 
previous topics have included the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> Bridge and the Statue of Liberty. 
Consider his task here: Create a living history on the screen without having 
footage of that history. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, his great genius as a visual storyteller is his ability to draw 
fluidity from stillness. His camera pans charred, swollen bodies as if it were 
Lincoln's own eyes wearily surveying the battlefield. Sometimes the camera 
seems to come almost from within the old photographs that <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> is shooting, 
starting at the center and then ever-so-slowly pulling back, or vice versa, 
creating a sense of motion. All the while, bugles or drums or cannon or horse 
hoofs or shouts or moans or readings or music come across the sound track. 
</P>
<P>
The sights and sounds are beautifully mixed. <PERSON>Jay Ungar</PERSON>'s mournful "Ashokan 
Farewell" interweaves the entire production, and "Jacob's Ladder," "The Battle 
Hymn of the Republic" and other songs, since passed down like genes from 
generation to generation, set moods and tones. 
</P>
<P>
Burns presents the war from infinite perspectives -- the personal stories of 
both major and minor figures, the famous and the anonymous becoming the strands 
of a richly detailed historical tapestry. Hardly an aspect of the conflict, no 
matter how small, goes unmentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Threading all of these diverse elements, meanwhile, is <PERSON>David McCullough</PERSON>'s 
narration, a hint of poignancy in his flat, Everyman's voice. 
</P>
<P>
If "The Civil War" has a serious flaw, it's <PERSON>Burns</PERSON>' failure at times to see 
enough of the past in the present. 
</P>
<P>
The point is made -- through the words of <PERSON>Douglass</PERSON> and others -- that the 
Emancipation Proclamation freed blacks from slavery, but not from 
discrimination, a condition that continued to prevail during the South's 
ensuing white supremacy years and that remains a sore that festers nationwide 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In other ways, however, historical links to the present are unexplored. For 
<PERSON>Foote</PERSON> to almost cavalierly dismiss <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON> as "the first modern general" 
because of the way his Union troops waged ruthless war on innocent Confederate 
civilians while marching southward, for example, suggests tacit approval of 
acts as indefensible as the My Lai massacre in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War had its own massacres. In the first installment <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> 
sets the stage for Southern secession and war. 
</P>
<P>
By the <DATE>late 1850s</DATE>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> resembled a giant picture puzzle whose 
pieces were loosening and falling away. McCullough: "By <DATE>1860</DATE>, the <DATE>last year</DATE> of 
peace, one out of seven Americans belonged to another American." As the 
nation's "sleeping serpent" of slavery finally uncoils, war clouds thicken and 
hover ominously. 
</P>
<P>
On <DATE>April 12, 1861</DATE>, Southern artillery fires on Northern troops inside Ft. 
Sumter off the coast of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, officially beginning the war that <PERSON>Foote</PERSON> 
says defined <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> like no other event in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Like all wars, this one produced its own brand of nervous humor, and <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> 
spreads it liberally. A Confederate soldier observes about reticent Union 
commander Gen. <PERSON>George McClellan</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>: "<PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> had brought superior 
forces . . . but he had also brought himself." 
</P>
<P>
One is especially struck by the initial fervor on both sides -- entire towns 
signing up, and <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> companies, in a forerunner of contemporary gangs, brashly 
calling themselves "Thrashers" or "Desperadoes" or "Killers" -- and how this 
seems a metaphor for all war. 
</P>
<P>
Yet jubilance here is eclipsed by death, as weapons exceed tactics and the 
bravery of soldiers often exceeds the ability of their officers to lead them. 
As a result, the carnage is appalling. 
</P>
<P>
In this bloody universe, the air is thick with cannon balls, and soldiers 
crouch behind walls of their own dead. And from the diary of someone recalling 
the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of Shiloh</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1862</DATE>: "Everywhere wounded men lay in agony. Neither 
army had yet devised a system for gathering or caring for them on the field. 
Scores of wounded collapsed and died drinking from a mud hole near the peach 
orchard, staining the water red. It began to rain, and flashes of lightening 
showed hogs feeding on the ungathered dead." 
</P>
<P>
Even more indelible are the photos: 
</P>
<P>
* Amputated limbs stacked like firewood. 
</P>
<P>
* Rigid, twisted bodies, their "fixed eyes staring at the sky." 
</P>
<P>
* Three eyeless skulls resting together on the earth, neither who they once 
were nor whose side they fought on mattering any longer. 
</P>
<P>
* The infamous Confederate prison near <LOCATION>Andersonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION>, its skeletal inmates 
appearing too weak even to move. 
</P>
<P>
The moment of the entire series, though, is a sequence depicting the pivotal 
<DATE>1863</DATE> defeat of <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s Confederate army at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> -- the battle was 
a war in itself -- that cost both sides dearly. It ends with <PERSON>Waterston</PERSON> reading 
<ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s famed <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> address as photographs of battlefield dead dissolve 
to ancient newsreel footage of white-haired <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> veterans many years 
later revisiting this place where their comrades fell. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's Lincoln's assassination as a grim postscript to four years of 
war that have just ended. The dying President is moved from <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s to a 
boarding house across the street, where he sinks like the sun, a brightness 
suddenly gone. 
</P>
<P>
It's one more memory that you take away from these 11 hours and another reason 
why, more than just a program, "The Civil War" is an event.

   ``Welcome To Historic <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>, Where
Our Nation Reunited.''
   Other than the wooden sign at the side of the highway, <PERSON>Harry
Lillie</PERSON>'s Civil War souvenir and relic shop adjoining the <PERSON>Lee-Grant
Motel</PERSON> is the only reminder of what happened two miles outside town
on <DATE>April 9, 1865</DATE>.
   In the Victorian parlor of a private home, with the
<ORGANIZATION>Confederacy</ORGANIZATION>'s main army surrounded and starving, Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>
surrendered to Gen. <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>, ending, for all intents and
purposes, the War Between the States.
   On the muddy main road of the tiny village of <ORGANIZATION>Appomattox Court
House</ORGANIZATION> three days later, exactly four years after the war started at
<LOCATION>Fort Sumter</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, Confederate Gen. <PERSON>John Gordon</PERSON> marched his 28,231
ragged, emaciated troops one last time.
   As Union troops from the 100,000-strong Army of the Potomac
lined the muddy road, the Rebels stacked their guns, hung their
ammunition pouches on the sights, furled their Confederate battle
flags and began the long trek home.
   In a re-enactment commemorating the 125th anniversary <DATE>Sunday</DATE>,
the solemn sound of soldiers marching again will be broken by the
crisp order ``Stack ... arms.'' But the skirmishes will be
re-enacted 150 miles away in <LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>.
   Neither local residents nor the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>, which
operates the <ORGANIZATION>Appomattox Court House National Historical Park</ORGANIZATION>,
wanted to restage the battles.
   Lillie, a well-meaning carpetbagger from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, is
perplexed by what he considers residents' apathy about the role
their county played in American history.
   ``<LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION> was big enough to handle the actual battles and
surrender, but is not big enough to handle the re-enacted battles.
That ought to tell you something,'' he said.
   About 110,000 people visit <ORGANIZATION>Appomattox Court House</ORGANIZATION> annually, but
few tarry because <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION> has only two small hotels and few
places to eat, said <PERSON>Jon Montgomery</PERSON>, the park superintendent.
   In <DATE>1865</DATE>, there were 8,900 residents. Now there are about 12,800.
A publicity pamphlet issued by the chamber of commerce describes
<LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION> as ``an old-fashioned town where progress is slow and
measured.''
   But a chain hotel now is under construction across the street
from <PERSON>Lillie</PERSON>'s, and a shopping center, Historic Junction, recently
was completed. Fast-food restaurants beckon on the main highway,
and there are plans to lure more people into the main part of town,
with its freshly painted, century-old wooden homes and stores.
   Montgomery and Mayor <PERSON>Ronnie Spiggle</PERSON> said it takes a sense of
history to understand the reluctance over the years to
commercialize the park and the decision this year to ignore the
battles that took place 125 years ago.
   Spiggle agrees with the shrine-like treatment of the park, which
continues to be surrounded by miles of undeveloped pastures and
looks nearly identical to what the soldiers saw in <DATE>1865</DATE>.
   ``We don't want to emphasize the battles. They were
insignificant compared to other battles of the war,'' <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON>
said. ``The story here is the peace that came here.''
   After the war, <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION> opposition to a park at <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION> kept
the federal government from establishing one for 75 years. A new
highway skirted the deteriorating village. Buildings disintegrated
and burned. Some were torn down.
   In <DATE>1940</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> acquired the land for the
park, and the main buildings of the village eventually were
restored or reconstructed in time for the 100th anniversary of the
surrender.
   The 10 historic structures, most red brick surround by
split-rail or white picket fences, include the <ORGANIZATION>McLean House</ORGANIZATION>, where
the terms of surrender were signed, the courthouse, a tavern, a
jail, a general store, a tiny law office and several residences.
   ``The southerners wanted to forget what happened here,''
<PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> said. ``It marked the end of their hopes of having a
separate country.''

<HEAD>NEW YORK: the South.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Beyond disagreements over slavery, it was a vicious campaign,
with Lincoln subjected to endless personal attacks from <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION>
newspapers.
   ``He has most unwarrantly abused the privilege, which all
politicians have, of being ugly,'' the <ORGANIZATION>Houston Chronicle</ORGANIZATION> sneered,
commenting on <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s thin, pock-marked face and unruly hair. ``A
horrid looking wretch he is,'' added the <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>) <ORGANIZATION>Mercury</ORGANIZATION>,
``sooty and scoundrelly in aspect, a cross between the nutmeg
dealer, the horse dealer and the night man.''
   But Lincoln, who would soon follow the advice of little <PERSON>Grace
Bedell</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Westfield</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and grow a beard, said nothing, making
no formal speeches during the campaign. And thanks to the
Democratic split, he easily won the election while receiving only
<PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the votes.
   By his inauguration in <DATE>March 1861</DATE>, however, seven Southern
states had already seceded and rumors of an assassination attempt
had forced him to alter travel plans the previous month. In his
inaugural address, Lincoln pleaded for a peaceful settlement to the
slavery issue:
   ``We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it
must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory,
stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every
living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet
swell the chorus of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>, when again touched, as surely they
will be, by the better angels of our nature.''
   On <DATE>April 12</DATE>, the Confederates opened fire on <LOCATION>Fort Sumter</LOCATION> in
<LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> harbor and captured it two days later. Lincoln, vowing
to ``repel force by force,'' called for a militia of 75,000 and
ordered a blockade of Southern ports. The Civil War had begun.
   ``Except in respect to military matters, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was not the
kind of president we expect today,'' <PERSON>Fehrenbacher</PERSON> said. ``He didn't
give leadership in domestic affairs because he didn't think that
was his job. The Whigs had been opposing the `dictatorship' of
(President) <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON>. They believed that was the leadership
of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. He took the leadership role in war, and also in
regards to emancipation.''
   With typical caution, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> dismantled slavery. In <DATE>1862</DATE>, he
drafted the Emancipation Proclamation, but waited for a Union
victory before officially issuing it on <DATE>Jan. 1, 1863</DATE>.
   ``What good would a proclamation for emancipation from me do,
especially as we are now situated,'' he worried. ``I do not want to
issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be
inoperative, like the Pope's bull against the comet! Would my word
free the slaves when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the
rebel States?''
   The turning point in the Civil War came that <DATE>summer</DATE>, outside
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>. For three days one of the war's bloodiest battles
was fought. Nearly 50,000 soldiers were killed and the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate
Army</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION> was forced to retreat.
   In <DATE>November</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> was a last-minute invitee to the dedication
of the <ORGANIZATION>Civil War Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION>,
under 300 words long, was a modest prayer that, despite the war,
``government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall
not perish from the earth.''
   Ironically, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> predicted in the same speech, ``The world
will little note, nor long remember what we say here.''
   ``It's quite obvious that he realized this was an occasion that
something important could be said about the meaning of war and the
meaning of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>,'' <PERSON>Fehrenbacher</PERSON> said. ``He saw it a new birth of
freedom, and it's obvious he gave a great deal of thought to what
he was saying.''
   The Republican Party overwhelmingly chose Lincoln as its
candidate in the <DATE>1864</DATE> elections. The Democrats selected Gen. <PERSON>George
B. McClellan</PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> had dropped as commander-in-chief of
<LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> forces in <DATE>1862</DATE>.
   With the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> deadlocked on the battlefield, Lincoln seemed
sure he would lose, even writing a ``Memorandum of the Probable
Failure of Re-Election'' on <DATE>Aug. 23</DATE>. But he easily won in <DATE>November</DATE>.
   ``With malice towards none; with charity for all; with firmness
in the right ... let us strive to finish the work we are in,''
Lincoln urged at his inaugural in <DATE>March 1865</DATE>, hoping for a peaceful
way to ``bind up the nation's wounds.''
   Once victory seemed assured, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s thoughts moved beyond
winning the war and focused instead on reconstruction, the subject
of his last speech, given on <DATE>April 11</DATE>, two days after Gen. <PERSON>Robert
E. Lee</PERSON>'s surrender at <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>April 14</DATE>, while attending a play at the <ORGANIZATION>Ford Theatre</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, Lincoln was shot in the head by actor <PERSON>John Wilkes
Booth</PERSON>, who cried out ``Sic Semper Tyranus'' (``Thus Ever to
Tyrants,'' the motto of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>). He died the following morning.
   Lincoln had long worried about death, thinking, speaking and
even dreaming of his assassination. In his early 50s, he was
already referring to himself as an old man, and he reflected on
mortality in an <DATE>1862</DATE> letter to young <PERSON>Fanny McCullough</PERSON>, whose father
was killed in battle:
   ``In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the
young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them
unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to
afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is
not possible, except with time.
   ``... The mrobably would have continued as a writer,
<PERSON>Fehrenbacher</PERSON> said.
   ``In the presidency he was increasingly concerned with the art
of writing. That shows in his best works, and that's one more thing
that <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON> took away from us.''

   A horse-drawn cart draped in black
transported the partial remains of four <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> soldiers to their
final resting place in a funeral marking the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of Antietam</ORGANIZATION>'s
127th anniversary.
   About 85 men dressed in Civil War uniforms gave full military
honors <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to the four fallen members of the Irish Brigade from
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> whose bones were found in <DATE>March 1988</DATE> by relic hunters in a
field near the battleground.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said 38-year-old <PERSON>Collin MacDonald</PERSON>, who served as
commander for the reburial.
   He said it was the western <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> park's first Civil War burial
this century.
   An estimated 450 people watched the funeral that began shortly
before noon at the 11-acre <ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> near
<LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION> where the remains of nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   ``I've done re-enactments, but to see it for real just sent
shivers up and down my spine,'' said <PERSON>Blake Magner</PERSON>, 39, of <ORGANIZATION>Westmont</ORGANIZATION>,
<LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>
   More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed,
wounded or missing after the battle, which ended Confederate Gen.
<PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s two attempts to push the war northward. The battle
is described as the single bloodiest day of the war.
   The remains of the four soldiers were sealed in a canister inside
a plain, pine coffin that was lowered into the ground near the
graves of other Irish Brigade soldiers.
   They were with regiments that charged the Confederate line <DATE>Sept.
17, 1862</DATE>, and were killed by rifle fire. Researchers speculated that
the men's skulls and leg and arm bones were removed from the
battleground in <DATE>1865</DATE> or <DATE>1866</DATE> under a federal program to re-inter
Union dead at the cemetery. The rest of their bodies remained
untouched until <DATE>March 1988</DATE> when they were found by a group using
metal detectors.
   ``We brought the remains home, but it bothered us that we had
human remains,'' said <PERSON>Dave Bebenroth</PERSON>, an elementary school teacher
from <LOCATION>Strongsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, who was with the group that discovered the
remains.
   About a month after the discovery, they decided to turn the
remains over to the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>, which manages <ORGANIZATION>Antietam
National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Douglas Owsley</PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, determined that two of the
soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other was
about 45 years old.
   Earlier in the day, the re-enactors representing the 28th
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and the 93rd <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> regiments gathered for a
Roman Catholic Mass at ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road in the middle
of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for nearly four
hours that day.
   After the Mass, the soldiers marched a mile from Bloody Lane to
the cemetery where two buglers played ``Taps.'' The remains were
buried with a clump of turf and a rock from <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>.

   About 4,000 volunteers dressed as <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>
and Confederate soldiers <DATE>Sunday</DATE> marked the 125th anniversary of the
end of the Civil War by recreating the solemn surrender of Gen.
<PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s troops.
   Nearly 8,000 spectators, some wearing bonnets and hoopskirts
from <DATE>1865</DATE>, stood behind wooden fences along the old stage road
through <ORGANIZATION>Appomattox Court House National Historic Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   There was scattered applause and a few rebel yells as a man
playing Confederate Gen. <PERSON>John Gordon</PERSON> rode a stocky chestnut horse
in front of a column of rebel soldiers marching four abreast
between Union troops with shouldered arms.
   After <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>, more than a month went by before the remaining
Confederate armies surrendered and a few isolated forces west of
the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> laid down their arms. But historians agree
that <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s surrender to Gen. <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON> ended the War Between
the States for all intents and purposes.
   The re-enactment took place in the isolated, reconstructed
central <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> village where the war ended after four devastating
years. Most of the volunteers playing rebel and Union men in
uniform were grim.
   ``It's a solemn occasion,'' said <PERSON>Joe Pitts</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Winston-Salem</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> ``We don't particularly care for it, and the troops back then
didn't care for it.''
   One young Confederate wept as he stacked his rifle in one of the
teepee-style piles along the dirt road winding through the region's
rolling hills.
   ``You get into what the soldiers felt back then,'' said Lake Day
of <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> ``To subject yourself to surrender is tough.''
   The volunteers said they were saddened this was the last major
re-enactment of the anniversary battles they have recreated during
the past four years. A few said they planned to quit the expensive
hobby after this.
   The re-enactors ranged in age from pre-teens to septuagenarians,
and came from across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Pitts</PERSON> said they tried to depict the surrender at <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>
exactly as the ragged, starving soldiers went through it.
   ``It can't be totally correct; we can't be emaciated like they
were,'' he said.
   The re-enactment also was a few days off, and the sky was blue
rather than gray.
   The stacking of arms came on <DATE>April 12, 1865</DATE>, exactly four years
after the war started at <LOCATION>Fort Sumter</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, and three days after
Lee surrendered to Gen. Grant at a private home on the edge of the
village. Lee's surrender was not re-enacted.
   <PERSON>Terry Daley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, who played Union Gen. <PERSON>Joshua
Chamberlain</PERSON>, said his order for his men to present arms as 27,800
Confederate soldiers surrendered, ``helped heal our wounds.''
   ``At the sound of a bugle, <PERSON>Chamberlain</PERSON> paid the highest tribute
you can to an adversary; it was to show we are brothers and
Americans,'' <PERSON>Daley</PERSON> said.

   The remains of four <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> soldiers were
reburied at the <ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the 127th
anniversary of an <DATE>1862</DATE> Civil War bloodbath.
   Relic seekers from <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> discovered the remains of the front-line
soldiers in <DATE>March 1988</DATE>, and anthropologists and archaeologists have
been studying them since.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, the remains were sealed inside a plain, pine coffin
and buried with full military honors at <ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>.
   An estimated 450 people watched the Civil War funeral at the
11-acre hilltop cemetery near <LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>, where the remains of
nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   The four soldiers found were members of the Irish Brigade from
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, which charged the Confederate line <DATE>Sept. 17, 1862</DATE>, and
were killed by rifle fire.
   They were among more than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers
who were killed, wounded or missing after the Battle of <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>,
which climaxed Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s two attempts to push the war
farther north. The battle is described as the single bloodiest day
of the war.
   ``The massive number of dead in the battle made the interment
paramount,'' said <PERSON>Dennis Frye</PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION>National Park
Service</ORGANIZATION>. ``They did not have time to properly bury individuals with
independent memorial services.''
   <PERSON>Douglas Owsley</PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist at the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History</ORGANIZATION>, determined that two of the
fallen soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other
was about 45 years old. ``The older fellow had arthritis in his
shoulder bones,'' he said.
   ``This was a very unique opportunity because you have the ability
to associate with the men who went into battle,'' <PERSON>Owsley</PERSON> said.
``Normally, you have the artifacts without the bones.''
   About 85 men from re-enactment units representing the 28th
<LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> and the 93rd <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> regiments camped at <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>
and assisted with the burial and a <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Mass</ORGANIZATION>.
   The morning service was held along ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road
in the middle of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for
nearly four hours that day.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said <PERSON>Collin MacDonald</PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION>Centreville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, who
served as a commander for the event. ``This is the first Civil War
burial that the park has had this century. The re-enactors who are
here are making history.''
   A hazy ridge of <LOCATION>South Mountain</LOCATION> provided a distant backdrop for
the <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>. The coffin, which rested on sawhorses, was covered with a
34-star American flag. Some of the soldiers, dressed in navy coats
and light blue slacks, knelt on one knee during the service. Smoke
from morning campfires filled the air.
   Pallbearers placed the coffin on a horse-drawn cart drapped in
black, and the soldiers donned black arm bands before starting a
milelong procession from <ORGANIZATION>Bloody Lane</ORGANIZATION> to the cemetery. The group
marched to a somber beat of drums draped in black.

   Americans took to the open road on their way to the beaches,
parks, campgrounds, concerts, race tracks, rodeos and parades
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> for the Fourth of <DATE>July weekend</DATE>, but the fire hazard
created by the drought took fireworks off the program for many of
them.
   The weekend of partying under the <DATE>summer</DATE> sun opened with a
shiver for some people around the Great Lakes and in the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION>.
Temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s overnight and two dozen
cities hit record lows, including 34 degrees at <ORGANIZATION>Elkins</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>W.Va</LOCATION>.
   Outdoor concerts were a big part of the weekend festivities.
   In <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, about 70,000 tickets were sold for concerts <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
and <DATE>Sunday</DATE> by the Grateful Dead at the <ORGANIZATION>Oxford Plains Speedway</ORGANIZATION>. The
band's followers, known as Deadheads, started arriving <DATE>Friday</DATE> to
camp out.
   ``This is the real American dream that sometimes gets lost,''
said <PERSON>Stephen Whitaker</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION>, who characterized a Grateful Dead
concert as a unity of people. ``The specialness of why people have
been doing this for 20 years is the sense of caring.''
   Thousands more in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> were expected to converge on <ORGANIZATION>Old Orchard
Beach</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to hear <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON>.
   Vice President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> was also in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, at his vacation
home in <LOCATION>Kennebunkport</LOCATION>, but aides said he planned no public
appearances and was scheduled to leave <DATE>Monday</DATE>.
   If rock wasn't your style, an annual Festival of <ORGANIZATION>American Fiddle
Tunes</ORGANIZATION> was scheduled at <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Fort Worden State Park</LOCATION>.
   For those who preferred something more rousing, the <ORGANIZATION>New Mexico
Symphony Orchestra</ORGANIZATION> offered an outdoor pops concert <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME>
featuring <ORGANIZATION>Tchaikovsky</ORGANIZATION>'s ``1812 Overture,'' accompanied by cannons
representing <PERSON>Napoleon</PERSON>'s siege of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
   And there's always the Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE> outdoor concert by the
<LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> Pops, with police expecting 200,000 people this year along
the <LOCATION>Charles River</LOCATION>.
   The <PERSON>Charlie Daniels</PERSON> Band joined in at <ORGANIZATION>Freedom Weekend Aloft</ORGANIZATION>, a
four-day hot-air balloon festival at <LOCATION>Greenville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C</LOCATION>. That event
opened <DATE>Friday</DATE> with 125 balloons taking off before an audience of
about 50,000 people. Going in the opposite direction at the opening
ceremony were members of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s parachute team, the Golden
Knights.
   Entertainers ranging from <PERSON>Glen Campbell</PERSON> to Chinese acrobats were
on the program in <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, where organizers expected more than 3
million visitors for the annual VP Fair, billed as ``<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s
largest birthday party.'' The three-day event kicked off <DATE>Saturday</DATE>
with a parade that drew 250,000 spectators.
   Big crowds were expected over the weekend at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>,
for the final two days of festivities marking the 125th anniversary
of the Civil War battle, fought <DATE>July 1-3, 1863</DATE>. But only about
15,000 tourists spent at least part of the day at the battlefield
<DATE>Friday</DATE>, park officials said.
   During a ceremony <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Robert P. Casey</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Gerald Baliles</PERSON>, and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Sen. Alfonse D'Amato</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New
York</LOCATION> exchanged original flags from the period. The flags will be
displayed at the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> battlefield's museum.
   ``We remember the remarkable bravery of our soldiers, the
sacrifices of our families and the consequences for succeeding
generations of Americans,'' <PERSON>Baliles</PERSON> said. ``But let us only
remember the past, not become prisoners to it.''
   The weather was playing a large part in the weekend diversions.
   In <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, rain and damp weather caused swarms of mosquitoes to
breed and southwest winds, unusual for this time of year, blew them
from the <LOCATION>Everglades</LOCATION> into populated areas by the millions.
   ``In many, many parts of <LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION> we're experiencing landing
counts on human beings of 50 (mosquitoes) per minute,'' said <PERSON>Pat
O'Conner</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Dade County</LOCATION>'s assistant director of public works.
   But elsewhere the problem was the widespread drought and its
heightened fire danger. Counties and communities in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and elsewhere banned
or restricted fireworks out of fear of setting grass and forest
fires.
   ``The potential is there for a disaster this year,'' said <PERSON>Les
Parr</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Riverside County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, fire prevention officer. ``The
brush is dry and well-cured and the danger and potential for fires
is a lot greater.''
   Some drought-stricken farmers got a little relief <DATE>Saturday</DATE> when
trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> hay arrived at
<LOCATION>Coldwater</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> farmers were returning a favor
granted by their <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> counterparts during a drought two years ago.
   Concern with fireworks safety wasn't limited to drought areas.
Fireworks were blamed for an apartment fire in the <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> suburb
of <LOCATION>Burien</LOCATION> that left eight families homeless <DATE>Friday</DATE>. That was the
sixth fire in the Puget Sound area blamed on fireworks in the past
two weeks.
   On the competitive side of the weekend, the 8th annual run of
the World's Greatest Lizard Race is set for <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Lovington</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.M</LOCATION>. A separate race is scheduled for slower horned toads. The town
also scheduled an egg toss, cowchip toss and drill-bit toss.
   And a Fourth of <DATE>July</DATE> church picnic at <LOCATION>Oak Ridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, will
feature a wrestling match between Tom ``Powerhouse Parson''
Melzoni, ordinarily the pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Central Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>
``Masked Saint'' <PERSON>Whaley</PERSON>, a divinity student who wrestles
professionally.

<TEXT>     The result is a gentle, heartwarming film that reminds us how the agony of
the Civil War affected a handful of Americans, including the 16th president,
who were touched by one of its most profoundly tragic encounters -- the Battle

<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is recovering from yet another war -- may make viewers even more
receptive to the film's anti-war message.;    The film follows the journey of
a 13-year-old <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> boy, <PERSON>Benjamin Blair</PERSON> (<PERSON>Lukas Haas</PERSON>), through the war-torn
countryside in the third year of the Civil War. He's trying to reach
<LOCATION>Washington City</LOCATION>, where he believes his older brother, <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Campbell Scott</ORGANIZATION>),
a Confederate soldier, lies dying from wounds received at Gettysburg.;    At
the same time, President <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> is fraught with despair over the worsening
condition of his ailing son, Tad (<PERSON>Andrew Winton</PERSON>), and the awesome number of
casualties on both sides of the epic conflict at Gettysburg.;    Hated by
Southerners and disliked by enormous numbers of war-numbed Northerners as
well, <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> has fallen so low that hardly anyone wants to hear him when he
rises to deliver the brief words of dedication at the new national cemetery at
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> -- words that would later be cited as among the most eloquent in
American history.;    The story of how this troubled president's path crosses
that of the desperate 13-year-old from <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> is the core of "The Perfect
Tribute." Only the hardhearted will be unmoved by the sentimental climax.;   
Though the incident never happened, most of the events leading up to it did,
including the film's most spellbinding sequence -- Lincoln's delivery of his
<ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION> to a stunned crowd wholly unprepared for its compelling
depth of feeling.;    Indeed, this is a great television moment, as <PERSON>Robards</PERSON>
gives new dimensions of power to the words so familiar to millions.;    "The
Perfect Tribute" is the work of first-time screenwriter <PERSON>Dennis Brown</PERSON>, a
journalist and sometime lecturer aboard the famed <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> Queen steamboat. He
took it from the short story by <PERSON>Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews</PERSON>, first published
in <LOCATION>Scribner</LOCATION>'s magazine in <DATE>1905</DATE>. Reprinted in book form, it sold 600,000
copies, a phenomenal number in its day.;    The movie shows us how worn-down
Americans were after three years of fighting each other. Most of the
characters are weary and heartsick, hoping for any miracle to bring this
catastrophic thing to a close.;    The exception is young <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>, who's
playing war with his tin soldiers at his <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> home when we first meet him.
Still untouched by the war, he's able to imagine only the glory of it all.;   
In sharp counterpoint, the movie alternates scenes from the horrors of
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> hums to himself and fights his tabletop battle: slugs
thumping into human chests, sending out great gouts of blood, the infernal
pounding of cannon, the screams of the wounded, the deafening buzz of the
flies.;    One of those who falls is his brother, who winds up with a terrible
wound in his chest, slowly dying from the bullet the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> doctor tending him
can't remove.;    It's not until <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> begins his impulsive quest into enemy
territory that he sees war for what it really is. Hiding, he stumbles over a
stiffening corpse in the woods. Starving, he's denied food by even the
Confederate troops he meets. The one Southern soldier who befriends him is
suddenly killed -- quietly, with a neat round hole in his forehead.;    At the
same time, Lincoln is shocked by the early casualty figures from <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>:
3,000 Union dead and 15,000 wounded against 2,600 Confederate dead and 13,000
wounded -- in just three days of fighting.;    <PERSON>Robards</PERSON> is brilliant as
<LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, assuming the character naturally without any trace of caricature.
(<PERSON>Robards</PERSON> has played Lincoln twice before on TV, the last time in <DATE>1964</DATE>.) His
Lincoln is a sad, almost pathetic figure but infused with great humanity and
very likable.;    <PERSON>Young Lukas Haas</PERSON> (the memorable Amish boy in "Witness") is
also exceptional, as <LOCATION>Benjamin</LOCATION>, particularly in the scene in which he reads the
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> Address aloud from the newspaper to his brother and the man he
doesn't realize is Lincoln himself.;    "The Perfect Tribute" is also loaded
with very strong supporting players, including a surprising dramatic cameo by
<PERSON>Katherine Helmond</PERSON> ("Who's the Boss?") as a war-deadened farm woman who helps
Benjamin along the way.;    Among the others: <PERSON>Jeanne Tripplehorn</PERSON> as a Union
nurse who treats <PERSON>Ben</PERSON>'s brother with compassion despite the death of her own
man at Rebel hands; Oscar-winner <PERSON>Jose Ferrer</PERSON> as <PERSON>Edward Everett</PERSON>, the primary
speaker at the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> memorial, who admits <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s soaring speech has
humbled him, and Emmy-winner <PERSON>Ed Flanders</PERSON> ("St. Elsewhere"), the newspaper
publisher who has grown tired of Lincoln until riding with him to Gettysburg.;
   "The Perfect Tribute" is another jewel in the crown of producer <PERSON>Dorothea G.
Petrie</PERSON>, whose award-laden TV films include "Caroline?" "Love Is Never Silent"
and "Foxfire." With our national interest in the period still running high
after last year's acclaimed "The Civil War" series on <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION>, "The Perfect
Tribute" should receive a warm welcome from viewers and leave them feeling
much better for the experience. (box)  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE climactic battle for the Shenandoah Valley, General Pickett's headlong
charge at Gettysburg and the first and second battles of Manassas are the
stuff from which Richard Berg has fashioned a business.;    Berg, 47, a former
New York City criminal defense lawyer, is the inventor of more than a dozen
Civil War games designed to give Civil War enthusiasts an opportunity to
change history.  </LEADPARA>

WAR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Games  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "I think of the games as paper time machines that re-create the Civil War,"
<PERSON>Berg</PERSON> says.;     <ORGANIZATION>Outfighting General Lee</ORGANIZATION>;    "We give players the battlefield,
the soldiers and the basic rules. Then it's up to them to do what they will
with them. For instance, take <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>; if General <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> had not stopped early
on <DATE>July 1</DATE>, because his troops were tired, even though he had a couple of hours
of daylight left, the outcome of the battle and the Civil War might have been
very different. You can see it on the board.";    Explaining that <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> forces
had not yet established a defensive position that fateful day, on <ORGANIZATION>Cemetery
Ridge</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Culp</PERSON>'s Hill, <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> points out, had Lee kept going, the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> troops
might have been forced to withdraw.;    Two editions of his game on
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, "Terrible Swift Sword," have been strong sellers, and one was
voted Best Game of the Year by the game industry.;    "More than 50,000 people
have bought the games to see if they can do better than General <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>," <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>
says. "A third edition is in the works now.";    <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> began designing games as
a hobby when he was a high-school student at <LOCATION>Poly Prep</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Brooklyn.</LOCATION>;    As an
adult, he became a contributor to <ORGANIZATION>Strategy &amp; Tactics</ORGANIZATION>, a military and history
magazine now published by <ORGANIZATION>3W Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Cambria</LOCATION>. Each issue includes a complete
war game.;    "The magazine grew rapidly, and the games began to attract a
following. Eventually, I began designing board games for the general market.
'Terrible Swift Sword' was my second board game.";    Inventing games was his
avocation, he says, until a few years ago when the pressure stemming from his
job as a criminal defense lawyer began to get to him: "It wasn't exactly
burnout, but something close to it.;    "On the other hand, I was getting a
tremendous amount of satisfaction doing my games and I thought, well, maybe I
can make money doing what I want to do," he says.;    "I recall being somewhat
apprehensive about my colleagues' reaction to my announcement that I was
leaving the legal profession to become a game designer full time, but I
needn't have worried. When I made the announcement, they all wanted to join
me.";     First comes the map;    However, <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> says he made the change
slowly, a step at a time. He resigned from his job, did a lot of research, and
founded a company, <ORGANIZATION>Simulation Design</ORGANIZATION>, with a partner, <PERSON>Thaddeus Kubits</PERSON>, a
former client.;    <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> set up an office in his <LOCATION>Scarsdale</LOCATION> home and began
producing his games. He says the first step in designing a game is to do the
board.;    "After the research, which I enjoy thoroughly, I draw the maps.
Then I write the rules," he says. "The basic rules are the same. But before I
had a computer, I used to do them on the typewriter and they took forever.
With the computer, I can move them around with ease.";    A well-designed
game, he says, plays fair and square with the players.;    "It should allow
the players to see the alternatives before they make a move. Some games last
longer than others. Some can be played in two hours, others are good for an
entire weekend.";    <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>, who ranks himself as an ardent Civil War buff who
is familiar with every regiment Lee had in battle, also designs games on other
subjects, such as his "Lord of the Rings" games and sports games.;    "Almost
any event lends itself to a game," he says. "I've designed crisis-management
games, and now we're working on one that is a reflection of the times.
Business is the theme, and each player is out of work and trying to get
another job.";    <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>, who uses the services of free-lance professionals,
says his biggest expense was for printing the board games.;    "Our printing
costs are phenomenal," he says. "We shopped around and looked at plants
overseas that do the work much cheaper. But we found quality control in the
<LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> to be somewhat haphazard, primarily because of language differences.
The slightest alteration in the wording of the rules, for instance, blows the
whole game. So we now print at a plant in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, where our main distributor
is located.";    The games, which retail in the <MONEY>$35</MONEY> to <MONEY>$50</MONEY> range, are
distributed to hobby shops.;    "It's a peak and valley business. <DATE>October</DATE> to
<DATE>December</DATE> are busy months, then we fall off until late <DATE>February</DATE>, when the large
hobby shows are held. But you can make money as a games publisher if you have
a good reputation and a fairly good inventory. I'm inclined to think games are
pretty recession-proof because when people have less money to spend on
entertainment they'll be home more often and perhaps they play more games. The
biggest game moneymaker of all time, Monopoly, was invented during the Great
Depression.";    What makes a good game?;    "A good game is different every
time you play it. I give players many choices. And they are choices of the
damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't variety. I like to build chaos and
random events into the game; it makes it more interesting.";    <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> says he
gets fan mail and an occasional irate letter from game players.;    "People
who play games are very passionate about them," he says.;    <PERSON>Berg</PERSON>, who also is
a frequent lecturer at schools and historic societies, says games are much
under-used as a teaching tool.;    "Games are a marvelous way to get kids
interested in history. It helps them understand why and how events occurred."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Acid Rain Is Winning the Modern Battle of Gettysburg</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The North and South both are losing the
modern-day Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   The monuments that make the rolling hills one of the world's
largest outdoor museums are melting. Every time rain drips from the
marble and bronze memorials, acid slowly but steadily washes away
pieces of history.
   ``The marble ones are definitely on their way to destruction,''
said <PERSON>David Ballard</PERSON>, maintenance director at <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National
Military Park</ORGANIZATION>. ``You can wax bronze, but there isn't a ... lot you
can do about marble. The marble's just going to keep on fizzing
away.''
   Only granite markers and monument bases seem immune. Across the
sprawling battlefield, the effects of acid rain are obvious to even
a casual observer. Brass plaques are stained and streaked with
corrosion in shades of black, gray, green and white. Marble markers
are badly pitted and misshapen.
   On <ORGANIZATION>Cemetery Ridge</ORGANIZATION>, the high ground that <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> forces held on the
decisive third day of the <DATE>1863</DATE> Civil War battle, <PERSON>Ballard</PERSON> gestured
helplessly toward an octagonal marble marker. Inscriptions had been
chiseled on all eight sides, but only a stray letter or two remain
visibile.
   ``Whatever the heck was here, it's gone now. It's history,'' he
said.
   A short hike away, in the cemetery where <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>
delivered the <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION> is the first monument erected
here. The Soldiers' <ORGANIZATION>National Monument</ORGANIZATION>, whose dedication took up
much of the front page of <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>July 2, 1869</DATE>, is
``probably the most endangered piece we have in the park right
now,'' <PERSON>Ballard</PERSON> said.
   The monument features a woman representing liberty atop a
classical column, which rests on a pedestal. At the four corners of
the pedestal, sculpted marble figures represent War, History, Peace
and Plenty. Damage from acid particles in rain isn't apparent at
first because of the stark beauty of the work viewed as a whole. A
closer look reveals a missing toe here, a washed-out detail there.
   Ballard likened the damage to a melting ice cube, which retains
its general appearance for a while, then collapses because it loses
structural shape.
   Fighting the acidic effects of airborne pollution, according to
a draft <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> report, is a losing battle:
   ``Only memories last forever. In time, metal corrodes and stone
crumbles. What worries park managers at <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National
Military Park</ORGANIZATION> is the speed with which our monuments to those
honored dead are disappearing.''
   Complicating <PERSON>Ballard</PERSON>'s mission are two facts he can't control.
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, according to the state <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Club</ORGANIZATION> and Pennsylvanians
for Acid Rain Control, receives the most acidic rainfall in the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and is one of the top three sources of sulfur
dioxide. Environmentalists contend sulfur dioxide from coal-fired
power plants is a major cause of acid rain.
   Another constraint <ORGANIZATION>Ballard</ORGANIZATION> faces is limited government funding,
both to deal with acid rain and maintain <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>'s monuments.
   Asked if his crews could protect the 1,300 monuments and major
markers, he replied, ``Not given the current state of funding in
the park service. It would take a crew of a dozen people, perhaps,
working year round.'' Payroll costs alone would total <MONEY>$300,000</MONEY>, he
said.
   Park workers do what they can. Corrosion is removed from bronze
with a pressurized stream of pulverized walnut shells the
consistency of pepper; then it is coated with a protective wax. To
be effective, the coating should be done every year, but funds and
manpower dictate less frequent treatments here.
   The work isn't cheap. Simply erecting scaffolding to repair
acid-rain damage to the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Monument, the largest in the
park, cost <MONEY>$8,000</MONEY>. It cost <MONEY>$2,900</MONEY> total to clean and wax a smaller
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> monument.
   Environmentalists say the problem can be resolved by requiring
industries to install equipment to reduce and control emissions.
   ``We have the technological means,'' the Canadian Coalition on
Acid Rain said recently. ``We know what we have to do to clean our
air and we know how to do it ... We've studied enough, we've
gathered tons of scientific evidence and we've talked until we're
blue in the face.''
   At recent conference, <PERSON>A. Joseph Dowd</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>American Electric
Power Service Corp.</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> shouldn't require industries to
spend billions on pollution control devices ``unless it is quite
clear that the resulting environmental benefits in the <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION>
and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> will exceed the cost.''
   <PERSON>Ballard</PERSON> has steered clear of the political battle over acid
rain, but says something must be done before long or major
monuments will be beyond repair. ``It's a real problem, and the
current solutions just aren't good enough.''

said <PERSON>John F. Peterson</PERSON> of the park service's computer division in <LOCATION>Washington.</LOCATION>; 
  "It won't prove that your great-grandfather fought at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, for

that that regiment fought at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>," <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said.;    Knowing the

provide brief information on the 7,000 Civil War regiments and units, and
information on many of the 10,500 battles, skirmishes and engagements, he
said.;    "We're also going to be able to track where Civil War soldiers are
buried at our 11 Civil War cemeteries within the park system," <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said.;
   Computers are to be installed at all 28 Civil War sites that the <ORGANIZATION>National

million people visit the sites each year. <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said the most frequently

the question, park historians now must research pension and service records,
state rosters, census and war records, and county histories.;    Visitors will
be given information on other sources of information, and they'll be

the <ORGANIZATION>Federation of Geneological Societies</ORGANIZATION> intend to enter the names on

   Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON>Dimitri Yazov</PERSON>, making
his first visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, is meeting with President
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and touring the Civil War battlefield at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION>.
   <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON>Yazov</PERSON>'s trip today to the battlefield
where Union troops turned back Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s Confederate
soldiers in a key, bloody battle was prompted by his interest in
the war between the states.
   Yazov met <DATE>Monday</DATE> for more than four hours with <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary
<PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>, officials said.
   A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the talks as ``relaxed, candid, generally non-polemical,
informative.'' The goal of the talks, the official said, were to
``improve understanding between the two sides,'' as well as
``enhance stability and predictability.''
   The main topics of discussion were ``how national security and
defense decisions are made in the two countries,'' as well as
military strategies, defense spending, regional conflicts and arms
control negotiations, the official said.
   Specifically, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials sought information about the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION>'s promise to make unilateral troop reductions and to cut the
defense budget by <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT>.
   ``The Soviets gave us some details. ... You always learn
something new,'' the official said, but he declined to provide
details.
   Asked if <PERSON>Cheney</PERSON> and his advisers were confident about Soviet
pledges to scale back defense spending, the official said, ``We'll
have to see.''
   Yazov's visit grew out an invitation extended by former <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Frank Carlucci</PERSON> when the two met in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> near the end of
the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration.
   In addition to meeting with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and visiting <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Yazov</PERSON>
also was to speak today at the <ORGANIZATION>National Defense University</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fort
Myer</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Yazov</PERSON> will visit <PERSON>Camp Pendleton</PERSON>, a Marine training
base in <LOCATION>Southern California</LOCATION>. He'll visit <ORGANIZATION>Luke Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, then fly to <LOCATION>Fort Bragg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, on <DATE>Friday</DATE>. Later

   The roads and hillsides winding through
<ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION> are to be softly lit <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>
with 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or
missing after the Civil War's bloodiest battle.
   ``It's a memorial and <DATE>Christmas</DATE> is the season of lights. We just
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' <PERSON>Richard
Rambur</PERSON>, battlefield superintendent, said <DATE>Friday</DATE>. ``Everybody talks
about 23,000, but not very many people really have an idea of how
many that is.''
   Up to 5,000 automobilies are expected to join a 4.5-mile tour of
the battlefield near <LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>, about 70 miles west of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>.
Candles glowing inside lunch-sized paper bags filled with sand will
outline the roadways and others will dot the snow-covered
3,200-acre battleground.
   More men were killed or wounded at <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 17, 1862</DATE>,
than on any other single day of the Civil War. Union losses were
12,410 and Confederate losses totaled 10,700. It was the single
bloodiest day of American military history.
   ``You're really going to get an impression of what kind of
impact that was,'' <PERSON>Rambur</PERSON> said. ``When they drive through here,
they're going to feel something, I'm sure.''
   In addition to the bags of lighted candles, choirs will be
singing at various spots in the battlefield, including the <ORGANIZATION>Dunker
Church</ORGANIZATION>, the focal point of repeated clashes as both armies sought
to occupy and control high ground at the site.
   A Civil War-era encampment, complete with uniformed re-enactors,
recaptures the atmosphere of a wintertime camp 127 years ago. The
soldiers will gather at <ORGANIZATION>Bloody Lane</ORGANIZATION>, a sunken road near the center
of the battlefield where four hours of fighting left more than
5,000 dead or injured.
   Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of
<LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>, but the conflict climaxed the first of Confederate
general <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>'s two attempts to carry the war into the
North. The battle also gave President <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> an
opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all
slaves in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1863</DATE>.
   An estimated 500 volunteers from church and civic groups,
historical organizations, scouting troops and area businesses have
assembled the lights, said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> County Tourism Director <PERSON>Bob
O'Connor</PERSON>. The battlefield was divided into 23 grids and groups
assigned to each section are responsible for arranging and lighting
1,000 candles and retrieving them after the five-hour display.
   All 23,110 tapers will be lit in the 30 minutes between dusk and
dark, <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said. ``We don't know of any (battlefield) where
this has been done to this magnitude,'' he said.
   Rambur said organizers are encouraging volunteers to maintain a
somber attitude while lighting the candles.
   ``This is a memorial and we're trying to stress that. We do not
want <LOCATION>Santa Clauses</LOCATION> and that kind of thing,'' <PERSON>Rambur</PERSON> said. ``If we
learn anything from the battlefields, it is that there just has to
be another answer to war.''

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foundation is donating more than 100,000
acres of park land, wildlife refuges and historical property,
including a site from the battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, in one of the
largest gifts of land to the federal government.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Richard King Mellon Foundation of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION> purchased the
properties during the last 1{ years through the Conservation Fund,
which promotes land and water conservation, according to
Conservation Fund senior associate <PERSON>Jack Lynn</PERSON>.
   The foundation, one of the nation's 15 richest, paid <MONEY>$666,000</MONEY>
for 266 acres that include <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>East Cavalry Field</LOCATION>, a site
in the <DATE>1863</DATE> battle. The foundation will give the site to the
<ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> as an addition to <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National Military
Park</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Tom Wilson</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that no gift of
land he can recall ``comes close to the magnitude of this kind of
gift. If it is not the biggest, it is one of the biggest.''
   ``I would describe it as a tremendous gift to the people of
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, and indeed to the international visitors who come to our
national parks,'' said <PERSON>James Ridenour</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   The gift includes 280 acres of farmland near <LOCATION>Sharpsburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>,
that will be added to the <ORGANIZATION>Antietam National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION>, site of
the <DATE>1862</DATE> Civil War battle that resulted in more than 20,000
casualties in a single day.
   <PERSON>Ridenour</PERSON> said he considers the preservation of the Civil War
sites especially important because of a ``fever pitch'' of public
interest in the battlefields.
   The largest piece of land is a 93,000-acre tract in coastal
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> near the Alligator River. The property will be known
as the <ORGANIZATION>Pocosin National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> and was purchased for <MONEY>$8.8
million</MONEY> at a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ORGANIZATION> auction.
   ``The casual observer would call it swampy and brackish,''
<PERSON>William Hartwig</PERSON>, realty chief for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service</ORGANIZATION>, said of the site. Conservationists hope to reintroduce the
endangered red wolf on the property, which is rich in waterfowl.
   The total gift comprises 102,714 acres and is worth more than
<MONEY>$21 million</MONEY>, the foundation said. Seven of the 10 purchases are in
the densely populated <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> states of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   Two are in the West, and the other is in <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>.
   The foundation on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> will deliver deeds for the tracts to
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Interior Secretary <PERSON>Manuel Lujan</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection
Agency</ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON>William Reilly</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lynn</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Jack Lorenz</PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Izaak Walton League</ORGANIZATION>, a
national conservation group, called the donation ``a super
initiative.''
   ``It makes you want to genuflect,'' <PERSON>Lorenz</PERSON> said. ``It's a classy
way to start off the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> decade, the '90s.''
   The other properties are:
   _130 acres near <LOCATION>Manteo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION>, to be added to the <ORGANIZATION>MacKay Island
National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION>. Cost: <MONEY>$1 million</MONEY>.
   _The 5,556-acre Forked Lightning Ranch near <LOCATION>Pecos</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.M.</LOCATION>,
containing more than 100 archaeological sites. Cost: <MONEY>$4.5 million</MONEY>.
The foundation wants the ranch to become a new historical park.
   _Two tracts totaling 1,287 acres in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Mason</PERSON>
counties, bordering <LOCATION>Shenandoah National Park</LOCATION>. Cost: <MONEY>$950,000</MONEY>.
   _A 930-acre farm in <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, purchased as an addition to
the <ORGANIZATION>Petersburg National Battlefield</ORGANIZATION>. Cost: <MONEY>$930,000</MONEY>.
   _135 acres near <LOCATION>Spotsylvania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, to be added to the
<ORGANIZATION>Spotsylvania Memorial National Military Park</ORGANIZATION>. Cost: <MONEY>$350,000</MONEY>.
   _Two tracts totaling 468 acres bordering the <ORGANIZATION>Rocky Mountain
National Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Estes Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colo</LOCATION>. The tracts were to have been
converted into a large housing development. Cost: <MONEY>$1.84 million</MONEY>
   _122 acres near <LOCATION>Kittery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, to be added to the <ORGANIZATION>Rachel Carson
National Wildlife Refuge</ORGANIZATION> at the state's southern tip. Cost:
<MONEY>$900,000</MONEY>.
   Banker and industrialist <PERSON>Richard King Mellon</PERSON> created the trust
in <DATE>1947</DATE>, and it since has given more than <MONEY>$150 million</MONEY> to
environmental causes.
   <ORGANIZATION>Seward Prosser Mellon</ORGANIZATION>, the foundation's president and <PERSON>Richard
Mellon</PERSON>'s son, said in a statement that the decline in federal land
purchases and the threats to wetlands show the importance of the
private sector's role in conservation.
   ``Our program will fill the gap whenever possible,'' <ORGANIZATION>Mellon</ORGANIZATION>
said. ``We feel that this program is an opportunity to say `thank
you' to the many outstanding people at the federal and state levels
who are engaged in land conservation and wildlife preservation and
for our foundation to help protect some of these important sites
during these times of tight budgets so that future generations may
enjoy the outdoors as we have.''

<HEAD>Civil War Interest Thrives, 125 Years After Appomattox</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gen. <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>'s troops chased
the Confederate government from <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, a slave named <PERSON>James
Wilder</PERSON> hid in a tobacco silo.
   ``He almost suffocated in that silo,'' recalls the slave's
grandson, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON>, recounting the story
passed down through his father.
   Instead, <PERSON>James Wilder</PERSON> emerged to find himself suddenly a free
man, and the city, which had been bombarded for months, wrapped in
flames.
   Grant rode on 95 miles to <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>, where Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>
surrendered the South's main army <DATE>seven days later</DATE> on <DATE>April 9,
1865</DATE>, and <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> went on to beget the father of the nation's first
black elected governor.
   Though 125 years have passed since the end of the Civil War, it
still is ingrained in the consciences of many Southern natives.
   Stories about the war are reaching more people than ever through
a growing number of battle re-enactments, battlefield tours, books
and specialty magazines, and through the celebrated movie
``Glory,'' about the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>'s first black regiment.
   ``There are so many events being re-enacted that we can't keep
track of them,'' said <PERSON>David Roth</PERSON>, editor of Blue and Gray, a
magazine with the motto ``For Those Who Still Hear The Guns.''
   The regional and racial divisions exacerbated by the ``War of
Northern Aggression,'' the term still used by some southerners, are
beginning to close, and the symbols of the Old South are becoming
more anachronistic.
   Trucks with Confederate flags on the rear windows and bumper
stickers reading ``Forget, Hell!'' and ``The South Will Rise
Again'' are becoming endangered species, but the ironies of the
South in transition still pervade <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, the capital of the
Confederacy.
   Residents celebrate the birthdays of Lee, Gen. <PERSON>Stonewall Jackson</PERSON>
and <PERSON>Martin Luther King Jr.</PERSON> on the same day.
   <PERSON>Mary Sue Terry</PERSON>, the state's first female attorney general, is
fighting a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> lawsuit seeking to force
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia Military Institute</ORGANIZATION> to admit women. VMI cadets fought to
secede from the federal government, and many of the southern
generals were graduates.
   One of only two buildings in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>'s commercial district that
survived <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>'s 10-month siege is a granite structure that housed
offices of the Confederate government. Occupying the building now
is the federal court, the institution that helped rid the South of
segregation.
   Across the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Bridge</ORGANIZATION> and a block to the left are
the Museum of the Confederacy and the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate White House</ORGANIZATION>, now
surrounded by high-rise university buildings.
   The museum's sign-in sheet is replete with the names of visitors
from cities to the north, as well as <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   Attendance never has been better, spokeswoman <PERSON>Barbara Hyde</PERSON> said.
   ``There always has been a high interest in the Civil War, but in
the past four years, it has increased tremendously,'' she said.
   On <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>'s Monument Avenue, two black women and a white man
who attend a karate class nearby practice their moves at the base
of a towering statue of Lee on horseback.
   In between kick punches, <PERSON>Carrie Britton</PERSON> relates how she cried
when she saw the movie ``Glory'' and only then learned there were
black soldiers who died fighting for the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>. ``There was a white
woman who made a point of holding the door for me when I was
leaving the theater,'' <PERSON>Ms. Britton</PERSON> said. ``She was touched, too.''
   The provocation for the Civil War was at first largely the
labor-intensive South's objection to tariffs favored by the
industrialized North, although the issue of slavery bitterly
divided the regions. Only later did the focus shift to the
constitutional issues of secession and the abolition of slavery.
   Those issues led to the poignant human drama of brother fighting
brother, father fighting son and friend fighting friend,
particularly in border states.
   The cost of the war was tremendous. More than 600,000 Union and
Confederate soldiers died over the four-year period, nearly
equaling the number of Americans killed in all other wars combined.
   Because of the high number of casualties, almost everyone who
had forebears in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in <DATE>1861</DATE> can associate with the war, said
<PERSON>Ed Bearss</PERSON>, chief historian of the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Charles Bryan</PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Historical Society</ORGANIZATION>, said
he and other Civil War scholars on the lecture circuit are being
asked to explain why people continue to be fascinated by the
struggle 125 years later.
   To answer, he pulls a cone-shaped rifle bullet from his pocket,
a <LOCATION>Minie</LOCATION> ball recovered at a battlefield outside <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> that's now
a residential development.
   ``A young boy brought it to the Historical Society,'' <PERSON>Bryan</PERSON>
said. ``One of the reasons the war is so fascinating is that it
happened in our own backyard, both literally and figuratively.''
   The war destroyed the economic and social system of the South.
The 12 years of Reconstruction that followed, a period in which the
11 secessionist states were regarded as conquered territories,
solidified the region's antagonism toward the North.
   ``I don't think there would have been a solid South had there
not been what southerners saw as a harsh Reconstruction,'' <PERSON>Bearss</PERSON>
said.
   ``The feelings were so visceral that it went past just
disagreement on political ideologues,'' <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> said. ``Rather, it
was almost a lifestyle to be different. The only thing that can
change that is the passage of time.''
   An increasingly mobile society and the commonality of mass
communications also are softening the divisions, <PERSON>Bryan</PERSON> said.
   ``Little by little, the separate identities of the <LOCATION>North and
South</LOCATION> are beginning to change,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Bryan</PERSON> said the lingering prejudices became apparent to him when
the topic of a speech he gave on the commemoration of Lee's
birthday _ the 18 native Virginians who served as generals in the
<LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> army _ was publicized in advance.
   ``I got angry phone calls from people who said, `How dare you
talk about Yankee generals on General <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s birthday?' '' he said.
``The Civil War still lives in the minds of many people. It will
never be forgotten.''

   Chief Justice <PERSON>William Rehnquist</PERSON> joined
more than 2,000 people who gathered <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to mark the 125th
anniversary of President <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> Address
honoring the men who fought here in the Civil War.
   Rehnquist noted that although <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION>'s speech endures, it was
not the focus of the <DATE>Nov. 19, 1863</DATE>, dedication of part of the
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> battlefield as a national cemetery.
   ``<PERSON>Edward Everett</PERSON>, the nationally known orator, was the featured
speaker, and spoke for nearly two hours,'' <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON> said. ``Lincoln
was invited only to make a few remarks. Yet <PERSON>Everett</PERSON>'s oration is
forgotten, but <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>'s remarks will live forever.''
   People in period dress lined the streets near the town's train
depot, awaiting the arrival of a man portraying <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and his
entourage on the <LOCATION>Stroudsburg</LOCATION> Railroad.
   As the dignitaries climbed off the train more than 2,000 people
dressed as Civil War troops and townspeople of the era kicked off
the celebration, making a parade to the <ORGANIZATION>National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> where
Lincoln gave the famed speech.
   State police estimated more than 5,000 spectators huddled in the
freezing rain to hear <PERSON>James A. Getty</PERSON>, portraying Lincoln, repeat the
270-word speech that begins, ``Four score and seven years ago ....''
   ``You knew he was an actor, but it was still thrilling,'' said
<LOCATION>Sunbury</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Jean Marquette</PERSON>, who was not bothered by the bad
weather. ``I got goose bumps.''
   Rehnquist spoke of Lincoln as a great statesman and masterful
speech writer.
   ``From contemporary descriptions of <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>, he was not what one
would think of as a great speaker,'' <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON> said. ``His voice was
high-pitched, and his tall, lanky appearance gave an impression of
awkwardness. But <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> was a master of the English
language.
   ``He was not just articulate; he was able to convey ideas in
simple terms, and yet with force and sometimes passion,'' <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON>
said.

<TEXT>
   More than a century after <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and
Confederate soldiers spilled blood over stretches of land from
<LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, a group is battling developers for the
real estate.
   The Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites was
organized last <DATE>summer</DATE> to buy land or development rights of
battlefields unprotected by the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> or other
organizations.
   ``All of us have watched over the past couple of years as a
tremendous amount of historic ground has disappeared,'' said <PERSON>Gary
W. Gallagher</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Penn State University</ORGANIZATION> history professor who is
president of the organization.
   ``If something isn't done in the next five years, it'll be too
late,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said the organization has 500 members and has raised
more than <MONEY>$10,000</MONEY>. The organization received tax-exempt status last
month and plans to begin soliciting members this <DATE>spring</DATE>, he said.
   Urban sprawl from the Civil War capitals of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, has engulfed many battlefields and threatens others.
   A large mall has been planned for an important part of the
<LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION> battlefield in <LOCATION>northern Virginia</LOCATION>, where the second battle
of Bull Run was fought.
   <PERSON>Annie Snyder</PERSON>, who lives on a 180-acre farm adjacent to the
battlefield, earlier this year organized a group called Save <ORGANIZATION>The
Battlefield Coalition</ORGANIZATION> to fight the mall.
   Also, five parcels of land on the <LOCATION>Cedar Creek</LOCATION> battlefield, near
<LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, are for sale.
   ``One of the <ORGANIZATION>Cedar Creek</ORGANIZATION> sites has already been targeted as a
light industrial park, and it will be a light industrial park
unless someone buys that ground before the end of the year,'' he
said.
   Many of the former battlefields are farm or pasture land.
Encroaching development has raised real estate prices and taxes,
according to <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON>.
   ``It's difficult to go to a land owner who hasn't been able to
make it as a farmer and has just been offered <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY> for his
land. How do you convince that person not to take the <MONEY>$2 million</MONEY>
and run?'' he said.
   <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said the formation of the group was prompted last
<DATE>summer</DATE> by a developers who slipped bulldozers onto northern
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Chantilly Battlefield</LOCATION> in the middle of the <TIME>night</TIME>.
   Initially, the developers had agreed to delay any excavation
until historical surveying could be conducted, according to
<PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON>. Only five acres were preserved to commemorate the
battle, he said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> owns and maintains several Civil War
battlefields, including sites in <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Monassas</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>, Appomatox and <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>.
   Many others remain unprotected, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said.
   Among them are sites in the <LOCATION>Shenandoah Valley</LOCATION>, where Confederate
General <PERSON>Stonewall Jackson</PERSON> staged his <DATE>1862</DATE> campaign, and at <LOCATION>Brandy
Station</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>north-central Virginia</LOCATION>, the site of the largest cavalry
battle in the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Gallagher</PERSON> said the organization plans to buy land or development
rights and turn the property over to historical societies or
government organizations to manage.
   ``We're not talking about buying thousands and thousands of
acres. We know some growth is inevitable. We just think there has
to be some balance between growth and preserving a part of our
past,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Approves Boundaries For Gettysburg National Military Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> approved legislation <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that
establishes boundaries for the <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National Military Park</ORGANIZATION>,
where President Lincoln delivered his historic address and the
<ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and Confederate armies fought a key battle of the Civil War.
   By voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> adopted the bill that allows the
<ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> to acquire land and interests in land within
the established boundaries by purchase, donation, exchange or other
means.
   The park, which was transferred from the War Department to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1933</DATE>, includes approximately 3,900 acres
of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> land, including about 3,700 that are owned by the
federal government.
   The bill also establishes an 11-member advisory commission to
join with local jurisdictions in managing the park and the
<ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District</ORGANIZATION>.
   The measure also calls on the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> to take steps
that encourage conservation of the park.
   The <ORGANIZATION>House Interior Committee</ORGANIZATION> said the bill will result in only a
minimal increase in federal spending. It did not provide specifics.

Federalist Sgt. <PERSON>Steve Mata</PERSON> leaned on a porch rail at the <ORGANIZATION>Drum Barracks</ORGANIZATION> in 
<LOCATION>Wilmington</LOCATION> and puffed slowly on his long-stemmed clay pipe, his 1816 
cap-and-ball rifle by his side. Though he was wearing long underwear, a blue 
wool uniform and 20-pound backpack in the morning sun, <PERSON>Mata</PERSON> said he felt pretty 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mata, 26, and several of his army buddies from the 55th Ohio Volunteer 
Infantry (OVI) were prepared for battle <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, they came to the Fourth of 
<DATE>July</DATE> picnic to talk about the Civil War, not to re-enact it. 
</P>
<P>
They were on hand to mingle with visitors to the Civil War museum, a former 
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> post built in <DATE>1861</DATE>, and to answer questions about that period of U.S 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Mata and his unit participate in mock battles staged by Civil War buffs around 
the country, but <PERSON>Mata</PERSON> said: "I really enjoy telling people about it now instead 
of fighting the battles." 
</P>
<P>
Mata has been involved in Civil War reenactments since <DATE>1976</DATE>, when he and his 
parents went to see a mock battle staged at Ft. <ORGANIZATION>Tejon State Historic Park</ORGANIZATION> near 
<PERSON>Gorman</PERSON>. Mata said he has been hooked ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Something inside of me just clicked and I knew that it was for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mata became such an avid Civil War buff, he says, that he often got kicked out 
his high school history class for arguing with his teachers about facts of the 
war. Several years ago he formed his own brigade, the 55th OVI, named in honor 
of relatives who fought in the war.

"I was really disgusted with the way my high school teachers skimmed that 
period. I mean, the slave trade issue alone between <DATE>1840</DATE> and <DATE>1870</DATE> is worth a 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a guest speaker, "I get to go to schools and talk all I want about it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also gets to fight the war all he wants. A welder by trade, the <ORGANIZATION>Torrance</ORGANIZATION> 
resident has fought in more than 200 mock battles since he started playing 
soldier -- more battles than there actually were during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in every major battle there was," <PERSON>Mata</PERSON> said. "I've been in the 
battle of Bull Run, <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Shylock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tenn.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Antietam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, and a lot that 
didn't even exist." Some have involved more than 16,000 participants and lasted 
more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although the battles are mock, some of <ORGANIZATION>Mata</ORGANIZATION>'s injuries are painfully real. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago he fought in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and caught Lyme disease from a tick, which 
hospitalized him for a week. A year ago, a wooden spike cut through his leg, 
just below the knee, during the filming of a Civil War battle in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. 
The injury required surgery, but <ORGANIZATION>Mata</ORGANIZATION> has no permanent damage from it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the price of fame, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those hazards, Mata plans to fight again at Ft. Tejon this month, and 
he is especially excited about a mock battle planned in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> in <DATE>September</DATE>. 
More than 6,000 Civil War buffs are expected to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always up for a big fight," <PERSON>Mata</PERSON> said. Louis Aguilar

   A <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> national parks subcommittee announced
today a hearing on what has become known as the ``Third Battle of
<LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION>,'' the fight by preservationists to prevent construction
of a shopping mall adjacent to a Civil War battlefield in northern
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Senate Energy and Natural Resources</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests will meet <DATE>Sept. 8</DATE> to consider
legislation which the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> passed 307-98 on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to buy the
542-acre mall site next to the battlefield where the Confederacy
won two major battles in <DATE>1861</DATE> and <DATE>1862</DATE>.
   Historians and preservationists say a shopping mall would
desecrate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died on the
battlefield. The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill would add the land to the existing
battlefield park.
   Sen. <PERSON>John W. Warner</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Va.</LOCATION>, said that after testimony is taken
at the hearing, he may offer legislation to buy only a part of the
developer's tract.
   ``My concern continues to be that the federal government could
spend a significant amount of the taxpayers' money for a parcel of
land, which during the debates in <DATE>1980</DATE>, was not regarded as
historically significant for the Park expansion bill,'' said <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> prevents development on this site and purchases
the property, at considerable expense to the federal taxpayer and
the mall is moved to a nearby site and built, is that expenditure
of federal funds justified in order to protect property which has
some historical significance?'' he asked.
   <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said he believes the tract's <PERSON>Stuart</PERSON>'s Hill where
Confederate Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON> had headquaters during the Second
Battle of <LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION> in <DATE>1862</DATE> should be considered for inclusion in
the <LOCATION>Manassas National Battlefield Park</LOCATION>.
   The <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration opposes the measure because of its
cost _ estimated to range from <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>. <ORGANIZATION>Office
of Management and Budget and Interior Department</ORGANIZATION> officials have
said they would recommend that President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> veto the measure if
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> enacts it in its current form.
   One of the major floor debates was the cost versus the
preservation of American heritage.
   Rep. <PERSON>Stan Parris</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Va.</LOCATION>, said important pieces of property
representing <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s heritage must be preserved.
   ``Our country and our culture are built upon our heritage,'' he
said. ``Our past is an important part of our present, and our
future.''
   However, when the matter came to a vote, <PERSON>Parris</PERSON> voted
``present'' because the developer, <PERSON>John T. Hazel</PERSON>, has been a close
friend and campaign contributor to him for many years.
   Rep. <PERSON>Bill Frenzel</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Minn.</LOCATION>, called the measure ``a squandering
of the taxpayers' money. This should have a low priority or no
priority.''
   Rep. <PERSON>Barney Frank</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Mass.</LOCATION>, also opposed the measure, saying:
``This is an extraordinary expenditure when we deny the needy.''
   But Rep. <PERSON>Bruce V. Vento</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Minn.</LOCATION>, floor manager for the bill,
said, ``This is about history, about our cultural history that must
be preserved.
   ``It's a matter of whether we preserve our history or turn it
into a dollar,'' he said.
   Hazel purchased the land two years ago for under <MONEY>$10 million</MONEY>. It
is now assessed at <MONEY>$13.6 million</MONEY>. He wants to build 1.2 million
square feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes next to the site of the two major Civil War
battles.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. <PERSON>Robert E. Lee</PERSON>
commanded Southern troops in the <ORGANIZATION>Second Battle</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION>.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The <ORGANIZATION>First Battle of Manassas</ORGANIZATION>, fought in <DATE>July 1861</DATE>, was the first
significant land battle of the Civil War. A surprising Confederate
victory there convinced Union authorities that the war would be a
protracted affair.
   More than 20,000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the
<ORGANIZATION>Second Battle of Manassas</ORGANIZATION>, which lasted over three days in <DATE>August
1862</DATE>. Most historians agree that <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s triumph in that battle
represented the <LOCATION>Confederacy</LOCATION>'s greatest victory in the war.

<HEAD>Park Service Targets Removal of Controversial Tower at Gettysburg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> officials are
pursuing a plan to buy and remove a 370-foot-high observation tower
that has overlooked the Civil War battlefield here for 15 years.
   ``My opinion is that the tower dominates the skyline at
<LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> and it's totally out of keeping with what we're trying
to accomplish here in preserving the battlefield,'' <PERSON>John Earnst</PERSON>,
<ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg National Military Park</ORGANIZATION> superintendent, said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>.
   The preliminary proposal is part of a study ordered by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>
to determine permanent boundaries for the park, site of the <DATE>1863</DATE>
Union victory and President <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'s legendary address.
   The proposal, outlined at a meeting <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, has yet to be
reviewed by <ORGANIZATION>Park Service</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and would require
congressional approval, <PERSON>Earnst</PERSON> said.
   The steel tower, built in <DATE>1973</DATE> on private land separating parts
of the park, was the focus of controversy over preserving the park
area's historical integrity.
   When the tower was built, then-Gov. <PERSON>Milton Shapp</PERSON> brought an
unsuccessful lawsuit against attorney <PERSON>Thomas Ottenstein</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, who came up with the idea for the tower and is a
co-owner.
   Ottenstein, reached in <LOCATION>Delray Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION>, said he could not
comment about <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s meeting because he was unaware of it. The
tower's manager, <PERSON>Gertrude Paris</PERSON>, also declined to comment.
   ``I didn't know a thing until I read the paper,'' she said.
   <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ordered the study last year while passing legislation
to allow a group's donation of 30 acres to the park.
   The study has identified about 1,800 acres that should be added
to the 3,874-acre park, said planner <PERSON>Jonathan Doherty</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Park
Service</ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.

   North vs. South, in Your Living Room

<LP>
   By the time this appears the first installment of "The
Civil War" will have aired on PBS. Continuing tonight through
Thursday, this extraordinary series by filmmaker Ken Burns
brings the American Civil War to life as no history has ever
been brought to life on a screen, including the large one
called the movies. This may sound like a large claim but it
is an understatement itself compared with the critical praise
already-deservedly-heaped on these 11 hours. What hours. What
history. Diary excerpts, letters, paintings, lithographs,
3,000 photographs, contemporary footage (of the old
battlegrounds), music and narrative all were fused to produce
a whole of the most remarkable immediacy.
   The bitterness and gallantry and slaughter pour out in
unhurried detail. The war is in the living room. Here are the
armies, the generals, the music, the food, the battle of the
ironclad ships Monitor and Merrimack, the battle of Shiloh,
where 2,400 died, Cold Harbor, where 7,000 men perished in 20
minutes, and Antietam. Also, the South's madly heroic Nathan
Bedford Forrest, who wheeled his horse around and charged
directly at a mob of Union troops in hot pursuit, ultimately
yanking one up on his horse for use as a shield. Here are
Grant and his friend Sherman, and the president actually
shown (via photographs) leaving the field after the speech at
Gettysburg. The sense of actuality produced by Mr. Burns's
camera and his still photos grows, so that by the time we
come to the Gettysburg Address (read by Sam Waterston) it is
hard to remember that this is not the real Lincoln, whom we
have after all just seen walk through the crowd after an
address he considered a dismal failure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It helps, of course, that history here is reported largely
in <DATE>19th-century</DATE> prose culled from diaries and letters of
enormous eloquence. This was not a tongue-tied age. It is
impossible to forget the words of Maj. <PERSON>Sullivan Ballou</PERSON> of the
<ORGANIZATION>Second Rhode Island Volunteers</ORGANIZATION>, who sent a letter to his wife
just a few weeks before his death at the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of Bull Run</ORGANIZATION>.
   The major wrote of his certainty that American
civilization depended on the triumph of the government. "I am
willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this
life to help preserve this government . . . My love for you
is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables. And yet
my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears
me with all those chains to the battlefield . . . If I do not
return, dear <PERSON>Sarah</PERSON>, never forget how much I loved you . . . I
shall always be with you in the brightest day and the darkest
night -- always, always."
   Here also are the letters written by former slaves, and
<PERSON>Frederick Douglass</PERSON>, played by <PERSON>Morgan Freeman</PERSON>. <PERSON>Mr. Burns</PERSON>
ranged far and wide to assemble his cast of voices, which
include <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON> as <PERSON>William Tecumseh Sherman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Studs
Terkel</PERSON> in the role of Gen. <PERSON>Benjamin Butler</PERSON>. Then there's <PERSON>Jody
Powell</PERSON>. It's hard to absorb the notion of <PERSON>Jody as Stonewall
Jackson</PERSON>, whom a contemporary describes as a "pious blue-eyed
killer" who sucked constantly on lemons and was utterly
untroubled by the likelihood of death.
   Never before had so many aspects of war found so many
chroniclers among a citizenry. Even the decisive moment
spelling the end has its witness, a fellow worshipper who
recorded the sudden ashen look of Confederacy President
<PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON> as he read a hopeless note from <PERSON>Gen. Lee</PERSON>,
slipped into his hand during services. In 11 hours layered,
however delicately, with almost nothing but vignettes of the
rawest emotional force -- <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s last hours with his weary
troops, the surrender at <LOCATION>Appomattox</LOCATION>, the salute of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION>
troops as Lee departs -- these are the events most likely to
threaten a viewer's composure. Many elements prepare the way
for that effect, among them old patriotic tunes that lose no
character for all that they are turned into a dirge. A lot of
people this week are going to find themselves singing, "The
Union forever, hurrah boys hurrah]" and similar lyrics not
heard in shower stalls for some time. Mississippi author and
Civil War historian <PERSON>Shelby Foote</PERSON>, a vivid presence throughout
this series, will win new fans. It took the 37-year-old <PERSON>Mr.
Burns</PERSON>, a documentary filmmaker (whose previous subjects were
Huey Long and the <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> Bridge), five years to accomplish
this work, whose equal we are not likely to see soon again.
   ---
   In another part of the forest, we have <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s new series,
"American Dreamer," from "Family Ties" creator <PERSON>Gary David
Goldberg</PERSON>, who appears to be in some other business instead of
comedy this season. Some business with a lot of contemporary
relationship-babble on its mind. Like a lot of new shows,
this one also has its quotient of physiological jokes,
grunts, people guzzling and slobbering water and looking
repellent -- all the wild, wonderful wit in short that our TV
writers have decided the world is yearning for. In addition
to this problem, there is the lead, <PERSON>Robert Urich</PERSON>, an actor
born to spew earnestness if ever there was one. Shouldn't it
occur to somebody -- the producers, say -- that an actor's
gift for comedy or lack of one is an issue to consider when
handing out lead roles in a sitcom? On the other hand, the
show has two bright spots. One is <PERSON>Carol Kane</PERSON> in the role of a
secretary, and the other is the splendidly mordant <PERSON>Jeffrey
Tambor</PERSON>. Both of them know what a comic line is, which is a
lot more than one can say of the writers.

<P>
On a <DATE>summer</DATE>'s eve nearly 127 years ago, a small band of Confederate soldiers 
sifted through a battle-scarred <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> churchyard, determined to give their 
slain comrades a proper burial. 
</P>
<P>
Working by the light of a fire, they quickly dug shallow graves and placed the 
dead in caskets crudely fashioned from eight-foot-long church pews, according 
to a firsthand account of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Recently a team of <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian</ORGANIZATION> researchers working at the site near <LOCATION>Brandy 
Station</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Culpeper County</LOCATION>, about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, unearthed 
one of the makeshift coffins, which contained a fairly complete skeleton of a 
rebel soldier buried in his boots. 
</P>
<P>
The coffin also held the man's clay pipe, glass shirt buttons and metal buttons 
apparently from a double-breasted jacket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant Find' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a truly exciting discovery," said <PERSON>Douglas Owsley</PERSON>, the forensic 
anthropologist who led the excavation. "It's probably one of the more 
significant Civil War finds in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Owsley</PERSON>, who has helped police identify murder victims from skeletal remains, 
estimated that the soldier was at least 30 years old when he died, based on the 
condition of his teeth and other factors. With the help of some historians, he 
said, researchers might be able to determine the man's identity. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier belonged to the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Artillery unit from <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, which 
on <DATE>Aug. 23, 1862</DATE>, was caught in cross-fire between Union troops and 
Confederates under the command of Gen. <PERSON>James Longstreet</PERSON>. The fighting, a 
prelude to the <ORGANIZATION>Second Battle of Manassas</ORGANIZATION>, occurred near <LOCATION>Beverly Ford</LOCATION> on the 
<LOCATION>Rappahannock River</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The discovery is consistent with much folklore about the site," <PERSON>Owsley</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. <PERSON>William Owen</PERSON>, a participant in the skirmish, recorded the burial scene in a 
book titled "In Camp and Battle with The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Artillery": 
</P>
<P>
"At night a burial detail performed the last sad rites to our dead comrades by 
the flickering light of a blazing fire of logs and rails, having made rude 
coffins of the pews of <ORGANIZATION>St. James Church</ORGANIZATION>, which, meaning no sacrilege, were 
appropriated for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
The church, built on the Fredericksburg-Winchester road in <DATE>1842</DATE>, was destroyed 
by <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> troops later in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Smithsonian researchers were invited to the two-acre site by a descendant 
congregation, <ORGANIZATION>Christ Episcopal Church of Brandy Station</ORGANIZATION>, which wished to learn 
about its roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Discovery 
</P>
<P>
Besides the soldier's body and coffin, the team found 55 military and civilian 
graves that remain to be excavated, some bullets, a harness, food-ration cans 
and the ruins of the original church. 
</P>
<P>
The unearthed coffin was buried about three feet underground and had no top or 
bottom, apparently for lack of time and tools, <PERSON>Owsley</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing to see the reaction from the members of the church when we 
discovered the grave," <PERSON>Owsley</PERSON> said. "They were ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
The soldier was "one of the last things we found" during the two-week 
expedition, <PERSON>Owsley</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to go back to the site for further excavation, but noted 
that by the end of the recent trip most of the 27 members of his team, some of 
them college students, were "so busy scratching from poison ivy they were ready 
to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers plan to recommend that the site be included in the <ORGANIZATION>National 
Register of Historic Places</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Owsley</PERSON> said the remains of the Confederate soldier eventually will be returned 
to the church. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Clark B. Hall</PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Va.-based Assn. for Preservation 
of Civil War Sites Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, said the densely wooded area where <PERSON>Owsley</PERSON>'s team 
worked was the site of the largest cavalry fight of the war, the <ORGANIZATION>Battle of 
Brandy Station</ORGANIZATION>, on <DATE>June 9, 1863</DATE>, a month before <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
More than 9,000 troops clashed "saber to saber and stirrup to stirrup" at 
<LOCATION>Brandy Station</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said. "The battle was a watershed event in Civil War 
history in that as a result . . . Union cavalry began their ascendancy over 
their counterparts in gray. . . . At Brandy Station they proved that they could 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,400 Casualties 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 casualties, many of them near <LOCATION>St. James Church</LOCATION>, were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and other preservationists are in a fight with a developer who plans to 
build a shopping center, office park and houses on about 5,000 acres nearby. 
"We're hoping (the developer) works with us to ensure that the significant 
sites where heavy fighting and heavy casualties occurred can be protected," 
said <PERSON>Hall</PERSON>, who accompanied the team during the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was "thrilled" with the recent discoveries. "It makes someone like 
myself doing historical research extremely excited. It's a very important 
find."

<HEAD>`Protection Plan' Announced for 25 Civil War Sites</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Battlefield List</HEAD>

   The federal government will ask private groups
and state and local governments to cooperate in preserving the
nation's historic battlefields, <ORGANIZATION>Interior</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Manuel Lujan</PERSON>
said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   The ``American Battlefield Protection Plan'' eventually will
cover all wars fought on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soil, but will begin by focusing on
25 key Civil War sites, <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> said.
   Because the government can't afford to buy all the land
involved, he said, a cooperative effort is needed to make sure the
farms and fields where Union and Confederate soldiers fought aren't
overwhelmed by shopping malls and industrial parks.
   ``We want the governors, local governments, foundations,
corporations and owners to all join,'' <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> said in an interview
on <ORGANIZATION>NBC-TV</ORGANIZATION>'s ``Today'' program.
   ``Some of the battlefields, for example, would be purchased, but
some of them can be commemorated simply by easements, some of them
maybe the owner would want us to put a plaque there commemorating
that particular battle,'' he said. ``We don't have enough money
just to go off and buy all these sites.''
   Details of his plan, which includes a request for <MONEY>$15 million</MONEY> in
seed money, will be explained <DATE>Saturday</DATE> when <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> speaks at
<ORGANIZATION>Manassas National Battlefield Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in ceremonies
marking the 129th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>First Battle of Bull Run</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> said he also planned to discuss his ideas with the
governors of the states where the sites to be protected are located.
   <LOCATION>Florence Kennedy</LOCATION>, director of the battlefield preservation drive
for the private Conservation Fund, praised <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON>'s project.
   ``I think the secretary's initiative is a very important one
because it's placing great importance on partnership,'' she said in
an interview. ``This partnership cooperation will be a catalyst to
encourage private sector cooperation.''
   A bitter fight broke out in <DATE>1988</DATE> over a developer's plans to
build a mall on land adjacent to the <LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION> park. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> later
voted to add the disputed tract to the park, with a final cost
expected to exceed <MONEY>$100 million</MONEY>.
   ``I was in the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> when we went through the <LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION>
fight,'' said <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON>, who represented a <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> district in the
<ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> for 20 years.
   ``At that time I thought it was the worst way to do it. It's
more expensive, you have to file suits. If we have a planned
program, everything works much better,'' he said.
   As an example of the better way, <PERSON>Lujan</PERSON> cited the <ORGANIZATION>Richard King
Mellon Foundation</ORGANIZATION>'s donation to the federal government three weeks
ago of 10 parcels of land, including important sites from the Civil
War battles of Antietem and <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   Lujan's plan has four parts:
   _Encouraging ``creative public and private land-use tools'' such
as zoning, easements, land-banking and historic district
designation to protect imminently threatened sites.
   _Distribute information on public and private projects to
protect battlefields.
   _Use limited federal funds to encourage land purchases by
private conservation organizations and other public agencies.
   _Develop a national strategy to protect other significant
battlefield sites that aren't imminently threatened, but may be in
the future.

   Several hundred people sang ``Dixie'' on
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the death
of Confederate President <PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON>.
   More than 150 people in Civil War uniforms and period clothing,
plus a similar number of spectators in modern clothing, watched a
re-enactment of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> being sworn in as president in <DATE>1861</DATE> atop the
Capitol steps in <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Richard Couch</PERSON>, portraying <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, stood
on a bronze star that marks the spot where a country was divided.
   Some spectators carried Rebel flags and most joined in singing
``Dixie'' during the program, which included historical lectures
and displays and a rifle and cannon salute by Civil War re-enactors
from throughout <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Norman Dasinger</PERSON>, state commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Sons of Confederate
Veterans</ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>' death a century ago was important to mark
because there was so much misunderstanding about the Civil War.
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> was 81 when he died in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>.
   ``The ignorance is so pervasive about the war being over
slavery. Out of the 50,000 Alabamians who died in the war, <PERCENT>90
percent</PERCENT> owned no one,'' said <PERSON>Dasinger</PERSON>, a professor of education
administration at <ORGANIZATION>Jacksonville State University</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The majority of the people here today believe <PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON>
was right and I do, too,'' <PERSON>Dasinger</PERSON> said. ``That does not mean we
want to have a slave nation. We believe in individual rights and
freedoms and state's rights.''
   <PERSON>David Toifel</PERSON>, a history teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Hillsdale Middle School</ORGANIZATION> in
Mobile who had the idea for the ceremony, said that one reason
Southerners loved <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> so much after the war was that ``he never
admitted what he did was wrong.''
   One of the programs at the <ORGANIZATION>State Archives</ORGANIZATION> included a film of a
re-enactment in <DATE>1914</DATE> of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>' swearing-in by real Confederate
veterans. In that ceremony, they raised the first flag of the
Confederacy atop the Capitol _ the kind of flag that actually flew
over the building when it was the capitol of the Confederacy _
rather than the Confederate battle flag that flies there now.
   The Confederate battle flag has been the focus of protests,
including one on <DATE>Feb. 2, 1988</DATE>, that resulted in the arrest of 14
black state legislators who made a symbolic attempt to rip it down.
Black leaders contend the flag has become a symbol of racism
through its use by the <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON>.
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s ceremony attracted no protests.
   The ceremony did bring two sons of Confederate veterans _
80-year-old <PERSON>Eddie Jordan</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Selma</LOCATION> and 83-year-old Willard ``Fred''
<PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Gadsden</LOCATION>.
   ``My daddy never owned a slave. He fought 3{ years in the war as
a volunteer. He was fighting for principle,'' <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said. ``When
the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> told him, you've got to get rid of slaves, he didn't like
it. It was the principle. Most people don't like to be told what to
do.''

   The cheers of thousands echoed on a
hillside here as a tongue of flame atop the Eternal Light Peace
Memorial burst skyward for the first time in 15 years.
   More than 20,000 people witnessed the relighting <DATE>Sunday</DATE> of the
memorial that was first ignited 50 years ago in memory of those who
fought and died in the Civil War Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.
   ``It's time for us to learn from the sacrifice of those who fell
here. And it is time to act,'' astronomer <PERSON>Carl Sagan</PERSON> said in his
dedication address.
   ``The real triumph of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> was not, I think, in <DATE>1863</DATE>. It
was 50 years later, when the veterans, the remnants of the
adversary forces, the Blue and the Gray, met in celebration and in
solemn memorial,'' <PERSON>Sagan</PERSON> said. ``It is time to emulate them.''
   The flame will be kept burning continuously atop the limestone
and granite monument, which was dedicated 50 years ago by President
<PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> in a ceremony that drew more than 450,000
people.
   The light burned unceasingly for 35 years except for a two-year
break during World War II. In <DATE>1973</DATE>, it was extinguished by a
congressional order banning all ornamental uses of energy during
the height of the oil crisis except for the flame on President <PERSON>John
F. Kennedy</PERSON>'s grave in <LOCATION>Arlington National Cemetery</LOCATION>.
   The monument remained dark for three years. The natural gas
light then was converted to an electric light that has burned for
the past 12 years.
   The relighting of the gas-fueled flame is ``a dream come true''
for state Rep. <PERSON>Ken Cole</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Adams</ORGANIZATION>. His uncle <PERSON>Paul Roy</PERSON>, who was then
editor of the <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> Times, conceived the idea for the original
flame and monument, and mounted a nationwide fund-raising effort to
build it.
   ``When they put the light bulb up there and extinguished the
flame, it kind of took the heart out of the monument,'' <PERSON>Cole</PERSON> said.
   The relighting was not lost on <PERSON>Arthur Rice</PERSON>, who witnessed the
original lighting in <DATE>1938</DATE> and whose relatives helped plan that
ceremony.
   ``I think the idea of rededicating it for peace, for a world
united, is something they would be happy with,'' he said.
   Three central <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> companys have offered to pay for the
first year's fuel bill.
