   For 45 years, the fate of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Lloyd
Willard Wibben</PERSON> was a mystery to both his family and the residents
of Treguier, a coastal village in northwestern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.
   The family knew <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION> had died somewhere in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> during World
War II.
   The villagers knew an American soldier fell while liberating
their town, but they never knew his name.
   A historian's persistence finally led to the name, jotted in the
yellowed pages of a diary kept by the commander of <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION>'s
regiment.
   This week, <PERSON>Mervin Wibben</PERSON> of <LOCATION>St. Charles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, arrived in
Treguier, population 3,400, at the invitation of city elders to
join them in honoring his older brother.
   On <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>Armistice Day</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION> will lay a wreath
at a new monument the villagers are dedicating to the man who was
once their unknown soldier.
   <PERSON>Lloyd Wibben</PERSON> was 24 years old on <DATE>Aug. 14, 1944</DATE>, when his 15th
<ORGANIZATION>Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron</ORGANIZATION> advanced just to the edge of
Treguier, a village 250 miles west of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.
   They found the road blocked by debris, so <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION> and other
soldiers left their vehicles to clear the road. Wibben was killed
in a barrage of German fire.
   The villagers placed a simple granite marker where he died,
dedicated ``to the unknown American soldier who died during the
Liberation 14 <DATE>August 1944</DATE>.'' He was buried in Plot K, Row 7, at the
American military cemetery at <LOCATION>St. James</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>, along with
about 4,400 other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers who died in the fighting.
   The Americans took the village and eventually stopped the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>'
counterattack on Avranches.
   ``All we really knew was that that we got telegram from the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
that <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> was killed in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> by
telephone from Treguier.
   ``We didn't know too much more of it until Treguier contacted us
to help in this ceremony,'' he said. ``He really is some kind of
hero to the people here.''
   The people of Treguier did not know the soldier's name until
local historian <PERSON>Yvon Herve</PERSON> launched a research project about two
years ago.
   His search eventually led him to retired Col. <PERSON>Robert Dwan</PERSON>, who
commanded the <ORGANIZATION>15th Cavalry Regiment</ORGANIZATION> and kept a diary listing all
the men under his command who had died.
   Dwan showed Herve the entry for <DATE>Aug. 14, 1944</DATE>, and further
investigation confirmed that <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION>Treguier</ORGANIZATION>'s unknown soldier.
   ``Very few people in the war kept a diary like that,'' said
<PERSON>Mervin Wibben</PERSON>, a semi-retired meat processor who served with the
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. ``Most of them just wanted to forget
about everything.''
   Herve considered the puzzle fully solved in <DATE>mid-September</DATE>, and
Treguier officials started planning a ceremony to place a bronze
plaque with <ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION>'s name over the old granite marker.
   ``Because we have learned his identity, we wanted to invite his
brother,'' said <PERSON>Herve</PERSON>. ``For us, this ceremony is a symbol of our
freedom.''
   <PERSON>Mervin Wibben</PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON>Jan</PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> courtesy of <ORGANIZATION>Air
France</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> before traveling on to Treguier. They visited
<ORGANIZATION>Wibben</ORGANIZATION>'s grave and will tour the area around the World War II
battlefields before leaving for home <DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   ``It really broke me up bad when <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> died,'' <PERSON>Mervin Wibben</PERSON>
said. ``He was five years older than me, but we were really close.
He left me his car when he volunteered for the service.''
   The family, natives of <LOCATION>Yankton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.D.</LOCATION>, included seven brothers
and four sisters. Mervin is the first to visit Lloyd's grave.
   ``When they called, it brought back a lot of memories _ and a
few tears,'' he said. ``Lloyd was a prince. He wanted to go fight
for his country. He loved horses so much he signed up for the
cavalry ... but when he got to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> it was all mechanized.''
   <DATE>Saturday</DATE>'s ceremony comes nine days before <PERSON>Lloyd Wibben</PERSON> would
have celebrated his 70th birthday.

<TEXT>
   Prince <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, who has been
criticized at home for attending <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>'s funeral, today
honored British soldiers who died in World War II by laying wreaths
at a cemetery.
   Accompanied by Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> honored
the 1,738 British, Australian and other war dead buried at the
<ORGANIZATION>Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> a day after attending the
elaborate funeral of Emperor <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>.
   In drizzling rain, the two British representatives laid wreaths
at a crucifix in the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and
later spoke with members of the local British community.
   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> today, <PERSON>Queen Elizabeth II</PERSON> appealed to a World War II
veteran to end his hunger strike protest over <LOCATION>Prince Philip</LOCATION>'s
attendance at the funeral. There was no immediate reaction to the
latest appeal from <PERSON>Andrew Burgess</PERSON>, 70, who has been eating nothing
and drinking only black tea for the last nine days.
   Philip's attendance at <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s funeral has been criticized by
British war veterans and lawmakers who considered the late monarch a
war criminal and who saw no reason to honor a man they blamed for
the deaths of thousands of their comrades. The royal family was
criticized for sending the husband of Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>, and the
decision was debated in editorial columns.
   ``To many millions outside <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> will be remembered
less for the dignified last years of his reign than for its first
phase, when aggressive war was waged in his name and barbarous
atrocities were committed,'' The Times of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> wrote in a <DATE>January</DATE>
editorial after <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s death. ``To those people, the emperor's
passing will bring back painful memories.''
   Fighting under <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s name, Japanese forces killed 27,000
British soldiers and another 20,000 Dutch.
   Many survivors also held <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> accountable for atrocities
committed against 127,000 Dutch people interned during the war.
   ``We are accustomed to hear such kind of criticism,'' said
<PERSON>Seizaburo Sato</PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo
University</ORGANIZATION>. ``<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> made a mistake.''
   ``But didn't (the) British or Dutch do really bad things to
Asians they colonized, for example, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>? If they
think about what they have done for a much longer period of time
than <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did, I think they should be more modest,'' he said in an
interview.
   Most historians maintain that the late emperor was merely a
glorified figurehead of his generals with little, if any, political
power. Hirohito died on <DATE>Jan. 7</DATE> at age 87, never having made clear
his role in the war.
   The cemetery is on the site of a playground that was opened by
<PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> himself more than 65 years ago when he was crown prince.
   Nestled in the hills of Hodogaya in <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the
cemetery also holds the remains of soldiers from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New
Zealand</LOCATION> and other Commonwealth nations, and the ashes of an
undetermined number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers.
   Many died while being held as prisoners of war in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> or aboard
POW ships on the way to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE> following the surrender of
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>. ``He loved his life but gave it in freeing the Japanese
people,'' read one epitaph.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Captured Germans Who Helped Soviets In War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emotional dispute has broken out in <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION> over whether imprisoned German soldiers who spread
propaganda for their Soviet captors during World War II were
traitors or heroes.
   ``Many people consider these people traitors. But that's not the
case. They were opponents of the (Nazi) regime,'' said <PERSON>Peter
Steinbach</PERSON>.
   <PERSON>Steinbach</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Passau University</ORGANIZATION> historian, arranged an exhibit
called ``Resistance to National Socialism'' that has generated
controversy.
   The failed <DATE>July 20, 1944</DATE> attempt by German generals to kill
<PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> is included in the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> exhibit, as are the wartime calls
for anti-Nazi actions by a group of university students known as
the <ORGANIZATION>White Rose</ORGANIZATION>.
   In both cases, those brave enough to oppose Hitler were tortured
and executed.
   But along with documents and photographs showing such widely
recognized attempts to disrupt the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> is a controversial
display about thousands of captured German soldiers in Soviet
prisons who opposed the Third <PERSON>Reich</PERSON> and wanted the war to end.
   Some members of the <ORGANIZATION>National Committee</ORGANIZATION> for a Free <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> did
propaganda work for the Soviets during the war, using loudspeakers
at the front to urge German soldiers to quit fighting.
   That part of the exhibit has angered Germans who do not believe
the soldiers deserve the same place of honor as people like <PERSON>Claus
von Stauffenberg</PERSON>, who was executed for planting the <DATE>1944</DATE> bomb meant
to kill Hitler.
   <PERSON>Hartmut von Hoesslin</PERSON>, brother of another German officer involved
in the <DATE>1944</DATE> plot, Maj. <PERSON>Roland von Hoesslin</PERSON>, was at the exhibit's
opening on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Hartmut von Hoesslin</PERSON> said the display on imprisoned German
soldiers ``insulted all resistance-fighters.''
   A protest letter presented by <PERSON>Hartmut von Hoesslin</PERSON> to the
exhibit's organizers said propaganda by the imprisoned soldiers
amounted to ``psychoterror'' against fellow German troops.
   But <PERSON>Steinbach</PERSON> said members of the <ORGANIZATION>National Committee</ORGANIZATION> for a Free
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> deserve a place in the exhibit and argued they saw
themselves not as opportunists who wanted to placate Soviet
captors, but as authentic opponents of Hitler's rule.
   ``They felt they were representatives of the Allied cause to
stop the war,'' <PERSON>Steinbach</PERSON> said.
   The dispute has its roots in a long-standing German dilemma:
what kind of honor to bestow on German soldiers who died during the
war, and whether those who deserted are also deserving of praise.
   German peace activists have been behind numerous moves to erect
monuments to World War II deserters, often angering people who feel
it is an affront to those who died fighting.
   There is heated controversy in <LOCATION>Bockhorn</LOCATION>, where citizens are
embroiled in discussion over the community's memorial to soldiers
who fell during both world wars.
   An open letter from peace activists questioned whether every
fallen soldier deserves to be treated like a hero.
   The letter said, ``They (the fallen soldiers) had participated
in one of the greatest crimes of modern times,'' meaning the
tragedies and terror begun by <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION> when it started World
War II.
   <PERSON>Kark Friedrich Schinkel</PERSON>, an officer in the West German navy,
said in the respected newspaper Die Zeit that such disputes
underscore the difficulties some Germans still have in coming to
terms with their homeland's Nazi past.
   He said such controversies ``raise the question, 50 years after
the German invasion of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, whether the concept of individual
heroism can be applied against the backdrop of mass murder.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years and another administration ago, the
<ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> promised to study the records of black soldiers to
determine why none of them received the Medal of Honor for valor
during World Wars I and II.
   Since then, <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> was elected president and the two
congressmen who were bird-dogging the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> on the subject are
gone: Rep. <PERSON>Mickey Leland</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Texas</LOCATION>, died in a plane crash and <PERSON>Joseph
DioGuardi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.Y.</LOCATION>, was defeated for re-election.
   But the probe has not been scuttled, a <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said
last week.
   Neither has it been finished.
   ``The study is still going on and the reason it's taking so long
is most of these black soldiers were with French units,'' Maj. <PERSON>Doug
Hart</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in an interview.
   The French records of one World War I unit became available only
in <DATE>February</DATE>, <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said. Military researchers are also looking at
World War II records of three black <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> seamen who received the
<ORGANIZATION>Distinguished Service Cross</ORGANIZATION>, he said.
   <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said the investigations will probably be completed later
this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   That pleases <PERSON>Leroy Ramsey</PERSON>, an <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, historian who six
years ago began a lonely quest to correct what he feels is a great
injustice.
   ``I'm kind of perturbed that it's taken so long but I am pleased
that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> agreed to give it a full review,'' <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> said in
an interview last week.
   A black World War II veteran himself, <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> was stunned to
discover while researching a book that not one of the 1.5 million
black Americans who served in the world wars received the nation's
highest military decoration for bravery.
   Blacks were excluded from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> combat units in both world wars.
But more than a few were cited for bravery, <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> learned upon
examining the records of servicemen awarded the <ORGANIZATION>Distinguished
Service Cross</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>French Croix de Guerre</ORGANIZATION>.
   Ramsey then read the nation's more than 1,200 Medal of Honor
citations and concluded that at least one black World War I soldier
and one black World War II seaman had records strong enough to
warrant the highest honor.
   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys were
black,'' <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> stressed.
   The two he selected were <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Henry Johnson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Seaman Dorrie Miller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Both are dead.
   By <DATE>1987</DATE>, <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> had succeeded in interesting <PERSON>DioGuardi</PERSON> and
<LOCATION>Leland</LOCATION> in his cause. The two sponsored legislation to award
posthumous Medals of Honor to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> but the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>
opposed the bill because it singled out two individuals.
   In <DATE>October 1988</DATE>, then Defense-Secretary <PERSON>Frank Carlucci</PERSON> announced
the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> would review the records of black World War I heroes and
said he would ask the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> about the feasibility of doing the same
with blacks in World War II.
   <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> is now looking at the records of <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>
and all the men in his unit. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s record also is under review,
along with those of Seamen <PERSON>William Cook Pinckney</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leonard Roy
Harmon</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, who fought with the French army in World War I, killed
four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured a
stockpile of weapons, all despite severe wounds. He was awarded the
<ORGANIZATION>Croix de Guerre</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s highest military honor, but was never
cited by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He died in <DATE>1930</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was a mess steward on the <LOCATION>USS West Virginia</LOCATION> when it was
attacked at <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>. While the battleship was being shelled,
he helped moved its wounded captain from the ship's bridge, then
returned to man a machine gun. Miller received a <ORGANIZATION>Distinguished
Service Cross</ORGANIZATION> and a warship was named for him in <DATE>1971</DATE>. He was
killed in a torpedo attack in <DATE>1943</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Harmon</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, was a mess attendant aboard the USS <LOCATION>San
Francisco</LOCATION> during a battle with the Japanese near the <LOCATION>Solomon
Islands</LOCATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE>. He deliberately exposed himself to hostile gunfire
in order to protect a wounded shipmate and was killed, according to
his citation.
   Pinckney, of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, was a cook on the <ORGANIZATION>USS Enterprise</ORGANIZATION> in
a battle with the Japanese near the <LOCATION>Santa Cruz Islands</LOCATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE>.
During heavy bombing, <PERSON>Pinckney</PERSON> carried a comrade to safety before
pushing his way out of a burning compartment.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a gesture of reconciliation more
than four decades after the end of World War II, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>
has released the names of 1,500 German soldiers who died in its
prisoner-of-war camps.
   The list was presented to the German Red Cross to coincide with
the arrival <DATE>Monday</DATE> of Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>.
   It was the first time the Soviets had provided a list of German
soldiers still unaccounted for after the war, West German officials
said.
   Thousands of German soldiers died in Soviet prisoner-of-war camps
and many prisoners were not released until the early <DATE>1950s</DATE>.
   German Red Cross officials applauded the Soviet action, saying it
was a ``moving gesture of reconciliation and an important first step
in clarifying the fate of these missing men.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and another West German group, the Federation for
the Preservation of German War Graves, said they hoped to be able to
inform relatives of the soldiers on the list soon.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> said it hoped that additional lists of missing
soldiers would follow.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> has also agreed allow greater access to several
cemeteries in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> where German soldiers are buried.
   German Red Cross President <PERSON>Botho Prinz</PERSON> zu Sayn-Wittgenstein
called the Soviet gesture a ``breakthrough in the humantarian
relations'' between the two nations.
   The bitter legacy of World War II and the Nazi attack on the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> has clouded West German-Soviet relations for decades.
   According to official estimates, more than 20 million Soviets
were killed in the war and Nazi armies destroyed vast areas of the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   Soviet prisoners of war were subjected to brutal treatment by the
Nazis and thousands died in forced labor and concentration camps
until the German defeat in <DATE>1945</DATE>.

The debate is muddling the intent of the monument: To make a special 
acknowledgement of the blood, sweat and tears of those Japanese-American 
soldiers who fought hard to prove their loyalty to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> so their 
families, unjustly interned in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> concentration camps during the war, would 
be more readily accepted by other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
They were tested as few others were. They deserve an enduring testimonial -- 
one designed with the names of all the Japanese-Americans who served in World 
War II as the centerpiece of the monument. The design also could incorporate 
secondarily the names of others who died in combat. 
</P>
<P>
They don't deserve to be fought over like this.

   World War II veteran and <ORGANIZATION>Purple
Heart</ORGANIZATION> winner <PERSON>Anthony Beggetta</PERSON> died expecting to be buried with
military pomp.
   But when his family tried to arrange the color guard, rifle
salute and bugle-blown ``Taps,'' they discovered a change in policy
at <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>'s main army base because of budget constraints.
   ``My father didn't talk too much about it, but he said he wanted
a military funeral,'' said <PERSON>Beggetta</PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON>Jeanne Udas</PERSON>. ``It's
just something we knew all our lives that he wanted.''
   Beggetta, who was 75 when he died <DATE>Jan. 19</DATE>, got his military
sendoff when officials at the local <ORGANIZATION>Veterans of Foreign Wars Post</ORGANIZATION>
sent a color guard.
   But although the family appreciated the efforts, the funeral
``wasn't of course as impressive as what my father expected or
wanted,'' <PERSON>Udas</PERSON> said.
   The problem, military officials say, is that the veteran
population from World War II is aging at a time when the military
is under pressure to trim spending.
   ``There's no intent to slight veterans. That's not the point.
When there's less money, we have to find ways to cut,'' said
<PERSON>Phillip Morris</PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION>Fort Devens</LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Ayers</ORGANIZATION>.
   Army policy is to provide funeral details for soldiers who die
on active duty and Medal of Honor winners, said <PERSON>Shari Lawrence</PERSON>,
spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Personnel Command</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION>. Any
veteran is entitled to the presence of a service representative of
equal rank, who usually presents the family with a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag, she
said.
   Beyond that, policy is up to individual commanders and <PERSON>Lawrence</PERSON>
said there was no centralized information on how funerals are
handled. Still, she said she was not aware of problems nationally.
   <LOCATION>Fort Devens</LOCATION> sends out funeral details for 20-year retirees and
former prisoners of war, <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said. In the <ORGANIZATION>Begetta</ORGANIZATION>'s case, a
sergeant was sent to present the flag to the family.
   Previously, the base had responded to most requests within 300
miles with 15-man details, including pallbearers, a bugle player
and a rifle group. In <DATE>1988</DATE>, 3,345 soldiers were assigned to details
at 229 funerals. Smaller groups, using 768 soldiers were sent to 96
funerals, he said.
   ``We were sending them all over the six-state <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> area,
lots of them. It was a drain,'' he said.
   During the <DATE>first six months of 1989</DATE>, 118 full details and 77
smaller contingents went out. After the policy change, the number
dwindled to only 26 full funerals and 18 smaller details.
   How the base came to be in the position of sending out so many
details is difficult to tell, <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said.
   ``I think it just kind of progressed and progressed and finally
got to the point where we were just doing all those funerals,'' he
said.
   <PERSON>Bill Smith</PERSON>, director of public affairs for the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>,
headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION>VFW</ORGANIZATION>, said the problem could be that the World
War II veterans are growing older, with an average age of 67.
   He said he understands that some families would prefer the
attention of a military base.
   ``We are a substitute,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said he does not know how much the base is saving through
cutting the funeral details because it involves too many variables.
At one point, <LOCATION>Fort Devens</LOCATION> was on a list of bases under
consideration for closure, but it has since acquired the
<ORGANIZATION>Information System Command</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious that we were expending lots of
troop labor to support veterans funerals all over <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION>,''
<PERSON>Morris</PERSON> said. ``It was one of many things that we've cut back. The
times are getting leaner and we have to do more with less.''

<TEXT>
   The remains of an Italian Unknown
Soldier who died in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> during World War II were
formally given to Italian authorities at a military cemetery on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   The remains symbolized the 90,000 Italians who died on the
Russian front while fighting with the German army against the
Soviets.
   The arrival of the urn at the military cemetery at Redipuglia in
northern <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> marked the beginning of a program in which Italian
remains from World War II are to be exhumed in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and
sent home.
   An accord on the program is to be signed in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   A Soviet military delegation and Italian President <PERSON>Francesco
Cossiga</PERSON> attended <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s ceremony.
   ``The return of the Unknown Soldier is a sign of the times,''
said <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Virginio Rognoni</PERSON> at the ceremony in front of
a military shrine.
   ``With the disintegration of the walls that divided peoples,
with freedom and dialogue returning to many parts of the world
through perestroika, <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> feel like neighbors.''
   About 40,000 people attended the ceremony.

<TEXT>
   <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> laid a wreath at a
war cemetery <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in a move to honor memories and appease
veterans angered that he paid last respects to <PERSON>Emperor Hirohito</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s World War II leader.
   Philip, accompanied by Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Geoffrey Howe</PERSON>, honored
the 1,738 British, Australian and other war dead buried at the
<ORGANIZATION>Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> a day after attending <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s
elaborate funeral.
   In light rain, the two British representatives laid wreaths at
the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and later spoke with
members of the local British community.
   British war veterans and lawmakers decried the attendance of
Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON>'s husband at the funeral of the late monarch,
whom they denounced as a war criminal.
   In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Queen Elizabeth II</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> appealed to one World
War II veteran to end his hunger strike, which was begun in protest
of <LOCATION>Philip</LOCATION>'s attendance.
   There was no immediate reaction to the latest appeal from
70-year-old <PERSON>Andrew Burgess</PERSON>, who has been eating nothing and drinking
only black tea for the last nine days.
   Fighting under <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON>'s name, Japanese forces killed about
27,000 British soldiers and 20,000 Dutch troops. Many survivors also
held <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> accountable for atrocities committed against 127,000
Dutch people interned during the war.
   ``We are accustomed to hearing such kinds of criticism,'' said
<PERSON>Seizaburo Sato</PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION>Tokyo
University</ORGANIZATION>. ``<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> made a mistake.''
   ``But didn't (the) British or Dutch do really bad things to
Asians they colonized, for example, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION>? If they
think about what they have done for a much longer period of time
than <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did, I think they should be more modest.''
   Most historians maintain that the late emperor was merely a
glorified figurehead with little political power. Hirohito died on
<DATE>Jan. 7</DATE> at age 87, never having made clear his role in the war.
   The cemetery is on the site of a playground that <PERSON>Hirohito</PERSON> opened
more than 65 years ago when he was crown prince.
   Nestled in the hills of <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, the cemetery
also holds the remains of soldiers from <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>
and other Commonwealth nations, and the ashes of an undetermined
number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers. Many died while being held as prisoners of
war or aboard <ORGANIZATION>POW</ORGANIZATION> ships on the way to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1942</DATE> following the
surrender of <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION>.
   At least one British war veteran attending the wreath-laying
ceremony thought <PERSON>Philip</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> was justified. The quick
trip to <LOCATION>Yokohama</LOCATION> was largely seen as an attempt to appease anger
over his attendance at the funeral.
   ``People are entitled to their own opinions,'' said <PERSON>Edward Ward</PERSON>,
77, who said he had served in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s intelligence corps and has
lived in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for about 10 years.
   ``But human rights would be in a sad state if people held grudges
forever more.''

<HEAD>Army Denies Medal of Honor to World War II Veteran</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> board has refused to grant the Medal
of Honor to a World War II veteran who colleagues claimed was
passed over for decoration because he was Jewish, an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> official,
Lt. Col. <PERSON>Terry Adkins</PERSON>, said <DATE>today</DATE>.
   <PERSON>David S. Rubitsky</PERSON>, then an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> sergeant, had been recommended
for the medal by company and battalion commanders. They cited a
battle in the jungles of <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> in which he was said to have
killed more than 500 Japanese soldiers.
   <PERSON>Adkins</PERSON> said an ``exhaustive'' two-year investigation into
<PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s claims showed the battle ``did not occur as alleged.''
   As for the claim that <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> was denied the medal because of
anti-Semitism, he said, ``I could not find any basis of fact in
this.''
   Rubitsky, who lives in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, was notified <DATE>Thursday</DATE> night of
the decision and the army presented its findings to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> today,
<PERSON>Adkins</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s decision was first reported today by <ORGANIZATION>The New York
Times</ORGANIZATION>.
   Board officials said the lack of official records, the death of
witnesses and the failing memories of those who survived the
campaign thwarted their review.
   But the toughest obstacle was the implausibility that one
soldier _ armed with a machine gun, automatic rifle and a carbine _
could inflict such damage singlehandedly.
   They said <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> would have needed large amounts of ammunition
and would have been able to fire only one weapon while the Japanese
returned his fire, forcing him to keep his head down and shoot
without taking aim.
   Board officials said it was most likely <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> fought well and
had inflicted heavy casualties.
   The story of <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s heroics had been largely forgotten until
<DATE>1986</DATE>, when during a reunion of the 128th Regiment he fought in, it
was learned he had never been recommended for the <ORGANIZATION>Medal of Honor</ORGANIZATION>.
After the war, <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> traveled the world as a merchant marine for
more than 30 years.
   <PERSON>J.M. Stehling</PERSON>, his company commander, said in a recently
notarized statement: ``I personally inspected the battle scene and
there were more than 500 Japanese killed or wounded by the actions
of Sgt. <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>. His actions were heroic, and he should receive
the Medal of Honor.''
   In another statement, <PERSON>Herbert A. Smith</PERSON>, a retired major general
who was <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s battalion commander, said he passed <PERSON>Stehling</PERSON>'s
recommendation to Col. <PERSON>John H. Mott</PERSON>, chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION>32nd
Division</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Col. <PERSON>Mott</PERSON>'s answer was, `You mean a Jew for the Congressional
Medal of Honor?''' said <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, who died three months ago.
   <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said <PERSON>Mott</PERSON>, who also is dead, ``just laughed and walked
away.''
   The board also looked at a handwritten notation on a yellowing
photograph that had been removed from the body of a Japanese
officer 47 years ago. He said he would commit suicide to atone for
having sent into battle ``600 fine Japanese soldiers (who) died
because of a solitary American soldier.''
   Secret Service experts in counterfeiting told <PERSON>Sen. Herbert H.
Kohl</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Wis.</LOCATION>, that the ink and paper of the photograph that
recently came to light were consistent with materials used in <DATE>1942</DATE>.
They concluded there was no reason to believe the photo was
``anything other than genuine.''
   Kohl's office had interceded on behalf of <LOCATION>Rubitsky</LOCATION>, a <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>
resident.
   Of 295 Medals of Honor awarded in World War II, none went to
black soldiers. Only two went to Jews, according to the Jewish War
Veterans of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.

I am dying, comrades dying 
</P>
<P>
Far away from friends and home 
</P>
<P>
In this rebel den I'm lying 
</P>
<P>
suffering, staring, all alone 
</P>
<P>
 -- From poem written by an unknown Andersonville prisoner 
</P>
<P>
All that is left of the infamous Confederate prison in this small, central 
<LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> town are graves. In the 3-foot-deep trenches are the remains of 12,912 
Union soldiers and sailors, buried side by side, shoulder to shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Usable clothing was removed to be worn by surviving prisoners or guards. Then 
dirt was shoveled on top of their partially clad or naked bodies. 
</P>
<P>
For the living, <ORGANIZATION>Andersonville</ORGANIZATION> was a place of horror. Prisoners lived in 
squalor, their excrement everywhere. Many went insane. Many killed fellow 
prisoners for a few morsels of food. Still others committed suicide, died from 
scurvy, gangrene, dysentery and other diseases caused by poor sanitation, 
malnutrition, contaminated water, overcrowding, exposure to the elements. 
</P>
<P>
Largest of the Confederate military prisons, Andersonville existed for 14 
months -- from <DATE>February, 1864</DATE>, to the end of the war in <DATE>May, 1865</DATE>. More than 
45,000 Union troops were held here. 
</P>
<P>
All prison buildings were torn down after the Civil War. The grounds are now 
occupied by the <ORGANIZATION>Andersonville National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>National Historic Site</ORGANIZATION> and 
<ORGANIZATION>National Prisoner of War Museum</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only POW Museum 
</P>
<P>
Since <DATE>November, 1987</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>, in cooperation with the 
<ORGANIZATION>American Ex-Prisoners of War</ORGANIZATION>, has operated the <ORGANIZATION>National Prisoner of War Museum</ORGANIZATION>, 
the only one of its kind in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"It is appropriate that here at <LOCATION>Andersonville</LOCATION>, where so much suffering occurred 
to <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> prisoners, we honor and commemorate the sacrifices of all American 
POWs throughout history," said <PERSON>Helen Smith</PERSON>, 62, historian since <DATE>1972</DATE> of the 
30,000-member American Ex-Prisoners of War. 
</P>
<P>
She is the wife of <PERSON>Allen Smith</PERSON>, 66, a retired <LOCATION>Diana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION>, millwright and World 
War II <ORGANIZATION>Army Air Corps</ORGANIZATION> sergeant who was captured in the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> and held 
prisoner by the Japanese for 42 months. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Helen Smith</PERSON> worked with <PERSON>John Tucker</PERSON>, 40, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION>Andersonville 
National Historic Site</ORGANIZATION>, to establish the <ORGANIZATION>POW</ORGANIZATION> museum, housed temporarily in a 
62-year-old storage building on the cemetery grounds. Early this year, the 
organization will launch a <MONEY>$2.5-million</MONEY> fund drive to help finance construction 
of a larger permanent POW museum in <LOCATION>Andersonville</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters and Diaries 
</P>
<P>
The temporary museum is filled with memorabilia from POWs of World Wars I and 
II, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. "We have space in the present museum to display only 
about <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> of our archival resources," <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said. "The museum's purpose is to 
tell the <ORGANIZATION>POW</ORGANIZATION> story to the American people through interpretive exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
On display are letters from POWs, prison camp diaries and artwork, exhibits 
explaining psychological warfare, photographs of emaciated POWs upon their 
release from the camps and maps showing their locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WWII Prison Camps 
</P>
<P>
Another exhibit describes the 666 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> prison camps that housed 400,000 
Germans, 50,000 Italians and 5,000 Japanese during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
POWs from throughout the nation come to <LOCATION>Andersonville</LOCATION> to meet with museum 
visitors and explain their lives as prisoners of war. Often they are 
accompanied by their wives, who detail their own nightmares -- not knowing 
whether their husbands were dead or alive, sometimes for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Monument 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>William J. Thompson</PERSON>'s haunting sculpture of a crippled POW leaning on a crutch 
stands in front of hundreds of marble headstones marking the burial place of 
Andersonville prisoners. Presented by <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> in <DATE>1976</DATE>, the statue honors all 
American prisoners involved in all of the nation's wars, and carries the words 
of Zechariah: "Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey erected a monument here in <DATE>1899</DATE> in memory of its residents who died 
in the Confederate camp. 
</P>
<P>
The graves were cared for then by the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Army</ORGANIZATION> of the Republic's Woman's 
<ORGANIZATION>Relief Corps</ORGANIZATION> auxiliary. From <DATE>1910</DATE> to <DATE>1970</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>GAR</ORGANIZATION> served as caretaker of the 
graves. Since then the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> has had the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, 20 states whose soldiers died here erected 
monuments in their honor. The monument for <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> is particularly poignant, a 
weeping woman with the inscription: "<LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> honors the turf that wraps their 
clay. Death before dishonor." The names of all Iowans buried here are on the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept Records of Dead 
</P>
<P>
At war's end <PERSON>Clara Barton</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>, came here with a 
detachment of laborers and soldiers, and former prisoner <PERSON>Dorence Atwater</PERSON> to 
properly identify all the graves. 
</P>
<P>
While a prisoner, it was Atwater's duty to keep records of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> dead. When 
a man died, a wooden stake bearing a number was hammered into the ground over 
his remains. Atwater kept the list of names corresponding to the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he and <PERSON>Barton</PERSON> directed the placement of wooden markers bearing the names 
and state of each of the dead. In the <DATE>1870s</DATE> and <DATE>1880s</DATE> marble headstones 
replaced the wooden ones. Barton also directed the successful campaign to 
convert the <LOCATION>Andersonville Prison</LOCATION> graveyard to a <ORGANIZATION>National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Perched atop the marble headstone of <PERSON>Lewis S. Tuttle</PERSON>, a young soldier from 
Saco, <LOCATION>Me.</LOCATION>, is a marble carving of a dove. No one knows how it got there, when 
or why. It's the only headstone different from all the others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Person Charged 
</P>
<P>
Capt. <PERSON>Henry Wirz</PERSON>, the commandant of <ORGANIZATION>Andersonville Prison</ORGANIZATION>, was the only Civil 
War veteran charged with war crimes, was found guilty and then hanged on <DATE>Nov</DATE>. 
10, <DATE>1865</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with "conspiring to impair and injure the health and destroy the lives 
of federal prisoners in violation of the laws of war," <PERSON>Wirz</PERSON> was described as a 
monster and a fiend by <ORGANIZATION>Northerners</ORGANIZATION>. Southerners claimed he was a scapegoat, a 
good soldier, a hero and martyr. 
</P>
<P>
The Daughters of the Confederacy erected a large monument to <PERSON>Wirz</PERSON> on 
Andersonville's main street "to rescue his name from the stigma attached to it 
by embittered prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Wirz's daughter and granddaughter unveiled the monument on <DATE>Nov. 10, 1909</DATE>, the 
44th anniversary of his hanging. An annual memorial service is conducted there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honored Posthumously 
</P>
<P>
In <DATE>1981</DATE> Wirz was posthumously awarded the <ORGANIZATION>Confederate Medal of Honor</ORGANIZATION> at a 
convention of the <ORGANIZATION>Sons of Confederate Veterans</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>. Wirz Street in 
<LOCATION>Andersonville</LOCATION> is named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
"Feelings continue to run deep to this day about Capt. <PERSON>Wirz</PERSON>, about 
Andersonville Prison, about the Civil War," said Mayor <PERSON>Lewis F. Easterlin</PERSON>, 79, 
grandson of <PERSON>William Easterlin</PERSON>, a Confederate drummer boy at <ORGANIZATION>Andersonville 
Prison</ORGANIZATION>. "It's good to research history and research it right, good to remember 
history and remember it right."

the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> memorial and thousands of people flocked to the capital
to honor <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s war dead.
   Almost perfect weather with clear blue skies, temperatures in
the 80s and a gentle breeze served as backdrop to the 120th
Memorial Day services at <LOCATION>Arlington National Cemetery</LOCATION>, where 200,000
veterans are buried _ each tombstone marked by an American flag for
the holiday.
   On a smaller scale, eight wreaths at the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> memorial
honored the women who died in that conflict.
   In brief, somber ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknowns, <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>
placed the wreath of flowers before the four graves _ each
representing unidentified casualties from World War I, World War
II, the Korean War and the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.
   The observance began with a 19-gun artillery salute. A drummer
from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army Band</ORGANIZATION> sounded four muffled ruffles, followed by a
bugler blowing taps and then 30 seconds of silence.
   Addressing more than 5,000 people, many in shorts and T-shirts,
<PERSON>Quayle</PERSON> called the war dead ``our nation's true heroes, the solid
pillars upon which our freedom rests.''
   The national cemetery is the resting place for ``Americans for
whom the words duty, honor and country are not just a phrase. They
were a way of life,'' said <PERSON>Quayle</PERSON>, whose military record became the
subject of controversy last year because he had avoided serving in
the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War by joining the <ORGANIZATION>Indiana National Guard</ORGANIZATION> in the late
<DATE>1960s</DATE>.
   Across the <LOCATION>Potomac River</LOCATION> in the shadows of the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Memorial</ORGANIZATION>,
several thousand <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans mingled and talked about
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most recent war. Some have made the trip to the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
Veterans Memorial each Memorial Day since the monument, a
chevron-shaped wall with the names of 58,156 war dead and missing
in action etched in its black granite, was dedicated in <DATE>1982</DATE>.
   The monument, which has become the most popular in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>,
attracts more than 3.6 million visitors a year, according to the
<ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION>.
   This Memorial Day, the ceremony was aimed at honoring the women
who died in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Eight wreaths were placed at locations where
the names of eight women, casualties of the war, are etched into
the wall.
   Veterans who were influential in getting the monument built,
reminded the audience that most <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans returned from the
war zone to a country that was at best indifferent and at times
hostile.
   ``Our nation can never again abandon our soldiers,'' declared
<PERSON>Ronald Gibbs</PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans Memorial Fund board
of directors. ``If we must send our youth off to battle, let's
stand by them to the end with moral conviction and support.''
   Among the thousands of visitors to the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans Memorial
on <DATE>Monday</DATE> were a Soviet general who fought in World War II and a
veteran of the Soviet fighting in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.
   Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Vladamir Orlov</PERSON>, chief of a World War II veterans group
in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Mikhail Vishnyakov</PERSON>, a veteran of the
fighting in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, marveled at the impact of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
memorial.
   The two even traced some of the names, according to <PERSON>John
Wheeler</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran who helped arrange the visit.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s military struggle in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, from which
the country was forced to withdraw after years of fighting, has
been compared to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military involvement in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> provided supplies and weapons to the <LOCATION>North
Vietnamese</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Viet Cong</ORGANIZATION> during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not one Medal of Honor went to any of the 1.5
million blacks who fought in World Wars I and II, a fact historian
<PERSON>Leroy Ramsey</PERSON> wants to change.
   <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> has found the records of two black servicemen he says
deserve the medal: Sgt. <PERSON>Henry Johnson</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Seaman
Dorrie Miller</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. Johnson served in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> during
World War I; <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> in the Second World War. Both
have since died.
   It was an accident that <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON>, also of <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, discovered no
blacks had won the nation's highest military honor for bravery
during the world wars, although blacks have won the medal for
heroic deeds in other wars. It was also a discovery born of anger.
   ``In <DATE>1984</DATE>, I was watching television when they celebrated the
40th anniversary of D-Day in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone
interview last week. ``The president was over there, and the whole
week was as white as a Ku Klux Klan rally.''
   A black World War II veteran himself, <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> got angry that his
experience of the war was not recognized, but turned that emotion
into a useful pursuit.
   ``I decided to do a book on the black American in World War II,
and when I got into my research I began to realize that no black
had received the Medal of Honor in either World War I or World War
II,'' said <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON>, a former associate history professor at <ORGANIZATION>Hofstra
University</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>. ``So I put the book on the back burner
and took off on an effort to see if I could get that righted.''
   Ramsey looked at the records of black servicemen who had won
other high military honors, including the <ORGANIZATION>Distinguished Service
Cross</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>French Croix de Guerre</ORGANIZATION>. He looked into the history of
the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>'s Medal of Honor, established by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1861</DATE>, and the
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s, established in <DATE>1862</DATE>. And, he said, he read the more than
1,200 citations of the Medal of Honor since its inception, ``to
make sure I was on solid ground.''
   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys were
black,'' he said. ``I didn't want any compromising of principle on
the Medal of Honor.''
   Ramsey discovered that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, who fought with the French army,
killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured
a stockpile of weapons all despite severe combat wounds. For his
actions, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> earned the <ORGANIZATION>Croix de Guerre</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s highest
military honor. He died in <DATE>1930</DATE>.
   Miller served at <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> aboard the USS <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>,
<PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> said. When the Japanese attacked, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, a mess steward,
helped move his mortally wounded captain from the ship's bridge,
then returned to man a machine gun, according to <ORGANIZATION>Ramsey</ORGANIZATION>'s research.
   Afterward, the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> awarded <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> a letter of
commendation, but Adm. <PERSON>Chester Nimitz</PERSON>, commander in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>,
upgraded that to the <ORGANIZATION>Navy Cross</ORGANIZATION>, the second-highest award, <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON>
said. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was killed in <DATE>1943</DATE> in a torpedo attack.
   Ramsey built up his case, but for two years, he couldn't get any
public official to listen. He sent copies of a 21-page letter to
every member of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> congressional delegations,
but ``<PERCENT>102 percent</PERCENT> of those people ignored the hell out of me.''
   ``It would have been easier for me to get a Boy Scout merit
badge for a communist,'' he said.
   Finally, he received a letter of support from Rep. <PERSON>Mario Biaggi</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-N.Y.</LOCATION>, but <PERSON>Biaggi</PERSON> became embroiled in criminal trials in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>
and <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON>'s cause languished until <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON>
decided it had merit.
   ``<PERSON>Cuomo</PERSON> wrote me a very long letter and he took the time to
personally write each member of the congressional delegation in
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and ask them to help me,'' <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> said.
   ``Then, as if a voice from the dark, <PERSON>Joe DioGuardi</PERSON> came through.
And the effort never stopped.''
   Last <DATE>October</DATE>, <PERSON>DioGuardi</PERSON>, a Republican congressman from
<LOCATION>Westchester County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON>Mickey Leland</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Texas</LOCATION>,
cosponsored bills to waive the statute of limitations for the Medal
of Honor so both men can be considered for the award.
   In the cases of <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, both the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> have
opposed the bills, which are now before the <ORGANIZATION>House Armed Services
Committee</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>DioGuardi</PERSON> said.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> did not specify why, according to <PERSON>DioGuardi</PERSON>, but the
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> laid out several reasons in a letter to Rep. <PERSON>Les Aspin</PERSON>,
<LOCATION>D-Wisc.</LOCATION>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Services Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Delbert L. Spurlock</PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> for
manpower and reserve affairs, wrote that while others, including
members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, had written to the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> requesting special
consideration for <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, ``At this late date, it would be
inappropriate to single out former <PERSON>Sergeant Johnson</PERSON> for award of
the Medal of Honor and to provide preferential treatment to him
over the thousands of other black soldiers who served so bravely in
combat.''
   Spurlock also said that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s records were destroyed in a
fire in <DATE>1973</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Personnel Records Center</ORGANIZATION>,
although <PERSON>Ramsey</PERSON> said he obtained certified copies from archives in
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> state.
   <PERSON>DioGuardi</PERSON> said he would not give up the fight.

<HEAD>First Stone Laid for Monument to Soldiers Killed in Afghanistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first stone was laid <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for a monument in
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to the more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers who have been killed
fighting in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency said.
   The monument, which includes an eternal flame to the dead, will
be built in <LOCATION>Friendship Park</LOCATION>, a popular spot in the Soviet capital's
northwest near the <LOCATION>Moscow River</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said.
   It said veterans of the Afghan war sang songs at a ceremony for
the laying of the cornerstone <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, a day celebrated here as
``Soviet Youth Day.''
   The creation of the memorial was a sign that the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>
may be increasingly coming to grips with the costs of the war it
did not win.
   During much of the 8{-year Soviet involvement in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>,
the state-run media and officials made scant mention of Soviet
soldiers who had been killed. Many of the war dead were buried with
no hint on their tombstones of where or why they had died.
   The Soviets have been more frank about the casualties under
<PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s policy of ``glasnost,'' or openess.
   The government disclosed on <DATE>May 25</DATE> that 13,310 Soviet troops had
been killed and 35,478 wounded since the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> intervened in
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1979</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> began withdrawing its
troops on <DATE>May 15</DATE> under a U.N.-brokered agreement concluded the
previous month.
   Tass said the war monument will be erected to ``Soviet soldiers
who died while fulfilling their internationalist duty in
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.'' According to official Soviet thinking, the <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION>
did not intervene in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, but came to the aid of a Marxist
government beleaguered by a nationwide insurgency.
   Tass said that for <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s ceremony, a lamp was lit at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier near the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> that honors World War II
dead, and brought to the spot in <LOCATION>Friendship Park</LOCATION> where the
cornerstone was laid.
   The lamp will be kept by the state-sanctioned <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Peace
Committee</ORGANIZATION> until the monument is completed, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said.
   Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Peace Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> city organization
of the military reserve collected donations for the monument and
for the construction of a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers
wounded in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> has agreed to review the records of
black World War I heroes following an acknowledgement by <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Frank Carlucci</PERSON> that racial discrimination ``could well
have extended to individual decisions leading to the awarding of
medals,'' a lawmaker said <DATE>Thursday</DATE>.
   Rep. <PERSON>Joseph DioGuardi</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-N.Y.</LOCATION>, made the disclosure in releasing
letters from <PERSON>Carlucci</PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> official.
   DioGuardi and Rep. <PERSON>Mickey Leland</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Texas</LOCATION>, have been seeking
posthumous Medals of Honor for two black servicemen: <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Sgt.
<PERSON>Henry Johnson</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, who served during World War I; and
<PERSON>Navy Seaman Dorrie Miller</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, who died in World War II.
   The congressmen introduced legislation last <DATE>October</DATE> that would
have waived the five-year statute of limitations governing the
awarding of Medals of Honor, opening the way for consideration of
the <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> cases. But because of <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> objections,
the bills stalled in the <ORGANIZATION>House Armed Services Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
   DioGuardi and <LOCATION>Leland</LOCATION>, along with 102 colleagues, wrote to
<PERSON>Carlucci</PERSON> in <DATE>June</DATE>, and the letter released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> was the
secretary's reply.
   ``It is clear that unjust discrimination existed during World
Wars I and II that could well have extended to individual decisions
leading to the awarding of medals in recognition of heroic
actions,'' <PERSON>Carlucci</PERSON> wrote.
   ``As you know, while there were a number of instances where
black World War I and World War II service members were recognized
by individual awards for heroism, none was awarded the Medal of
Honor.''
   Some 1.5 million blacks served in the world wars.
   <PERSON>Carlucci</PERSON> emphasized that the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> ``does not
support a symbolic award'' of the Medal of Honor, the nation's
highest military honor. He also reiterated the department's
objections to bills singling out <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> ``when many
other individuals might have been equally deserving.''
   ``Nevertheless, I am willing as a result of your expressed
concern to conduct further research to examine the conditions
existing in the past concerning award of decorations and medals and
the extent to which racial discrimination might have been part of
those conditions,'' the secretary wrote.
   DioGuardi also released a letter from <ORGANIZATION>Assistant Defense</ORGANIZATION>
Secretary <PERSON>Grant S. Green Jr.</PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> will review the war
records of blacks who served in World War I and received French
military honors or the <ORGANIZATION>Distinguished Service Cross</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s
second-highest honor.
   ``Research will be difficult because of the passage of time and
the destruction of so many records in the fire at the <ORGANIZATION>National
Personnel Records Center</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1973</DATE>,'' Green wrote.
   He estimated that the review, which has already begun, would
take ``in excess of six months.''
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> research will cover servicemen from the all-black 92nd
and 93rd Divisions during World War I and will attempt ``to
ascertain why Sgt. <PERSON>Henry Johnson</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>93rd Division</ORGANIZATION>,
was not recognized by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> for his actions in combat and
for wounds received in action,'' Green wrote.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> will also try to identify any black World War I
soldiers who were recommended for the Medal of Honor but were
disapproved or received lesser awards, he said.
   In a handwritten footnote, <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> said he has asked the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ``to
report back to us on the magnitude of doing something similar for
WWII.''
   Blacks were denied naval combat duty during World War I, making
such research unnecessary, <PERSON>DioGuardi</PERSON> said. But he said he is trying
to get the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> to do similar research into black soldiers who
served in World War II.
   <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, was on sentry duty <TIME>one night</TIME> when
he killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and
captured a stockpile of weapons, despite being severely wounded
himself. He received the <ORGANIZATION>Croix de Guerre</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s highest military
honor.
   <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was serving as a mess steward aboard the USS <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>
when the ship was attacked at <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>. After the captain was
mortally wounded, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> dragged him off deck. Miller then manned a
machine gun and shot down two enemy aircraft.
   He was awarded the <ORGANIZATION>Navy Cross</ORGANIZATION>, the service's second highest
honor, and was killed when his ship was torpedoed in <DATE>1943</DATE>.

   The mournful sound of buglers playing taps and the cadence of
marchers in Memorial Day parades helped Americans remember those
who died fighting for their country, while beaches and parks were
packed with holiday revelers.
   A sea of fluttering American flags marked the 72,000 graves at
<ORGANIZATION>Willamette National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION>. Officials planned
ceremonies of remembrance today at <ORGANIZATION>Arlington National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION>Vietnam Memorial</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON>William Westmoreland</PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
troops in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> during the war, planned to speak after a parade
honoring soldiers who died in the Civil War battle 125 years ago
this <DATE>summer</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION>, a brass band today planned to wend its way
through a pioneer cemetery to salute a <DATE>19th century</DATE> madam called
``the hooker with a heart of gold.''
   And on <LOCATION>Attu Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, Americans and Japanese erected a
monument that was to be dedicated to the thousands of soldiers from
both sides of the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> who died there _ the site of the only
World War II battle fought on North American soil.
   A snowstorm in the <LOCATION>Southwest</LOCATION> stranded some campers in <ORGANIZATION>Cedar
Breaks National Monument</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and whipped up waves that sank an
unoccupied 60-foot houseboat on <PERSON>Lake Powell</PERSON>, authorities said.
   Temperatures in the 80s lured hundreds of thousands of
sunbathers to beaches from <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>.
   ``It's like the people are saying, `Welcome to <DATE>summer</DATE>,''' said
police Sgt. <PERSON>William Selig</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Rockport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION> ``It's like this until
the cold weather comes. In a few months we'll be looking forward to
fall.''
   In <LOCATION>Ocean City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION>, a swimmer drowned in the ocean 90 minutes
before lifeguards went on duty <DATE>Saturday</DATE> for the first time in the
season, police said.
   An estimated 100,000 people headed to <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> beaches on
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> to enjoy sun and sand on the opening weekend of the <DATE>summer</DATE>
beach season.
   Lifeguards were on duty for the first time this year at the
city's <LOCATION>Jones Beach State Park</LOCATION>, but there wasn't much for them to do
because of the cold water.
   ``Most people are just sunbathing,'' said <PERSON>Joseph Lescinski</PERSON>, park
superintendent.
   About 10,000 people, mostly bikers, ended their two-day <ORGANIZATION>American
Motorcycle Jamboree</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Cobleskill</LOCATION>, 30 miles west of
<LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   ``I didn't see a single wheelie,'' Mayor <PERSON>Nicholas Iorio</PERSON> said.
   The pace was quicker in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, where an estimated 350,000 to
450,000 people watched <DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s 72nd running of the <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION>
500. About 100 people were arrested in prerace revelry, and one man
died after falling out of a pickup truck, police said.
   <PERSON>Rick Mears</PERSON>, 36, overcame an early one-lap deficit to win the
race for the third time in his career.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Prospect Hill Preservation Brass Band</ORGANIZATION> planned its
eighth-annual Memorial Day tribute to <PERSON>Anna Wilson</PERSON>, who ran <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>'s
highest-priced house of ill repute for 30 years before donating it
to the city as a hospital shortly before her death in <DATE>1911</DATE>.
   In <LOCATION>Menands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, a veterans group took time out from the
<DATE>weekend</DATE> sun and fun to honor President <PERSON>Chester A. Arthur</PERSON>, who is
buried in the <ORGANIZATION>Albany Rural Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Nobody else had opted in an official capacity to do anything
for this former president,'' said <PERSON>Martin O'Connell</PERSON>, organizer of
the memorial service for the nation's 21st president, who served
from 1881-1885. ``I think it's shameful that the federal government
should ignore the grave of a former commander-in-chief on Memorial
Day weekend.''
   In <LOCATION>Hackensack</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, submarine veterans <DATE>Sunday</DATE> held their 15th
annual ceremony in memory of the 52 submarines lost in World War II
and peace time.
   A wreath was tossed into <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION> from the 190-year-old USS
Constitution, the nation's oldest commissioned warship.
   And about 1,200 Boy Scouts, <PERSON>Girl Scouts</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brownies</PERSON> and Cub Scouts
placed flags on all 78,200 graves at <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``You can see all those who fought, but it's sad because they

   A Jewish soldier who says he saved his
battalion by singlehandedly shooting to death more than 500
Japanese soldiers may soon receive the Medal of Honor he believes
was denied because of his religion.
   Marshaling the support of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator, an authenticated
photograph taken from the body of a Japanese soldier, and
affidavits from two former commanders, <PERSON>David S. Rubitsky</PERSON> thinks he
has enough evidence to win official recognition 47 years after the
deed.
   Rubitsky, 72, believes he was nominated for a Medal of Honor
during World War II but denied the award because of the actions of
an anti-Semitic commander. He has vowed to keep fighting for the
award.
   ``If I give up, I'm beaten and I'm a fighter,'' <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> said in
an interview last year. ``If I lose, the Jewish people lose and
then I'm going to let them down.''
   According to <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s story, the heroic deed took place <DATE>Dec.
1-2, 1942</DATE>, in a <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> swamp known as ``The Triangle,'' during
an attack by Japanese troops on <ORGANIZATION>Rubitsky's 128th Infantry</ORGANIZATION> unit.
   The former communications sergeant jumped into a machine gun
fortification after it was abandoned by other soldiers and fired
nearly 3,500 rounds of ammunition on the Japanese during 21 hours.
   Officials investigating <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s complaint said a photograph
discovered this <DATE>spring</DATE> has brought strong credence to his claim.
They officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rubitsky came across the photograph in <DATE>March</DATE> while visiting an
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> companion in <LOCATION>Mesa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz</LOCATION>. The photograph, reportedly taken from
the pocket of dead Japanese soldier, shows a group picture of a
Japanese military unit.
   A handwritten message in Japanese on the back said the picture's
bearer had decided to commit suicide after he and other officers
sent men into a battle in which ``600 fine Japanese soldiers died
because of a solitary American soldier.''
   <PERSON>Sen. Herbert Kohl</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Wis.</LOCATION>, began working on <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s behalf in
<DATE>January</DATE> and had the photograph examined this <DATE>spring</DATE>.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION> confirmed the photo was printed on paper from
<DATE>1942</DATE> and the writing was from ink produced in <DATE>1942</DATE>. The note on the
back was interpreted by the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``Based on my review of the evidence, as well as the contacts my
office has had with <PERSON>Mr. Rubitsky</PERSON>, I have concluded that he earned
the Medal of Honor,'' <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> said.
   Maj. <PERSON>Joe Padilla</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Army Awards Branch</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>,
said a review of <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s case began in <DATE>January 1988</DATE> and a
decision should be issued by the end of the year.
   Under Title 10 of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Code, all recommendations for a medal
from World War II had to have been submitted by <DATE>May 1951</DATE>. Thus
investigators must determine whether a recommendation was made for
<PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>, and if so whether anti-Semitism played on role in the
denial of the award, <PERSON>Padilla</PERSON> said.
   He said the investigation into the medal ``must prove
incontestable evidence. This is very difficult to do, after nearly
half a century.''
   Rubitsky has declined interviews recently, saying he wants to
wait for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s decision.
   But in an editorial he wrote for the <LOCATION>Milwaukee Sentinel</LOCATION> <DATE>last
year</DATE>, he said he was told in <DATE>1986</DATE> that his former commanding
officers had nominated him for a medal.<PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> said he then began
investigating why he hadn't received it.
   <PERSON>Joseph Stehling</PERSON>, a retired brigadier general who lives in <ORGANIZATION>Beaver
Dam</ORGANIZATION>, signed an affidavit outlining <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s actions and
confirming he nominated <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> for the honor. Retired Gen.
<PERSON>Herbert Smith</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>September</DATE>, signed a similar affidavit.
   Another affidavit signed by a military messenger said Col. <PERSON>John
Mott</PERSON>, now dead, had denied <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> his medal because <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> was
Jewish.
   In the <DATE>1988</DATE> interview, <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> said he had received numerous
anti-Semitic phone calls and threats after deciding to fight for
the medal.
   ``It's not really the medal,'' he said. ``It is the
anti-Semitism that existed then and still exists now. I want people
to know there is still discrimination.''

   The white marble headstone on <PERSON>Vladimir
Mikhalev</PERSON>'s grave is a reminder in this bastion of World War II
valor that he died in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, but there is no monument to
those who fought the war the Soviets didn't win.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s 115,000 troops are to begin the long-awaited
march home this <DATE>spring</DATE>. And the nation must deal with the problem
of how to remember those who served and those who died in
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.
   The human losses suffered since Soviet soldiers entered
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1979</DATE> and the emotional wounds were
unmentionable topics in <DATE>1981</DATE>, when <PERSON>Mikhalev</PERSON>, 23, was buried in
Chizhukovskoye cemetery among the heroes of World War II.
   The troops were sent in to defeat a revolt by anti-communists
and leave behind an Afghan army capable of standing on its own.
Neither goal was fulfilled, war weariness has set in and Soviets
are now anxious for withdrawal.
   The Afghan war has left many returning soldiers deeply disturbed
by their tour of duty in that Asian land. Drug addiction, a
predilection for violence, apathy, disease, crippling wounds and
broken marriages also are byproducts of the Afghan war.
   Significantly, the veterans are called ``the Afghans'' by many
Soviets _ a clear sign, say many returning soldiers, that they are
branded as outcasts.
   In few other cities is the contrast between the social status of
Afghan veterans and those who struggled against the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> more
apparent than in <LOCATION>Minsk</LOCATION>, a ``Hero City'' virtually destroyed in
World War II and rebuilt as a monument to Soviet suffering and
perseverance.
   Every major intersection and park has a war memorial or statue
depicting a local hero. Here and in other cities, veterans of what
is known as the Great Patriotic War proudly wear their medals and
campaign ribbons.
   But not a single memorial has been erected in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>
to the soldiers killed in the 8-year-old Soviet military
intervention in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.
   The sole reminders are the stern young faces and bronze busts of
young men staring from graveyards around the country. Few
tombstones say the youths were killed in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, but all who
pass by know the meaning of the inscription ``he died while
fulfilling his internationalist duty.''
   At Chizhukovskoye cemetery, the plaque on <ORGANIZATION>Vladislav Ivanovsky</ORGANIZATION>'s
headstone is engraved with rare directness: ``Perished in
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>.''
   An estimated 10,000 Soviets died in the war that was
unmentionable until Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>'s drive for
``glasnost,'' or openness, made it acceptable conversation.
   The casualty estimates by Western sources pale in comparison
with the 20 million Soviets killed during World War II. But grief
is no easier for survivors of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> victims, and veterans
from both conflicts acknowledge the problem goes deeper than
numbers.
   ``It's been 40 years since World War II,'' <PERSON>Sergei Kuznetsov</PERSON> told
an American reporter at a recent meeting of Afghan vets in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>.
``We are sometimes an uncomfortable reminder to those accustomed to
peace.''
   Soviets cling to the euphemisms used to label their activity in
<LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>, denying it was a war, contending they never sought
victory, and always lowering their voices when the subject comes up.
   ``It cannot be said that we went there to win. We went there to
help,'' explained <PERSON>Alexander Maslov</PERSON>, a metal worker in <LOCATION>Minsk</LOCATION> who
alongside his twin brother <PERSON>Mikhail</PERSON> served two years in <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION>. ``The
leadership of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> asked us to help.''
   A tone of defensiveness permeates his discussion of the war.
``There is no reason to consider this a mistake,'' the 24-year-old
veteran said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>'s decision to send in
troops. ``If it were necessary, we would do it again.''
   The Maslov twins contend <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> veterans receive priority
for housing and jobs. Yet each lives with his wife and child in a
single room of a city dormitory.
   State-run media have come a long way in the past few years in
acknowledging that Soviet soldiers were involved in combat and that
there was resistance at home, from fearful mothers of draft-age
boys to advisers at the top levels of power.
   The Soviets' experience in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> is similar to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
soldiers' service in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War was brought home
to Americans daily through media coverage that focused as much on
individual suffering as on the political issues involved.
   In contrast, Soviet media have carefully sanitized reports to
cast the conflict as a ``situation around <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>'' brought
about by imperialist interference.
   Spurred on by glasnost, about 2,000 Afghanistan veterans groups
have sprung up around the country to talk to school children about
their service, to help widows and mothers, and to talk over
experiences they say outsiders don't understand.
   In <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sergei Kuznetsov</PERSON>'s group, which gathers on occasional
<DATE>Saturdays</DATE>, has found a medium in song for issues most of the men
find difficult to openly discuss.
   The mournful ballads about buddies killed in battle and the
frustration of fighting a distant and little understood war have
been collected and issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Young Guard</ORGANIZATION> recording company.
   One song reflects veterans' disillusionment, and a glimmer of
the belief that Soviet involvement in a foreign civil war was
pointless. In part, it says:
   ``They fight for the prophet <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON>,
   ``While we defend only our Soviet truck.''
   ``The Return,'' a short documentary making its way into Soviet
theaters, for the first time shows wounded soldiers and blown up
tanks, and talks with troubled veterans and a bereaved mother.
   ``I'm a terrible enemy of this war,'' says a tearful <PERSON>Klavdia
Ilyin</PERSON>, with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the
background. ``I don't see why our children are there.''
   Newspapers have announced fund-raising campaigns to erect
monuments to the ``soldier-internationalists,'' and articles in the
national dailies have decried the second-class treatment of Afghan
veterans by those who don't want to be reminded of the war.
   ``Most people think our boys have been down there planting
flowers and building roads,'' observed one World War II veteran in
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. ``How can they earn the respect they deserve when so few
know what they have done?''

<HEAD>Kohl Says `Hard' Talks with Gorbachev, Clash on Berlin
Reunification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor <PERSON>Helmut Kohl</PERSON> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> he
and President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> failed to agree on whether to
reunify <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, but signed accords to help the sick Soviet food
industry and put a West German in space.
   The chancellor earlier highlighted his concern for human rights
by meeting with <PERSON>Andrei D. Sakharov</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> laureate
at the West German ambassador's residence.
   Kohl, speaking to reporters before a second round of talks with
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, took a philosophical view to the dispute over <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> that
surfaced in banquet speeches the night before.
   ``The last word of history is neither spoken by me or by <PERSON>Mr.
Gorbachev</PERSON>,'' <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> said.
   In a dinner speech, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> had said of the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> dispute:
   ``The attempts to upset what has been created in the (postwar)
process or push through unrealistic policies is an unpredictable and
even dangerous business.''
   He appeared to be referring to <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>'s proposal for a change in
the status of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> and closer relations between <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> member <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION> and Moscow-aligned <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>.
   Since the end of World War II, <LOCATION>West Berlin</LOCATION> has been under the
control of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, the victorious
allies. The city has been divided since <DATE>1961</DATE> by a wall that
symbolizes the East-West hostility of the Cold War. Kohl said in a
radio interview in <DATE>January</DATE> ``there can be no real improvement in
relations between <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> if <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> is not included.''
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> told reporters he was not surprised by
<PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s remarks on <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>.
   ``The world can't be changed in a couple of hours,'' he said,
adding that he was optimistic agreement eventually could be reached.
   Kohl said <DATE>Monday</DATE>'s talks had been ``often and in part hard.''
   The two met again <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, but a <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency dispatch on the
session did not say whether they discussed the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> dispute.
   Tass said aides signed agreements, including one on the peaceful
uses of outer space. It said the pact provides for the possibility
that a West German would fly aboard the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s orbiting
space station, <LOCATION>Mir</LOCATION>. West German officials said the pact also could
have German astronauts join Soviets in traveling to Mars in <DATE>1994</DATE>.
   West Germans have traveled to space in <DATE>1983</DATE> and <DATE>1985</DATE> aboard the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> space shuttle.
   During recent visits by Austrian and Italian leaders, the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> invited citizens of those countries to fly aboard the Mir
station. Next month, French President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> is to
observe the launch of a French-Soviet space crew to the station.
   Another agreement signed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> calls for West German companies
to help modernize about 200 Soviet food and consumer goods
factories, <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>, faced with growing
complaints, has placed priority on eliminating food and consumer
goods shortages.
   Kohl met earlier <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with Soviet Premier <PERSON>Nikolai I. Ryzhkov</PERSON>
to discuss economic cooperation, which includes a <MONEY>$1.6 billion</MONEY>
German credit to the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> to finance exports in food, leather,
textile and clothing.
   Sakharov, the founding father of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> Soviet dissident
movement told Kohl there still are political prisoners in the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> and they must be released and rehabilitated, according to
German spokesman <PERSON>Friedhelm Ost</PERSON>.
   Sakharov was banished to the closed city of Gorky in <DATE>1980</DATE> for
criticizing the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION>'s military push into <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>
allowed him to return to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> in <DATE>December 1986</DATE>.
   Kohl, who arrived in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> on a four-day visit <DATE>Monday</DATE>, paid
homage <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to Soviet and German victims of World War II. In
freezing weather and under an gray sky, <PERSON>Kohl</PERSON> laid a wreath at the
Soviet Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beside the <ORGANIZATION>Kremlin</ORGANIZATION> wall. The
ceremony, a protocol must for foreign dignitaries visiting <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>,
takes on a special poignancy when performed by a German.
   ``The distinguished guest honored by a minute of silence the
memory of millions of Soviet people who died in the Great Patriotic
War of 1941-45,'' <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said in a brief report.
   An unknown Soviet soldier killed in <DATE>1941</DATE> when the Werhmacht was
at the gates of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> is buried in the tomb, which is topped by an
eternal flame. Total Soviet losses in World War II are officially
put at 20 million, but some Soviet historians suggest that figure is
far too low.
   Kohl then was driven to a walled cemetery in the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> district
of <LOCATION>Lyublino</LOCATION>, where 596 German soldiers who were taken prisoner by
the <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION> during World War II and later died in captivity are
buried.
   On a dark granite obelisk at the cemetery's entrance, the words
``for peace and reconcilation'' are carved in Russian. Prior to
<PERSON>Kohl</PERSON>'s arrival, a solitary flower had been placed on each German
soldier's grave in the front row.
   Kohl laid a wreath and walked between the graves, whose stone
border had been freshly painted white.

   World War I hero <PERSON>Alvin York</PERSON> has a statue on
the grounds of the <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> state Capitol. His life, like that of
World War II hero <PERSON>Audie Murphy</PERSON>, was made into a Hollywood movie.
   <PERSON>Joe Hooper</PERSON> has nothing.
   The most decorated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War lies nearly
forgotten near the Tomb of the Unknowns at <ORGANIZATION>Arlington National
Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>, another symbol of a war the nation would just as soon
forget.
   In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state, where <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> grew up and lived much of his
life, there is no individual monument to his memory and the deeds
that won him 37 citations, including the Medal of Honor.
   Plans to rename various public buildings or parks after <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON>
have been in the works for years. It isn't that anyone is opposed to
them, but more often they seem to stall for lack of interest.
   That may soon change.
   Rep. <PERSON>Rod Chandler</PERSON>, <LOCATION>R-Wash.</LOCATION>, plans to introduce a bill in <DATE>January</DATE>
to rename the substance-abuse wing of the <ORGANIZATION>Veterans Administration</ORGANIZATION>
hospital in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> after the man who won the nation's highest
military honor, plus two Silver Stars and 11 Purple Hearts.
   The office of <PERSON>Sen. Brock Adams</PERSON>, <LOCATION>D-Wash.</LOCATION>, is leading a separate
drive to get the VA to do the same thing, without <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> having to
pass a bill.
   And some efforts have started in <PERSON>Moses Lake</PERSON>, where <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> grew
up, to rename a city park or erect a memorial to him.
   Why has it taken so long?
   ``The unpopularity of the war has shifted over to a bias against
the individuals who served in the war,'' speculated <PERSON>Jim Gunsolus</PERSON>,
the <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> aide working on the <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> effort.
   Part of the reason may have been <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> himself, who drank his
way out of the military and a variety of jobs after the war, failed
to play the part of war hero for the government, and died from a
fall in a motel room in <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> at age 40.
   <PERSON>Donald Ross</PERSON>, a Medal of Honor historian in <LOCATION>Port Orchard</LOCATION> who knew
<PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> well, said a small number of recipients are ``unable to live
and honor the Medal of Honor.''
   ``He was one of them,'' said <PERSON>Ross</PERSON>, who served at <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> and
is a Medal of Honor winner himself. ``It was too much of a load for
him.''
   Another friend said <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> couldn't bear what he witnessed as an
employee of the VA hospital in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
   ``It just got too much for him and he couldn't stand all the
misery around here,'' said <PERSON>Joe Feldman</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>American Legion</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON>'s peacetime life was in sharp contrast to his 30 months in
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   The Medal of Honor citation, covering six hours of combat near
Hue on <DATE>Feb. 21, 1968</DATE>, relates astonishing exploits _ killing two
dozen enemy, rescuing six of his men and suffering seven wounds.
   Hooper, then a 29-year-old sergeant, crossed a river through
enemy fire and with his men overran several bunkers. He then ran
into heavy gunfire to help his wounded men, suffering serious wounds
but refusing medical treatment.
   Then, he singlehandedly stormed three enemy bunkers, destroying
them with hand grenades and rifle fire, and also killing two enemy
soldiers who had attacked his unit's chaplain.
   Leading his men forward, <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> destroyed three buildings housing
enemy riflemen, and killed a North Vietnamese officer with his
bayonet.
   His initial wounds now compounded by grenade fragments, <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON>
raced down a small trench, hurling hand grenades to destroy four
enemy bunkers.
   He then ran across an open field, still under enemy fire, to
rescue a wounded man. Upon reaching that man, <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> was attacked by
an enemy soldier and killed him with a pistol.
   He then killed three North Vietnamese officers with rifle fire,
reorganized his men, and did not consent to evacuation until the
following morning.
   What the citation doesn't say is that 189 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers began the
river crossing and <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> was among just 14 who survived.
   Hospitalized for his wounds, he broke out of the hospital to
return to his unit. In the <DATE>next two days</DATE>, <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> and 10 other
soldiers ambushed 600 enemy fighters, earning him a Silver Star and
another bullet wound.
   <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> was discharged shortly after, but found civilian life
boring and re-enlisted a few months later.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, which had been unable to locate him after the
discharge, awarded <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> the Medal of Honor and he became a
celebrity.
   He served in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> as a recruiter, and in the <LOCATION>Panama Canal
Zone</LOCATION> as a courier. But things went badly, and he opted to rejoin the
101st Airborne in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   He won a second Silver Star and more medals, received a
battlefield commission to lieutenant, and ultimately returned to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to work at a basic training company.
   But he didn't like being an officer and eventually resigned,
ending 18 years of service that began in <DATE>1956</DATE> when he enlisted in
the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION>.
   He returned to the <LOCATION>Yakima</LOCATION> area, where friends said he was often
drinking and carrying a pistol. He also was arthritic and suffered
<PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> disability because of his wounds.
   Friends tried to help <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON> with jobs and support, but he often
failed to show up for work before his fatal fall in a <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION>
motel room on <DATE>May 6, 1979</DATE>, <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said.
   ``I know it was alcohol-related,'' <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>Hooper</PERSON>, who left behind a wife and a daughter, was buried at
<LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> with full military honors. His name was put on a plaque
honoring all <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Medal of Honor winners at the state capital
in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION>.
   Other than that, he was mostly forgotten.
   Both <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON>, the most decorated <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> serviceman of World
War II, have VA hospitals named after them.
   ``People look at <PERSON>Audie Murphy</PERSON> and people like that and these guys
are national heroes,'' said <PERSON>Steve Witter</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Chandler</LOCATION> spokesman.
``It's appropriate that (<PERSON>Hooper</PERSON>) be recognized for what he did.''

   Americans and Norwegians on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> honored
a young army captain who became the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier to die in
World War II when he was killed in a German air raid.
   Capt. <PERSON>Robert M. Losey</PERSON> died <DATE>April 21, 1940</DATE> at age 31 in the
central Norwegian village of Dombaas. He was on a mission to help
American civilians flee the <DATE>April 1940</DATE> German invasion of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>.
   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Norwegian officials and war veterans joined 400 people
for the ceremony in the village memorial park, laying a wreath on
an eight-foot-high stone monument marking his death.
   ``Capt. <PERSON>Losey</PERSON>'s sacrifice was followed by the battle deaths of
292,131 Americans later in the war,'' said <PERSON>Loret Ruppe</PERSON>, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
ambassador to <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. ``Just as Captain <PERSON>Losey</PERSON> is now forever linked
to Dombaas, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> are forever linked in
friendship and remembrance.''
   A native of <LOCATION>Andrews</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Losey</PERSON> was killed when German bombs
exploded near a mountain tunnel where he had sought shelter. The
attack came nearly 20 months before the Japanese attacked <LOCATION>Pearl
Harbor</LOCATION>, which drew the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> into the war.
   A <DATE>1929</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> graduate, <PERSON>Losey</PERSON> was buried at <LOCATION>West
Point</LOCATION>.
   Losey was an army air attache and aide to <LOCATION>Florence Harriman</LOCATION>, the
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> minister, or senior diplomat, in <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>. They were to lead the
evacuation of American personnel from <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION> to neutral <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>.
   Losey, arriving from <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>, joined <PERSON>Mrs. Harriman</PERSON> near the
Swedish border and volunteered to go to Dombaas, an important
railroad and highway junction 150 miles north of <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION>.
   Losey felt the trip was too dangerous to risk a senior diplomat.
Dombass, a mountain village, was bombed heavily by the Germans
after an unsuccessful paratroop attack.
   During an air raid, <PERSON>Losey</PERSON> moved closer to the entrance to the
entrance of the tunnel he was in to observe the attack. One bomb
exploded near the entrance, killing <PERSON>Losey</PERSON> and several British
soldiers.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Harriman</PERSON>, who eventually made it to <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, later said
the news of <PERSON>Losey</PERSON>'s death ``was a horrible shock.''
   In the early days of the war, she wrote her ``sense of loss in
the world was centered in that one young American.''

   The epitaphs provide fascinating and powerful historical
footnotes.
   The story of <PERSON>Thomas Selfridge</PERSON>, the nation's first military pilot
to die in a plane crash, is told on one tombstone. <PERSON>Selfridge</PERSON> ``gave
up his life in the service of his country at <LOCATION>Fort Myer</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, <DATE>Sept.
17, 1908</DATE> in falling with the first government aeroplane.''
   <PERSON>Selfridge</PERSON>, a 26-year-old first lieutenant, was experimenting
with <PERSON>Orville Wright</PERSON> at the time. <ORGANIZATION>Selfridge Air Force Base</ORGANIZATION> in
<LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> is named after him.
   <PERSON>Walter Schulze</PERSON>'s tragic story is told on his tombstone. <PERSON>Schulze</PERSON>,
the 138th ``aero squadron'' captain was killed on <DATE>June 28, 1919</DATE>, in
a plane crash in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> as he was returning from delivering word
to the American troops east of the <LOCATION>Rhine River</LOCATION> that World War I had
officially ended.
   One tombstone with Chinese characters stands over the grave of
Ying-hsing Wen, a <DATE>1909</DATE> West Point graduate who went on to be a
lieutenant general in the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Army</ORGANIZATION>.
   One of the most poignant tombstones stands over the grave shared
by 1st Lt. <PERSON>John A. Fera</PERSON>, class of <DATE>1966</DATE>, who was killed two years
later in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, and his father, Maj. <PERSON>Milo A. Fera</PERSON>, who served in

Polish President <PERSON>Wojciech Jaruzelski</PERSON> went to the <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> Forest on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and 
paid tribute to the thousands of Polish army officers killed and buried there 
by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s secret police during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
His visit came one day after the Soviet government reversed nearly 50 years of 
official denial and admitted committing the massacre. The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> had long 
blamed <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth was said about <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>, and the truth is healing the wounds," 
<PERSON>Jaruzelski</PERSON> said in Russian, his voice soft and wavering with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it will be easier for us to understand each other," he told Soviet 
reporters. The <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> massacre has long been a strain on relations between the 
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski was accompanied by an honor guard of the Polish army at the memorial 
site in the forest near the western town of <LOCATION>Smolensk</LOCATION> as he honored the more 
than 4,000 officers killed in <DATE>1940</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s secret police, the Polish <ORGANIZATION>PAP</ORGANIZATION> 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
A "roll call of the dead" was intoned -- a ceremony in which the names of 
victims were read, <ORGANIZATION>PAP</ORGANIZATION> said. 
</P>
<P>
In footage broadcast on Soviet TV's evening newscast "Vremya," <PERSON>Jaruzelski</PERSON>, 
wearing a green army overcoat, green scarf and military cap, stood ramrod 
straight as two soldiers carried a large wreath of red and white carnations and 
laid it in front of a memorial to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
The monument reads in Russian: "To the Polish officers fallen in <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Polish radio reported <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that the wording on the monument was 
changed three days ago, removing the words that blamed <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<ORGANIZATION>PAP</ORGANIZATION> added that <PERSON>Jaruzelski</PERSON> wrote in the visitor's book: 
</P>
<P>
"They fought for an independent <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. They died innocently, far removed from 
their families and homeland. They were faithful to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and to military honor 
until they breathed their last. In tribute and in lasting memory to Polish 
officers, victims of the cruel Stalinist crime." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski also went to the town of Lenino in the nearby republic of 
<LOCATION>Byelorussia</LOCATION> and laid wreaths on the graves of Soviet and Polish soldiers at a 
memorial there, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> reported. 
</P>
<P>
The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> admitted that the <ORGANIZATION>NKVD</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s feared secret 
police, was responsible for the murders 49 years ago of the Polish officers who 
had been captured at the start of World War II.

<LEADPARA>  Before the war started in the Persian Gulf, researchers at the University of
Colorado gave their computer a bleak assignment: predict how many soldiers, of
all nationalities, will die in the battlefields of Iraq and Kuwait.;    When
the numbers started clicking into place, they were so bad the dismayed members
of the Long Range Analysis of War Project ran them again. And again. But the
computer's forecast was relentless. Hundreds of thousands dead, with the
possibility of final totals creeping over one million.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We're not in the business of scaring people. But this is what we think is
most likely to happen," said <PERSON>Claudio Cioffi-Revilla</PERSON>, director of the war
project.;    "That doesn't mean it will. It's a probability, an estimate for
an event which is still under way. But, it does fit the historical models very
well, so there is some confidence to it.";    The high end of the death
estimate assumes a long conflict in which Iraqi President <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> keeps
reinforcing his 1.2-million-soldier army.;    The results of the computer
model were so compelling that Cioffi-Revilla and his colleagues at the
university's <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION> campus contacted officials in both the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Iraqi
governments, before the <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> deadline for war passed, to warn them of the
chance for massive fatalities.;    "We don't usually do that," Cioffi-Revilla
said. "But, in this case, it's as if you had a seismographic station and you
came up with a prediction of a major earthquake -- just before the event is
due to begin. It seemed to be irresponsible not to make this information
available to decision makers.";    The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> has refused to comment about
the computer estimates.;    The bulk of those deaths would be Iraqi, according
to the computer's analysis. The <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> group -- and other experts in
war-fatality estimates -- think <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military deaths are most likely to top
out between 40,000 and 50,000.;    Most agree that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION>'s casualty
estimates, projecting between 10,000 and 20,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> deaths, are too low. The
defense department has another set of casualty projections, considered very
accurate, that it has declared classified.;    "Utterly optimistic," said
<PERSON>Bruce Russett</PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION>, about the
government's public forecast. Russett, editor of the Journal of Conflict
Resolution, said in <DATE>December</DATE> that he expected tens of thousands of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> deaths
and injuries and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi casualties.;    So far
American losses, including some sporadic ground battles, have been reported at
less than 20 deaths; military experts say there are indications that 10,000
Iraqi soldiers have died, most crushed to death in bombed out bunkers. The
Iraqis have insisted that their losses have been low, and the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> has
refused to release its own estimates of Iraqi casualties.;    "We're going to
see a whole lot worse than that once we get into a significant ground war,"
<PERSON>Russett</PERSON> said. "And that's based not only on academic analysis, but on
conversations with some high-level military people. It's always a mistake to
be too optimistic, because there are a hell of a lot of unpredictabilities in
war.";    His projections are lower than the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> results. The <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>
researchers, part of the university's <ORGANIZATION>Center for International Relations</ORGANIZATION>,
placed heavy emphasis on the fact that the current war is a multinational
conflict. In previous wars, an array of combatants has been a signal for
staggering casualties.;    But, <PERSON>Russett</PERSON> said the fact that most of the nations
involved are joined in one anti-Iraq alliance -- rather than forming two
enormous hostile coalitions -- should tend to keep the casualty numbers down.
Because of that point, he said, the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> numbers may be somewhat
inflated.;    "Obviously, there's a good bit of art as well as science in
making these projections," <PERSON>Russett</PERSON> said. "That's not to say there isn't a real
possibility that the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> analysis isn't correct. It's coming from a very
good research group. And I think it offers a good caution. It's a reminder
that the body of experience does lead us to expect that level of carnage.";   
Across the country, political scientists are using modern computer power to
dissect wars of the past and use that information to calculate the size and
shape of wars of the future. The Correlates of War project, at the <ORGANIZATION>University
of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON>Ann Arbor</PERSON>, is devoted to gathering the numbers together; its
database is thought to be the most accurate in the world.;    The <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>
warfare model is based largely on those numbers, a coldly statistical picture
of death. The computer's projections were based on the patterns of 118 wars
fought since <DATE>1816</DATE>. The consistent pattern shows that when a war engages many
nations, the military losses run very high.;    In World War I, nine million
soldiers died; more than 300,000 were American. Historians now say that in
World War II, 16 million soldiers were killed, including about half a million
Americans. The warfare models exclude civilian casualties which are often much
higher.;    In World War II, for instance, counting appalling losses by the
Soviets and Chinese, the civilian deaths are thought to be more than 30
million. And this particular model also excludes injuries, which can be many
times the death rate.;    Analysts say that the current conflict is more
similar to those in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, in which only one superpower, the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, was heavily engaged. In <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, 43,000 American soldiers died,
but military deaths among the Korean forces approached two million.;    In
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, American military deaths were about 58,000; more than 1.2 million
soldiers from <LOCATION>North and South Vietnam</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> also died.;    "So
far, this has not conformed to a world war model," said <PERSON>Manus Midlarsky</PERSON>, a
political scientist at <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, and author of the
<DATE>1988</DATE> book, "The Onset of World War.";    "I suspect our losses will be closer
to those in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>. Everything points to the greatest casualties
being borne by the Iraqis because there is so much firepower lined up against
them. So the comparison with <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> might also hold for <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION>, in which case the
projection of a million or more dead is not unrealistic."  </TEXT>

<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> investigators will decide this month whether a veteran said to have killed 
more than 500 Japanese soldiers during a single encounter in World War II was 
denied the Medal of Honor because he is Jewish, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported. 
<PERSON>David Rubitsky</PERSON>, 72, a retired merchant seaman who lives in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, and his 
supporters say that the veteran, armed only with a machine gun, a carbine and 
an automatic rifle, cut down 500 to 600 enemy troops in <LOCATION>New Guinea</LOCATION> in <DATE>December, 
1942</DATE>. The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> said that two of <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON>'s superiors recommended him 
for the Medal of Honor but a third rejected the idea because <PERSON>Rubitsky</PERSON> is 
Jewish. The paper said that an important piece of evidence is a handwritten 
message from a Japanese officer who said he elected to commit suicide for his 
role in a battle in which "600 fine Japanese soldiers died because of a 
solitary American soldier."

   <PERSON>Mark Taynton</PERSON> was among the first Americans to
die in the Korean War. He was thrown into the breach against North
Korean invaders.
   <PERSON>Schuyler B. Cole</PERSON> was among the last. The war had bogged down
roughly along the same line where it started, when soldiers died
over map points named Pork Chop Hill and <ORGANIZATION>Heartbreak Ridge</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Leslie Doyle Rader</PERSON> was killed at <LOCATION>Inchon</LOCATION>, when the Americans
gained the offensive.
   Fellow Marine <PERSON>William G. Windrich</PERSON> died a hero at the <ORGANIZATION>Chosin
Reservoir</ORGANIZATION> after Communist <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> entered the war. His tombstone
notes he won the Medal of Honor.
   If the war didn't end with the clear-cut results some wanted,
and if things aren't perfect in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> today, well, nobody can fault
these men.
   Yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their white
marble headstones at <ORGANIZATION>Arlington National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>. There is no patch
of ground, no monument of carved black granite for Korean veterans.
   Only now, 40 years later, is a memorial in the works.
   Authorized by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, it will adjoin the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln
Memorial</ORGANIZATION> across the reflecting pool from the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Memorial if
<MONEY>$11 million</MONEY> in private contributions can be raised by <DATE>1991</DATE>. About
<MONEY>$6.2 million</MONEY> has been raised so far.
   For the people who fought, bled or died in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, it's about
time.
   ``It's an overdue thank you,'' said retired Col. <PERSON>John F.C.
Kenney</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean War Veterans Association</ORGANIZATION> and former
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean War Memorial Advisory Board</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The nation owes some form of recognition to those who, without
all the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched off quietly to
fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their
country asked them to do so,'' <PERSON>Kenney</PERSON> said.
   The memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers, each 8 feet tall,
walking from a copse of trees toward an American flag. There will
also be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead.
   ``We were the silent veterans of the forgotten war,'' says <PERSON>Frank
Kerr</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> public relations executive who fought with the
Marines at Chosin. ``Those who died enobled that time and place. It
was like a rock thrown in a pond and there wasn't a ripple.''
   That forgotten war began <DATE>June 25, 1950</DATE>, when North Korean tanks
clanked southward across the 38th parallel. It ended <DATE>July 27, 1953</DATE>,
not with a final peace, but an armistice. About 43,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
soldiers are still in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, serving as a trip wire in case the
<LOCATION>North</LOCATION> invades again.
   Most Americans get their images of the Korean War from ``MASH''
reruns; <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the country is too young to remember it
firsthand.
   <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> was a nasty war. More artillery fell on it than was fired
in all of World War II. In 37 months, 54,248 Americans died _
33,629 of them in combat, the rest in accidents or from sickness.
In <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dead reached 58,149 in more than 10 years of
fighting.
   There are 8,177 MIAs and 389 unaccounted-for POWs, all of them
presumed dead. Thirty-eight percent of American POWs died in
captivity.
   <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> was a harbinger. Almost all the ingredients of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>
were present in <LOCATION>Korea _ East Asia</LOCATION>, an undeclared, limited war, a
conflict between northern communists and a southern republic, and
American war technology against a determined but ill-equipped foe.
   But mostly, <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> was a war unlike any the American public ever
had been asked to support. Americans watched with some fascination
as the <ORGANIZATION>U.S.-led United Nations</ORGANIZATION> troops were almost overrun, then
counterattacked all the way to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>, then were beaten back
by hordes of Chinese troops.
   One year after the shooting started, the lines stabilized at
roughly the 38th parallel. Peace talks dragged on for two years,
and <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> of the casaulties came after the stalemate on the
battlefield.
   At first, most Americans in those communist-conscious times
approved. But <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> soon was turned off by a no-win, stagnant
war. There were no patriotic ditties by <PERSON>Irving Berlin</PERSON>, but no
anti-war songs either. There were no parades, but no draft-card
burnings or Kent States.
   ``It fell off the front pages. It just sort of petered out in a
very negative way. Nobody wanted to think about this thing,'' said
historian <PERSON>Clay Blair</PERSON>, author of ``<LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>: The Forgotten War.''
   ``When the war was over, people went back to their jobs and
didn't talk about it. When your country asked you to do something,
you do it,'' said <PERSON>Dick Adams</PERSON>, former member of the <ORGANIZATION>25th Infantry
Division</ORGANIZATION> and now president of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean War Veterans Association
   Was Korea</ORGANIZATION> worth it?
   Veterans say just ask anybody if they'd rather live in the
<LOCATION>North</LOCATION>, one of the last vestiges of ironclad Stalinism, or in the
South, a bustling, industrial power that was host to the <DATE>1988</DATE>
Olympic Games.
   ``My view is we accomplished our mission in full,'' said Gen.
<PERSON>Richard Stilwell</PERSON>, who commanded ground forces in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and now
heads the effort to build the Korean memorial. ``<LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> was the
cornerstone for defense and foreign policy that provided the
bulwark of what is happening in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>.''
   ``It was a complete victory. We did what we set out to do. We
stopped the communists. It was worth every inch of it,'' said
<PERSON>William Norris</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Waterford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean War
Veterans Association</ORGANIZATION>.
   The veterans group was formed in <DATE>1984</DATE>. <PERSON>Norris</PERSON>' daughter wanted
to do a school paper but couldn't find any library books on <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>,
the place where her father fought and his buddies died.
   ``It irritated me. I started it so nobody would ever forget,''
<PERSON>Norris</PERSON> said.
   The group already has remembered to remember. It placed a
granite meditation bench near <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION>'s Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier on <DATE>July 27, 1987</DATE>.
   It is carved with this quote from <PERSON>Herman Wouk</PERSON>: ``The beginning
of the end of war lies in remembrance.''

   <PERSON>Mark Taynton</PERSON> was among the first Americans to
die in the Korean War. He was thrown into the breach against North
Korean invaders.
   <PERSON>Schuyler B. Cole</PERSON> was among the last. The war had bogged down
roughly along the same line where it started, when soldiers died
over map points named Pork Chop Hill and <ORGANIZATION>Heartbreak Ridge</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Leslie Doyle Rader</PERSON> was killed at <LOCATION>Inchon</LOCATION>, when the Americans
gained the offensive.
   Fellow Marine <PERSON>William G. Windrich</PERSON> died a hero at the <ORGANIZATION>Chosin
Reservoir</ORGANIZATION> after Communist <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> entered the war. His tombstone
notes he won the Medal of Honor.
   If the war didn't end with the clear-cut results some wanted,
and if things aren't perfect in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> today, well, nobody can fault
these men.
   Yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their white
marble headstones at <ORGANIZATION>Arlington National Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>. There is no patch
of ground, no monument of carved black granite for Korean veterans.
   Only now, 40 years later, is a memorial in the works.
   Authorized by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE>, it will adjoin the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln
Memorial</ORGANIZATION> across the reflecting pool from the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Memorial if
<MONEY>$11 million</MONEY> in private contributions can be raised by <DATE>1991</DATE>. About
<MONEY>$6.2 million</MONEY> has been raised so far.
   For the people who fought, bled or died in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, it's about
time.
   ``It's an overdue thank you,'' said retired Col. <PERSON>John F.C.
Kenney</PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean War Veterans Association</ORGANIZATION> and former
executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean War Memorial Advisory Board</ORGANIZATION>.
   ``The nation owes some form of recognition to those who, without
all the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched off quietly to
fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their
country asked them to do so,'' <PERSON>Kenney</PERSON> said.
   The memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers, each 8 feet tall,
walking from a copse of trees toward an American flag. There will
also be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead.

   <PERSON>James M. Gavin</PERSON>, a World War II general
who helped lead the D-Day invasion and was later an outspoken
critic of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military policy, was buried <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with full
military honors.
   An honor guard from <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON>'s famed 82nd <ORGANIZATION>Airborne Division</ORGANIZATION> fired a
three-volley salute at the funeral at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Military Academy</ORGANIZATION>
attended by about 200 people. Gavin was buried at the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> post's
cemetery alongside such legendary military figures as <PERSON>George
Armstrong Custer</PERSON>.
   Gavin, who died <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> at age 82, was one of the
last great generals from World War II.
   Old comrades in arms recalled <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON>'s courage in battle and his
eagerness to embrace innovations in battlefield tactics and weapons.
   ``His physical courage was unchallenged,'' said retired Gen.
<PERSON>William T. Ryder</PERSON>. ``His intellectual bent for battle was proven.
The thing that endeared him to me the most was his integrity.
   ``<PERSON>Jim</PERSON> was one of those perceptive people, and they come few and
far between, who knew the next war would not be fought with the
last war's tools,'' <PERSON>Ryder</PERSON> said.
   Ryder parachuted into <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> during World War II with <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON>. He
said that when the paratroops were first organized, <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON>
immediately wanted to get involved.
   ``As soon as he heard about airborne, he wanted to get out with
the paratroops,'' <PERSON>Ryder</PERSON> said. ``He was always an avant-garde
innovator.''
   <PERSON>Frederick Spataro</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Brunswick</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, a paratrooper who
fought with <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Holland</PERSON> and the Battle of the Bulge,
said the general was ``always the first one out of the plane.''
   Another foot soldier under <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON>, <PERSON>H. Joseph Hirlemann</PERSON> of <LOCATION>West
Orange</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, said he remembered fighting at a remote outpost and
calling for more ammunition. Gavin delivered it personally.
   Gavin worked his way to the upper echelon of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> command during
a 34-year career that began in <DATE>1925</DATE> when he enlisted as a private
at age 17. He had dropped out of school after the eighth grade, but
completed his high school education as an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> private, gained
admission to West Point and was commissioned a second lieutenant in
<DATE>1929</DATE>.
   By the time he resigned at 51 in a dispute over the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s role
in missile development, he was the youngest three-star general.
   A captain when World War II began, <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON> was promoted to
brigadier general by D-Day and later was given command of the <ORGANIZATION>82nd
Airborne Division</ORGANIZATION>. At the end of the war he was a highly decorated
major general.
   After World War II, <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON> was instrumental in developing the
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s use of the helicopter, which was used extensively in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   An outspoken critic of President <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>, his former
commander, <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON> resigned in <DATE>1958</DATE> out of principle over his
disagreement with <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> policies. At the time, he was about to
take command of the <ORGANIZATION>Seventh Army</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   Gavin became an executive with the industrial and consulting
form of <ORGANIZATION>Arthur D. Little Inc.</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION>.
   He was appointed ambassador to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> by President <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>.
   As a civilian, <PERSON>Gavin</PERSON> continued to criticize the American
military, and was was one of the first to criticize <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>
involvement in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>.
   Gavin's wartime medals include the <ORGANIZATION>Purple Heart</ORGANIZATION>, Silver Star,
and the <ORGANIZATION>Distinguished Service Cross</ORGANIZATION> with oak leaf cluster. <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
gave him its <ORGANIZATION>Croix de Guerre</ORGANIZATION> with palm and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> named him to the

   EL-ALAMEIN, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> (AP) _ This dusty coastal village of Bedouin
houses, car repair shops, a rest house and two gas stations has
little to offer for the living _ except memories of the dead.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, 2,000 people are expected here to mourn those who
fell in World War II in the Battle of el-Alamein.
   Since <DATE>1978</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Service</ORGANIZATION> of Remembrance for the more than 70,000
casualties of the battle has been held on the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> nearest to
<DATE>Oct. 23</DATE>. That was the night 46 years ago when English Gen. <PERSON>Bernard
Law Montgomery</PERSON> launched a devastating attack on the elite Axis
divisions of ``The Desert Fox,'' German Field <PERSON>Marshal Erwin Rommel</PERSON>.
   The decisive battle began at <TIME>9:40 p.m.</TIME> when <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery</ORGANIZATION>'s guns
opened fire under a full moon after a day of blistering heat.
   Rain had turned the desert to mud by the time the battle was won
early <DATE>Nov. 4</DATE>, ending <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON>'s relentless march across <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>
toward <ORGANIZATION>Suez</ORGANIZATION>. It cleared the way for the Allies to open a second
front in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   This year's main ceremony will be held beneath the pink and
green foliage of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>, an English garden
setting against a desert backdrop.
   Among those who will take part is <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s defense secretary,
<PERSON>George Younger</PERSON>, who arrived with a delegation of 41, including
about a dozen war widows and 17 veterans.
   The cemetery, with its rows of marked and unmarked graves, is an
emotional reminder of the battle wedged in the 30 miles of
wasteland between the quicksand-filled Qattarra Depression to the
south and the <LOCATION>Mediterranean Sea</LOCATION> to the north.
   The largest war cemetery in <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>, it contains the graves
of Commonwealth soldiers who died at el-Alamein as well as some who
fell earlier in the <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION>.
   English architect Sir <PERSON>Hubert Worthington</PERSON> came to el-Alamein in
the <DATE>summer of 1943</DATE>, just months after <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON> was repelled, to
design a garden cemetery in the harsh surroundings.
   He determined that walls were necessary to keep out drifting
sand, and cloisters with hearty plants to make visits pleasant even
in the hottest months.
   Of the 7,352 graves, 815 bear unknown remains.
   Jew and Arab lie side by side. English soldiers and Canadians
are buried beside Australians, Indians, <LOCATION>East Africans</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West
Africans</LOCATION>, Sudanese, Belgians, Frenchmen, Greeks, Poles, troopers
from the old <ORGANIZATION>High Commission Territories</ORGANIZATION> and unknown Allied dead
from other North African campaigns.
   On the walls in front of the cemetery are listed names of 11,495
others lost in all desert campaigns.
   East of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> is a separate smaller memorial
to Greek combatants, and monuments to Axis losses are to the west.
   <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>'s mausoleum, dazzling white against the azure sea, holds
the remains of 3,241 soldiers.
   A short distance away, the dark, round, fortress-like German
memorial dominates a sandy hill beside the shore. Its walls shelter
4,280 remains.
   In its center courtyard, a tablet reads: ``The price of pride is
high, and paid by the young.''
   There has been occasional talk of halting the annual
commemoration, but Wing Cmdr. <PERSON>Anthony Edmunds</PERSON>, who heads this
year's program, said that is not being seriously considered.
   ``For the younger generations, World War II is becoming part of
a deep, dark past, but for others this time of year recalls
el-Alamein,'' he said. ``<LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> still has large Italian and Greek
communities who gather for the ceremony.''
   Edmunds remembers studying about el-Alamein in detail as a child
because ``it was such a turning point for the Allies. We were doing
OK in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, awful in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> and hadn't done well in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
After el-Alamein, all that changed.''
   The <LOCATION>Sahara</LOCATION>'s constantly shifting sands have made it impossible
to know the exact numbers of el-Alamein's dead.
   Untold thousands of men are hidden. From time to time the
featureless landscape, too dry even for shrubs, releases a stilled
skeleton or exposes a mine.
   Estimates of casualties _ dead, wounded, captured and missing _
total 72,500: the Axis suffered 59,000 and the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>
sustained 13,500.
   El-Alamein tells the story of its 12 days in world history in a
small museum.
   The visitor passes large Nazi and <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> flags on the way
to display cases of weaponry, uniforms, battle plans and related
documents.
   Department-store dummies are decked out as the meticulous and
calculating <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> and lean <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON>.
   Outside is a row of tanks, gathering dust, including the
Italians' M-13 that <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON>'s tankmen called the
``self-propelled coffin.''

   The peacetime <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> is a healthy alternative to
civilian life, say military researchers who found that soldiers in
<DATE>1986</DATE> died at half the rate of their civilian counterparts.
   But one professor says choosing a year of peace for such a study
may obscure the realities of serving a nation that goes to war
about once a decade.
   <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> researchers compared death rates among all 781,000 soldiers
to civilian counterparts of the same age, race and sex in <DATE>1986</DATE>.
   The study published in <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>'s Journal of the <ORGANIZATION>American
Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> did not give actual death rates. However, the
lead researcher said in a telephone interview that soldiers overall
died at a rate of 109 per 100,000, while comparable civilians died
at a rate of 215 per 100,000.
   The greatest disparity was for homicides, almost six times less
common among soldiers than civilians, followed by smaller <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
rates of deaths cause by disease and suicide, the researchers
reported.
   The most striking difference was among black men, who died in
homicides almost 12 times less often in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> than in the
population at large. The homicide rate among black soldiers was 9
per 100,000, compared with 100 per 100,000 for black civilians,
said lead author <PERSON>Joseph M. Rothberg</PERSON>, a mathematician in military
psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION>Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</ORGANIZATION>.
   Women in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, who comprised <PERCENT>10.2 percent</PERCENT> of soldiers, died
at <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> the rate of civilian women of the same age. Black
women soldiers died at <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> the rate of comparable civilians.
But white women soldiers died at <PERCENT>139 percent</PERCENT> the rate of white
women civilians of the same age.
   A large component of the elevated death rate among white <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
women was due to their suffering more than 2{ times as many fatal
accidents as civilian women the same age, but the researchers could
not say why.
   ``There are a number of factors that determine the probability
of death for any individual, and they're different for the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
than for civilian life,'' said <PERSON>Rothberg</PERSON>.
   Most important is the screening of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> volunteers, who must
have high school degrees and are healthy enough to pass a physical
exam, <PERSON>Rothberg</PERSON> said in a telephone interview <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> from <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Md</LOCATION>.
   He also said the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> provides housing, food, meaningful work
and ``lots of fresh air and exercise.'' It controls substance abuse
and regulates firearms, he said.
   ``Everybody's told how to live their life and how to stay
healthy. In civilian life, it's the individual's option,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Sam Sarkesian</PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION>Loyola
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, said he believed the study could give a
skewed picture because it reflects peacetime mortality. Yet, he
noted, ``we've been involved in a war virtually every 10 years
since the end of World War II.''
   Even in non-war years, members of the military die violently,
such as in the <DATE>1983</DATE> Beirut bombing, when 237 Marines were killed;
in the <DATE>1985</DATE> Gander, <LOCATION>Newfoundland</LOCATION>, airplane crash, when 248 died;
and in the <DATE>1989</DATE> Panama invasion, when 23 lost their lives.
   ``From <DATE>1945</DATE> on, if you'd put all those together and compare it
to the equivalent in civilian life, I think you'd get a totally
different picture,'' <PERSON>Sarkesian</PERSON> said.
   But <PERSON>Charles Moskos</PERSON>, a sociology professor at <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern
University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Evanston</LOCATION>, said: ``Most of military life is peacetime.
A peace year is more normal than a war year.''
   Still, ``It's a sad commentary on <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> when military service
is healthier for black youths than civilian life,'' said <PERSON>Moskos</PERSON>,
head of an international group of 600 military social scientists.

The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>'s last surviving World War I Medal of Honor winner has died at

</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Thomas A. Pope</PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION>Woodland Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Norwood Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>, 
died <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Hines Veterans Hospital</ORGANIZATION> near this small <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> city.

action. Then a corporal, he spotted a machine-gun nest. Waving to his platoon 
to lie low, he charged the nest, killing the gunner before he could swing the 
machine gun toward the platoon. He then bayoneted another German soldier and 
held off eight more Germans, whom his men then took prisoner.

<HEAD>World War II a Vivid Memory For Many Poles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the millions of people who were born
after World War II, the solemn ceremonies marking the 50th
anniversary of the German invasion of this nation amounted to a
history lesson.
   For the Poles who lived through the carnage, the memorials
marking the <DATE>Sept. 1, 1939</DATE>, outbreak of the war have brought back a
flood of memories.
   ``I survived,'' said <PERSON>Alexandra Sikorska</PERSON>, who served as a courier
for the Polish resistance.
   She said she cried watching televised memorial ceremonies from
<LOCATION>Westerplatte</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Baltic peninsula</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Gdansk</LOCATION> where a German
battleship fired the first salvos of the war at a small Polish
garrison.
   ``Young people were taking a pledge, and I remembered I was young
too then. All my life seems strange because my young days were at
that time,'' she said.
   <PERSON>Mrs. Sikorska</PERSON>, 70, said when the war began she built barricades
against Nazi tanks with paving stones. Then, she carried messages
for the resistance.
   ``I was always thinking that I would be taking part in everything
until the very end,'' she said, her medal of valor dangling from her
collar as she stood in <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Castle Square</LOCATION> during a peace
ceremony marking <DATE>Friday</DATE>'s anniversary.
   A bronze memorial filling half a city block is being completed to
honor the valiant but doomed stand against the Germans during the
<ORGANIZATION>Warsaw Uprising</ORGANIZATION> of <DATE>1944</DATE>. Two hundred thousand people in the city
died in the fighting, and the reprisal massacres that followed.
   Nationwide, 6 million Poles died in the war, including 3 million
Jews, and much of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> was reduced to rubble.
   Proudly wearing combat medals at the ceremony were two men who
started the war as Poles and ended it as citizens of territory
annexed by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   ``In <DATE>September 1939</DATE>, my friend and I were the first to fight the
Germans. We had active duty that day,'' said <PERSON>Jozef Zamojdzin</PERSON>, still
speaking his native Polish.
   They fought ``not to allow the enemy to tread on Polish soil,''
said his friend, <PERSON>Stefan Sidoromek</PERSON>, ``But we had to face enormous
violence and we were not able to overcome it.''
   They eventually joined the Polish army that the Soviets allowed
to be reformed on their territory after the Germans attacked their
former ally.
   Both men showed honors from the battle of <ORGANIZATION>Monte Cassino</ORGANIZATION>, one of
the Polish army's many heroic efforts through <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   ``A soldier is a soldier in order to defend the homeland, and to
be victorious,'' <PERSON>Zamojdzin</PERSON> said.

EL-ALAMEIN VETERANS MEET IN SAD MEMORY

EL-ALAMEIN, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were young soldiers, far from home, huddled in desert sands, waiting for 
the <TIME>night</TIME> sky to explode. 
</P>
<P>
The last time some of them would ever look at their watches was <TIME>9:39 p.m.</TIME>, <DATE>Oct</DATE>. 
23, <DATE>1942</DATE>. In one minute the wails of bagpipes would summon the guns of Major 
Gen. <PERSON>Bernard Law Montgomery</PERSON>'s 8th <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, the Desert Rats, to the final battle of 
<ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Such a bombardment had not been seen since World War I. What followed was one 
of history's great tank battles along <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s barren but beautiful northern 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
How many died to turn the tide of German victories, nobody knows. But after 
<ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION>, it was the Allied forces who marched forward. After <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION>, 
<PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON>'s dreams of world conquest began to sour. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Lance Barnard</PERSON>, a former deputy prime minister of <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION>, served with the <ORGANIZATION>9th 
Australian Division</ORGANIZATION>, the Diggers, who took the brunt of Field <PERSON>Marshal Erwin 
Rommel</PERSON>'s fury at the end of <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION>'s final battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Each generation seems to produce another dictator and somebody has to go out 
and stop him," <PERSON>Barnard</PERSON> said. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve hundred Diggers are among the 7,354 men of the combined British 
Commonwealth forces buried at <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION>. They proved that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s seemingly 
invincible <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON>, the "Desert Fox," and his famous Afrika Korps could be 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Six days after the Allied victory on <DATE>Nov. 4</DATE>, <ORGANIZATION>British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill</ORGANIZATION> gave El-Alamein its place in World War II history: "This is not the 
end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of 
the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Patience would prove him right. The ordeal of <LOCATION>Stalingrad</LOCATION> was then only 
beginning, <ORGANIZATION>American Marines</ORGANIZATION> were digging in at <LOCATION>Guadalcanal</LOCATION>, and D-Day -- the 
beginning of the end -- still was almost two years away. 
</P>
<P>
Historians debate whether El-Alamein was the most crucial battle of the war, 
but none ignores what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
After sweeping through <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>, Axis forces under <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON> sped along the only road 
on northern <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s coastline toward <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Suez Canal</ORGANIZATION> and the rich oil 
fields of <LOCATION>Persia</LOCATION>. They could smell victory. 
</P>
<P>
Allied commander <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> had other ideas. He sent escape vehicles to the 
rear and told his troops: "If Alamein is lost, <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> is lost. If we cannot stay 
at Alamein alive, we will stay there dead." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of winning and losing the battles of <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION>, which raged off and 
on from <DATE>July until November, 1942</DATE>, was staggering. Dead still lie in unfound 
desert graves, but the number of casualties on both sides has been estimated at 
65,000. The Allies suffered 13,500 dead and wounded. Half the forces of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 
and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> were killed, wounded or captured. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing forces were uneven. Montgomery had 11 divisions, about 210,000 
men. He had 1,200 tanks, more than 1,000 field and medium guns, adequate fuel 
and ammunition and a short line of communications to his home base in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Rommel</PERSON> commanded four German and eight Italian divisions and some independent 
units. He had no more than 108,000 men and 600 tanks, but plenty of artillery. 
Also, he relied on 5 million mines planted in the 50-mile-wide El-Alamein 
bottleneck between the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> and the quicksand of the <ORGANIZATION>Qattara 
Depression</ORGANIZATION>. His fatal flaws were the lack of fuel and a steady supply line. 
</P>
<P>
The battle of <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION> should have been a showpiece for tank warfare. It 
wasn't. Tanks broke down -- the tinny Italian version was nicknamed 
"self-propelled coffin" -- and the <LOCATION>Qattara</LOCATION> to the south prevented brilliant 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery lost 600 tanks, about the number <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON> had when the battle began, 
and by <DATE>Nov. 2</DATE> <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON> was fighting with only 30. 
</P>
<P>
In his diary, <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON> lamented the battle: "Rivers of blood were spilled over a 
miserable strip of land which in normal times even the poorest Arab would never 
have bothered about." 
</P>
<P>
Today's <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION> is not much better. But its stilled battlefields, a military 
museum and monuments of the famous battles beckon visitors to make the 
four-hour journey from <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since <DATE>1978</DATE>, individual countries have put aside differences to honor 
the fallen World War II desert fighters of all sides at observances on the 
<DATE>Sunday</DATE> nearest the <DATE>Oct. 23</DATE> battle anniversary. The service, attended by 
hundreds of diplomats, veterans and well-wishers, rotates among the 
<ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> and the German and Italian memorials. 
</P>
<P>
This year's is <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE> at the Italian monument atop a hillside overlooking the 
<LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
El-Alamein's newest memorial is a simple but poignant obelisk honoring the 
Australian Diggers. The 20-foot-tall monument of locally quarried limestone and 
Australian granite stands before the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> and its thousands of 
Allied dead. 
</P>
<P>
The monument was dedicated in the <DATE>spring of 1989</DATE>, and for the Australians it 
was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard, the former deputy prime minister, and <PERSON>Everard Baillieu</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>, a 
gunner severely wounded at <LOCATION>El-Alamein</LOCATION>, spearheaded the campaign for a monument 
to honor their fallen comrades-in-arms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an emotional experience for me to go back to <LOCATION>Alamein</LOCATION>. It was the 
place we stopped <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON>'s advance, forced him to go back, leave <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>," 
<PERSON>Barnard</PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION>. He has made the pilgrimage four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"The first visit I made I was looking at the graves of my comrades, the graves 
of my friends. Each time I come I believe more and more that victory was made 
possible because of the efforts of the <ORGANIZATION>9th Division</ORGANIZATION>." 
</P>
<P>
Melbourne attorney <PERSON>Frank Minotti</PERSON>, another veteran of the 9th, has written a 
division history. He wrote that until the obelisk, "no one visiting the 
cemetery would find anything to tell them what part the Australians played in 
those famous battles, and in what circumstances those in the cemetery gave 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
There are guest registers at the memorials for the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>, German and 
Italian soldiers. Few leave <ORGANIZATION>El-Alamein</ORGANIZATION> without shedding a tear. 
</P>
<P>
Last <DATE>July 18</DATE>, Australian <PERSON>Margaret Gillespie</PERSON> visited the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Cemetery</ORGANIZATION>. 
"My brother <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>, always remembered by his family," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
David and <PERSON>Myrna McDonell</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brisbane</LOCATION>: "May there never be cause for such a sad 
place."

<TEXT>
   In a war few outside <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> recall,
soldiers of the newborn Polish republic 70 years ago this week
retaliated in a battle that saved <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> from Bolshevik conquest
and the wrath of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION>.
   Until last year, the Polish-Soviet war of 1919-20 was rarely
discussed by <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s former Communist authorities because they
correctly gauged local sensitivities about the ``Miracle of the
Vistula.''
   But five days of observances about the battle that began <DATE>Aug.
13, 1920</DATE>, were organized in villages across <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> for the first
anniversary observance since the end of Communist rule.
   The ``Miracle on the Vistula'' has been recalled in churches and
cemeteries throughout <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> since <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, and memorials destroyed
or removed during the reign of the Communists have been carefully
restored.
   ``Many historians put this battle among the dozen most important
military acts,'' Prime Minister <PERSON>Tadeusz Mazowiecki</PERSON> said during a
<ORGANIZATION>Royal Castle</ORGANIZATION> ceremony <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night honoring veterans of the battle.
   ``If not for the Polish determination, if not for our sacrifice
and our victory, the history of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> would have been much
different,'' he told the elderly survivors.
   Ceremonies on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
<LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> and <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <LOCATION>Krakow</LOCATION> tomb of Marshal <PERSON>Jozef Pilsudski</PERSON>,
the champion of Polish independence who led the military campaign,
were to conclude observances that had captured <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s emotions
all week.
   With central <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in collapse after World War I and the German
working-class excited by Bolshevism's triumph in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, Soviet
leader <PERSON>Vladimir Lenin</PERSON> dreamed of conquering <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, which would put
the <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION> in mid-Europe and spread the socialist revolution
across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.
   In the <DATE>summer of 1920</DATE>, five of the feared Soviet armies
converged on <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>.
   ``To the West! Over the corpse of <LOCATION>White Poland</LOCATION> lies the road to
worldwide conflagration,'' Soviet Gen. <PERSON>Mikhail Tukachevsky</PERSON>
instructed his troops before the battle, according to British
historian <PERSON>Norman Davies</PERSON>.
   ``White'' was <ORGANIZATION>Lenin</ORGANIZATION>'s pejorative description meaning
counterrevolutionary enemies of the working-class. The czarist army
opposing the Bolsheviks dressed in white.
   Barbed-wire defenses hurriedly errected by <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>'s residents
held, and in a series of daring maneuvers Poles managed to encircle
the Soviets. In days, 100,000 Red Army troops were taken prisoner
and the rest fled to <LOCATION>East Prussia</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>East Prussia</LOCATION> is former German
territory now belonging to <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.
   In <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, the unexpected triumph came to be called ``The
Miracle on the Vistula'' for the river that passes through <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>.
   ``Had (Polish soldiers) failed to arrest the triumphant advance
of the Soviet Army at the Battle of <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>, not only would
Christianity have experienced a dangerous reverse, but the very
existence of Western civilization would have been imperiled,''
wrote the then-British ambassador to <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lord D'Abernon</PERSON>,
according to <PERSON>Davies</PERSON>.
   The attention focused on <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s heroic effort continues today,
<PERSON>Mazowiecki</PERSON> said. Thousands of people of all ages have been jamming
memorial <LOCATION>Masses</LOCATION> <DATE>this week</DATE>, decorating their villages with ribbons
in honor of the battle.
   ``The world is paying great attention to our experiences now
because it knows our process of freeing ourselves from communism
has critical importance for the world,'' <PERSON>Mazowiecki</PERSON> said.
   Polish primate <PERSON>Cardinal Jozef Glemp</PERSON> told worshippers that the
battle ``is still going on,'' referring to the trials of building a
democratic society after four decades of one-party rule.
   Glemp started the commemoration <DATE>Sunday</DATE> at a country church in
<LOCATION>Radzymin</LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> near a battlefield where a rebuilt
cemetery chapel now honors the fallen soldiers.
   Among those attending was Col. <PERSON>Stanislaw Lis-Kozlowski</PERSON>, 84, a
teen-age volunteer from the Polish boy scouts who shouldered a
rifle against the Bolsheviks in <DATE>1920</DATE>.
   Lis-Kozlowski, who came from his home in <LOCATION>Buenos Aires</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>, stood outside the church, his suit covered with medals
that recalled his service with the anti-Nazi resistance in World
War II and the doomed <DATE>1944</DATE> Warsaw uprising.
   He scoffed when a reporter suggested that as a 14-year-old he
was too young to fight. ``In the uprising in <DATE>'44</DATE>, I had soldiers 12
years old,'' <PERSON>Lis-Kozlowski</PERSON> said.
   For the Soviets, <DATE>1920</DATE> proved a temporary defeat. Stalin's troops
occupied more than half of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> in <DATE>1939</DATE>. After World War II,
Communists took power and ruled until <DATE>1989</DATE>, when the Solidarity
movement wrested power from the party and installed a non-Communist
government.
   Many of the ``Miracle on the Vistula'' fighters perished among
the 15,000 captured Polish army officers executed by the Soviets at
<LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> and two other sites in <DATE>1940</DATE>. In <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, the crime often is
viewed as <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s revenge for <DATE>1920</DATE>.

<P>
IN A SMALL KANSAS CEMETERY, THE GRAVES OF 14 GERMAN POWS REPRESENT ONE OF THE 
LAST UNTOLD STORIES OF WORLD WAR II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
LEAVENWORTH, Kan. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no women or children buried in the little hilltop cemetery 
overlooking the <LOCATION>Missouri River</LOCATION>, only military convicts, about 240 of them, 
their souls forever tainted by some dishonorable deed that made this 
Godforsaken place their final outpost. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the pristine national cemetery half a mile away, this place attracts few 
visitors; no flowers are laid on the unblessed ground. The small tombstones 
bear nothing more than a name and a date of death -- but that, 10 years ago, is 
what caught the attention of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Ken Knox</PERSON>, a corrections officers at the 
Disciplinary Barracks at Ft. Leavenworth, and began his obsession with one of 
the last untold stories of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Come here. Look at this," <PERSON>Knox</PERSON> said to his wife, <PERSON>Dianne</PERSON>, while biking around 
the post one <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Off to one side, separated from the other graves, were 14 tombstones, each with 
a German name, half inscribed with the same date, <DATE>Aug. 25, 1945</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
Knox's first thought was that they must have died in a bus accident, but he 
soon learned that he had stumbled onto the graves of the only prisoners of war 
ever executed in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, and, delving through archives and 
libraries, he found that many troubling ethical questions still remained over 
the circumstances of their hanging. 
</P>
<P>
From his second-floor office, he would look down on the prison courtyard and 
imagine <PERSON>Walter Beyer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Otto Stengel</PERSON> and the dozen other German sailors and 
soldiers, handcuffed, each escorted by an eight-man guard, walking to the 
makeshift gallows the fort had set up in the elevator shaft of an old 
warehouse. He could almost hear the Episcopal chaplain, <PERSON>John Sagar</PERSON>, reciting 
Psalm 130, the litany for the dying: "Out of the deep I have called unto thee, 
O Lord. Lord, hear my voice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not contesting their guilt, only the injustice," says <PERSON>Knox</PERSON>, who now lives 
in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys just don't belong in that cemetery. They were honorable military 
men and, right or wrong, if <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had won the war, they'd have been given a 
medal. They ought to be reinterred in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, in a place of respect. That's 
all I'm trying to accomplish. Besides, they were executed after the war was 
over, and that raises a lot of questions over whether they were the victims of 
a society's desire for revenge against all Germans." 
</P>
<P>
The 14 condemned men -- one of whom was a grocer in civilian life, one a 
pattern cutter, another an engineer -- were among 400,000 Germans held prisoner 
during World War II at 500 camps scattered across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. The German 
prisoners worked in the wheat fields of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, stuffed olives with Spanish 
peppers in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, repaired <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> vehicles in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, sewed <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> uniforms 
in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, picked peas in <LOCATION>Upstate New York</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the war, aided by prison tailors who made them civilian clothes 
and artists who provided them with forged documents, Germans were escaping the 
camps at the rate of 100 a month, often melting into American society. 
</P>
<P>
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intelligence officers worked hard to recruit "snitches" among the newly 
arrived prisoners, and they put unsuspecting inmates in with them in bugged 
two-man cells. 
</P>
<P>
The information they gathered proved invaluable to the Allied war effort. One 
snitch, <PERSON>Johannes Kunze</PERSON>, passed on details of the camouflaging of <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> 
intended to mislead British bomber pilots -- the roof of the train station had 
been painted to resemble a highway, the lake had been covered over -- and 
others identified Nazi camp ringleaders and shared secrets about German U-boat 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
At <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Nov. 4, 1943</DATE>, one of the German prisoners at Camp <PERSON>Gruber</PERSON> in 
<LOCATION>Tankowa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Walter Beyer</PERSON>, a 30-year-old first sergeant captured in <LOCATION>North 
Africa</LOCATION>, ordered his company to assemble in the mess hall. <PERSON>Johannes Kunze</PERSON> was 
one of the last to enter. White-faced and perspiring, he took a seat at a table 
by the door. Beyer held up two notes in identical handwriting -- one unsigned, 
containing a brief description of <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION>'s camouflaging, the other a letter, 
signed by <PERSON>Kunze</PERSON>, to his wife in <LOCATION>Leipzig</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
"Comrades," said <PERSON>Beyer</PERSON>, whose wife and 2-year-son, <PERSON>Edgar</PERSON>, lived in <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION>. "I 
am sorry and it hurts me in my soul to be forced to tell you some sad news, and 
the case is so grave that I am not in a position to pass judgment myself. Bad 
as it may seem, we have a traitor in our midst." 
</P>
<P>
Beyer had hardly finished before someone shouted, "That's him! Don't let him 
get out!" and a score of men pounced on <PERSON>Kunze</PERSON>, who struggled wildly to escape 
the fists and feet of his tormentors. He died a short while later of a 
fractured skull and cerebral hemorrhaging. Beyer, court testimony later 
disclosed, did not participate in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
During the next five months, three other informers were murdered in unrelated 
incidents at <ORGANIZATION>POW</ORGANIZATION> camps in <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Camp Chaffee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Aiken</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> 
</P>
<P>
The killings led to lengthy investigations -- one of the suspects, <PERSON>Otto 
Stengel</PERSON>, confessed only after being forced to wear a gas mask stuffed with 
onions and garlic -- and eventually 14 Germans were sent off to Ft. Leavenworth 
to be hanged after being convicted in four separate courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
Each contended that he had acted as would have any conscientious soldier. 
</P>
<P>
"I am no murderer," the grocer, Sgt. <PERSON>Erich Gauss</PERSON>, 32, told the court. "I merely 
fought for the honor of my fatherland and for respect as a soldier, and I 
believe that every decent German soldier would do likewise. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Germans' defense was based on the argument that their victims were traitors 
and prisoners of war were obligated to prevent treason against their homeland. 
To defend <PERSON>Beyer</PERSON> and the four others accused of killing <PERSON>Kunze</PERSON>, the government 
assigned, part time, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Alfred Petsch</PERSON>, who described himself as a country 
lawyer and farmer and who told a review board that he had "practically no 
experience in matters of this sort." The prosecutor was one of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s most 
respected lawyers, Lt. Col. <PERSON>Leon Jaworski</PERSON>, the eventual Watergate special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Ken Knox</PERSON>, whose father was a decorated aviator in <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and who himself served 
in peacetime <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and warring <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION>, is retired from the military now after 
a 22-year career and works as a sandblaster at the <ORGANIZATION>Army Depot</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. 
</P>
<P>
He has collected 4,000 documents, many of them under the Freedom of Information 
Act, and has struggled to put together 159 pages of a book. Evening after 
evening he sits at his computer, sifting through testimony and declassified 
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> memos, wondering if he has overlooked some clue that would prove the 
injustice of the Germans' deaths. Friends say to him, "What are you doing with 
your Germans today?" but, he says, they aren't really interested in hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain why this thing has become so important to me, I really can't," 
<PERSON>Knox</PERSON> says, "but it's been like an ulcer. I keep thinking of the families in 
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> who've been told their father or grandfather died as a criminal, when 
this wasn't the case at all. We'd consider Americans who did what they did 
heroes." 
</P>
<P>
The Germans lingered on Death Row in Ft. Leavenworth for a year. During that 
time, 15 of the 90,000 Americans being held prisoner on German soil were also 
sentenced to death, and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> began negotiating through Swiss 
intermediaries on a prisoner exchange. Both sides agreed not to execute anyone 
until the negotiations were complete. 
</P>
<P>
"No death sentence imposed on German prisoners of war in this country will be 
carried out," said a classified message from the assistant chief of staff to 
Ft. Leavenworth authorities on <DATE>April 28, 1945</DATE>, ". . . until further order from 
the personnel division." 
</P>
<P>
Nine days later, the war in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> ended with the German surrender. The 15 
Americans sentenced to death were returned to the Allied command, and President 
<PERSON>Harry S. Truman</PERSON> signed the Germans' death warrants, despite the recommendation 
of a review board that the sentences be commuted to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Just past <TIME>midnight</TIME>, <DATE>July 10</DATE>, the first batch of five Germans prisoners, all 
former members of <PERSON>Rommel</PERSON>'s famed Afrika Korps, were taken from their cells 
after a meal of stew, steamed rice and cake. 
</P>
<P>
It was 300 yards from Ft. Leavenworth's solitary-confinement wing, known as the 
<ORGANIZATION>Castle</ORGANIZATION>, to the warehouse gallows, and in bright moonlight, accompanied by a 
Catholic priest and an Episcopalian chaplain, the prisoners crossed the 
courtyard Sgt. <PERSON>Ken Knox</PERSON> would spend so many hours looking at years later. At 
their request, all wore their military uniforms. Sgt. <PERSON>Walter Beyer</PERSON> was the 
first to approach the American soldiers who waited by the noose. 
</P>
<P>
"The prisoner appeared none too robust and his cheeks were drawn," <PERSON>William H. 
Radford</PERSON> reported the next day in the <LOCATION>Kansas City Star</LOCATION>. "A black stubble, 
matching his hair, indicated that he had not shaved for at least 12 hours. His 
eyes were those of a trapped beast. They moved nervously from right to left. 
But he never turned his head or moved his chin from its jutting position. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A noncommissioned officer standing beside him removed <PERSON>Beyer</PERSON>'s cap and placed a 
black hood over his head. There was a brittle command, 'Right face, forward 
march,' and the Nazi pivoted on his right heel in rhythm with the bodyguard of 
soldiers that brought him into the building and stepped off the remaining 30 
feet to the gallows. His bearing was military to the last." 
</P>
<P>
<PERSON>Beyer</PERSON>'s wife knew something was very wrong early that <DATE>spring of 1945</DATE> because 
her husband's letters stopped. But it was a year before she learned that he was 
dead and several more before she learned the circumstances of his death. By 
then she could not afford a trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to claim the body. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still remember the moment Mother found out my father was dead," said 
<PERSON>Beyer</PERSON>'s only child, <PERSON>Edgar</PERSON>, 49, the assistant manager of a <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> bank. "I was 
5 years old. She was cooking beans in the back yard when it came, a simple, 
open postcard. She read it and started to shake. She let out a wail that I will 
never forget. It must have lasted 5 to 10 minutes. I thought she was going to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
The postcard, <PERSON>Beyer</PERSON> recalled in a telephone interview, was cryptic: It was 
dated <DATE>Aug. 2, 1946</DATE>, and gave no details except for the fact and date of death. 
Eventually, it was followed by a death certificate and a note from the <ORGANIZATION>Red 
Cross</ORGANIZATION> stating no further information was available. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years <PERSON>Mrs. Beyer</PERSON> shared her secret with no one, and it was not 
until <PERSON>Edgar Beyer</PERSON> was about to marry that she sat him down and told him his 
father had been executed and was buried in a criminal's grave. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete shock," <PERSON>Beyer</PERSON> said. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago an aunt gave <PERSON>Edgar Beyer</PERSON> the equivalent of <MONEY>$4,000</MONEY> for a trip to 
the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on the condition that he visit all the family's relatives as 
well as his father's grave. He flew alone from <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION>, 
drove to Ft. Leavenworth and met an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officer who told him where the 
convicts' cemetery was. The gate was locked, so he climbed the chain-link fence 
and found his father's grave, the first one in the row of 14. The last time he 
had seen his father was <DATE>Christmas Day, 1941</DATE>. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, German and American military authorities have suggested that 
perhaps the prisoners' remains should be returned to lie in a German war 
cemetery. But while <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> was divided, the <ORGANIZATION>West Germany Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 
preferred that the matter not be raised at all, fearing that <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION> would 
use it to cause a rift in the Washington-Bonn alliance. 
</P>
<P>
None of the victims' families has tried to claim the bodies. Even <PERSON>Edgar Beyer</PERSON> 
isn't sure repatriation of the bodies is a good idea. "I'd need time to think 
about that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So, <PERSON>Ken Knox</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION> keeps poring over his stacks of documents, calling 
newspapers and TV stations, hoping that someone will share his interest in 
righting the injustice he perceives. "There was some interest in first," he 
says, "but it died pretty quickly. What have I achieved in 10 years? Nothing, 
really. Just frustration. I guess I've reached my limit. I would need someone 
with more education and experience than I've got to get this done." 
</P>
<P>
A cold autumn wind whipped across the cemetery on Ft. Leavenworth's <PERSON>Hancock 
Hill</PERSON> one recent <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, murmuring through the leafless trees. It was 
<DATE>Nov. 18</DATE>, a day the Germans call Volkstravertag -- People's Remembrance Day -- 
and from the road five German soldiers wearing gray jackets, leather gloves and 
maroon berets approached the row of 14 tombstones, carrying a wreath of 
carnations. 
</P>
<P>
Col. <PERSON>Michael Hueber</PERSON>, a 27-year veteran and the son of a World War II 
paratrooper, came first, remembering on this day of memories the Allied air 
strike on his home in <DATE>Kreuzuach</DATE> that had killed his mother, his grandparents, 
an aunt and a nephew. With him, in military step, were four other Germans who 
are attached to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Command General Staff</ORGANIZATION> college here. 
</P>
<P>
They placed the wreath between the tombstones of Pvt. <PERSON>Rudolf Sraub</PERSON>, the 
39-year-old pattern cutter, and Pvt. <PERSON>Helmut Fisher</PERSON>, a 22-year-old high school 
dropout. "We stand here," <PERSON>Hueber</PERSON> said, head bowed, "in front of the graves of 
young soldiers who died in meeting their given missions. They were just 
soldiers like you and me. 
</P>
<P>
"They died harder than their colleagues in combat because they realized that, 
in the end, they would die. But they died so that we could live in freedom, so 
that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> could finally end 60 years of dictatorship. That is why the people 
of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> pay them their respects today." 
</P>
<P>
Then with a salute, the Germans were gone, their steps rustling through the 
ground cover of dead leaves, and in the coming darkness the wreath and the 14 
headstones were hardly visible at all.

<TEXT>
   A World War II historian says the <ORGANIZATION>Marine
Corps</ORGANIZATION> treated a veteran's family unfairly when it decided the
former <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> wasn't in a famous World War II photograph of Marines
raising the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag on Iwo Jima.
   The Marines initially identified Sgt. <PERSON>Henry Hansen</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Somerville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION>, as one of six men in the Pulitzer Prize-winning
photograph. But the corps changed its position two years later
after another soldier's family complained. Both of the soldiers had
died in the war.
   Professor <PERSON>Parker B. Albee</PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of
Southern Maine</ORGANIZATION>, says his two years of independent research
indicates the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>' investigation was not thorough enough.
   ``I think (the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>) should pursue the investigation and
reopen the case,'' <PERSON>Albee</PERSON> said. ``It's been gnawing at the family
for three generations.''
   But the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Friday</DATE> that it doesn't see a need for
another investigation.
   The photograph was taken by <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON>Joe
Rosenthal</PERSON> on <DATE>Feb. 23, 1945</DATE>, as the Marines raised the flag atop
<LOCATION>Mount Suribachi</LOCATION> during one of the bloodiest battles in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> was initially identified by one of the pictured survivors
as the man standing at the far right in the photo.
   Three of the six <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>, were later killed in
combat as Japanese troops fought to maintain a hold on the
strategic island.
   <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Madeline Evelley</PERSON>, joined the three survivors
later that year at a War Bond rally, where she was honored and
given a copy of the photo.
   Two years later, the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> said the man first thought to
be <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> was actually Cpl. <PERSON>Harlon H. Block</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Weslaco</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, a
<ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> also killed in action.
   Stunned by the change, <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>'s mother wrote to the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>
commandant and to members of the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> congressional
delegation, seeking an explanation.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corp</ORGANIZATION> told her it had conducted a throrough
investigation, but it never presented any evidence to back up its
finding, <PERSON>Albee</PERSON> said.
   Evelley died convinced that her son was among the six in the
picture. Her four surviving children also thought the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>'
investigation was unfair and passed their doubts to a third
generation.
   Evelley's granddaughter, <PERSON>Judy Galgay</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, asked the
professor to investigate.
   ``This was always told to us as children growing up that the man
at the base of the flag was our Uncle Henry,'' she said <DATE>Friday</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Albee</PERSON> said he combed through papers of the <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> and Evelley
families and other manuscripts and concluded the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>
investigation was neither fair nor thorough.
   One survivor, <PERSON>Rene Gagnon</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.H.</LOCATION>, identified the
other five Marines in the picture when he was ordered back to the
<LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1945</DATE>. He said <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> was among the five.
   But a year later, Block's parents wrote to another survivor, <PERSON>Ira
Hayes</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sacaton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION>, saying they had heard the <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION>
identified as <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> was actually their son.
   Hayes agreed, triggering a second examination of the photograph.
   After reading an affidavit from <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gagnon</PERSON> and the third
survivor - <PERSON>John Bradley</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Antigo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION> - changed their stories and
told a three-member board of officers that the man may have been
Block.
   <PERSON>Albee</PERSON> says <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gagnon</PERSON> may have been pressured into
agreeing with <PERSON>Hayes</PERSON>. Gagnon has since died and <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> doesn't talk
to reporters.
   <PERSON>Rosenthal</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>, said the Marines who
raised the flag dispersed after he shot the picture and he was not
able to get their names.
   <PERSON>Albee</PERSON> said he is not sure whether the man whose identity is in
dispute was <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON>, Block or someone else.
   ``It could be one of them or it could be neither of them,''
<PERSON>Albee</PERSON> said.
   He suggested that the matter be reopened and that investigators
study other photographs taken about the same time by two still
photographers and one with a movie camera.
   ``The one way to resolve it at this point in time is through a
careful study of the pictures, which I am surprised they didn't do
at the time,'' he said.
   <PERSON>Robert Aquilina</PERSON>, assistant head of the reference section at the
<ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps Historical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, said the
<ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION> made a mistake when it first said <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> was in the
photograph.
   ``I think they made a quick judgment that it was <PERSON>Hansen</PERSON> who was
in the photo. Then, they found out later that it was Block. My
understanding is that Block was identified by the survivors,''
<PERSON>Aquilina</PERSON> said.
   But <PERSON>Albee</PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION>' evidence wasn't convincing.
   ``I have a feeling that they wanted a conclusion and felt under
pressure to know who it was,'' he said. ``I wish they said it was
unknown, or had conducted the investigation thoroughly and fairly
to a logical end.''

<TEXT>
   The question of whether Brig. Gen. <PERSON>S.L.A. Marshall</PERSON>
fabricated data in his book about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers under fire is
central to a debate raging between his critics and his grandson.
   In the renowned historian's <DATE>1947</DATE> ``Men Against Fire,'' <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>
stated that as few as <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of American infantry soldiers in
World War II fired their weapons, for a variety of factors including
paralyzing fear.
   The ``firing ratio'' finding led historians to change their
emphasis in studying combat from the perspective of the commander to
that of the common soldier, and helped prompt the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military to
modify infantry training for the Korean and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> wars.
   ``We think in a new way about combat because of <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>,'' said
<PERSON>Fredric Smoler</PERSON>, a historian at <ORGANIZATION>Sarah Lawrence College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bronxville</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION>
   But <PERSON>Smoler</PERSON> wrote in the <DATE>March</DATE> issue of American Heritage magazine
that <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>'s findings were merely a theory he had derived from
anecdotal evidence, and not based on the authoritative study that
<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> claimed.
   Marshall's thesis may have been based on evidence he ``made up,''
<PERSON>Smoler</PERSON> wrote.
   Marshall's grandson, <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON>, entered the fray late in <DATE>May</DATE>
with a three-part series in the <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> Post-Intelligencer that
defended his ancestor's thesis and questioned the research of his
detractors.
   <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>, a reporter for the newspaper, spent four weeks
interviewing his grandfather's colleagues and searching archives.
   The younger <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> fell out with his grandfather during the
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War when he was given an honorable discharge from the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>
as a conscientious objector. In an interview last week, he said he
conducted the investigation of his grandfather's work ``as a
reporter, not a defender.''
   ``American Heritage raised questions of methodology but they
haven't refuted his basic thesis. The bigger issue is, was he right
or was he wrong?'' <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON> said.
   <PERSON>S.L.A. Marshall</PERSON>, who died in <DATE>1977</DATE>, wrote 30 books over his career
as a reporter for <ORGANIZATION>The Detroit News</ORGANIZATION> and as military historian. Among
his works are ``Pork Chop Hill,'' about the Korean war battle, and
the <ORGANIZATION>American Heritage</ORGANIZATION> history of World War I.
   But his most important contribution was the ``firing ratio,''
which he said was based on 400 to 600 post-battle interviews with
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in World War II.
   <PERSON>Harold B. Leinbaugh</PERSON>, a World War II infantry company commander
and author, felt <PERSON>S.L.A. Marshall</PERSON>'s work maligned American soldiers
and conducted the research that initially questioned the basis of
<ORGANIZATION>Marshall</ORGANIZATION>'s hypothesis.
   The research by <PERSON>Leinbaugh</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Spiller</PERSON>, a historian at the
<ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>'s Command and <ORGANIZATION>General Staff College</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fort Leavenworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kan.</LOCATION>,
showed no statistical evidence existed to back up <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>'s claim
that most soldiers didn't fire in battle, <PERSON>Smoler</PERSON> wrote.
   ``It all pivoted on the fact that (<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>) said he had the
statistical evidence to back it up. ... We're saying he didn't have
the numbers to back himself up,'' said <PERSON>Richard Snow</PERSON>, managing editor
of <ORGANIZATION>American Heritage</ORGANIZATION>.
   <PERSON>Spiller</PERSON> said he was doing research at the <ORGANIZATION>S.L.A. Marshall
Military History Collection</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>El Paso</LOCATION>
for a possible biography of <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> and found no evidence of the
studies <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> said he conducted.
   ``I would have been satisfied with tickmarks on a page of rough
notes ... but I did not find some indication that he had done what
he said he had done,'' <PERSON>Spiller</PERSON> said in a telephone interview.
   Spiller also interviewed <PERSON>John G. Westover</PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION>Western
Illinois University</ORGANIZATION> professor of history and <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON>'s assistant
during his World War II research, who said he didn't recall
conversations with <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> on the subject.
   <PERSON>Westover</PERSON> said <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> ``did not have the statistical evidence''
a social scientist would require to back the thesis.
   ``The statistics are made up out of the whole cloth, but the
truth is there,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   <PERSON>Spiller</PERSON> said he disagreed with <PERSON>John Marshall</PERSON> and <PERSON>Westover</PERSON> in
accepting ``impressionistic evidence'' as the basis for the theory.
   ``That's like saying it may not be the truth but it ought to
be,'' he said, adding, ``I use his books in class and will continue
to do so, but in a different way.''

   <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and German soldiers reunited in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, flags adorned a
highway in rural <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and a memorial to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans was
dedicated in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> as the nation paused to honor its war dead
on the <DATE>Memorial Day weekend</DATE>.
   Massachusetts Gov. <PERSON>Michael S. Dukakis</PERSON> attended a ceremony today
in <LOCATION>Beaufort</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION>, to bury the remains of 19 black Union soldiers
missing in action since <DATE>1863</DATE>. The remains are believed to be those
of members of the 54th <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Regiment _ the first black
regiment in the nation's history.
   ``This is a very, very interesting chapter of American history,
not one most are familiar with,'' <PERSON>Dukakis</PERSON> said after he arrived for
the ceremony. ``This issue of black men fighting for the <ORGANIZATION>Union Army</ORGANIZATION>
was highly controversial at the time. I'm proud to say they were
supported by the people of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>.''
   Revelers enjoying the start of the <DATE>summer</DATE> vacation season
flocked to the nation's parks and beaches <DATE>Sunday</DATE>. Thousands
attended the Jambalaya Jam festival in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, while hundreds
lined a beach in <LOCATION>Wildwood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION>, to watch the <ORGANIZATION>East Coast Stunt Kite
Festival</ORGANIZATION>.
   In many places, however, traditional observances were altered to
provide moments of solemn reflection on the sacrifices made by
Americans who lost their lives in wartime.
   In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, several thousand people stood quietly as a
fireworks display ended with a lone bugle playing ``Taps'' as a
barge off of the <LOCATION>South Street Seaport</LOCATION> was enveloped in red smoke
and fire.
   ``This isn't to make the drunk guys with hot dogs cheer. Anyone
can do that,'' said <PERSON>Bruce Bassman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Garden State Fireworks</ORGANIZATION> of
<LOCATION>Millington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> ``But to get them to cry, to bring them to some
kind of feeling.''
   And there were no parades, bands or speeches at a ceremony at
the <ORGANIZATION>Tidewater Veterans Memorial</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Virginia Beach</LOCATION>, where
participants received flags bearing the name of a serviceman who
died in combat.
   ``Last year we had speeches and bands,'' said <PERSON>Harold Heischober</PERSON>
of the Disabled American Veterans. ``This is a little different.
This is the people's day. The people are the ceremony.''
   In western <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, travelers passing the <ORGANIZATION>Paxton Cemetery</ORGANIZATION> along
Interstate 80 could view 109 flags representing veterans who had a
connection to the rural community. Many of the flags had draped a
veteran's casket.
   In <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, about 150 <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Navy</ORGANIZATION> veterans joined with their
former adversaries to commemorate the only capture of a German
submarine during World War II.
   ``Many of the men in this engagement, both American and German,

during the capture, told the crowd, which included three of the
German sailors who were on the U-505 submarine captured <DATE>June 4,
1944</DATE> off the coast of west <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.
   About 3,500 people attended the dedication of a monument to
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veterans at a memorial service in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>. Family members

<TEXT>
   President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clinton H. Jay</PERSON> were
comrades at arms once, half a globe apart at a time when the world
was at war.
   In the <DATE>spring of 1944</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was not quite 20, a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> officer and
an aviator in the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION>. Jay was 31, an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> private from
<LOCATION>Youngstown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and an infantryman in the <ORGANIZATION>3rd Division</ORGANIZATION>'s bloody
drive on <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>.
   On <DATE>Sunday</DATE>, <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military cemetery at
<LOCATION>Nettuno</LOCATION>, row after row of white marble headstones set in gentle
arcs on a manicured lawn. Jay is one of 7,862 soldiers buried
there, near the spot where he fell on <DATE>May 28, 1944</DATE>.
   ``They represent about <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> of those killed in <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> and
the advance on <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON>Joseph Bevilacqua</PERSON>, a retired soldier
and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran who became the cemetery's superintendent two
months ago.
   The bodies ofmost of those killed in the invasion at <LOCATION>Anzio</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Nettuno</LOCATION> were returned to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> at the request of next
of kin. The names of 3,094 others still missing or buried at sea
are carved in the white <PERSON>Carrara</PERSON> marble walls of a memorial at the
end of a long grassy mall.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will lay a wreath, but officials say his brief Memorial Day
weekend remarks will focus on <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>, not the war.
   Still, <PERSON>Bevilacqua</PERSON> says the visit is an honor, a way to
acknowledge so many like <PERSON>Jay</PERSON> whose sacrifice is remembered usually
only by friends or family.
   Some families paid a higher price. There are 21 pairs of
brothers buried at <LOCATION>Nettuno</LOCATION>, most of them side by side. Two, Cpl.
<PERSON>Preston Kaspervick</PERSON> and 2nd Lt. <PERSON>William Kaspervick</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Quincy</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ill.</LOCATION>,
died 10 days apart in <DATE>January 1944</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is coming to <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> on his way to the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> summit in
<LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION>, which marks the alliance's 40th anniversary. During his
European swing, he also will meet with Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> and
political leaders in <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.
   His most public appearance in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> will be the stop at the
77-acre military cemetery near where Allied troops waded ashore at
<TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Jan. 22, 1944</DATE>.
   Allied commanders hoped the bold stroke would relieve the fierce
stalemate at Cassino to the south and hasten the fall of <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>, 45
miles to the north.
   The battle-hardened British 1st and American 3rd, the first
divisions ashore, expected heavy resistance but were almost
unopposed. The astonished Allies had caught the Germans by surprise.
   ``It was so easy ... American troops are standing with their
mouths open and shaking their heads in utter amazement,''
Associated Press correspondent <PERSON>Don Whitehead</PERSON> wrote at the time.
   But while the Allies secured the beachhead, crack German
divisions fortified the heights beyond the shore. The bold stroke
was lost in a nightmare of rain, wind, mud, blood and high
explosive. There were 3,000 American casualties in <DATE>January</DATE>.
   A German counterattack pushed the Allies toward the sea. Then it
became a static war, three months of withering artillery barrages.
In the soldier's black humor it was simply called the ``Sitzkrieg.''
   The breakout finally came in <DATE>May</DATE>. On <DATE>June 4</DATE>, after 123 days of
fighting, the Allies entered <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>.
   The cemetery lies along the <ORGANIZATION>3rd Division</ORGANIZATION>'s path up from the
beach. <PERSON>Bevilacqua</PERSON> said it opened as a temporary cemetery two days
after the landings.
   ``There were Germans and Britons as well as Americans buried
here at first,'' he said. ``It was in the middle of the fighting.''
   Today the only reminder of the fighting is rows of Latin crosses
and <ORGANIZATION>Stars of David</ORGANIZATION>. Pink, long-stem chrysantemums lie near some
headstones.
   ``They are left by Italians,'' said <PERSON>Bevilacqua</PERSON>. ``Sometimes they
just like the name or maybe remember a name. Many of them were
befriended by Americans who landed here.''
   Many buried in <LOCATION>Nettuno</LOCATION> died heroically. Two men _ Sgt. <PERSON>Sylvester
Antolak</PERSON> of <LOCATION>St. Clairsville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>, and 1st Lt. <PERSON>Robert T. Waugh</PERSON> of
<LOCATION>Ashton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>R.I.</LOCATION> _ received the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Medal of Honor</ORGANIZATION>, the
nation's highest award for gallantry.
   Others died anonymously. There are 490 unknowns buried in 488
graves scattered throughout the cemetery. One is next to <PERSON>Jay</PERSON>.

<HEAD>Neo-Gaullists Honor de Gaulle 50 Years After Resistance Call</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT QUIRICONI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   COLOMBEY-LES-DEUX-EGLISES, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> (AP) _ Thousands of people
converged at the memorial to <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to honor
his historic appeal 50 years ago for armed resistance against Nazi
tyranny.
   Former Premier <PERSON>Jacques Chirac</PERSON>, leader of the neo-Gaullist
conservatives, was at the head of the 2{-mile march to the 150-foot
cross of <LOCATION>Lorraine</LOCATION> on a hillside of this town, where de Gaulle lived
and was buried.
   The march was among numerous ceremonies planned to honor the
<DATE>50th anniversary of</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>de Gaulle</ORGANIZATION>'s <DATE>June 18</DATE> appeal.
   ``The day is approaching, my general, when there will no longer
be any of your old companions among those who march toward your
tomb,'' said <PERSON>Maurice Schumann</PERSON>, former spokesman for the Free <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>
resistance movement de Gaulle headed during World War II.
   ``But that is of no importance. If your old guard has done its
time, your time has barely begun,'' he said at the red granite
memorial.
   On <DATE>June 18, 1940</DATE>, de Gaulle made a four-minute radio broadcast
from his <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> headquarters, appealing to French soldiers and
civilians to resist <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Nazi occupiers.
   ``Must we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final?'' asked the
general, who would later become president. ``No. ... The flame of
French resistance must not and shall not die.''
   On <DATE>Monday</DATE>, a Mass is to be celebrated in <LOCATION>de Gaulle</LOCATION>'s honor at
<ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>. President <PERSON>Francois Mitterrand</PERSON> is to
lay a bronze plaque inscribed with the <DATE>June 18</DATE> ``appel'' at the
<ORGANIZATION>Arch of Triumph</ORGANIZATION>, where the tomb of the unknown soldier lies.
   Tens of thousands of people are expected at a sound-and-light
show <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> on the <LOCATION>Seine River</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> that will highlight
the great moments of World War II and the Liberation.
   Chirac's Rally for the Republic party, which considers itself
the direct political descendant of de Gaulle's movement, organized
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>'s event, bringing in five trains and 500 busloads of
Gaullists.
   Batteries of loudspeakers played back other now-historic words
of de Gaulle, at the liberation of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> or in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s far-flung
colonies. All the colonies were ultimately ceded to independence
under the presidency of de Gaulle, who died in <DATE>1970</DATE>.
   ``The Gaullist language, a half-century after making history,
addresses itself now to those who practice it,'' said <PERSON>Schumann</PERSON>, the
only speaker. ``Submit? Never. Dream? Always.''

<TEXT>
   Polish President <PERSON>Wojciech Jaruzelski</PERSON> went to the
<LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> Forest on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and paid tribute to the thousands of
Polish army officers killed and buried there by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s
secret police during World War II.
   His visit came one day after the Soviet government reversed
nearly 50 years of official denial and admitted committing the
massacre. The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> had long blamed <LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>.
   ``The truth was said about <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>, and the truth is healing the
wounds,'' <PERSON>Jaruzelski</PERSON> said in Russian, his voice soft and wavering
with emotion.
   ``Now it will be easier for us to understand each other,'' he
told Soviet reporters. The <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> massacre has long been a strain on
relations between the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>.
   Jaruzelski was accompanied by an honor guard of the Polish army
at the memorial site in the forest near the western town of
<LOCATION>Smolensk</LOCATION> as he honored the more than 4,000 officers killed in <DATE>1940</DATE>
by <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s secret police, the Polish <ORGANIZATION>PAP</ORGANIZATION> news agency reported.
   A ``roll call of the dead'' was intoned _ a ceremony in which
the names of victims are read, <ORGANIZATION>PAP</ORGANIZATION> said.
   In footage broadcast on Soviet TV's evening newscast ``Vremya,''
<PERSON>Jaruzelski</PERSON>, wearing a green army overcoat, green scarf and military
cap, stood ramrod straight as two soldiers carried a large wreath
of red and white carnations and laid it in front of a memorial to
the dead.
   The monument reads in Russian: ``To the Polish officers fallen
in <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION>.''
   Polish radio reported <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> that the wording on the
monument was changed three days ago, removing the words that blamed
<LOCATION>Nazi Germany</LOCATION>. The Soviets had long said the <LOCATION>Nazis</LOCATION> were responsible
for the massacre, in which the Polish officers were shot in the
back of the head and stacked on top of each other in mass graves.
   The honor guard fired a rifle salute, Polish radio said.
   <ORGANIZATION>PAP</ORGANIZATION> added that <PERSON>Jaruzelski</PERSON> wrote in the visitor's book:
   ``They fought for an independent <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>. They died innocently,
far-removed from their families and homeland. They were faithful to
<LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and to military honor until they breathed their last. In
tribute and in lasting memory to Polish officers, victims of the
cruel Stalinist crime.''
   Jaruzelski also went to the town of Lenino in the nearby
republic of <LOCATION>Byelorussia</LOCATION> and laid wreaths on the graves of Soviet
and Polish soldiers at a memorial there, the Soviet news agency
<ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> reported.
   The <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> admitted that the <ORGANIZATION>NKVD</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s
feared secret police, was responsible for the murders 49 years ago
of the Polish officers who had been captured at the start of World
War II.
   The Soviet statement <DATE>Friday</DATE> said archive material discovered
recently showed that the murders were the work of <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>'s secret
police chief <PERSON>Lavrenti Beria</PERSON>, his protege <ORGANIZATION>V.N. Merkulov</ORGANIZATION> and others.
   ``The Soviet side, expressing its deep regret in connection with
the <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> tragedy, states that it is one of the most horrifying
Stalinist crimes,'' said the statement, carried by <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION>.
   More than 10,000 other Polish officers were killed in camps
elsewhere. Their bodies never have been found, but in its
statement, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> clearly tied together the fates of all
15,000 officers.
   Jaruzelski's trip to <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> capped an official visit to the
<LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. He returned to <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> later <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.
   At a dinner <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON>
called the <LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> tragedy one of the historical ``knots'' that cast
a shadow on Polish-Soviet relations, but he added that ``many of
them have already been undone.''
   In remarks carried by <ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> said ``genuine renewal and
genuine mutual understanding lies only through telling the truth.''
   Jaruzelski told the Soviet leader that the Soviet admission on
<LOCATION>Katyn</LOCATION> was ``particularly important and valuable to the Polish
people from the moral point of view,'' and he said Poles would not
blame the massacre on the Soviet people who themselves suffered
under <ORGANIZATION>Stalin</ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
   The remains of a soldier believed to be
an American missing since World War II have been discovered on a
remote <LOCATION>Aleutian Island</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service</ORGANIZATION> says.
   ``Our records show that 12 American soldiers were stationed
there during World War II, and only 11 came home,'' <PERSON>Walt Steiglitz</PERSON>,
the service's regional director, said <DATE>Monday</DATE>. ``After 45 years of
missing in action, the 12th soldier is finally coming home too.''
   Fish &amp; Wildlife biologists on <LOCATION>Buldir Island</LOCATION> found a skull, leg,
arm and pelvic bones a few yards from their camp earlier this
month. The biologists are studying seabirds on the tiny, rocky
island about 1550 miles southwest of <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>.
   <PERSON>Chuck Diters</PERSON>, an archaeologist at the agency's <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION>
headquarters, said American military boots, an M-1 rifle with
bayonet, an American coin and a pocketwatch inscribed with ``<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>''
were found with the bones.
   A wallet also was recovered, but <PERSON>Diters</PERSON> said its contents were
deteriorated too much to make an immediate identification of the
owner.
   ``The body was wedged into some large boulders, as if the
soldier may have been trying to escape from the weather,'' said
biologist <PERSON>Mike Boylan</PERSON>. ``The terrain is very rough and disorienting
there. He probably got lost and died of exposure.''
   The remains were found about four miles from what is left of a
military camp on the northwest corner of the island. The remains
and personal effects were being taken by boat to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Naval
Base</ORGANIZATION> at Adak.
   Military spokesmen in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> they did not know
the name of the missing soldier or what would be the next step in
identifying the remains.
   A <ORGANIZATION>Fish &amp; Wildlife</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the remains were found <DATE>July 12</DATE>
or 13, but radio communications with <PERSON>Buldir</PERSON> are difficult and he
was not sure of the date.
   The 5,000-acre island is halfway between <LOCATION>Attu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kiska</LOCATION>, two
islands occupied by the Japanese from <DATE>1942</DATE> to <DATE>1943</DATE>. An American
invasion drove the Japanese from <LOCATION>Attu</LOCATION>, and they abandoned <LOCATION>Kiska</LOCATION> a
short time later.
   No battles were fought on Buldir, which became the site of a
12-man <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military weather station.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal <PERSON>Jozef Glemp</PERSON> told several thousand
mourners at a funeral service for a priest found in his rectory <DATE>last
weekend</DATE> that the clergyman had apparently been murdered.
   The body of Rev. <PERSON>Stefan Niedzielak</PERSON>, provost of the Powazki
cemetery, was found <DATE>Saturday</DATE>. He was buried at the cemetery
<DATE>Thursday</DATE>. Officials say he died of a broken neck, but have yet to
determine the circumstances of his death.
   ``He died a violent death,'' <PERSON>Glemp</PERSON> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in brief remarks
to the crowd in front of the <PERSON>Charles Borromeo Roman Catholic</PERSON> church
in northwestern <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION>.
   Poles have been particularly sensitive to the safety of clergymen
since the <DATE>1984</DATE> murder of the Rev. <PERSON>Jerzy Popieluszko</PERSON>, a supporter of
the Solidarity trade union movement who was killed by security
police.
   Niedzielak, 74, maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the <LOCATION>Soviet
Union</LOCATION> and speakers at the service said he served as a chaplain to
soldiers in the underground Home <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> during the World War II.
   Many elderly Poles attended the funeral. Some of the men wore
red-and-white armbands lettered with the initials of the underground
<ORGANIZATION>Home Army</ORGANIZATION>, which fought against the Germans during the war.
   One woman held up a banner decorated with red-and-white
carnations saying, ``To the chaplain of Independence.''
   Police blocked the road leading to the cemetery and dozens of
passengers in buses patiently waited for the two-hour service to
conclude.
   The Rev. <PERSON>Zdiszlaw Krol</PERSON>, chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION>Warsaw Curia</ORGANIZATION>, called
Niedzielak a ``great patriot.''
   Other speakers praised <ORGANIZATION>Niedzielak</ORGANIZATION>'s role in preserving the memory
of those Poles who died at the hands of the Russians during World
War II.
   Several speakers referred to the circumstances surrounding the
priest's death.
   <PERSON>Wojciech Ziembinski</PERSON>, a friend of the dead priest, said: ``And
you, Father <PERSON>Stefan</PERSON>, did not fall off any chair.'' Some had suggested
he died in a fall from a chair.
   <PERSON>Krol</PERSON> dismissed robbery as a motive, saying Niedzielak kept no
valuables in his apartment, which was across from the church.
   The government said an investigation is continuing.

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regardless of which war it was or how many years
have passed, the grunts _ the infantrymen who've fought in a war _
don't readily talk about it with those who've never been in one.
   A common reason: only other grunts can possibly understand what
combat is like. It takes an uncommon interviewer to draw these men
out, yet avoid a succession of war stories that become routine
through repetition.
   But <PERSON>Bill Moyers</PERSON> somewhow accomplishes the former while largely
avoiding the latter in his ``From D-Day to the Rhine,'' an
old-soldier special, which the <ORGANIZATION>Public Broadcast Service</ORGANIZATION> is showing
<DATE>Sunday</DATE>.
   In it, <PERSON>Moyers</PERSON>, just a boy when World War II ended, takes a
memory-lane visit to the battlefields of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> and
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> with a group of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> veterans who fought there in the
<DATE>last two years</DATE> of the war.
   Now gray-haired and in their 60s and 70s, most move slowly and
talk quietly, occasionally chuckling or grinning about the odd,
sometimes funny, little memories that any war produces.
   They recall the guy who spent a half-hour each day trimming his
mustache, the sound of gears cranking as a German tank's turret
turned to fire, and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> pilot who showed up at the <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>
beachhead not long after D-Day in <DATE>June 1944</DATE>. He stood out. He was
all dressed up, in his class-A uniform.
   It's a thoughtful, impressionistic show in which recollections
of war are illustrated with old newsreels of combat, or contrasted
with scenes of today, like French kids clambering over a Sherman
tank, now a museum piece.
   A rolling tour of the bloody past, the program always is headed
toward the <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION>, with occasional pauses for interviews in little
towns or gently rolling fields where men once killed each other and
where cows now peacefully graze.
   The veterans include a Medal of Honor winner from <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Jose Lopez</PERSON>. Now 79, he won the nation's highest military
award when he was over 30, which is ancient for a combat
infantryman.
   But he'd lied back then and said he was two years younger. Why?
He wanted to be a paratrooper. Why? He shrugs. ``So we could meet
the enemy as soon as possible and get the thing over.''
   The vets inspect a museum and a graphic tapestry of a much
earlier war, the bloody battle of <DATE>1066</DATE> in which <PERSON>William</PERSON> the
Conquerer's troops went to war in <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>.
   Moyers later asks one of the soldiers of World War II, a
battalion surgeon then, how the tapestry strikes him. The doctor
gently smiles.
   It makes him think, he says, about how endless war is, ``how
it's a part of everbody's life, war and death and men fighting
men.''
   There are the expected visits to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military cemetaries _ but
also a stop at a neatly trimmed German military cemetery in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>,
where the grave of one soldier who fought for Hitler is simply
marked ``Ein Deutscher Soldat.''
   At times, this 90-minute documentary, filmed and produced by
<PERSON>David Grubin</PERSON>, drags a bit. Several stories go on too long; they
could have been edited more tightly.
   It might have made a better show had Moyers brought in a few
German ex-grunts, heard their stories, gotten their perspective.
They visit the old battlefields, too.
   But ``From D-Day to the Rhine'' is a good effort, flaws and all.
And what strikes you most about it is how quietly humble and
plain-spoken most of its old soldiers are.
   Their manner, their lack of I-was-there bombast, may make a few
old-timers think of <PERSON>Ernie Pyle</PERSON>'s musings on life after the war,
thoughts that the famed war correspondent wrote in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in <DATE>August
1944</DATE>.
   ``Submersion in war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the
master of the peace,'' he wrote. ``All we can do is fumble and try
once more _ try out of the memory of our anguish _ and be as
tolerant with each other as we can.''

   Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hans-Dietrich Genscher</PERSON> said
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the latest round of talks has left him confident about
solving the major stumbling block to German unification.
   The West German official, as part of the consultations aimed at
establishing the military stance of a united <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, will meet with
Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON>Eduard Shevardnadze</PERSON> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the Soviet
town of <LOCATION>Brest</LOCATION> near the Polish border.
   The <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> said the two men will visit the
grave of <ORGANIZATION>Shevardnadze</ORGANIZATION>'s brother, a Soviet soldier who died there
during World War II, as a sign of reconciliation.
   As Soviet President <PERSON>Mikhail S. Gorbachev</PERSON> explains his nation's
wariness about a militarily powerful <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, he has been reminding
Western countries of his 20 million compatriots killed during World
War II.
   East <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON>Lothar de Maiziere</PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>
on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to take part in a <LOCATION>Warsaw</LOCATION> Pact leaders' conference, the
government in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION> said.
   De Maiziere will fly to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <DATE>this weekend</DATE> for four
days of talks that will include a meeting with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>.
   On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, Secretary of State <PERSON>James A. Baker III</PERSON> discussed with
Shevardnadze a package of Western concessions to try to win <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s
approval of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> membership for the powerful new German state.
   Asked if they had made progress, <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said: ``I think we did.''
   ``The area of mutual understanding on the complex issues seems to
be broadening,'' <PERSON>Shevardnadze</PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Embassy</ORGANIZATION>.
   In an interview <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, <PERSON>Genscher</PERSON> said he shared the
superpowers' confidence.
   ``I have a positive assessment of my talks with the American
secretary of state and the Soviet foreign minister, which went late
into the evening,'' <PERSON>Genscher</PERSON> added.
   <PERSON>Genscher</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Norddeutsche Rundfunk</ORGANIZATION> radio network he is still
hoping to present a German unification plan to a European summit
this year, saying he hopes the meeting can take place before
<DATE>December</DATE>.
   <PERSON>Genscher</PERSON> will fly to the Soviet town of <LOCATION>Brest</LOCATION> for the
Shevardnadze meeting <DATE>Monday</DATE>, the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> said.
   ``It was an invitation from <PERSON>Shevardnadze</PERSON>,'' said a ministry
spokesman. ``Shevarnadze's brother died there during the fighting.
Shevardnadze invited him to visit the brother's grave, which in
light of the past, is certainly not an unmeaningful gesture from the
Soviet side.''
   Asked whether the visit was meant as a sign of
``reconciliation,'' the spokesman replied ``yes, certainly.'' The
spokesman, asking not to be identified by name, said <PERSON>Shevardnadze</PERSON>'s
brother died in <DATE>June 1941</DATE> but did not know the fallen soldier's
first name.

<BYLINE>GIs, Soviet Vets Meet Again at Point Where WWII Armies United
^By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORGAU, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets and Americans met again by
the river Elbe on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, marveling at the imminent unity of
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> exactly 45 years after they helped cut it in two.
   Under gray skies and a light drizzle, about 100 World War II
veterans watched a solemn ceremony as a wreath was laid in the
grassy river delta where the armies of two invading nations came
together.
   Soviet and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> veterans wearing medals from the historic
military campaign clasped hands, embraced and traded war stories in
the first Elbe reunion held on free German soil.
   Both armies invaded <LOCATION>Torgau</LOCATION> as they drove through <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> from
opposite ends, formally linking up <DATE>April 25, 1945</DATE>.
   <PERSON>William Robertson</PERSON>, 66, was credited with leading one of two <ORGANIZATION>U.S.
Army</ORGANIZATION> scout patrols that made the first contact with the Soviet
forces.
   ``To us veterans it's a very big deal, but it probably isn't to
most Americans,'' said the retired physician from <LOCATION>Culver City</LOCATION>,
<LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION>.
   ``But the Elbe meeting touches something very deep in the hearts
of the Soviets,'' he added.
   The last such reunion was in <DATE>1985</DATE> and drew about 25,000 people.
It was orchestrated by the Soviets and the then-Communist East
German government. The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> criticized it as a propaganda
extravaganza.
   The gathering <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was more low-key and attracted a crowd
of only about 2,000 people to the river bank on the edge of this
aging town 75 miles southeast of <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>.
   Veterans marveled at the peaceful revolt that ousted <LOCATION>East
Germany</LOCATION>'s hard-line government. The popular uprising opened the way
for democratic government and eventual unification with <LOCATION>West
Germany</LOCATION>.
   The reunion <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was planned in <DATE>June 1989</DATE>, when such events
were unthinkable.
   ``It's very confusing for some of us older people. There has
been a lot going on,'' said Soviet veteran <PERSON>Nikolai Sagoruko</PERSON>, 76, a
former member of a Soviet mine-sweeping force. ``But we think good
things are happening and hope it means peace.''
   Soviets turned out in their green <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION> uniforms, their
chests packed with medals and one little <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> flag. Americans wore
baseball caps and blue-and-white jackets.
   Two small American scout troops made contact with two small
Soviet patrols along the river on that historic day in <DATE>1945</DATE>, but it
was the group <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> led that set up the meeting of commanders
from the two armies.
   ``The others were first, but we got the glory, the newspaper
clippings,'' said <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON>. ``They had communications problems and
nobody knew they made contact until the next day.''
   Retired Lt. Gen. <PERSON>Vladimir Orloe</PERSON>, leader of the Soviet veterans
contingent, said conflicting claims also existed between the two
Soviet patrols about which was the first to make contact.
   <PERSON>Ivan Krutcheno</PERSON>, 72, said he was part of the first group of
Soviet scouts.
   ``We came here and saw Americans and we thought we were in
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, we had traveled for so long,'' he said.
   The veterans gathered at a cemetery to lay a wreath at the
graves of Soviet soldiers killed in <LOCATION>Torgau</LOCATION>. They later placed a
wreath on the grave of <PERSON>Joseph Polowsky</PERSON>, an American soldier who won
unusual acclaim in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> with his efforts to arrange the
periodic <LOCATION>Torgau</LOCATION> reunions.
   Polowsky, a <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> cab driver who died in <DATE>1983</DATE>, insisted
he be buried at <LOCATION>Torgau</LOCATION>.
   ``He just thought it was so beautiful here,'' said <PERSON>Bill Beswick</PERSON>,
65, of <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION>, who was a pallbearer at <ORGANIZATION>Polowsky</ORGANIZATION>'s funeral
and one of the first soldiers to reach the Elbe.
   <PERSON>Leonard Addorisio</PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION>Hartford</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Conn.</LOCATION>, said he was amazed at
the camaraderie shown by the Soviet veterans.
   ``Everyone is so good, so friendly, you wonder why there are
wars,'' he said.
